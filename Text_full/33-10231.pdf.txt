INVESTMENT COMPANY REPORTING MODERNIZATION
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting new rules and forms as
well as amendments to its rules and forms to modernize the reporting and disclosure of
information by registered investment companies. The Commission is adopting new Form
N-PORT, which will require certain registered investment companies to report information about
their monthly portfolio holdings to the Commission in a structured data format. In addition, the
Commission is adopting amendments to Regulation S-X, which will require standardized,
enhanced disclosure about derivatives in investment company financial statements, as well as
other amendments. The Commission is adopting new Form N-CEN, which will require
registered investment companies, other than face-amount certificate companies, to annually
report certain census-type information to the Commission in a structured data format. The
Commission is adopting amendments to Forms N-1A, N-3, and N-CSR to require certain
disclosures regarding securities lending activities. Finally, the Commission is rescinding current
Forms N-Q and N-SAR and amending certain other rules and forms. Collectively, these
amendments will, among other things, improve the information that the Commission receives
from investment companies and assist the Commission, in its role as primary regulator of
investment companies, to better fulfill its mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair,
orderly and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation. Investors and other potential

users can also utilize this information to help investors make more informed investment
decisions.

BACKGROUND
A.

Changes in the Industry and Technology

As the primary regulator of the asset management industry, the Commission relies on
information included in reports filed by registered investment companies (“funds”)1 and
investment advisers for a number of purposes, including monitoring industry trends, informing
policy and rulemaking, identifying risks, and assisting Commission staff in examination and
enforcement efforts. Over the years, however, as assets under management and complexity in
the industry have grown, so too has the volume and complexity of information that the
Commission must analyze to carry out its regulatory duties.
Commission staff estimates that there were approximately 17,052 funds registered with
the Commission, as of December 2015.2 Commission staff further estimates that there were
nearly 12,000 investment advisers registered with the Commission, along with another 3,138
advisers that file reports with the Commission as exempt reporting advisers, as of January 2016.3

1

For purposes of the preamble of this release, we use “funds” to mean registered investment
companies other than face-amount certificate companies and any separate series thereof—i.e.,
management companies and unit investment trusts. In addition, we use the term “management
companies” or “management investment companies” to refer to registered management investment
companies and any separate series thereof. We note that “fund” may be separately and differently
defined in each of the new or amended forms or rules.

2

Based on data obtained from the Investment Company Institute (“ICI”) and reports filed by
registrants on Form N-SAR. The 17,052 funds include mutual funds (including funds of funds and
money market funds), closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), and unit investment trusts
(“UITs”). See ICI, 2016 I NVESTMENT C OMPANY F ACT B OOK (56th ed., 2016) (“2016 ICI Fact
Book”) at 22, available at https://www.ici.org/pdf/2016_factbook.pdf; see also infra footnote 1259
and accompanying and following text.

Based on Investment Adviser Registration Depository (“IARD”) system data. In 2010 Congress
charged the Commission with implementing new reporting and registration requirements for certain
investment advisers to private funds (known as “exempt reporting advisers”). See Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1570–80 (2010).
Form ADV is used by registered investment advisers to register with the Commission and with the
states and by exempt reporting advisers to report information to the Commission. Information on
Form ADV is available to the public through the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure System,

8

At year-end 2015, assets of registered investment companies exceeded $18 trillion, having grown
from about $5.8 trillion at the end of 1998.4 At the same time, the industry has developed new
product structures, such as ETFs5, new fund types, such as target date funds with asset allocation
strategies,6 and increased its use of derivatives and other alternative strategies.7 These products
and strategies can offer greater opportunities for investors to achieve their investment goals, but
they can also add complexity to funds’ investment strategies, amplify investment risk, or have
other risks, such as counterparty credit risk.
While these changes have been taking place in the fund industry, there have also been
significant advances in the technology that can be used to report and analyze information. We
have started to use structured data formats to collect, aggregate, and analyze data reported by

which allows the public to access the most recent Form ADV filing made by an investment adviser
and is available at http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. The Commission recently adopted
amendments to Form ADV. See Form ADV and Investment Adviser Act Rules, Investment Advisers
Act Release No. 4509 (August 25, 2016) [81 FR 60417 (September 1, 2016)] (“Form ADV Release”).

registrants and other filers.8 These data formats for information collection have enabled us and
other data users, including investors and other industry participants, to better collect and analyze
reported information and have improved our ability to carry out our regulatory functions.
As we noted in the Proposing Release, we have historically acted to modernize our forms
and the manner in which information is filed with the Commission and disclosed to the public in
order to keep up with changes in the industry and technology.9 In May 2015, we again acted to
modernize our forms and the manner in which information is filed and disclosed by proposing a
number of reforms for investment company reporting.10 Our proposal included four sets of
reforms: (1) the creation of a new portfolio holdings reporting form, Form N-PORT, and the
rescission of Form N-Q; (2) the creation of a new census reporting form, Form N-CEN, and the
rescission of Form N-SAR; (3) amendments to Regulation S-X, largely designed to improve

the use of Extensible Markup Language (“XML”) with Forms N-MFP, PF and 13F, as well as in
other contexts).

footnote 7 (proposing, among other things, reporting requirements in Forms N-PORT and N-CEN

Company Swing Pricing; Investment Company Release No. [x] (October 13, 2016) (“Swing Pricing
Adopting Release”).
We also note that in December 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) issued a
notice requesting comment on aspects of the asset management industry, including on additional data
or information that would be helpful to regulators and market participants. See FSOC, Notice
Seeking Comment on Asset Management Products and Activities, Docket No. FSOC-2014-0001
(Dec. 24, 2014) (“FSOC Notice”), available at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/rulemaking/
Documents/Notice%20Seeking%20Comment%20on%20Asset%20Management%20Products%20and
%20Activities.pdf. Although our proposal was independent of FSOC, several commenters
responding to the notice discussed issues concerning data that were relevant to our proposal and those
comments were discussed in the Proposing Release, as relevant. See Proposing Release, supra
footnote 7, at nn. 17–18 and accompanying text.

derivatives disclosure; and (4) a proposed new rule, rule 30e-3, which would provide funds with
an optional method to satisfy shareholder report transmission requirements by posting their
reports online if they met certain conditions.
The proposed reforms were designed to help the Commission, investors, and other market
participants better assess different fund products and to assist us in carrying out our mission to
protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.
These reforms also sought to (1) increase the transparency of fund portfolios and investment
practices both to the Commission and to investors, (2) take advantage of technological advances
both in terms of the manner in which information is reported to the Commission and how it is
provided to investors and other potential users, and (3) where appropriate, reduce duplicative or
otherwise unnecessary reporting burdens on the industry.
B.

Summary of Changes to Current Reporting Regime

We received 1,003 comments11 on our proposed reforms from a variety of interested
parties, including investment companies, industry groups, investors, academics and others. As
discussed in greater detail below in the relevant sections of this release, commenters generally
supported our efforts to modernize the investment company reporting regime, but had varying
comments on a number of specific items in each of the respective sets of reforms. Commenters

11

Of these, about 574 were individualized letters, and the rest were one of a number of types of form
letters. See Comments on Investment Company Reporting Modernization, File No. S7-08-15,
available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-15/s70815.shtml. The comment period for the
proposal closed on August 11, 2015, but was re-opened until January 13, 2016 when the Commission
proposed liquidity risk management programs for open-end funds. See Open-End Fund Liquidity
Risk Management Programs; Swing Pricing; Re-Opening of Comment Period for Investment
Company Reporting Modernization Release, Investment Company Act Release No. 31835 (Sept. 22,
2015) [80 FR 62274 (Oct. 15, 2015)] (“Liquidity Proposing Release”).

11

were generally supportive of proposed new Form N-PORT;12 however, we received many
comments relating to the data to be collected by the form, the frequency of filing reports on the
form, and whether reports on the form or certain information in the reports should be made
public. Commenters were also generally supportive of proposed new Form N-CEN,13 agreeing
that Form N-CEN will provide both the Commission and the public with enhanced and updated
census-type information. Similar to Form N-PORT, however, commenters also provided many
comments on the data to be collected by the form and whether certain information in reports on
the form should be made public. In addition, commenters were largely supportive of our efforts
to improve the information that funds report to shareholders and the Commission through the
proposed amendments to Regulation S-X,14 but had specific comments on certain disclosures.
Comments on proposed rule 30e-3, which would allow funds to transmit reports to shareholders
via the internet subject to a number of conditions, were mixed, with some commenters
supporting the rule and others opposing it.15
Today, after consideration of the comments we received, we are adopting new Forms
N-PORT and N-CEN, as well as amendments to Regulation S-X. We continue to believe that
with the industry changes and technological advances that have occurred over the years, we need
to improve the type and format of the information that funds provide to us and to investors, and
the information that the Commission receives from funds in order to improve the Commission’s
monitoring of the fund industry in its role as the primary regulator of funds and investment

advisers. We are not adopting proposed rule 30e-3 at this time as we believe, in light of the
comments received, that additional consideration regarding the rule is appropriate. We are
adopting amendments to Forms N-1A, N-3, and N-CSR to require certain disclosures regarding
securities lending activities.16
1.

Form N-PORT and Amendments to Regulation S-X

We are adopting Form N-PORT, largely as proposed, with certain modifications in
response to commenters. We are also rescinding, as proposed, Form N-Q. Form N-PORT is a
new portfolio holdings reporting form that will be filed by all registered management investment
companies, other than money market funds and small business investment companies
(“SBICs”),17 and by UITs that operate as ETFs.18 Currently, management investment companies
(other than SBICs) are required to report their complete portfolio holdings to the Commission on
a quarterly basis on Forms N-Q19 and N-CSR.20
Form N-PORT requires reporting of a fund’s complete portfolio holdings. The form also
requires additional information concerning fund portfolio holdings that is not currently required
by Forms N-Q and N-CSR, and that will facilitate risk analyses and other Commission oversight.

16

If any provision of these rules, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be
invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of such provisions to other
persons or circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.

See infra footnote 49 (discussing why money market funds and SBICs will not be required to file
reports on Form N-PORT).

18

ETFs will be required to file reports on Form N-PORT, regardless of whether they are organized as
management companies or UITs. UITs are a type of investment company which (a) are organized
under a trust indenture contract of custodianship or agency or similar instrument, (b) do not have a
board of directors, and (c) issue only redeemable securities. See section 4(2) of the Investment
Company Act.

19

Rule 30b1-5 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30b1-5]. While SBICs file reports on
Form N-CSR, SBICs are not required to file reports on Form N-Q.

20

See rule 30b2-1 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30b2-1].

13

For example, Form N-PORT requires reporting of additional information relating to derivative
investments. The form also includes certain risk metric calculations that measure a fund’s
exposure and sensitivity to changing market conditions, such as changes in asset prices, interest
rates, or credit spreads. As was proposed, reports on Form N-PORT will be filed in a structured
data format with the Commission on a monthly basis, with every third month available to the
public 60 days after the end of the fund’s fiscal quarter.
We continue to believe that more timely and frequent reporting of portfolio holdings
information to the Commission, as well as the additional information Form N-PORT requires,
will enable us to further our mission to protect investors by assisting the Commission and its
staff in carrying out its regulatory responsibilities related to the asset management industry.
These responsibilities include its examination, enforcement, and monitoring of funds, its
formulation of policy, and the staff’s review of fund registration statements and disclosures.
While Form N-PORT is primarily designed to assist the Commission and its staff, we
also continue to believe that information in Form N-PORT will be beneficial to investors and
other potential users. In particular, we believe that both sophisticated institutional investors and
third-party users that provide services to investors may find the information required on Form NPORT useful. For example, Form N-PORT’s structured format will allow the Commission,
investors, and other potential users to better collect and analyze portfolio holdings information.21
While we do not anticipate that many individual investors will analyze data using Form NPORT, although some may, we believe that individual investors will benefit indirectly from the

21

As we noted in the Proposing Release, portfolio holdings information currently filed on Form N-Q is
filed in a plain text or hypertext format, which often requires labor-intensive manual reformatting by
Commission staff and other potential users in order to prepare the reported data for analysis. See
Proposing Release, supra footnote 7.

14

information collected on reports on Form N-PORT, through enhanced Commission monitoring
and oversight of the fund industry and through analyses prepared by third-party service providers
and other parties, such as industry observers and academics.
In addition, we are adopting, largely as proposed, amendments to Regulation S-X with
certain modifications in response to comments. These amendments in large part require
standardized enhanced derivatives disclosures in fund financial statements. Currently,
Regulation S-X does not prescribe specific information for most types of derivatives, including
swaps, futures, and forwards. While many fund groups provide disclosures regarding the terms
of their derivatives contracts, the lack of standard disclosure requirements has resulted in
inconsistent disclosures in fund financial statements.
We continue to believe that the amendments to Regulation S-X to enhance and
standardize derivatives disclosures in financial statements will allow comparability among funds
and help all investors better assess funds’ use of derivatives. Reports on Form N-PORT will
contain similar derivatives disclosures to facilitate analysis of derivatives investments across
funds. Because Form N-PORT is not primarily designed for individual investors, the
amendments to Regulation S-X require disclosures concerning the fund’s investments in
derivatives in the financial statements that are provided to investors. We also have endeavored
to mitigate burdens on the industry by conforming the derivatives disclosures that are required by
both Regulation S-X and Form N-PORT.
2.

Form N-CEN

We are adopting, substantially as proposed and with certain modifications in response to
comments, Form N-CEN, a new form on which funds will report census-type information to the

15

Commission. We are also rescinding, as proposed, Form N-SAR, the current form on which the
Commission collects census-type information on management investment companies and UITs.22
As we discussed in the Proposing Release, Form N-SAR was adopted in 1985 and, while
Commission staff has indicated that the census-type information reported on Form N-SAR is
useful in its support of the Commission’s regulatory functions, staff has also indicated that in the
thirty plus years since Form N-SAR’s adoption, changes in the industry have reduced the utility
of some of the currently required data elements.23 Commission staff believes that obtaining
certain additional census-type information not currently collected by Form N-SAR will improve
the staff’s ability to carry out regulatory functions, including risk monitoring and analysis of the
industry.
Form N-CEN includes many of the same data elements as Form N-SAR, but, in order to
improve the quality and utility of information reported, replaces those items that are outdated or
of limited usefulness with items that we believe to be of greater relevance today. Where
possible, we are also eliminating items that are reported on other Commission forms, or are
available elsewhere. In addition, reports on Form N-CEN will be filed in a structured XML
format, which, we believe, will reduce reporting burdens for current Form N-SAR filers and
yield data that can be used more effectively by the Commission and other potential users.24
Finally, reports on new Form N-CEN will be filed annually, rather than semi-annually as is

22

See rules 30a-1 and 30b1-1 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30a-1 and 17 CFR
270.30b1-1].

23

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7 (noting that when adopted, Form N-SAR was intended to
reduce reporting burdens and better align the information that was required to be reported with the
characteristics of the fund industry). Also as noted in the Proposing Release, the filing format that is
required for reports on Form N-SAR limits our ability to use the reported information for analysis.

required for reports on Form N-SAR by management companies, which will further reduce
current burdens on funds.
II.

DISCUSSION
A.

Form N-PORT

As discussed above, we are adopting a new monthly portfolio reporting form, Form NPORT. Form N-PORT requires registered management investment companies and ETFs
organized as UITs, other than money market funds and SBICs, to electronically file with the
Commission monthly portfolio investments information on reports in an XML format no later
than 30 days after the close of each month.25 Except as discussed below in section II.A.4, only
information reported for the third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter on Form N-PORT will be
publicly available, and that information will not be made public until 60 days after the end of the
fiscal quarter.26
As the primary regulator of the asset management industry, the Commission relies on
information that funds file with us, including their registration statements, shareholder reports,
and various reporting forms such as Form N-CSR. The Commission and its staff use this
information to understand trends in the fund industry and carry out regulatory responsibilities,
including formulating policy and guidance, reviewing fund registration statements, and assessing

25

See new rule 30b1-9.

26

As used throughout this section, the term “fund” generally refers to investment companies that will
file reports on Form N-PORT.
As discussed further in section II.A.4, the Commission does not intend to make public the
information reported on Form N-PORT for the first and second months of each fund’s fiscal quarter
that is identifiable to any particular fund or adviser or any information reported with regard to country
of risk and economic exposure, delta, or miscellaneous securities, or explanatory notes related to any
of those topics that is identifiable to any particular fund or adviser. However, the Commission may
use such information in its regulatory programs, including examinations, investigations, and
enforcement actions. See infra footnote 500; see also General Instruction F of Form N-PORT.

17

and examining a fund’s regulatory compliance with the federal securities laws and Commission
rules thereunder.
Information on fund portfolios is currently filed with the Commission quarterly with up
to a 70-day delay.27 Moreover, the reports are currently filed in a format that does not allow for
efficient searches or analyses across portfolios, and even limits the ability to search or analyze a
single portfolio. Based on staff experience with data analysis of funds, including staff
experience using Form N-MFP, we believe, and commenters generally agreed, that more
frequent and timely information concerning fund portfolios than we currently receive, will assist
the Commission in its role as the primary regulator of funds, as discussed further below.28
The information we will collect on Form N-PORT will be important to the Commission
and its staff in analyzing and understanding the various risks in a particular fund, as well as risks
across specific types of funds and the fund industry as a whole. These risks can include the
investment risk that the fund is undertaking as part of its investment strategy, such as interest rate
27

Funds currently file with the Commission portfolio schedules for the fund’s first and third fiscal
quarters on Form N-Q, and shareholder reports, including portfolio schedules for the fund’s second
and fourth fiscal quarters, on Form N-CSR. These reports are available to the public and the
Commission with either a 60- or 70-day delay. See rule 30b1-5 (requiring management companies,
other than SBICs, to file reports on Form N-Q no more than 60 days after the close of the first and
third quarters of each fiscal year); rule 30b2-1 (requiring management companies to file reports on
Form N-CSR no later than 10 days after the transmission to stockholders of any report required to be
transmitted to stockholders under rule 30e-1). See also rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 under the Investment
Company Act [17 CFR 270.30e-1 and 17 CFR 270.30e-2] (requiring management companies and
certain UITs to transmit to stockholders semi-annual reports containing, among other things, the
fund’s portfolio schedules, no more than 60 days after the close of the second and fourth quarters of
each fiscal year). These reports include portfolio holdings information as required by Regulation SX. See rule 12-12 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-12], et seq.

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Morningstar, Inc. (Aug. 21, 2015) (“Morningstar Comment Letter”)

portfolios would assist the Commission in monitoring the financial system, while also providing
suggested revisions to enhance the proposal.); Comment Letter of Vanguard (Aug. 11, 2015)

disclosures to the Commission and protecting funds and their investors from front-running, and
providing suggested modifications to the proposal).

risk, credit risk, volatility risk, other market risks, or risks associated with specific types of
investments, such as emerging market debt or commodities. Additionally, as we discuss in the
Liquidity Adopting Release that we are adopting concurrently Form N-PORT will help the
Commission better understand liquidity risks through additional Form N-PORT disclosure
requirements discussed in that release.29 The information collected on Form N-PORT will also
assist with understanding whether and to what extent a fund’s exposure to price movements is
leveraged, either through borrowings or the use of derivatives.
Many commenters generally agreed with us that the information required on Form
N-PORT will assist the Commission in better understanding each of these risks in the fund
industry.30 These commenters also generally agreed with us that the ability to understand the
risks that funds face will help Commission staff better understand and monitor risks and trends in
the fund industry as a whole, facilitating the Commission’s informed regulation of the fund
industry.31 We also believe, and some commenters agreed, that information obtained from Form
N-PORT filings will facilitate the Commission’s oversight of funds and assist Commission staff

29

See generally Liquidity Adopting Release, supra footnote 9.

See, e.g., Comment Letter of BlackRock (Aug. 11, 2015) (“BlackRock Comment Letter”)

the Commission better identify and monitor emerging risks associated with specific RICs or
categories of RICs as well as asset management activities.”); Comment Letter of Wells Fargo Funds
Management, LLC (Aug. 11, 2015) (“Wells Fargo Comment Letter”) (“we believe that the enhanced
disclosure requirements of the Proposals represent appropriate valuable information for the
Commission to have in order to assess trends in risks, for example, across the mutual fund
industry.”); but see, e.g., Comment Letter of Federated Investors, Inc. (January 13, 2016) (“Federated
Comment Letter) (“A majority of the Commission’s proposed amendments to Form N-1A, N-PORT,
and N-CEN would require a large effort from funds while offering data that is, at best, of little utility,
and, at worst, misleading. Many of these deficiencies relate to flaws inherent in a security-level
disclosure scheme.”). We disagree with the commenter that a security-level disclosure scheme is of
little utility. See infra footnote 1283 and accompanying and following text (discussing the utility of
the security-level information that will be reported on Form N-PORT).

in examination, enforcement, and monitoring, as well as in formulating policy and in its review
of fund registration statements and disclosures.32 In this regard, we expect that Commission staff
will use the data reported on Form N-PORT for many of the same purposes as Commission staff
has used data reported on Form N-MFP by money market funds. The data received on Form
N-MFP has been used extensively by Commission staff, including for purposes of assessing
regulatory compliance, identifying funds for examination, and risk monitoring. Form N-MFP
data has also informed Commission policy; for example, staff used Form N-MFP data in
analyses that informed the Commission’s considerations when it proposed and adopted money
market fund reform rules in 2013 and 2014.33
In addition to assisting the Commission in its regulatory functions, we believe, and some
commenters agreed, that investors and other potential users will benefit from the periodic public
disclosure of the information reported on Form N-PORT.34 Form N-PORT is primarily designed
for use by the Commission and its staff, and not for disclosing information directly to individual
investors. The information we are requiring on Form N-PORT is more voluminous than on a
schedule of investments. We believe, and some commenters agreed, however, that some
investors, particularly institutional investors, could directly use the data from the information on
Form N-PORT for their own quantitative analysis of funds, including to better understand the

funds’ investment strategies and risks, and to better compare funds with similar strategies.35
Additionally, we believe, and some commenters agreed, that entities providing services to
investors, such as investment advisers, broker-dealers, and entities that provide information and
analysis for fund investors, will also utilize and analyze the information that will be required by
Form N-PORT to help all investors make more informed investment decisions.36 Accordingly,
whether directly or through third parties, we believe, and some commenters agree, that the
periodic public disclosure of the information on Form N-PORT will benefit all fund investors.37
As discussed further below, in order to mitigate the risk that the information on Form N-PORT
will be used in ways that might ultimately result in investor harm, we are limiting the public
availability of Form N-PORT to reports filed as of quarter-end, as well as delaying public
availability of those reports by 60 days and keep certain discrete information items nonpublic.
We intend to increase transparency of fund investments through Form N-PORT in several
ways. First, Form N-PORT will improve reporting of fund derivative usage. As the
Commission has previously noted, we have observed a dramatic growth in the volume and
complexity of the derivatives markets over the past two decades.38 Additionally, funds that are
considered “alternative” funds, which often use derivatives for implementing their investment
strategy, are becoming increasingly popular among investors.39 Although Regulation S-X

Concept Release”) at n. 7 and accompanying text.

39

While there is no clear definition of “alternative” in the fund industry, an alternative fund is generally
understood to be a fund whose primary investment strategy falls into one or more of the three

21

establishes general disclosure requirements for financial statements in fund registration
statements and shareholder reports, based on staff review of fund filings, the lack of standardized
requirements as to the terms of derivatives that must be reported has sometimes led to
inconsistent approaches to reporting derivatives information and, in some cases, insufficient
information concerning the terms and underlying reference assets of derivatives to allow the
Commission or investors to better understand the investment.40 This hinders both an analysis of
a particular fund’s investments, as well as comparability among funds.41
The information and reporting format required by Form N-PORT will create a more
detailed, uniform, and structured reporting regime. We believe and several commenters agreed
that this will allow the Commission and investors to better analyze and compare funds’
derivatives investments and the exposures they create, which can be important to understanding
funds’ investment strategies, use of leverage, and potential for risk of loss.42

following categories: (1) non-traditional asset classes (for example, currencies); (2) non-traditional
strategies (such as long/short equity positions); and/or (3) less liquid assets (such as private debt).
At the end of December 2015, alternative mutual funds and exchange-traded funds had more than
$200 billion in assets. Although alternative mutual funds only accounted for 1.23% of the mutual
fund market as of December 2015, the almost $17.3 billion of inflows into these funds in 2015
represented 7% of the inflows for the entire mutual fund industry in that year. These statistics were
obtained from staff analysis of Morningstar Direct data, and are based on fund categories as defined
by Morningstar.
40

For example, we understand that some funds provide a description of all of the holdings in an index
or custom basket underlying a swap contract, while others only provide a short description. See also
Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at n. 31 and accompanying text.

See, e.g., current rule 12-13 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-13] (requiring funds to disclose

derivative disclosures should be made for funds); FASB ASC 815, Disclosures about Derivative

22

Furthermore, as discussed further below, Form N-PORT requires funds to report certain
risk metrics that would provide measurements of a fund’s exposure to changes in interest rates,
credit spreads and asset prices, whether through investments in debt securities or in derivatives.
Financial statement information provides historical information over a particular time period
(e.g., a statement of operations), or information about values of assets at a particular point in time
(e.g., a balance sheet including, for funds, a schedule of investments). Risk metrics, on the other
hand, measure the change in value of an investment in response to small changes in the
underlying reference asset of an investment, whether the underlying reference asset is a security
(or index of securities), commodity, interest rate, or credit spread over an interest rate. Based on
staff experience, as well as staff outreach to asset managers and entities that provide risk
management services to asset managers (prior to the Commission issuing the Proposing
Release), discussed further below, we believe that fund portfolio managers and risk managers
commonly calculate risk metrics to analyze the exposures in their portfolios.43 The Commission
believes that staff can use these risk measures to better understand the exposures in the fund
industry, thereby facilitating better monitoring of risks and trends in the fund industry as a
whole.

Commission in carrying out its mission; and providing suggestions for modifications to the final

prices or interest rates); Sheldon Natenberg, OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING (1994) (same).

23

Form N-PORT will also require information about certain fund transactions and activities
such as securities lending, repurchase agreements, and reverse repurchase agreements, including
information regarding the counterparties to which the fund is exposed in those transactions, as
well as in over-the-counter derivatives transactions. We believe and several commenters agreed
that such information will increase transparency concerning these transactions and activities and
will provide better information regarding counterparties, which will be useful in assessing both
individual and multiple fund exposures to a single counterparty.44 This will allow the
Commission to better assess and monitor counterparty risk for individual funds, as well as across
the industry.
As discussed further below, Form N-PORT will be filed electronically in a structured,
XML format. This format will enhance the ability of the Commission, as well as investors and
other potential users, to analyze portfolio data both on a fund-by-fund basis and also across
funds.45 As a result, although we will collect certain information on Form N-PORT that may be
similarly disclosed or reported elsewhere (e.g., portfolio investments would continue to be
included as part of the schedules of investments contained in shareholder reports, and filed on a
semi-annual basis with the Commission on Form N-CSR), we believe that it is appropriate to
also collect this information in a structured format for analysis by our staff as well as investors
and other potential users.

about counterparty risk and other important factors, the SEC will make it easier for investors and
financial advisors to monitor portfolio risks.”).

Commission to use information from market participants in rigorous empirical examinations of the

out its regulatory mission.”).

24

Many commenters were generally supportive of our proposal.46 However, we received
many comments relating to the structure of the proposed form, data to be collected, frequency of
filings, and whether reports on the form should be made public. We address these comments
below and discuss modifications we made from the proposal in response to comments.
1.

Who Must File Reports on Form N-PORT

We are adopting, as proposed, the requirement that each registered management
investment company and each ETF organized as a UIT file a report on Form N-PORT.47
Registrants offering multiple series will be required to file a report for each series separately,
even if some information is the same for two or more series.48 Money market funds and SBICs
will not be required to file reports on Form N-PORT.49

46

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (Aug. 11, 2015)
(“Schwab Comment Letter”) (“Form N-Port [sic] will provide substantial additional information to
the Commission and strengthen its ability to oversee and carry out its regulatory responsibilities for
the asset management industry.”); Vanguard Comment Letter (“Vanguard generally supports the
proposed reporting initiatives because we believe these reporting obligations will provide the
Commission with the tools necessary to monitor portfolio composition and risk exposure among
funds, without exposing fund investors to potentially harmful front-running activities.”); Comment
Letter of Pioneer Investments (Aug. 11, 2015) (“Pioneer Comment Letter”) (“Pioneer supports the
Commission’s effort to modernize the regime whereby funds report information about their portfolio
holdings to the Commission.”); Comment Letter of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association Asset Management Group (Aug. 11, 2015) (“SIFMA Comment Letter I”) (“We support
the Commission’s initiative in proposing monthly reports on Form N-PORT in order to strengthen its
regulatory oversight of the asset management industry and protect investors by obtaining more
frequent and substantially expanded information about funds, in a structured format.”); ICI Comment
Letter (“ICI broadly supports the Commission’s efforts to update fund reporting.”).

47

See new rule 30b1-9.

48

As further discussed below, in part to harmonize definitions between Forms N-PORT and N-CEN,
and in part to parallel identical changes to the definition of “exchange-traded fund” in Form N-CEN,
we have revised Form N-PORT’s proposed definition of “exchange-traded product” to refer instead to
“exchange-traded fund,” which as revised includes each series of a UIT that meets that definition.
See General Instruction E of Form N-PORT; infra footnote 896 (discussing changes to definitions in
Form N-CEN).

Money market funds already file their monthly portfolio investments with the Commission. See
Form N-MFP. SBICs are unique investment companies that operate differently and are subject to a
different regulatory regime than other management investment companies. They are “privately

25

We are adopting, as proposed, the requirement that all ETFs file reports on Form NPORT, regardless of their form of organization. Although most ETFs today are structured as
open-end management investment companies, there are several ETFs that are organized as
UITs.50 ETFs organized as UITs have significant numbers of investors who we believe can
benefit from the disclosures required in Form N-PORT.51 We received no comments on this
aspect of the proposal.
One commenter suggested that reports on Form N-PORT should be filed by all registered
investment companies, including UITs, in order to have comparable filing information across
registered investment products, although the commenter did suggest that less frequent filing
requirements might be appropriate based on the structure of the investment company.52 We note
that UITs have fixed portfolios that do not change over time, and thus, unlike most other
investment companies which are required to file quarterly reports with their current portfolio
holdings, UITs are not currently required to file periodic reports other than on an annual basis.53
Based on these differences, as reflected in the current reporting regime, we have determined not
to extend Form N-PORT filing requirements to UITs that are not ETFs at this time.

owned and managed investment funds, licensed and regulated by [the Small Business Administration
(“SBA”)], that use their own capital plus funds borrowed with an SBA guarantee to make equity and
debt investments in qualifying small businesses.” See SBA, SBIC Program Overview, available at
https://www.sba.gov/content/sbic-program-overview. As a result of these differences, SBICs are not
required to file reports on Form N-Q. As of December 31, 2015, only one SBIC had publicly offered
securities outstanding.
50

There are currently eight ETFs organized as UITs that have registered with the Commission.

51

Commission staff estimates that as of December 2015, ETFs organized as UITs represented 12% of
all assets invested in registered ETFs. This analysis is based on data from Morningstar Direct.

52

See Morningstar Comment Letter.

53

UITs currently file annual reports on Form N-SAR. In contrast, management investment companies
currently file reports for their first and third fiscal quarters on Forms N-Q and reports for their second
and fourth fiscal quarters on Form N-CSR, as well as semi-annual reports on Form N-SAR. See
supra footnotes 19–20 and accompanying text.

26

The same commenter also recommended that reports on Form N-PORT be filed by
business development companies (“BDCs”).54 BDCs are a category of closed-end funds that are
operated for the purpose of investing in, and providing managerial assistance to, small and
developing businesses, and financially troubled businesses. BDCs are not required to register as
investment companies under the Investment Company Act although they do elect to be subject to
certain specialized provisions, and they are subject to a different reporting regime than registered
investment companies.55 Based on these differences, and as reflected in the current reporting and
registration regime, we have determined not to extend Form N-PORT filing requirements to
BDCs at this time.56
Another commenter suggested that the Commission and the CFTC should agree on and
implement a substituted compliance regime.57 Although we recognize that there are various
alternative reporting requirements imposed in other contexts and by other regulators, the
reporting requirements imposed by Form N-PORT have been designed specifically to meet the
Commission’s regulatory needs with regards to monitoring and oversight of registered funds.
Finally, one commenter stated that we should not require funds to directly report
information on their own behalf, but instead require other entities such as transfer agents and

54

See Morningstar Comment Letter (recommending that “business development companies…and other
[registered investment companies]” should be required to file reports on Form N-PORT).

Although BDCs will not be subject to Form N-PORT filing requirements, the amendments being
adopted to Regulation S-X will apply to both registered investment companies and BDCs. See infra

regulating, examining, and overseeing funds, including fund reporting, recordkeeping, and
compliance, we continue to believe that obtaining such information directly from funds is
appropriate.

Information Required on Form N-PORT

We are adopting, substantially as proposed, the requirements in Form N-PORT to report
certain information about the fund and the fund’s portfolio investments as of the close of the
preceding month, including: (a) general information about the fund; (b) assets and liabilities; (c)
certain portfolio-level metrics, including certain risk metrics; (d) information regarding securities
lending counterparties; (e) information regarding monthly returns; (f) flow information;
(g) certain information regarding each investment in the portfolio; (h) miscellaneous securities (if
any); (i) explanatory notes (if any), and (j) exhibits. We are adopting these information
requirements substantially as proposed, although we are making some modifications from the
proposal in response to comments. Each of these is discussed in more detail below.
a.

General Information and Instructions

Part A of Form N-PORT requires, as proposed, general identifying information about the
fund. This information includes the name of the registrant, name of the series, and relevant file
numbers.59 Funds will also report the date of their fiscal year end, the date as of which
information is reported on the form, and indicate if they anticipate that this will be their final
58

See Federated Comment Letter (“It would also reduce the reporting burden on funds for the
Commission to acquire information directly from custodians and transfer agents, which are proficient
in maintaining and reporting portfolio holdings and other information.”).

59

See Item A.1 and Item A.2 of Form N-PORT. Funds will provide the name of the registrant, the
Investment Company Act and CIK file numbers for the registrant, and the address and telephone
number of the registrant. Funds will also provide the name of and EDGAR identifier (if any) for the
series.

28

filing on Form N-PORT.60 This information will be used to identify the registrant and series
filing the report, track the reporting period, and identify final filings. No comments were
received on this aspect of our proposal. We are adopting these elements as proposed.
As proposed, funds will also provide the Legal Entity Identifier (“LEI”) number of the
registrant and series.61 The LEI is a unique identifier generally associated with a single corporate
entity and is intended to provide a uniform international standard for identifying counterparties
to a transaction.62 Fees are not imposed for the usage of or access to LEIs, and all of the
associated reference data needed to understand, process, and utilize the LEIs is widely and freely
available and not subject to any usage restrictions. Funds or registrants that have not yet
obtained an LEI will be required to obtain one, which currently entails a one-time fee of $219
plus $119 per year in annual maintenance costs and fees.63

60

See Item A.3 and Item A.4 of Form N-PORT.

61

See Item A.1.d and Item A.2.c of Form N-PORT. The Commission has begun to require disclosure of
the LEI in other contexts. See, e.g., Form PF, Reporting Form for Investment Advisers to Private
Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors, available at
http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2011/ia-3308-formpf.pdf; Regulation SBSR-Reporting and
Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 74244
(Feb. 11, 2015) [80 FR 14564 (Mar. 19, 2015)] (“Regulation SBSR Adopting Release”).

62

The global LEI system operates under an LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee (“ROC”) that
currently includes members that are official bodies from over 40 jurisdictions. The Commission is a
member of the ROC and currently serves on its Executive Committee. The Commission notes that it
would expect to revisit the requirement to report LEIs if the operation of the LEI system were to
change significantly.

63

As of June 30, 2016, the cost of obtaining an LEI from the Global Markets Entity Identifier (“GMEI”)
Utility in the United States was $200, plus a $19 surcharge for the LEI Central Operating Unit. The
annual cost of maintaining an LEI from the GMEI Utility was $100, plus a $19 surcharge for the LEI
Central Operating Unit. See GMEI Utility, Frequently Asked Questions, available at
https://www.gmeiutility.org/frequentlyAskedQuestions.jsp.

29

Commenters were generally supportive of this aspect of our proposal, with most
endorsing the use of LEI for identification of funds, as well as for fund counterparties.64
However, one commenter suggested that certain funds should be permanently exempted from
such requirements as such funds would not need an LEI for any other purpose.65 Lastly, another
commenter suggested that, to better assist academic researchers with identification of entities,
every filing by a mutual fund should require an exhaustive list of the tickers and CUSIPs
associated with that mutual fund.66
We are adopting the requirement that funds report LEI information for the registrant and
for each series, as proposed. We acknowledge that funds will incur some costs to obtain and
maintain an LEI, although we believe the cost to obtain and maintain an LEI identifier is
modest.67 Uniform reporting of LEIs by funds, however, will help provide a consistent means of
identification that will facilitate the linkage of data reported on Form N-PORT with data from
other filings and sources that is or will be reported elsewhere as LEIs become more widely used
by regulators and the financial industry.68 Using alternate means of identification or providing

identifier).

that this information could help with the identification of entities. The commenter did not discuss the
utility of the LEI specifically).

exemptions to this requirement could hinder the ability of Commission staff as well as investors
and other potential users of this information to use the data on Form N-PORT as discussed above.
For these reasons, we anticipate that the benefits of requiring funds to report the LEI number of
the registrant and series on Form N-PORT will justify the costs of obtaining and reporting this
information, and thus we are adopting this requirement as proposed.
Furthermore, in response to the request that an exhaustive list of the tickers and CUSIPs
associated with the fund be reported to help with the identification of entities, we note that Form
N-PORT requires funds to report various identifying information, including name of the
registrant, Investment Company Act file number of the registrant, CIK number of the registrant,
LEI of the registrant, name of each series, EDGAR identifier (if any) for each series, and LEI for
each series.69 We believe this information is sufficient for Commission staff, as the primary user
of the form, to identify funds filing reports on Form N-PORT, and could also be useful for
investors and other potential users. As discussed further below, funds will also be reporting
additional identifying information on Form N-CEN in a structured format that can be used to

Commenters to the FSOC Notice expressed support for regulatory acceptance of LEI identifiers. See,
e.g., Joint Comment Letter of SIFMA/Investment Adviser Association to FSOC Notice (Mar. 25,
2015) (“SIFMA/IAA FSOC Notice Comment Letter”) (expressing support for the LEI initiative, and

market participants); Comment Letter of Fidelity to FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015) (expressing the
need to develop analytics to make data intelligible, such as the ability to map exposures across the
financial system, such as through the use of LEIs).

identify those funds and link information reported by them on Forms N-PORT and N-CEN with
information available in other Commission filings and sources that is similarly structured.70
Form N-PORT also includes general filing and reporting instructions, as well as
definitions of specific terms referenced in the form.71 These instructions and definitions are
intended to provide clarity to funds and to assist them in filing reports on Form N-PORT.72
Proposed Form N-PORT would have required funds to report information about their
portfolios as of the last business day, or calendar day, of the month, but did not provide specific
instructions on the appropriate basis for reporting such information, such as whether the
information should be reported as of the trade date (“T+0”), which is required for financial
reporting purposes, or the trade date plus one day (“T+1”), which is currently permitted under
rule 2a-4 for the calculation of funds’ net asset values (“NAV”). Several commenters requested
clarification on this issue and specifically requested that Form N-PORT allow reporting on a T+1
basis.73
Many commenters noted that most funds use T+1 accounting to record their day-to-day
transactions, and only convert their records to T+0 for quarterly portfolio holdings reporting

70

Form N-CEN requires funds to report additional information for each share class outstanding,
including name of the class, class identification number, and ticker symbol. See Item C.2.d of Form
N-CEN.

71

See General Instruction A (Rule as to Use of Form N-PORT), B (Application of General Rules and
Regulations), C (Filing of Reports), D (Paperwork Reduction Act Information), E (Definitions), F
(Public Availability) and G (Responses to Questions) of Form N-PORT.

72

See id. For example, General Instructions A, B, C and G provide specific filing and reporting
instructions (including how to report entity names, percentages, and dates), General Instructions D
and F provide information about the Paperwork Reduction Act and the public availability of
information reported on Form N-PORT, and General Instruction E provides definitions for specific
terms referenced in Form N-PORT.

of OppenheimerFunds (Aug. 10, 2015) (“Oppenheimer Comment Letter”).

32

purposes on Forms N-CSR and N-Q.74 These commenters further noted that our proposal would
require funds to file monthly reports 30 days after each reporting period, whereas funds currently
have at least 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter to report similar information on a T+0
basis on Forms N-CSR and N-Q. Accordingly, commenters suggested that allowing funds to file
on a T+1 basis would reduce filing burdens relative to requiring reporting on a T+0 basis, while
not meaningfully changing the substance of the information reported. One commenter explicitly
recommended that funds be allowed to choose whether to file on a T+0 or T+1 basis, so that
funds that prefer to align their Form N-PORT reporting with their reporting on Forms N-Q
and/or N-CSR could do so, while other commenters that suggested this modification did not
specify whether all funds should be required to report on a T+1 basis uniformly.75
As discussed above, the Commission did not specify the appropriate basis for reporting,
and we agree with commenters that an explicit instruction on the basis on which to report is
appropriate. We are persuaded by commenters that explicitly instructing funds file on the same
basis for which they calculate their NAV (generally a T+1 basis) would not be as burdensome as
instructing all funds to file on a T+0 basis, and would still maintain the utility of the information
reported. As noted by commenters, we acknowledge that reporting monthly information on
Form N-PORT on a T+1 basis may result in differences between quarterly portfolio holdings
information currently reported on a T+0 basis on Forms N-CSR and N-Q. However, any such
differences are unlikely to affect the utility of the information for the Commission and other
potential users, because our primary purpose for using the information is to analyze and assess

the various risks in a particular fund and monitoring risks and trends in the fund industry as a
whole, rather than to align the information reported with the fund’s financial statements.
Nonetheless, we do not agree that funds should be permitted to file either on the basis of
calculating its NAV (generally T+1) or on the basis of how they prepare financial reports (T+0)
at the fund’s option, as having funds report their portfolio holdings on different bases would
reduce the comparability of the data reported on Form N-PORT among funds and across the
industry. Accordingly, we have modified the proposal to add an instruction to Form N-PORT
instructing funds that they must report portfolio information on Form N-PORT on the same basis
they use to calculate their NAV, which we understand is generally T+1.76
Commenters also requested confirmation that different internal methodologies could be
applied in responding to certain items on Form N-PORT, such as those that may require
subjective judgments on the part of funds.77 Furthermore, two commenters urged the
Commission to explicitly state that funds may make and rely on reasonable assumptions in
providing responses to information items on Form N-PORT.78 In response to these comments,
we have modified the proposal by adding an instruction clarifying that in reporting information
on Form N-PORT, the fund may respond using its own methodology and the conventions of its

76

See General Instruction A of Form N-PORT (“Reports on Form N-PORT must disclose portfolio
information as calculated by the fund for the reporting period’s ending net asset value (commonly,
and as permitted by rule 2a-4, the first business day following the trade date).”). We understand that
funds generally calculate their NAV on a T+1 basis pursuant to rule 2a-4, although under certain
circumstances funds might record particular transactions on a T+0 basis, such as when correcting a
pricing error. The instructions in Form N-PORT are intended to be flexible enough to allow funds to
report information on Form N-PORT on the same basis used in calculating NAV.

77

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter I (requesting confirmation that funds may use classifications
generated by existing methodologies or available service providers in reporting country of risk for
portfolio holdings); ICI Comment Letter (asserting that funds should have the flexibility to make
country of risk determinations using their own good faith judgment).

service provider, so long as the methodology and conventions are consistent with the way the
fund reports internally and to current and prospective investors.79 This approach, which we have
modeled after a similar instruction in Form PF, is intended to strike an appropriate balance
between easing the reporting burden on funds by allowing them to rely on their existing practices,
while still providing useful information to the Commission, investors, and other potential users.80
The new instruction also explains that funds may explain any of their methodologies, including
related assumptions, in Part E of Form N-PORT.81
One commenter recommended that we include a definition of “forward contract,” that
references the settlement time of a contract, noting that from their experience, there are several
interpretations of what constitutes a forward contract and without a standard definition, funds
might categorize products inconsistently.82 We disagree that we should define forward contracts
with regard to the settlement time, and believe that adopting a specific definition like the one that
the commenter suggested could be overbroad or under-inclusive based on the settlement time
selected. Also, based on staff experience reviewing fund disclosures, we note that funds have
generally been able to classify forwards in their current disclosures even though there is not a
79

See General Instruction G of Form N-PORT (“Funds may respond to this Form using their own
internal methodologies and the conventions of their service providers, provided the information is
consistent with information that they report internally and to current and prospective investors.
However, the methodologies and conventions must be consistently applied and the Fund’s responses
must be consistent with any instructions or other guidance relating to this Form.”).

80

See General Instruction 15 of Form PF. Periodic reports on Form PF must be filed by registered
investment advisers with at least $150 million in private fund assets under management. Form PF is
designed, among other things, to assist the Financial Stability Oversight Council in its assessment of
systemic risk in the U.S. financial system. See generally Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private
Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF,

PF Adopting Release”).

specific definition that references the settlement date of the contract. Finally, the approach we
are adopting allows flexibility as forward products evolve.
Similarly, one commenter noted that it is unclear if a credit default swap should be
reported as an option or a swap on Form N-PORT since it has the characteristics of both types of
investments. 83 As discussed further below, we are revising Form N-PORT to include a
clarification that specifically identifies that total return swaps, credit default swaps, and interest
rate swaps should all be categorized under the “swap” instrument type.84
A few commenters also asked for guidance as to what investments would fall within the
category of “other derivatives” in Item C.11.g.85 The commenters noted that funds already rely
upon the definition of “derivatives” provided in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(“GAAP”) for financial statement reporting purposes and recommended that funds be allowed to
rely upon the same definition for determining what to report as “other derivatives” on Form NPORT (i.e., investments reported as derivatives for financial statement reporting purposes, but
that do not fall within the categories of derivatives enumerated in Form N-PORT such as futures,
forwards, etc.).86 We agree that this approach will generally promote consistency in how such

83

See Morningstar Comment Letter.

84

See infra footnote 340 and accompanying text.

85

See ICI Comment Letter; T. Rowe Price Comment Letter.

86

See generally ASC 815 (Derivatives and Hedging).
We note that definitions related to derivatives have been proposed in other contexts, for example
“derivatives transaction” in our recent proposal regarding the use of derivatives by registered
investment companies and BDCs. See Derivatives Proposing Release, supra footnote 7 (defining the
term “derivatives transaction” to mean “any swap, security-based swap, futures contract, forward
contract, option, any combination of the foregoing, or any similar instrument (‘derivatives
instrument’) under which a fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or
other assets during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination.” However, that
proposed definition is limited to derivatives transactions where the fund may be required to make a
payment or delivery of cash or other assets. In contrast, for purposes of Form N-PORT, we seek to
obtain information about all of a fund’s derivative investments, regardless of whether the fund has a

36

information is reported and will provide more certainty to funds reporting “other derivatives” on
Form N-PORT, and we understand that funds may choose to utilize this approach. However, we
are not requiring that funds do so since we anticipate most derivative investments held by funds
will fall within one of the categories of derivatives previously enumerated in Form N-PORT, and
thus we expect few investments to be reported within the “other derivatives” category.
Moreover, this “other derivatives” category is intentionally designed to be flexible enough to
allow funds to capture and categorize investments in the future that are not currently traded by
funds, and for these reasons we are not requiring funds to adhere to any specific process in
determining what should fall within this category, provided that none of the previously
enumerated categories apply.
Several commenters also asked that the definition of “investment grade” be revised to
follow standards generally used by the industry by replacing references to liquidity with
references to credit quality.87 In response to these comments, we are removing the definition of
“investment grade” that we proposed to be included in Form N-PORT. Consistent with our other
changes discussed herein that permit funds to rely on their existing practices and methodologies,
Form N-PORT provides funds with the flexibility, in determining what constitutes “investment
grade,” to generally use their own methodology and the conventions of their service providers, as

payment or delivery obligation. As a result of these differences, we continue to believe that it is
preferable for Form N-PORT to not incorporate a specific definition, but rather to retain the flexibility
to encompass the changing types of products that may evolve and emerge.
87

See ICI Comment Letter; Oppenheimer Comment Letter; Pioneer Comment Letter; Comment Letter
of MFS Investment Management (Aug. 11, 2015) (“MFS Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of the
Dreyfus Corporation (Aug. 11, 2015) (“Dreyfus Comment Letter”).

37

provided in General Instruction G. Given this clarification in the adopted form, we do not
believe any definition of investment grade is necessary.88
We have also made several changes to certain definitions and instructions related to the
way in which funds will provide information on Form N-PORT, largely relating to the
formatting of the information reported. Among other things, we have revised the instruction in
the proposal that directed funds to respond to every item of the form.89 As proposed, the
instruction would have required funds to respond to each sub-item and item on Form N-PORT
even if the item was inapplicable. The revised instruction indicates that funds are not required to
respond to items that are wholly inapplicable.90 For example, no response is required for Item
C.11, which concerns derivatives, when reporting information about an investment that is not a
derivative. We believe this revision will decrease burdens upon filers and reduce the file size of
Form N-PORT submissions, while still maintaining the clarity of the data reported on Form NPORT.
We have also eliminated certain instructions from proposed Form N-PORT relating to the
formatting of information reported on the form that, upon further consideration, we believe are
unnecessary in Form N-PORT. In particular, we have eliminated instructions requiring the
rounding of percentages, monetary values, and other numeric values.91 Elimination of the

88

See supra footnote 79 and accompanying text.

89

See General Instruction G of proposed Form N-PORT (“A Fund is required to respond to every item
of this form. If an item requests information that is not applicable (for example, an LEI for a
counterparty that does not have an LEI), respond N/A”).

90

See General Instruction G of Form N-PORT (“A Fund is not required to respond to an item that is
wholly inapplicable (for example, no response would be required for Item C.11 when reporting
information about an investment that is not a derivative). If a sub-item requests information that is
not applicable, for example, an LEI for a counterparty that does not have an LEI, respond N/A”).

91

See General Instruction G of proposed Form N-PORT (instructions regarding rounding of
percentages, monetary values, and other numerical values).

38

instructions regarding the rounding of such figures should allow funds to report such information
in the same way such information is currently recorded in their books and records. We also have
eliminated instructions regarding the signature and filing of reports, because we believe that the
general rules and regulations applicable under the Act provide sufficient guidance with regard to
those issues.92
We have also made clarifying revisions to certain definitions. As discussed above, we
have revised the proposed definition of “exchange-traded product” to refer instead to “exchangetraded fund” to harmonize the definitions used in Forms N-PORT and N-CEN93 The revision
also clarifies that a separate report on Form N-PORT must be filed by each series of a UIT
organized as an ETF, and parallels similar revisions to the definition of ETF in Form N-CEN.94
We have also revised the definition of “LEI” to reflect new terminology regarding LEIs.95
Finally, regarding General Instruction F, which provides information regarding the public
availability of the information in Form N-PORT, the final Instruction clarifies, similar to
92

See General Instruction B of Form N-PORT (“The General Rules and Regulations under the Act
contain certain general requirements that are applicable to reporting on any form under the Act.
These general requirements shall be carefully read and observed in the preparation and filing of
reports on this Form, except that any provision in the Form or in these instructions shall be
controlling.”) See also General Instruction H of proposed Form N-PORT (instructions regarding
signature and filing of reports).

93

See supra footnote 48 and accompanying text. Although the definition of “exchange-traded fund”
being adopted on Form N-PORT is narrower than the definition of “exchange-traded product” as
proposed on Form N-PORT, the universe of filers on Form N-PORT is not changing because
exchange-traded managed funds that would have been encompassed in the proposed definition of
“exchange-traded product” will be encompassed in the adoption through references to managed
investment companies. See rule 30b1-9 (requiring certain funds to file reports on Form N-PORT);
Form N-PORT (“Form N-PORT is to be used by a registered management investment company, or an
exchange-traded fund organized as a unit investment trust, or series thereof (‘Fund’)….”).

94

See infra footnote 896.

95

Form N-PORT’s revised definition of “LEI” refers to the legal entity identifier “endorsed” by the
Regulatory Oversight Committee Of The Global Legal Entity Identifier System (“LEI ROC”) or
“accredited” by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (“GLEIF”), as opposed to “assigned or
recognized” by those two entities.

39

language that is contained in current Form PF, that we do not intend to make public certain
information reported on Form N-PORT “that is identifiable to any particular fund or adviser.”96
This modification makes clear, for example, that the Commission or Commission staff could
issue analyses and reports that are based on aggregated, non-identifying Form N-PORT data,
which would otherwise be nonpublic, such as information reported on Form N-PORT for the
first and second months of each fund’s fiscal quarter.
b.

Information Regarding Assets and Liabilities.

Part B of Form N-PORT seeks certain portfolio level information about the fund. As we
proposed, Part B includes questions requiring funds to report their total assets, total liabilities,
and net assets.97 Funds will also separately report certain assets and liabilities, as follows. First,
as we proposed, funds will report the aggregate value of any “miscellaneous securities” held in
their portfolios.98 As currently permitted by Regulation S-X, and as further discussed below,
Form N-PORT permits funds to report an aggregate amount not exceeding 5 percent of the total
value of their portfolio investments in one amount as “Miscellaneous securities,” provided that
securities so listed are not restricted, have been held for not more than one year prior to the date
of the related balance sheet, and have not previously been reported by name to the shareholders,
or set forth in any registration statement, application, or report to shareholders or otherwise made

96

See supra footnote 26.

97

See Item B.1 of Form N-PORT.

98

See Item B.1.a and Item B.2.a of Form N-PORT. As discussed further below, Form N-PORT will
require funds to also report information about miscellaneous securities on an investment-byinvestment basis, although such information will be nonpublic and will be used for Commission use
only. See infra footnote 420 and accompanying text.

40

available to the public.99 We received only one comment on this aspect of our proposal, which
supported the reporting of aggregate information for miscellaneous securities.100
Second, as we proposed, funds will also report any assets invested in a controlled foreign
corporation for the purpose of investing in certain types of investments (“controlled foreign
corporation” or “CFC”).101 We received no comments on this aspect of the proposal. Some
funds use CFCs for making certain types of investments, particularly commodities and
commodity-linked derivatives, often for tax purposes. Form N-PORT requires funds to disclose
each underlying investment in a CFC, rather than just the investment in the CFC itself, which
will increase transparency on fund investments through CFCs.102 These disclosures will allow
investors to look through CFCs and understand the specific underlying holdings that they are
investing in, which will in turn allow investors to better analyze their fund holdings and risk, and
hence enable investors to make more informed investment decisions.
In addition, as discussed further below in section II.D.4, we believe it will be beneficial
for the Commission to have certain information about funds’ use of CFCs. The information we
will be obtaining in Form N-PORT, combined with additional information we are requiring on
Form N-CEN regarding CFCs, discussed below, will help the Commission better monitor funds’
compliance with the Investment Company Act and assess funds’ use of CFCs, including the
extent of their use by reporting of total assets in CFCs.

See General Instruction E (providing that “Controlled Foreign Corporation” has the meaning provided
in section 957 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 957]) and Item B.2.b (requiring funds to
report assets invested in controlled foreign corporations) of Form N-PORT.

102

See Instruction to Part B of Form N-PORT (“Report the following information for the Fund and its
consolidated subsidiaries.”).

41

Third, as we proposed, we are requiring that funds report the amounts of certain
liabilities, in particular: (1) borrowings attributable to amounts payable for notes payable, bonds,
and similar debt, as reported pursuant to rule 6-04(13)(a) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.604(13)(a)]; (2) payables for investments purchased either (i) on a delayed delivery, whendelivered, or other firm commitment basis, or (ii) on a standby commitment basis; and (3)
liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock issued by the fund.103 We received no
comments on this aspect of the proposal. This information will allow Commission staff, as well
as investors and other potential users, to better understand a fund’s borrowing activities and
payment obligations associated with these transactions. This in turn will facilitate analysis of the
fund’s use of financial leverage, as well as the fund’s liquidity profile and ability to meet
redemptions or share repurchases, which are important to understanding the risks such
borrowings might create.
One commenter suggested that certain fee and expense information currently reported on
Form N-SAR, and Item 75 of Form N-SAR in particular—which relates to average net assets
during the current reporting period—be reported on Form N-PORT.104 The commenter
acknowledged that much of this information is already publicly reported in or can be derived
from information reported in other fund documents filed with the Commission, but argued that
this information should also be reported on Form N-PORT because the structured format of
Form N-PORT would make information reported on Form N-PORT easier to aggregate and

information will be reported on Form N-PORT in a structured format going forward (i.e.,
monthly net assets for funds more generally) and is currently available in a structured format for
mutual funds in their risk/return summaries (certain fee and expense data).106 Also, as discussed
further below, we are revising Form N-CEN to require funds to report average net assets on an
annual basis.107
For these reasons, we are adopting this aspect of Form N-PORT as proposed.
c.

Portfolio Level Risk Metrics

One of the purposes of Form N-PORT is to provide the Commission with information
regarding fund portfolios to help us better monitor trends in the fund industry, including
investment strategies funds are pursuing, the investment risks that funds undertake, and how
different funds might be affected by changes in market conditions. As discussed above, the
Commission uses information from fund filings, including a fund’s registration statement and
reports on Form N-CSR (which includes the fund’s shareholder report) and Form N-Q, to inform
its understanding and regulation of the fund industry. Additionally our staff reviews fund
disclosures – including registration statements, shareholder reports, and other documents – both
on an ongoing basis as well as retroactively every three years.108
The disclosures in a fund’s registration statement about its investment objective,
investment strategies, and risks of investing in the fund, as well as the fund’s financial statements,
are fundamental to understanding a fund’s implementation of its investment strategies and the

risks in the fund. However, the financial statements and narrative disclosures in fund disclosure
documents do not always provide a complete picture of a fund’s exposure to changes in asset
prices, particularly as fund strategies and fund investments become more complex.109 The
financial statements, including a fund’s schedule of portfolio investments, provide data regarding
investments’ values as of the end of the reporting period – a “snapshot” of data at a particular
point in time – or, in the case of the statement of operations, for example, historical data over a
specified time period. By contrast, based on staff experience and the staff’s outreach to funds
prior to our proposal, we understand that funds commonly internally use multiple risk metrics
that provide calculations that measure the change in the value of fund investments assuming a
specified change in the value of underlying assets or, in the case of debt instruments and
derivatives that provide exposure to interest rates and debt instruments, changes in interest rates
or in credit spreads above the risk-free rate.110
Accordingly, we believe, and some commenters agreed, that it is appropriate to require
funds to report quantitative measurements of certain risk metrics that will provide information
beyond the narrative, often qualitative disclosures about investment strategies and risks in the
fund’s registration statement.111 Monthly reporting on these risk measures, in particular, will
help provide the Commission with more current information on how funds are implementing
their investment strategies through particular exposures. Receiving this information on a

monthly basis could help the Commission, for example, more efficiently analyze the potential
effects of a market event on funds.112
Specifically, we proposed to require certain funds to report portfolio-level measures on
Form N-PORT that will help Commission staff better understand and monitor funds’ exposures
to changes in interest rates and credit spreads across the yield curve.113 As discussed in section
II.A.2.g below, we proposed to require risk measures at the investment level for options and
convertible bonds. We continue to believe that the staff can use these measures, for example, to
determine whether additional guidance or policy measures are appropriate to improve disclosures
in order to help investors better understand how changes in interest rate or credit spreads might
affect their investment in a fund. As a result, we are adopting these risk measures substantially
as proposed, subject to the modifications discussed below.114
While we received some comments generally supporting our proposal to require
portfolio-level risk metrics,115 some suggested alternative methods for collecting risk metrics,116

the Commission’s request for risk metrics as it relates to duration and spread duration; however, we
suggest that the calculation for providing such risk metrics are defined differently than proposed.”).

the Commission, investors, and service providers to independently calculate risk); see also Interactive

discussed in more detail below.
We believe, and some commenters agreed, that institutional investors, as well as entities
that provide services to both institutional and individual investors, could use these risk metrics to
conduct their own analyses in order to help them better understand fund composition, investment
strategy, and interest rate and credit spread risk the fund is undertaking. As discussed further
below, however, other commenters, were mixed as to whether this information would be useful
for investors and if this information should be made public.118 These measures can complement
the risk disclosures that are contained in the registration statement, thereby potentially helping
investors to make more informed investment choices. Accordingly, we disagree with
commenters that argued this information has no utility for investors. We also continue to believe
that requiring funds to publicly disclose these measures quarterly, like other information in the
schedule of investments will also help provide investors with more specific, quantitative

information regarding the nature of a fund’s exposure to debt than they currently have.119 As
discussed further in Section II.A.4 below, we are adopting, largely as proposed, the requirement
that funds provide public disclosure of portfolio-level risk metrics on a quarterly basis.120 For
these reasons, and as discussed further below in section II.A.4, we were not persuaded by
commenters that such information should be nonpublic.
In particular, for funds that invest in debt instruments, or in derivatives that provide
exposure to debt or debt instruments, we believe it is important for the Commission staff,
investors, and other potential users to have measures that can help them analyze how portfolio
values might change in response to changes in interest rates or credit spreads.121 To improve the
ability of the Commission staff, investors, and other potential users to analyze how changes in
interest rates and credit spreads might affect a fund’s portfolio value, we proposed that a fund
that invests in debt instruments, or derivatives that provide notional exposure to debt instruments
or interest rates, representing at least 20% of the fund’s net asset value as of the reporting date,
provide a portfolio level calculation of duration and spread duration across the applicable
maturities in the fund’s portfolio.122

119

See Franco Comment Letter (“The rule proposal’s various disclosure and reporting requirements,
especially those requirements relating to portfolio disclosure, risk metrics and fund use of derivatives,
serve the public interest and/or the protection of investors.”).

120

See Item B.3 of Form N-PORT; see also generally Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at n. 56 and
accompanying text.

121

As discussed further below, the Commission also believes that there would be a benefit to collecting
risk measures for derivatives that provide exposure to certain assets, such as equities and
commodities. Due to the nature of these instruments, however, we believe that such information
should be provided on an instrument-by-instrument basis, instead of as a portfolio level calculation.

122

Specifically, as proposed, funds would have calculated notional value as the sum of the absolute
values of: (i) the value of each debt security, (ii) the notional amount of each swap, including, but not
limited to, total return swaps, interest rate swaps, and credit default swaps, for which the underlying
reference asset or assets are debt securities or an interest rate; and (iii) the delta-adjusted notional

47

Commenters were generally supportive of our proposal to include a threshold.123
However, several commenters requested that we increase the threshold for risk reporting from
20% and that the calculation of debt investments be made based on the fund’s three-month
average notional value of debt investments as a percentage of NAV.124 Some commenters
requested an increase in the threshold in order to make the risk metric threshold more consistent
with the Commission’s threshold for requiring funds to disclose industry concentration in their
prospectus.125 Additionally, some commenters argued that the three-month average would better

amount of any option for which the underlying reference asset is an asset described in clause (i) or
(ii). See proposed Instruction to Item B.3 of Form N-PORT.
The delta-adjusted notional value of options is needed to have an accurate measurement of the
exposure that the option creates to the underlying reference asset. See, e.g., Comment Letter of
Morningstar to Derivatives Concept Release (Nov. 7, 2011) (“Morningstar Derivatives Concept
Release Comment Letter”) (submitted in response to the Derivatives Concept Release, supra footnote
38, which sought comment regarding the use of derivatives by management investment companies).
123

See, e.g., Interactive Data Comment Letter (supporting 20% level as reasonable and stating belief that
threshold should be measured by considering notional value for derivatives and market values for
bonds); State Street Comment Letter (supporting 20% threshold and recommending that the
Commission provide clarity on the threshold calculation); Fidelity Comment Letter; Franco Comment
Letter; Simpson Thacher Comment Letter (20% threshold and holds more than 100 debt securities);
Wells Fargo Comment Letter (supporting 20% threshold).

124

See, e.g., Oppenheimer Comment Letter (25% threshold consistent with prospectus disclosure of
industry concentration); ICI Comment Letter (same); MFS Comment Letter (25% threshold); Pioneer
Comment Letter (same); Dreyfus Comment Letter (“we believe the Commission should consider a
25% threshold because, at least, it would define a subset of ‘balanced’ and ‘asset allocation’ funds
that would, by prospectus or name test mandate, for example, have to maintain a minimum fixed
income exposure.”); SIFMA Comment Letter I (recommending a 30% threshold); Invesco Comment
Letter (same); but see Morningstar Comment Letter (supporting 20% threshold).

reflect a fund’s true investment strategy and mitigate short-term market fluctuations that could
cause a fund to temporarily exceed the threshold. 126 We agree with both recommendations.
We believe that a 25% threshold, as several commenters suggested, will still allow the
Commission to receive measurements of duration and spread duration from funds that make
investments in debt instruments as a significant part of their investment strategy because we do
not believe many, if any, funds that make investments in debt instruments as a significant part of
their investment strategy have less than 25% of their NAV invested in such instruments.
Commenters persuaded us that some funds that primarily invest in assets other than debt
instruments, such as equities, could, at times, have more than 20% of the net asset value of the
fund invested in debt instruments for cash management or other purposes.127 Thus raising the
threshold from 20% to 25% will relieve more funds of having to monitor each month whether
they trigger the requirement for making such calculations, while still achieving the goal the
Commission stated in the Proposing Release of requiring funds that make investments in debt
instruments as a significant part of their investment strategy to report such metrics.128
We agree with commenters that using the same thresholds we use for discussing industry
concentration in current prospectuses is appropriate as it will achieve an objective that is similar
to the one in Form N-1A of requiring funds to disclose only where such investments are a central
part of the fund’s investment objectives. We are therefore adopting a 25% threshold for
reporting portfolio-level risk metrics.129

49

We are also modifying the rule from the proposal to require funds to calculate this
threshold on the three-month average of a fund’s value as percentage of NAV (rather than, as
proposed, value as percentage of NAV at the reporting date (i.e. month-end)) because we agree
with commenters who pointed out that this should mitigate the chance that short-term market
fluctuations could cause a fund that does not typically use such instruments as part of its
investment strategy to temporarily exceed the threshold and be required to report the metrics.130
Finally, another commenter opposed requiring risk metrics data for index funds because
it believed that this requirement would be unnecessarily burdensome for those funds.131
However, index funds incorporate a wide variety of funds – some of which are primarily
invested in debt securities, including derivatives based on debt securities. It is our view that if a
fund is exposed to debt instruments or interest rates in amounts that trigger the reporting of risk
metrics, they have an exposure large enough to warrant reporting. Moreover, some index funds
have indexes that change weekly or daily. Accordingly, because we believe it is important to
monitor the risk metrics for all funds with exposures to debt instruments exceeding the threshold,
we do not believe it would be appropriate to exempt index funds from Form N-PORT’s
requirements for risk metric reporting.
For duration, we proposed to require that a fund calculate, the change in value in the
fund’s portfolio from a 1 basis point change in interest rates (commonly known as DV01) for
130

See Item B.3 of Form N-PORT; see, e.g. Pioneer Comment Letter; Oppenheimer Comment Letter.
One commenter requested that the threshold be based on the fund’s net asset value and not notional
value. See MFS Comment Letter. We continue to believe that basing the threshold on notional
amount, especially for derivatives, is a better measure of a fund’s exposure than the just the
investment’s value because some derivatives may have a negligible net asset value, but represent
significant exposures to the fund. We have, however, made a clarifying change to the terminology
from the proposal, and instruction B.3 now refer to “value” rather than “notional value.” See infra

each applicable key rate along the risk-free interest rate curve, i.e., 1-month, 3-month, 6-month,
1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year, 20-year, and 30-year interest rate, for each
applicable currency in the fund.132 We realized that funds might not have exposures for every
applicable key rate. For example, a short-term bond fund is unlikely to have debt exposures with
longer maturities. Accordingly, we proposed that a fund only report the key rates that are
applicable to the fund. We proposed that funds report zero for maturities to which they have no
exposure.133 For exposures outside of the range of listed maturities listed on Form N-PORT, we
proposed that funds include those exposures in the nearest maturity.
One commenter stated that calculating DV01 along key rates of the Treasury curve is
“common and intuitive” to analyzing shifts of the yield curve.134 However, some commenters
suggested that calculating the DV01 and SDV01 for 11 proposed key rates could be burdensome,
and requested that we limit the number of applicable key rates along the risk-free curve.135 For
example, commenters recommended that the Commission limit the calculations to the key rates
to those most representative of bond fund overall exposures by limiting the calculation to the 1-,
2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year rates.136 Another commenter recommended collapsing the 1-, 3-,
and 6-month exposures into the 1-year exposure, as a detailed breakout inside 1-year is not
informative for most instruments.137 Commenters argued that reducing the number of key rates

132

For funds with exposures that fall between any of the listed maturities in the form, we proposed in the
Instructions to Item B.3 that funds use linear interpolation to approximate exposure to each maturity
listed above.

will reduce burdens for fund companies while providing the Commission with sufficient
information on yield curve exposures for staff analysis.138 Finally, one commenter suggested
that we only require a single measure of duration (i.e., total portfolio duration) that is the
weighted average of the top 5 currencies (including the base currency) rather than providing
duration calculations for key rates along the Treasury curve, arguing that a single measure would
capture the majority of a fund’s portfolio risk.139
We continue to believe that requiring funds to provide further detail about their exposures
to interest rate changes along the risk-free rate curve will provide the Commission with a better
understanding of the risk profiles of funds with different strategies for achieving debt exposures.
For example, funds targeting an effective duration of 5 years could achieve that objective in
different ways – one fund could invest predominantly in intermediate-term debt; another fund
could create a long position in longer-term bonds, matched with a short position in shorter-term
bonds. While both funds would have intermediate-term duration, the risk profiles of these two
funds, that is, their exposures to changes in long-term and short-term interest rates, are different.
Having DV01 calculations along the risk-free interest rate curve, as opposed to a single measure
of duration suggested by one commenter, will clarify this difference. Moreover, as one
commenter noted, “DV01 and SD01 [spread duration] are likely the measures that will be least
subject to differences based on assumptions within risk models employed by fund companies”

138

See id.; Dreyfus Comment Letter.

139

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (suggesting as an alternative, a single duration measurement that is the
weighted average of the top 5 currencies (including the base currency)); SIFMA Comment Letter I

portfolio duration and credit spread duration– i.e., single measures – rather than multiple points along
the yield curve).

52

and therefore minimizes variation based on the disparate risk metrics models used by funds.140
The Commission staff will use this information to better understand how funds are achieving
their exposures to interest rates, and to perform analysis across funds with similar strategies to
identify outliers for potential further inquiry, as appropriate.
We were, however, persuaded by commenters that reducing the number of key rates that
funds must report could reduce the reporting burden, while still providing the staff with
sufficient information and flexibility to analyze how debt portfolios will react to different interest
rates and credit spreads along the Treasury curve. We are therefore modifying this requirement
from the proposal to require fewer key rates—specifically 3-month, 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, and
30-year—which will provide, as commenters suggested, the rates most representative to bond
funds’ overall exposures. The key rates Form N-PORT will require, as adopted, are substantially
similar to the key rates suggested by commenters;141 however, we believe that some granularity
for short term debt is important, especially in the context of short and ultra-short duration funds,
and therefore, unlike the commenters’ suggestions for collapsing all short-term exposures to oneyear, Form N-PORT will require reporting for the 3-month maturity.142
Form N-PORT will also require, as proposed, funds to provide the key rate duration for
each applicable currency in a fund. One commenter recommended that we limit the duration to
the top 5 currencies.143 Some commenters requested that we not include currency in the

reporting of duration for funds because currency risk is not relevant to duration.144 Others
supported a de minimis reporting threshold for exposure to different currencies that would be
based on the notional value of the instruments, relative to NAV.145 These commenters noted that
including all currency exposures, regardless of size, would result in a long list of exposures that
would have little impact on a fund.146 As a result, the commenters believed that the Commission
would receive data that would add little to the staff’s ability to understand a fund’s portfolio risk,
but would add significant reporting and compliance burdens to funds.147
We continue to believe that funds should generally be required to provide the key rate
duration for each applicable currency in the fund in order to understand interest rate risk to funds
with significant currency risk. Nonetheless, we were persuaded by commenters that a de minimis
threshold is appropriate. Based on staff experience analyzing similar data, however, we believe
that a 5% de minimis, as suggested by some commenters, could hinder the staff’s ability to
measure smaller fund exposures that could have large effects across the fund industry as a whole.
We agree with one comment that Form N-PORT should provide for a 1% de minimis threshold,
calculated as the notional value of relevant investments in each currency relative to the fund’s
NAV. 148 We believe that setting the de minimis at this level will balance the need for the staff
to identify and monitor not only a fund’s currency risk, but also the risks of small fund positions

that could aggregate into large positions across the industry, as the Commission will still be
receiving information about the majority of a fund’s currency exposures with this threshold.
For both duration and spread duration, we proposed to require that funds provide the
change in value in the fund’s portfolio from a 1 basis point change in interest rates or credit
spreads, rather than a larger change, such as 5 basis points or 25 basis points. As we noted in the
Proposing Release, based on staff outreach, we believed that a 1 basis point change is the
methodology that many funds currently use to calculate these risk measures at the position level
for internal risk monitoring and would provide sufficient information to assist the Commission in
analyzing fund exposures to changes in interest rate or credit spreads.149 We requested comment
on whether we should require or permit funds to report a larger change in interest rates or credit
spreads, such as 5 or 25 basis points.
Additionally, while we did not propose requiring convexity, the Commission also
considered and requested comment on whether funds should be required to report convexity,
which facilitates more precise measurement of the change in a bond price with larger changes in
interest rates because this measure captures changes in the shape of the yield curve.150
Commenters suggested that we adopt risk metrics that would provide a better measure of
risk over time than just DV01.151 For example, one commenter, noting that, while DV01 and
SDV01 are typically used as daily risk measures, larger shifts in the curve, such as DV25 or
149

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33600. See also Morningstar Comment Letter (“The use
of a bottom-up approach and the limited movement of 1 basis point are likely to provide
standardization.”).

150

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33600. More specifically, convexity measures the nonlinearities in a bond’s price with respect to changes in interest rates. See Frank J. Fabozzi, THE
HANDBOOK OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES (8th ed., 2012) at 149–152.

151

See Morningstar Comment Letter; see also Interactive Data Comment Letter (noting that fund
managers often consider moves greater than 1 basis point when managing interest rate risks in their
portfolios, particularly for funds with exposure to bonds with call or prepayment risk.).

55

DV50, may be appropriate for measures with a significant lag, such as reporting on Form NPORT.152
We also received several comment letters recommending that we include a measure of
convexity as it is a valuable method of measuring the change of the shifting yield curve, as well
as a comment to require stress tests of the portfolio of small and large changes in spreads,
interest rates, and volatility.153 We agree with commenters that a measurement that captures
larger changes in the yield curve will be useful. We additionally agree with commenters that
argued that a measure for changes in the shape of the yield curve such as convexity would be
useful, but are sensitive to the burdens that requiring a measurement of convexity may impose on
filers that do not currently calculate convexity internally.
Accordingly we believe that requiring a risk measure that shows the effect of a larger
change in interest rates, coupled with DV01 as we proposed, both provides information that
commenters said would be useful (i.e., how the exposure changes with different changes in
interest rate), while not requiring filers that do not calculate convexity internally to begin to do
so. We are therefore adopting a requirement that funds provide both DV01154 (a one basis point
change in interest rate) and DV100 (a 100 basis point change in interest rates).155 Based on staff
experience, we believe that DV100 is among the most common measures of interest rate
sensitivity and it will, in conjunction with DV01, provide more useful information about non152

See Morningstar Comment Letter (also noting that DV01 and SDV01 are less likely to be subject to
model risk).

Interactive Data Comment Letter (“portfolio managers consider convexity to be critical when
measuring the interest rate risk of their funds”); Dreyfus Comment Letter (“Convexity is valuable as a
risk measure because it captures the change in the curvature (the ‘flattening’ or ‘steepening’) of the
shifting yield curve.”).

parallel shifts in the yield curve than smaller measures, such as DV25 and DV50. Moreover,
DV100 will allow the staff to capture larger changes to interest rates (and corresponding
“shocks” to the markets) than DV25 and DV50. Finally, based on staff experience, it is our
belief that DV100 is a standard measure of interest rate sensitivity and is a common measure of
duration and is therefore unlikely to require filers to change current internal measurement
practices, thereby mitigating the increase in reporting costs relative to the proposal.
We also proposed to require that funds provide a measure of spread duration (commonly
known as SDV01) at the portfolio level for each of the same maturities listed above, aggregated
by non-investment grade and investment grade exposures.156 This would measure the fund’s
sensitivity to changes in credit spreads (i.e., a measure of spread above the risk-free interest rate).
Again, similar to the example above regarding the potential use of the DV01 metric, SDV01 can
provide more precise information regarding funds’ exposures to credit spreads when they engage
in a strategy investing in investment-grade or non-investment grade debt.
One commenter stated that spread duration is a more representative measure of bond fund
portfolio risk than duration alone because it “captures both interest rate risk and credit risk” and
that staff should therefore use spread duration when analyzing funds.157 However, that
commenter and others recommended that we require funds to report a single spread duration for
the portfolio, as spread rates are generally calculated as a parallel shift, making calculations at

As proposed, Form N-PORT would have included instructions stating that “Investment Grade” refers
to an investment that is sufficiently liquid that it can be sold at or near its carrying value within a
reasonably short period of time and is subject to no greater than moderate credit risk, and “NonInvestment Grade” refers to an investment that is not Investment Grade. See proposed General
Instruction E of Form N-PORT. As discussed above in section II.A.2.a, we received comments
relating to our proposed definition of “Investment Grade”. For the reasons discussed above, we have
determined to remove these definitions from the Form.

key rates less useful than they are for analyzing shifts in interest rates.158 Because credit spreads
can vary based on the maturity of the bonds, we continue to believe that providing credit spread
measures for the key rates along the yield curve, as with DV01, will help the Commission and its
staff better analyze credit spreads of investments in funds than a single measure for the entire
portfolio. For example, this data could be helpful for analyzing shifts in credit spreads for noninvestment grade and investment grade debt, respectively, over the yield curve, as credit spreads
for investment grade and non-investment grade debt do not always shift in parallel or in lock
step, particularly during times of market stress.159
For the same reasons discussed above for interest rate risk, however, we are limiting the
required key rates for credit spread risk to 3-month, 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year.160
Commenters also suggested either only requiring spread duration (as opposed to both credit and
spread duration) or further refining the measure of credit spreads, for example, by breaking out
government related spreads from other investment-grade spreads.161 However, we continue to
believe that our current measure of spread risk provides adequate information to the staff,
investors, and other potential users to better understand industry and fund credit spreads, and the

158

See supra footnotes134-137; see, e.g., Wells Fargo Comment Letter (noting that, unlike interest rate
spreads, credit spreads are not typically calculated at all key rates); Fidelity Comment Letter (“A
single CR01 without reference to maturity is a standard risk metric and should be familiar to market
participants.”); Dreyfus Comment Letter (recommending a single measure for spread duration); ICI
Comment Letter (same).

159

The delineation between non-investment grade and investment grade debt is similar to information
regarding private fund exposures gathered on Form PF, which could be helpful for comparing and
analyzing credit spreads between public and private funds. See, e.g., Item 26 of Form PF.

160

See Item B.3.c of Form N-PORT.

161

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (Suggesting breaking out government-related credit spreads from
other investment-grade credit spreads because it would be more useful for monitoring fund credit
risk); Dreyfus Comment Letter (“Spread duration is a more important measure of overall bond fund
portfolio risk than duration alone because it captures both interest rate risk and credit risk.”).

risk associated with credit spreads, while appropriately balancing the costs of calculating such
measures. We are therefore adopting the credit spread risk as proposed, subject to the previously
discussed key rate refinements discussed above.162
We also proposed to include an instruction to Item B.3 to assist funds with calculating the
threshold and to allow better comparability among funds. One commenter recommended that
our proposed calculation for the threshold, which the proposal defined as “notional value,”
include the “contract value of each futures contract for which the underlying reference asset or
assets are debt securities or an interest rate.”163 The commenter noted that funds may use fixed
income futures for similar purposes as fixed income swaps, for example, to adjust duration, and
including futures in the calculation would give the Commission more accurate reporting and is
consistent with how the industry typically does these types of calculations.164 We agree and are
modifying our instructions to require that funds include futures in the calculation of notional
value.165
Another commenter noted that non-investment grade portfolios often hold “equity-like
securities,” such as convertible bonds and preferred stocks.166 The commenter argued that DV01
is not appropriate for these types of portfolios and requested that Form N-PORT clarify how

165

We have also decided to make a clarifying change by using the term “value” as opposed to the
proposal’s “notional value.” We believe that this could reduce confusion in the reporting of these
measures. Since our proposed calculation of “notional value” requires the sum of “absolute” values,
which may be different than how funds currently define “notional value,” we are changing the
instructions from requiring notional value to requiring “value,” which is defined to include the
notional value of certain derivatives instruments. See Instruction to Item B.3 of Form N-PORT.
Moreover, this is consistent with Form PF which describes “value” in General Instruction 15. See
General Instruction 15 of Form PF.

funds should calculate interest-rates in such situations.167 Other commenters suggested that we
further refine our proposed methodology by providing more details relating to the relevant
interest rate and credit spread calculations such as whether the credit spread to be shifted is the
nominal or option adjusted spread (OAS).168 In determining the proposed methodology for the
measures of duration and spread duration, staff engaged in outreach to asset managers and risk
service providers that provide risk management and other services to asset managers and
institutional investors. The proposed methodology was based on staff experience in using
duration and spread duration, as well as this outreach to better understand common fund
practices for calculating such measures.
While the Commission continues to believe that the methodologies for reporting duration
and spread duration will allow for better comparability across funds, as discussed above, we are
adopting a new instruction to Form N-PORT, subject to the specific instruction in Item B.3 to
calculate value, that funds may use their own internal methodologies and the conventions of their
service providers, which should help minimize reporting burdens.169 As in Form PF, we believe
that this approach strikes an appropriate balance between easing the burdens on funds by
allowing them to rely on their existing practices while still providing the Commission’s staff

See, e.g., Interactive Data Comment Letter (Clarify whether interest rate shifts should be applied to a

excluding certain issues, such as US treasuries; clarify whether the credit spread to be shifted is the
nominal or option adjusted spread (OAS) and recommending OAS.); State Street Comment Letter
(requesting clarity whether the Commission wants notional value versus delta adjusted or duration
equivalent value, but also suggesting that the SEC should not be too prescriptive and give managers
discretion within guidelines, so long as they can validate and justify their approach.).

with comparable data across the industry.170 However, we agree with the commenter that
requested that we clarify whether the shift is the nominal or option-adjusted spread. We believe
that measuring credit risk by shifting option adjusted spread provides a more robust measure of
credit risk for investments with embedded optionality because it captures how embedded options
alter the payment obligations of counterparties.171 Thus measuring credit risk by shifting the
option adjusted spread will allow the Commission and other interested parties to more accurately
monitor this effect. We are therefore adding one clarification to Item B.3.c., Credit Spread Risk,
to clarify that funds should provide the change in value of the portfolio from a 1 basis point
change in credit spreads where the shift is applied to the option adjusted spread.172
While we proposed that funds provide a calculation of each of these measures at a
portfolio level, we also considered whether to require, and requested comment on the alternative
that, instead, funds report these risk metrics for each debt instrument or derivative that has an
interest rate or credit exposure.173 We had asked what the benefits would be to having more
precise data for analysis of various movements in interest rates and credit spreads.
Several commenters supported reporting at the portfolio-level rather than at the positionlevel.174 One commenter suggested that, rather than report risk measures at the portfolio-level,

170

See Form PF Adopting Release, supra footnote 80, at n. 187 and accompanying text Based on staff
experience, we believe that we will still find the data useful even when funds use different
methodologies, despite the fact that varying methodologies could reduce the comparability of data
across funds because this data will still provide information that can be compared to a fund’s previous
filings, as well as a baseline measurement for the industry that can be monitored for changes from one
month to the next.

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter I (supporting the Commission’s proposal to require funds to

funds should report risk exposures at the position-level, as this is current industry practice and
would therefore not be burdensome.175 Other commenters generally noted that providing
position specific details would better enable investors and service providers to calculate risk,
without relying on the reporting fund’s models or assumptions.176 Finally, another commenter
recommended that the Commission, with respect to derivatives, focus on metrics based on a
portfolio-level analysis, as such an analysis would more accurately reflect a fund’s use of, and
net exposure to, derivatives.177
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we believe that most funds likely calculate these
risk metrics at a position-level. However, we recognize that even if such calculations are
available at a position-level, reporting these metrics could cause funds to make additional
systems changes to collect such position-level data for reporting, as well as potential burdens
related to increased review time and quality control in submitting the reports. Therefore, on
balance, we continue to believe that requiring funds to provide this information for each maturity
at the portfolio level would provide a sufficient level of granularity for purposes of Commission
staff analysis. We also believe that there are certain efficiencies for the Commission, its staff,
investors, and other potential users to having funds report the portfolio-level calculations relative
to reporting position-level calculations, as this could allow for more timely and efficient analysis

made public); Wells Fargo Comment letter (supporting the Commission’s request for duration and
spread duration, but suggesting that the calculation for providing risk metrics be defined differently).

alternatives, including requiring funds to report aggregate risk metrics at the asset class level and

of the data by not requiring users of the information to calculate the portfolio-level measures
from the position-level measures.178
In order to allow better comparability among funds, some commenters recommended that
the Commission omit risk metrics in favor of more data on the specific investments, stating that
raw data would allow the staff, investors, and other potential users to perform their own risk
calculations. 179 According to the commenters, providing position specific details would better
enable investors and service providers to calculate risk, without relying on the reporting fund’s
models or assumptions.180 While we agree that reporting raw data on specific investments would
provide users of the data with more flexibility in calculating risk, we do not believe that the
benefits of reporting this information sufficiently justify the burdens of requiring funds to report
substantially more detailed information on Form N-PORT at this time. Moreover, as discussed
above, we believe that requiring funds to report the portfolio-level risk measures required on
Form N-PORT, as well as delta for options, warrants, and convertible securities, which is
discussed further below in section II.A.2.g.iv, provides the Commission, investors, and other
potential users with a sufficient level of granularity for purposes of analysis at this time.

178

Commenters also requested that we clarify that the fixed income exposure as calculated by a top tier
in a fund-of-fund investment structure would not include the top tier fund’s exposure to the
underlying fund’s exposure to debt. See ICI Comment Letter; MFS Comment Letter. Since Item B.3
requires aggregated portfolio-level risk metrics, we generally would not expect funds to look through
to the underlying funds’ holdings. Rather, funds only will need to look to the top level fund
investments in calculating their exposure to risk measures.

179

See, e.g., Vanguard Comment Letter; Morningstar Comment Letter (“Rather than collecting model
assumptions or additional standardization of the calculations, we believe providing additional detail
with position information, specifically for bespoke derivatives and syndicated loans, will enable
investors and service providers to independently calculate risk measures based on a model of the
investor’s choice.”).

63

Finally, commenters requested that we collect alternative risk metrics, such as the same
interest rate and credit risk questions as are required by Form PF in order to improve the
interoperability of the data collected for private funds and registered investment companies.181
However, while some of our Form N-PORT risk metric disclosures are based on Form PF, for
the reasons stated above, the position-level information that we will receive in reports on Form
N-PORT make more detailed reporting unnecessary for registered funds.182 Another commenter
suggested that we focus on alternative portfolio-level risk metrics, such as Value at Risk
(“VaR”).183 Based on staff experience, for purposes of monitoring a fund’s sensitivity to
changes in interest rates and credits spreads , we believe that requiring funds to calculate
duration and spread duration along key rates will provide the Commission with more sensitive
information than would be provided by an overall portfolio-level risk metric such as VaR.
Accordingly, we are not adopting these suggested alternative risk metrics.

Securities Lending

To increase the rate of return on their portfolios, some funds engage in securities lending
activities whereby a fund lends certain of its portfolio securities to other financial institutions
such as broker-dealers. To protect the fund from the risk of borrower default (i.e., the borrower
181

See, e.g., BlackRock Comment Letter (Commission should use the same interest rate and credit risk
questions as is required in Item 42 of Form PF; Commission should consider implementing a
reporting requirement to obtain a comprehensive measure of fund’s use of leverage); Simpson
Thacher Comment Letter. Item 42 of Form PF requires an adviser to report the impact on the fund’s
portfolio from specified changes to certain identified market factors, if regularly considered in formal
testing in the fund’s risk management, broken down by the long and short components of the
qualifying fund’s portfolio. See Item 42 of Form PF; see also Form PF Adopting Release, supra
footnote 80, at nn. 270-272 and accompanying text.

182

Unlike with Form PF, which does not require position-level reporting, with Form N-PORT the staff
will be able to calculate alternative risk measures using the detailed position-level information
provided in reports on Form N-PORT.

metrics, such as “value-at-risk” models).

failing to return the borrowed security or returning it late), the borrower posts collateral with the
fund in an amount at least equal to the value of the borrowed securities, and this amount of
collateral is adjusted daily as the value of the borrowed securities is marked to market.184 Funds
generally demand cash as collateral. A fund will typically invest cash collateral that it receives
in short-term, highly liquid instruments, such as money market funds or similar pooled
investment vehicles, or directly in money market instruments.
A fund’s income from these activities may come from fees paid by the borrowers to the
fund and/or from the reinvestment of collateral. 185 Many funds engage an external service
provider—commonly called a “securities lending agent”—to administer the securities lending
program. The securities lending agent is typically compensated by being paid a share of the
fund’s securities lending revenue after the borrower has been paid any rebate owed to it.186
Securities lending may implicate certain provisions of the Investment Company Act, and
funds that engage in securities lending do so in reliance on Commission staff no-action letters,
and in some circumstances, exemptive orders.187 Funds that rely on these letters and orders are

185

If a security is not in high demand, a lender typically pays the borrower a cash collateral fee,
commonly called a “rebate.” The rebate is negotiated and can be negative (i.e., a fee paid from the
borrower to the lender) when demand for the loan of a particular security is especially great or its
supply especially constrained. See Master Securities Loan Agreement, supra footnote 184, at §5
(Fees for Loan).

186

See Securities Lending Summary, supra footnote 184.

187

For example, the transfer of a fund’s portfolio securities to a borrower implicates section 17(f) of the
Investment Company Act, which generally requires that a fund’s portfolio securities be held by an
eligible custodian. A fund’s obligation to return collateral at the termination of a loan implicates

65

subject to conditions on a number of aspects of their securities lending activities, including loan
collateralization and termination, fees and compensation, board approval and oversight, and
voting of proxies.
Currently, the information that funds are required to report about securities lending
activity, whether in a structured format or otherwise, is limited. For example, funds disclose on
Form N-SAR whether they are permitted under their investment policies to, and whether they did
engage during the reporting period in, securities lending activities.188 Funds generally also
disclose additional information regarding their securities lending programs in their registration
statements.189 In addition, consistent with current industry practices, many funds identify
particular securities that are on loan in their schedules of portfolio investments prepared pursuant
to Regulation S-X. These disclosures do not address other pertinent considerations, such as the
extent to which a fund lends its portfolio securities, the borrower to which the fund is exposed,
the fees and revenues associated with those activities, and the significance of securities lending
revenue to the investment performance of the fund.
As proposed, to address these data gaps and provide additional information to the
Commission, investors, and other potential users regarding a fund’s securities lending activities,
we are requiring funds to report certain borrower information and position-level information

section 18 of the Investment Company Act, which governs the extent to which a fund may incur
indebtedness. See id.

contracts) of Form N-1A.

monthly on Form N-PORT.190 Also, as to other securities lending information for which annual
reporting would be sufficient because it is unlikely to change on a frequent basis (e.g., name and
other identifying information for a fund’s securities lending agent), funds will report such
information annually on Form N-CEN, as proposed and as discussed below in section II.D. In
addition, as discussed below in section II.C.6, we have made a modification from the proposal to
require certain information about the income from and fees paid in connection with securities
lending activities, and the monthly average of the value of portfolio securities on loan, be
disclosed as part of the fund’s Statement of Additional Information (or, for closed-end funds,
reports on Form N-CSR) or in Form N-CEN, instead of a fund’s financial statements as we had
originally proposed.191
The new reporting requirements we are adopting are intended, in part, to increase the
transparency of information available related to the lending of securities by funds as a subset of
the universe of market participants engaged in securities lending activities.192 Commenters were

See infra text following footnote 195 (discussing the reporting of counterparty information); section
II.A.2.g (discussing the proposed requirements regarding position-level information). Commenters to
the FSOC Notice also suggested that enhanced securities lending disclosures could be beneficial to
investors and counterparties. See, e.g., SIFMA/IAA FSOC Notice Comment Letter (“Disclosures
related to securities lending practices, if appropriately tailored, could potentially assist investors and
counterparties in making informed choices about where they deploy their assets and how they engage
in lending practices.”); Comment Letter of the Vanguard Group, Inc. to FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015)
(“Vanguard FSOC Notice Comment Letter”) (asserting that securities lending as a whole suffers from
a lack of readily available data, and supporting further efforts to gather data and study the practice of
securities lending).

See infra footnotes 724-725 and accompanying text (discussing new required disclosures in funds’

associated with, securities lending activities) and 1224-1225 and accompanying text (discussing new

67

generally supportive of increased reporting about securities lending activities, although they
suggested modifications to certain aspects of the proposal and expressed concerns with some of
the specific proposed reporting.193 These comments, and the modifications we are making in
response to comments, are discussed in more detail below.
Borrower Information.194 One risk that funds engaging in securities lending are exposed
to is counterparty risk because borrowers could fail to return the loaned securities. In this event,
the lender would keep the collateral. In the U.S., cash collateral is more typical than non-cash
collateral and loans are often over-collateralized. The collateral requirements thereby mitigate
the extent of a fund’s counterparty risk. This risk is further mitigated for the fund if the fund’s
securities lending agent indemnifies the fund against default by the borrower.
As we explained in the Proposing Release, while we believe there is value to having
information on borrowers of fund securities to monitor risk, as well as information with which to
evaluate compliance with conditions set forth in staff no-action letters and exemptive orders,195
we proposed to require that funds report the full name and LEI (if any) of each borrower, as well
as the aggregate value of all securities on loan to the particular borrower, rather than at the loan
level.196 We believe that reporting of borrower information at an aggregate portfolio level will

See, e.g., infra footnotes 199–201 and accompanying and following text (recommending that the
collection of securities lending information should be limited to the top 5 or 10 securities lending
borrowers with the greatest exposure) and footnotes 205–208 and accompanying and following text
(suggestions regarding how to report non-cash collateral posted by securities lending borrowers).

194

In the Proposing Release, we referred to “securities lending counterparties,” but have made a
clarifying change to “securities lending borrowers” in the form. As discussed above, when funds are
engaged in securities lending transactions, they are securities lenders because they lend their portfolio
securities to other financial institutions, such as broker-dealers, who are securities borrowers. The
change in terminology is not intended to alter the substance of reporting from what we proposed.

provide the Commission, investors, and other potential users with information to better
understand the level of potential counterparty risk assumed as part of the fund’s securities
lending program, with a lower relative burden on funds than requesting such information on a
per loan level.
Commenters generally supported our proposal to increase reporting relating to securities
lending borrowers, although one commenter questioned the usefulness of borrower information
given that securities lending agreements are generally indemnified by securities lending
agents.197 Most commenters also specifically supported our approach of assessing the
counterparty risk of securities lending transactions on an aggregate basis for each borrower, as
opposed to a loan-by-loan or security-by-security basis.198
However, many commenters recommended limiting the collection of securities lending
information to the top 5 or 10 securities lending borrowers presenting the greatest exposure.199
These commenters argued that the top 5 securities lending borrowers generally represent the
majority of a fund’s securities lending exposure and that further disclosure would impose
unnecessary costs on funds and shareholders to the extent it would be capturing borrowers to
197

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Independent Directors of the BlackRock Equity-Liquidity Funds (Oct. 2,
2015) (“Blackrock Directors Comment Letter”) (supporting this aspect of our proposal); BlackRock

Association (Aug. 11, 2015) (“RMA Comment Letter”) (same); SIFMA Comment Letter I (same);
Comment Letter of CFA Institute (Aug. 10, 2015) (“CFA Comment Letter”) (same). But see MFS
Comment Letter (arguing that disclosure of borrower information may not be relevant in
understanding a fund’s counterparty exposure, because if the fund has been indemnified then the
counterparty exposure rests with the lending agent).

See, e.g., BlackRock Comment Letter; Morningstar Comment Letter.

199

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (limit to the top 5 securities lending borrowers); RMA Comment Letter
(top 5 or 10 borrowers); Fidelity Comment Letter (top 5 borrowers; broader securities lending
disclosures would not provide a meaningful indicator of risk in securities lending because security
loans are fully collateralized and also funds may be indemnified by lending agents); State Street
Comment Letter (top 5 or ten borrowers). But see Morningstar Comment Letter (applauding the
Commission’s proposal to require counterparty information for all securities lending borrowers).

69

which the fund does not have material exposure.200 Likewise, several commenters suggested that
borrower information for securities lending transactions should only be reported by funds whose
securities lending exposure exceeded a certain minimum threshold.201
We continue to believe that funds that engage in securities lending should be required to
report information for all of its securities lending borrowers. In response to commenters’
observations that many funds are indemnified for their securities lending transactions, we note
that not all funds are so indemnified. Separately, we believe that information on borrowers is
useful even if there is an indemnification by the agent. For example, such information is helpful
in generally monitoring the degree to which funds are involved in securities lending transactions
and the identities of borrowers engaged in such transactions. Allowing funds to exclude certain
borrower information would limit the applicability and completeness of the information reported
on Form N-PORT regarding counterparty risk, both to an individual fund and to the fund
industry. We are not persuaded by commenters’ arguments that reporting of all borrowers would
be unduly burdensome or costly, as we believe funds would need to collect this information both
to understand its own counterparty risk and for its own oversight of securities lending. For these
reasons, we are requiring funds to report aggregate borrower exposure for all securities lending
borrowers, as proposed.
Several commenters also suggested that borrower information for securities lending
information should be nonpublic. In particular, these commenters expressed concerns that
200

See, e.g., Invesco Comment Letter (the top 5 securities lending borrowers generally represent 68% of
a fund’s securities lending exposure); ICI Comment Letter (additional disclosures beyond the top 5
borrowers would impose unnecessary costs on funds and shareholders).

201

See Wells Fargo Comment Letter (portfolio level reporting of aggregate securities lending activity
should only be required for funds with a minimum threshold of 10% of assets on loan); Oppenheimer
Comment Letter (funds should report only the top 5 borrowers and not disclose anything if
outstanding securities loans do not exceed 1% of net assets).

70

securities lending counterparties (i.e., borrowers) may wish to avoid having details of their
exposures being made public, including to competitors.202 We are not persuaded by these
arguments. First, we note that the new reporting requirements we are adopting today are
intended, in part, to increase the transparency of information available related to the lending and
borrowing of securities.203 Making borrower information for the securities lending information
reported on Form N-PORT nonpublic would defeat this objective.
Second, based on our experience with securities lending, we are not persuaded by
commenters claiming that a fund’s activities in securities lending would be harmed because
certain securities borrowers do not want to be identified. We note that we are not requiring
identification of securities borrowers by loan, but rather on an aggregated basis. We also note
that certain funds currently publicly identify securities lending borrowers twice per year in the
notes to their annual and semi-annual financial statements, as permitted by GAAP.204 We are
unaware of any evidence that these disclosures have had any effects on borrowers’ decisions to
borrow from registered investment companies in the manner those commenters suggest, and thus
we continue to believe that requiring funds to make such information publicly available is
appropriate because these disclosures will improve transparency to investors and other users.
As discussed in greater detail below, we also received various suggestions regarding how
to report non-cash collateral posted by securities lending borrowers.205 One commenter pointed
out that funds typically do not account for non-cash collateral as a fund asset because funds
generally do not “control” the non-cash collateral and thus do not bear any investment risk for

it.206 For this reason, the commenter asserted that it would be inconsistent with accounting and
reporting standards for funds to report non-cash collateral received for loaned securities as
portfolio investments on Form N-PORT, as we proposed.207 We agree with the commenter and
are modifying Form N-PORT from the proposal to add a new Item requiring funds to report the
aggregate principal amount and aggregate value of each type of non-cash collateral received for
loaned securities that is not treated as a fund asset.208
Several commenters also requested that Form N-PORT collect additional information
regarding securities lending activities. One commenter recommended that funds report average
monthly aggregate dollar amounts on loan and fee split information, as well as a brief summary
of the fund’s securities lending program, including risk and strategy.209 Another commenter
suggested that the aggregate value of securities lent should be accompanied by the aggregate
value of collateral pledged.210 One commenter requested that funds report the average daily
value of securities lending collateral over the reporting period, rather than a snapshot as of the
last day of the reporting period, and asserted that securities lending collateral can be used as a
proxy for the percentage of the portfolio that is on loan, which is the true quantity of interest.211

represents the collateral, selected from among the following (asset-backed securities; agency
collateralized mortgage obligations; agency debentures and agency strips; agency mortgage-backed
securities; U.S. Treasuries (including strips); other instrument). If “other instrument,” funds will also

We are not adopting such additional reporting requirements on Form N-PORT. As
discussed further below, the amendments to the Statement of Additional Information (and, for
closed-end funds, Form N-CSR) that we are adopting today will require funds to make certain
disclosures in connection with their securities lending activities and cash collateral management,
and Form N-CEN also requires information about a fund’s securities lending program, including
the average monthly value of securities on loan. Although the additional information requested
by commenters may be useful to certain investors or other users, we are sensitive to the burdens
on funds of additional reporting requirements. Some of the information requested by
commenters, such as a brief summary of the fund’s securities lending program, including risk
and strategy, is already disclosed in fund registration statements.212 Certain other information
requested by commenters, such as the aggregate value of securities lent and the aggregate value
of collateral pledged, can be calculated by adding up the structured information reported for each
individual securities lending transaction.213 Furthermore, other information requested by
commenters, such as the percentage of the portfolio securities on loan over the reporting period,
can be derived from information that will be reported in a structured format as part of this
rulemaking.214 Although we understand that requiring funds to report additional information
may be useful to certain users of such information, Form N-PORT is primarily designed to meet
the data needs of the Commission and its staff. As such, the securities lending information we
are requiring to be reported on Form N-PORT is designed to balance what we anticipate would

be useful for our regulatory oversight purposes, namely obtaining more information specifically
regarding counterparties, amounts on loan, and how collateral is reinvested, against the expected
burdens of reporting such information. Accordingly, we decline to modify Form N-PORT to
require the additional securities lending disclosures requested by commenters.
We also received several comments requesting that we revise Form N-PORT to phase in
reporting of securities lending borrowers’ LEIs. Commenters urged that this requirement be
delayed until LEIs have been fully integrated into the global financial system and lending agents
and funds have implemented the necessary systems enhancements to facilitate LEI reporting.215
Commenters also expressed concerns that reporting LEI information for securities lending
counterparties (i.e., borrowers) may cause borrowers to become less likely to borrow from
registered funds and more likely to borrow from lenders who are not required to make similar
disclosures, in order to avoid having details of the borrowers’ exposures being made public.216
For the same reasons discussed above regarding commenters’ suggestions not to require
disclosure of securities borrowers, we are not persuaded by such arguments. While the
Commission is the primary user of the form, the new reporting requirements we are adopting
today are intended, in part, to increase the transparency of information available related to the
lending and borrowing of securities.217 In particular, the uniform public reporting of borrowers’
LEIs will facilitate the identification of such borrowers, which is part of the purpose of such
reporting. As discussed above, providing exemptions or deferring implementation of this
requirement would hinder the ability of Commission staff as well as investors and other potential

74

users of this information to use the data on Form N-PORT as discussed above.218 Furthermore,
as indicated above, Form N-PORT instructs funds to report LEIs “if any” for borrowers, and thus
already acknowledges and makes accommodations for the fact that LEI identifiers may not be
available in some contexts as LEIs are continuing to be integrated into the global financial
system.
e.

Return Information

As proposed, we are requiring funds to provide monthly total returns for each of the
preceding three months.219 If the fund is a multiple class fund, it will report returns for each
class.220 Funds with multiple classes will also report their class identification numbers.221 Funds
will calculate returns using the same standardized formulas required for calculation of returns as
reported in the performance table contained in the risk-return summary of the fund’s prospectus
and in fund sales materials.222
We are requiring this information on Form N-PORT because we believe it will be useful
to have such information in a structured format to facilitate comparisons across funds. For
example, analysis of return information over time among similar funds could reveal outliers that
might merit further inquiry by Commission staff, and this type of analysis can be done much
more efficiently and timely when the information is reported in a structured format.
Additionally, performance that appears to be inconsistent with a fund’s investment strategy or

Return information reported on Form N-PORT will reflect swing pricing for funds that elect to swing
price pursuant to the contemporaneous release we are adopting today regarding swing pricing for
open-end funds. See Swing Pricing Adopting Release, supra footnote 9., at section II.A.3.g.

75

other benchmarks can form a basis for further inquiry and monitoring.223 Although mutual funds
currently report certain return information in a structured format periodically as part of their
risk/return summaries, we believe that having return information reported on a monthly basis by
all registered funds will allow the Commission staff to more easily and effectively monitor the
fund industry as a whole, as described above.224
Because only quarter-end reports on Form N-PORT will be made public, we are
requiring, as proposed, that funds provide return information for each of the preceding three
months.225 This rolling three month requirement will provide investors and other potential users
with monthly return information, so that they will have access to each month’s return on a
quarterly basis. Otherwise, we are concerned that investors might potentially confuse the
month’s disclosed return as representing the return for the full quarter.
Commenters had mixed reactions regarding the reporting of monthly total returns.
Several commenters expressed concern that reporting three months of returns could cause

See Item B.5.a of Form N-PORT. Although generally only information reported on Form N-PORT
for the third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter will be publicly available, the concerns associated
with more frequent public disclosure are related to the disclosure of portfolio holdings information
and will not apply to the disclosure of fund return information. See generally footnote 1305 and
accompanying and following text (discussing the risks of predatory trading practices such as frontrunning and the ability of non- investors to reverse engineer and copycat fund’s investment
strategies).

76

investors to unduly focus on short-term results and recommended that returns for longer periods
of time be reported instead.226 One commenter recommended that funds should report only a
single month of returns in order to lower compliance costs and because investors are likely to use
other sources (such as fund or third-party websites) to find return information rather than Form
N-PORT.227 Another commenter agreed with our proposed approach of requiring funds to report
total returns as opposed to gross returns, noted that monthly fund performance data is already
generally publicly available, and concluded that the quarterly public release of monthly
performance data reported on Form N-PORT would result in the release of information that had
already been made available to the public.228
We are adopting this requirement as proposed. As acknowledged by commenters, many
funds and market data providers already generally disclose monthly performance data to
investors, and daily performance data is often available as well.229 The greater granularity
provided by monthly data will enhance the ability of Commission staff to use return information
to reveal outliers and detect performance that appears to be inconsistent with a fund’s investment
strategy or other benchmarks, as discussed above. More generally, frequent disclosure of

results and therefore should not be publicly reported or, in the alternative, should be reported together

performance can mislead investors); SIFMA Comment Letter I (monthly return information should
not be made public or, in the alternative, should be disclosed annually on Form N-CEN).

Letter”).

the industry’s data, is generally made available on investor-facing websites by the third business day

performance data over shorter time periods can better capture variations in performance that
would not be apparent with returns reported over longer time periods.
Accordingly, we are not persuaded by commenters’ recommendations to require funds to
report return information on Form N-PORT over longer time horizons, as opposed to on a
monthly basis. We are similarly not persuaded by arguments that reporting fund performance
data for three months will “[provide no] direct or indirect value to [fund] investors” as opposed
to reporting one month of fund performance information.230 As discussed above, although Form
N-PORT is primarily designed to assist the Commission and its staff, we believe that investors
and other potential users may benefit from the information reported on Form N-PORT as well,
either by analyzing Form N-PORT directly or through analyses prepared by third-party service
providers. Because Form N-PORT will be available on a quarterly basis but will provide monthend return information, we remain concerned that investors might potentially confuse one
month’s returns as representing the fund’s returns for the full quarter. For each of these reasons,
we are requiring funds to report monthly return information for each of the preceding three
months, as proposed.
We are also requiring, substantially as proposed, that funds report, for each of the
preceding three months, monthly net realized gain (or loss) and net change in unrealized
appreciation (or depreciation) attributable to derivatives for certain categories. We proposed that
this information would be reported by asset category (i.e., commodity contracts, credit contracts,
equity contracts, etc.). We are modifying the proposal to require funds to report this information
by both asset category and also by type of derivative instrument (i.e., forward, future, option,

230

See Confluence Comment Letter.

78

swap, etc.).231 This information will help the Commission staff, investors, and other potential
users better understand how a fund is using derivatives in accomplishing its investment strategy
and the impact of derivatives on the fund’s returns. In order to provide a point of comparison,
and as proposed, we are also requiring that funds report, for each of the last three months,
monthly net realized gain (or loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (or depreciation) for
investments other than derivatives.232
Comments on this aspect of the proposal were mixed. Some commenters opposed the
reporting requirement, stating that it would not provide a valuable reference point from which to
assess whether the derivatives included in a fund’s portfolio have contributed to returns,
especially when derivatives are used for hedging purposes.233 One commenter expressed general
support for the derivatives reporting requirements in N-PORT, including this proposed
requirement, stating that this information would, among other things, allow the Commission to
better assess trends, given the potential risks associated with certain uses of derivatives.234
Several commenters, in response to a request for comment, recommended that the
Commission require funds to report the monthly net realized gain (or loss) and net change in
unrealized appreciation (or depreciation) attributable to derivatives by type of derivative
instrument (i.e., forward, future, option, swap, etc.), rather than by asset category (i.e.,
commodity contracts, credit contracts, equity contracts, etc.). This is because funds typically
report derivatives in their financial statements by type of derivative instrument rather than asset

79

category. As a result, according to commenters, systems are currently aligned to capture and
report this information by instrument type, whereas reporting information by asset category
would require large changes to the existing accounting systems, which these commenters
believed would involve costs that would not be justified by the resulting benefits.235

Finally,

some commenters believed that gains (or losses) and appreciation (or depreciation) attributable
to derivatives should not be made public because such information would not be meaningful to
investors and could potentially convey proprietary information about the fund’s trading strategies
that could be used for predatory trading or to reverse engineer the fund’s investment strategy.236
We disagree with commenters questioning the utility of reporting gains (or losses) and
appreciation (or depreciation) attributable to derivatives. We continue to believe that this
information will help Commission staff, investors, and other potential users better understand
how a fund is using derivatives in accomplishing its investment strategy and the impact of
derivatives on the fund’s returns. We recognize that providing this information by asset category
is not how funds currently maintain this data in their systems and therefore will involve more
systems changes and costs relative to providing this information by type of derivative instrument
alone; however, we disagree that such information does not have a benefit that justifies this
burden. Providing this information by asset category will be helpful in understanding the
relationship between derivatives – and, as discussed further below, the types of derivative
instruments – that provide exposure to a particular asset category and direct investments in the
same asset category. For example, information attributable to equity derivatives contracts could
be compared to returns attributable to direct investments in equities. Further, reporting returns

235

See SIFMA Comment Letter I; ICI Comment Letter; MFA Comment Letter.

236

See SIFMA Comment Letter I; MFA Comment Letter.

80

by derivative instrument alone would not provide any information about the market risk factors
that had caused the gain or loss.
Although we recognize that there will be some initial burden in modifying systems to
provide information by asset category, we note that funds are currently already required to
compile this information by asset category twice a year, pursuant to FASB Topic ASC 815.237
While we understand from the comments that many funds currently compile this manually, we
believe, based on staff experience, that such processes could be automated over time to facilitate
the more frequent reporting. In particular, we note that Form N-PORT, as proposed and adopted,
will separately require funds to categorize each derivative investment by asset category, which
should reduce the incremental burden of providing return information by asset category.238
Additionally, after consideration of the comments, we are modifying this item from the
proposal to require funds to report this information by type of derivative instrument within each
asset category. We believe that providing both elements – asset category and derivative
instrument type – will make this information more informative than by reporting by either asset
category or instrument type in isolation. For example, consider a fund that uses derivatives in
two asset categories (e.g., equities and commodities) and two types of derivative instruments
(e.g., futures and options). If the asset category or instrument type were reported alone, users of
the information would be unable to discern if the fund is deriving its returns by using equity
options and commodity futures or equity futures and commodity options – or in what proportion.
Reporting both pieces of information together allows the Commission, investors, and other users

237

See ASC 815 (Derivatives and Hedging).

238

See Item C.4.a of Form N-PORT (requiring reporting of asset category of each investment among
enumerated categories, including derivative-commodity, derivative-credit, derivative-equity,
derivative-foreign exchange, derivative-interest rate, derivatives-other).

81

to determine from which category-type combination the fund is drawing (or hedging) its
exposure. Further, knowing the instrument type in combination with asset category can be
important for understanding the risks associated with obtaining exposure to a particular asset
category because different derivative instruments can have different risks associated with them,
such as different counterparty risk, or a linear risk profile (e.g. futures) versus a non-linear risk
profile (e.g., options). Additionally, having such information by instrument and asset category
will be useful in understanding situations ranging from a market disruption for a particular type
of derivative instrument (e.g., a market disruption affecting a futures market) to a price shock
impacting a particular asset category (e.g., commodities). Consequently, we believe that
requiring such information by both derivative instrument type and asset category will provide
more complete information relative to providing either type in isolation to Commission staff,
investors, and other potential users seeking to better understand how a fund is using derivatives
in accomplishing its investment strategy and the impact of derivatives on the fund’s returns.
Moreover, based on staff review of fund financial statements, we have observed that in
compliance with the requirements of FASB Topic ASC 815, upon which this reporting
requirement was based, funds generally show gains (losses) and appreciation (depreciation) in
tabular format by both asset category and type of derivative instrument. Because, as noted by
commenters, many funds already have systems in place to classify derivatives by instrument
type, we believe that requiring such information to be reported on Form N-PORT along with
asset category will not add a significant incremental burden relative to providing, as proposed,
such information by asset category alone.239

239

See SIFMA Comment Letter I; ICI Comment Letter.

82

Regarding comments concerning public disclosure of the information, we disagree with
the commenter that argued such disclosures could reveal information that could be used for
reverse engineering or predatory trading.240 We are not aware of this information being used for
such purposes, nor did the commenter explain how the disclosure of such information could
reveal information about the fund’s trading strategies that would allow traders to “front-run” or
“copycat” the fund. Separately, we note that the information will be delayed in terms of public
disclosure and that the return information will be aggregated, which should mitigate the
possibility that such information could be used by predatory traders to the detriment of the fund.
Likewise, we disagree with the commenter that asserted such information would not be
meaningful to investors.241 The Commission believes, and one commenter agreed, that this
information will be useful for identifying funds in which a significant amount of gains and losses
came from exposures to derivative contracts, and will allow Commission staff, investors, and
other potential users to better understand the relationship between the type of derivative
instrument and asset category in terms of the impact on the fund’s returns. Furthermore, we are
not persuaded by commenters’ arguments that such information would be misleading to investors
if made publicly available. As discussed above, funds will also be reporting similar information
attributable to investments other than derivatives, which we believe could help investors
compare returns attributable to derivatives with returns attributable to a fund’s other
investments. Furthermore, although gains (or losses) and appreciation (or depreciation) from
derivatives may have different implications depending on whether derivatives are being used for
investment purposes or as a hedge for other positions in the portfolio, disclosure of such

240

See SIFMA Comment Letter I.

241

Id.

83

information should help improve the ability of investors to understand and assess the use of
derivatives in funds’ investment strategies.
f.

Flow Information

As proposed, Form N-PORT will require funds to separately report, for each of the
preceding three months, the total net asset value of: (1) shares sold (including exchanges but
excluding reinvestment of dividends and distributions); (2) shares sold in connection with
reinvestments of dividends and distributions; and (3) shares redeemed or repurchased (including
exchanges).242 This information is similar to what is currently reported on Form N-SAR, and is
generally to be reported subject to the same instructions that currently govern reporting of flow
information on that form.243 We are requiring this information on Form N-PORT because we
believe that this information will be more helpful if reported on a monthly basis rather than
retrospectively on an annual basis on Form N-CEN.
We believe that having flow information reported to us monthly will help us better
monitor trends in the fund industry. For example, it could help us analyze types of funds that are
becoming more popular among investors and areas of high growth in the industry. It could help
us better examine investor behavior in response to market events. Finally, in combination with
242

See Item B.6 of Form N-PORT.

243

Similar to Form N-SAR, Form N-PORT will instruct funds to report amounts after any front-end
sales loads had been deducted and before any deferred or contingent deferred sales loads or charges
had been deducted. Shares sold will include shares sold by the fund to a registered UIT. Funds will
also include as shares sold any transaction in which the fund acquired the assets of another investment
company or of a personal holding company in exchange for its own shares. Funds will include as
shares redeemed any transaction in which the fund liquidated all or part of its assets. Exchanges will
be defined as the redemption or repurchase of shares of one fund or series and the investment of all or
part of the proceeds in shares of another fund or series in the same family of investment companies.
Form N-PORT will also include a new clarifying instruction, providing that if shares of the fund are
held in omnibus accounts, funds will use net sales or redemptions/repurchases from such omnibus
accounts for purposes of calculating the fund’s sales, redemptions, and repurchases. Cf. Item B.6 of
Form N-PORT and Item 28 of Form N-SAR (requiring reporting of monthly sales and repurchases of
the Registrant’s/Series’ shares for the past six months).

84

other information that will be reported on Form N-PORT regarding liquidity of fund positions
pursuant to changes to Form N-PORT set forth in the Liquidity Adopting Release, which we are
adopting today, flow information could also help us identify funds that might be at risk of
experiencing liquidity stress due to increased redemptions.244
Commenters generally supported our proposed reporting requirements for monthly flow
information.245 However, many commenters noted that funds are generally unable to look
through omnibus accounts to the underlying investors, and thus requested confirmation that flow
information be reported on a net basis for shares of the fund held in omnibus accounts.246 We
agree with these commenters, and in response to these comments, Form N-PORT now includes a
clarifying instruction to this effect.247
One commenter asked the Commission to mandate that transfer agents, distributors, or
some other entity (e.g., a central data repository) track omnibus flow information by type of
underlying investor (i.e., 401(k) plans/individual retirement accounts, pension funds, insurance
companies, other institutional investors, and retail investors).248 The commenter suggested that
this information be provided to fund managers, who would then report this information on Form
N-PORT. The commenter concluded that this information would help funds and others to create

Letter (recommending that the Commission mandate that transfer agents, distributors, or some other

predictive models to better understand potential future redemptions, which in turn would help
funds with liquidity risk management.
We acknowledge the merits of helping funds better manage potential redemption risks,
and further note that better transparency into intermediary omnibus accounts by each type of
underlying investor would help the Commission better understand subscription and redemption
activity and how it varies across distribution platforms and market environments. However, the
commenter’s suggestion is beyond the scope of this rulemaking, although we note that the
Commission is currently seeking a range of input with respect to omnibus intermediary account
relationships, including through the recently issued advance notice of proposed rulemaking and
concept release with respect to transfer agent regulations, which seeks comment in various areas
including the processing of book entry securities, broker-dealer recordkeeping for beneficial
owners, and the role of transfer agents to mutual funds.249
Another commenter recommended that monthly flow information be reported for only
the last month of the reporting period, rather than for the three prior months, on the grounds that
reporting this information for the three prior months would have “no direct value to investors.”250
We are not persuaded by this suggestion. As discussed above, although Form N-PORT is
primarily designed to assist the Commission and its staff, we believe that investors and other
potential users may benefit from the information reported on Form N-PORT as well, either by
analyzing Form N-PORT directly or through analyses prepared by third-party service providers.
Unlike other information reported on Form N-PORT, which generally represents a snapshot “as

of” a certain date, flows are calculated over a period of time. Because information reported on
Form N-PORT will be publicly available on a quarterly basis but will provide monthly flow
information, we are concerned that investors might potentially believe that one month’s flows
represent the fund’s flows for the full quarter. For that reason, we are requiring funds to report
monthly flow information for each of the preceding three months, as proposed.

Schedule of Portfolio Investments

Part C of Form N-PORT will require, as proposed, funds to report certain information on
an investment-by-investment basis about each investment held by the fund and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the close of the preceding month. As proposed, funds will respond to certain
questions that will apply to all investments (i.e., the investment’s identification, amount, payoff
profile, asset and issuer type, country of investment or issuer, fair value level, and whether the
investment was a restricted security). As proposed, funds will also respond, as applicable, to
additional questions related to specific types of investments (i.e., debt securities, repurchase and
reverse repurchase agreements, derivatives, and securities lending).
Also, as proposed, funds will have the option of identifying any investments that are
“miscellaneous securities.”251 Unless otherwise indicated, funds will not report information
related to those investments in Part C, but will instead report such information in Part D.252
i.

Information for All Investments

Form N-PORT will require, as proposed, funds to report certain basic information about
each investment held by the fund and its consolidated subsidiaries. In particular, funds will
report the name of the issuer and title of issue or description of the investment, as they are

251

See Part D of Form N-PORT. See also supra footnote 99 and accompanying text.

252

See infra footnote 419 and accompanying and following text.

87

currently required to do on their reported schedules of investments.253 To facilitate analysis of
fund portfolios, it is important for Commission staff to be able to identify individual portfolio
securities, as well as the reference instruments of derivative investments through the use of an
identifying code or number, which is not currently required to be reported on the schedule of
investments. Fund shareholders and potential investors that are analyzing fund portfolios or
investments across funds could similarly benefit from the clear identification of a fund’s
portfolio securities across funds. The staff has found that some securities reported by funds lack
a securities identifier, and this absence has reduced the usefulness of other information reported.
To address this issue, and as proposed, we are requiring that funds report additional
information about the issuer and the security. Funds will report certain securities identifiers, if
available.254 For example, for security-based swaps, funds may report the product ID if a
product ID for that contract is used by one or more security-based swap data repositories.255
Identifiers for other types of derivatives may also be used, if available.256 If a unique identifier is
reported, funds will also indicate the type of identifier used.257 Such an identifier might be
assigned by a security-based swap data repository or be internally generated by the fund or
provided by a third party, but should be consistently used across the fund’s filings for reporting

253

that investment so that the Commission, investors, and other potential users of the information
can track the investment from report to report.
We received comments regarding the use of unique identifiers generally, and LEI in
particular. As discussed above, many commenters expressed support for the use of LEI for
identification of funds, registrants, and counterparties.258 However, one commenter asserted that
a portfolio-based approach, including data on counterparties to whom funds have greatest
exposures, would enable adequate monitoring of potential threats better than obtaining
counterparty LEI and specific information for each bilateral transaction.259 Other commenters
expressed concerns regarding the ability of funds to verify the accuracy of LEIs provided by
third-parties.260 Another commenter suggested that each security held by a fund should be
identified by ticker and CUSIP, or ISIN and SEDOL for foreign securities, together with the
primary exchange where the security is traded at the date of the filing.261 Another commenter
urged the Commission not to mandate the use of certain unique identifiers for public and
nonpublic funds, such as the Financial Instrumental Global Identifier (“FIGI”).262
As discussed above, we are adopting a portfolio-based approach in the securities lending
context, including data on counterparties to whom funds have greatest exposures. However, we

believe that the uniform reporting of LEIs by fund series and registrants, as well as securities
issuers and fund counterparties, will further enhance our monitoring and analytical capabilities
by providing a consistent means of identification that will facilitate the linkage of data reported
on Form N-PORT with data from other filings and sources that is or will be reported elsewhere.
We acknowledge that LEIs have not yet been fully integrated into the global financial system,
and accordingly the form contains a qualifier that an LEI be reported, “if any.” We believe,
however, that LEIs will become more widely used by regulators and the financial industry and
note that our rulemaking will not require funds to report LEIs, if any, until 18 months following
the effective date.
However, we understand that funds will in some instances be relying upon service
providers and other third-parties who will be providing funds with LEI information to be
reported to the Commission and publicly disclosed to investors and other possible users, and we
understand that funds may find it difficult to verify such information other than to confirm that it
has been generated and reported consistently with the methodologies of the fund’s service
providers. As discussed above, the fund may generally use its own methodology or the
methodology of its service provider, so long as the methodology is consistently applied and is
consistent with the way the fund reports internally and to current and prospective investors.263
We do not believe, as some commenters suggested, that it is necessary to require specific
alternative unique identifiers for securities or entities at this time, other than those identified in

263

See General Instruction G of Form N-PORT (“Funds may respond to this Form using their own
internal methodologies and the conventions of their service providers, provided the information is
consistent with information that they report internally and to current and prospective investors.
However, the methodologies and conventions must be consistently applied and the Fund’s responses
must be consistent with any instructions or other guidance relating to this Form.”).

Form N-PORT, because we believe that allowing funds to select another identifier in the absence
of an ISIN, CUSIP, or ticker gives funds appropriate flexibility in identifying such investments.
We are also requiring, as proposed, funds to report the amount of each investment as of
the end of the reporting period, as is currently required under Regulation S-X.264 Funds will
report the number of units or principal amount for each investment, as well as the value of each
investment at the close of the period, and the percentage value of each investment when
compared to the net assets of the fund.265 Funds will also report the currency in which the
investment was denominated, and, if not denominated in U.S. dollars, the exchange rate used to
calculate value.266 We received no comments on this aspect of our proposal.
Also as proposed, we are requiring funds to report the payoff profile of the investment,
indicating whether the investment is held long, short, or N/A, which will serve the same purpose
as the current requirement in Regulation S-X to disclose investments sold short.267 Funds will
respond N/A for derivatives and will respond to relevant questions that indicate the payoff
profile of each derivative in the derivatives portion of the form. These disclosures will identify
short positions in investments held by funds. We received no comments on these disclosure
requirements.
As proposed, funds will also report the asset type for the investment: short-term
investment vehicle (e.g., money market fund, liquidity pool, or other cash management vehicle),
repurchase agreement, equity-common, equity-preferred, debt, derivative-commodity,

264

See Item C.2 of Form N-PORT. See rule 12-12 of Regulation S-X.

structured note, loan, ABS-mortgage backed security, ABS-asset backed commercial paper,
ABS-collateralized bond/debt obligation, ABS-other, commodity, real estate, other) and issuer
type (corporate, U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, U.S. government sponsored entity,
municipal, non-U.S. sovereign, private fund, registered fund, other).268 We are also adopting a
modification from the proposal to add a “derivatives-other” category to encompass derivatives
that do not fall into the other categories of derivatives enumerated in this Item, so as to allow
Commission staff, investors, and other users of the information reported on Form N-PORT to
more easily aggregate the fund’s derivative investments. We have based these categories in part
on staff review of how funds currently categorize investments on their schedule of investments,
and in part on the categories of investments required to be reported by private funds on Form
PF.269 These disclosures will allow the Commission, investors, and other potential users to
assess the composition of fund portfolios in terms of asset and issuer types and also facilitate
comparisons among similar types of investments.
One commenter recommended the use of a well-defined taxonomy for asset and issuer
type, such as ISO 10962, or some truncation of the six-character ISO Classification of Financial
Instruments code.270 Although we acknowledge there could be benefits for data aggregation and
analysis to using an existing standardized taxonomy for users of the form, Form N-PORT is

See, e.g., Item 26 of Form PF (requiring filers to report exposures by asset type); Item 1 of Form N-Q
(requiring filers to report the schedules of investments required by sections 210.12-12 to 12-14 of
Regulation S-X); Item 1 of Form N-CSR (requiring filers to attach a copy of the report transmitted to
stockholders pursuant to rule 30e-1 under the Act).

primarily designed to meet the data needs of the Commission and its staff. We have drafted the
asset categories in Form N-PORT specifically to address the Commission staff’s data needs,
whereas many of the existing taxonomies include extraneous information in some areas or
insufficient information in other areas. For these reasons, we are adopting the asset categories on
Form N-PORT largely as proposed.
Funds will also report, as proposed, for each investment, whether the investment is a
restricted security.271 This disclosure will provide investors and the Commission staff with more
information about liquidity risks associated with the fund’s investments.
Also as proposed, each fund will report whether the investment is categorized by the fund
as a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy under
GAAP.272 Commission staff could use this information to identify and monitor investments that
may be more susceptible to increased valuation risk and identify potential outliers that warrant
additional monitoring or inquiry.273 In addition, Commission staff will be better able to identify

271

See Item C.6 of Form N-PORT. “Restricted security” will have the definition provided in rule
144(a)(3) under the Securities Act [17 CFR 230.144(a)(3)]. See General Instruction E of Form NPORT. See also amended rule 12-13, nn. 6 and 8 of Regulation S-X, which will require similar
disclosures in funds’ schedules of investments to identify securities that are restricted. Cf. footnote
290 and accompanying and following text.

272

See ASC 820. An investment is categorized in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest
level input that is significant to its fair value measurement. Level 1 inputs include quoted prices
(unadjusted) for identical investments in an active market (e.g., active exchange-traded equity
securities). Level 2 inputs include other observable inputs, such as: (i) quoted prices for similar
securities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar securities in non-active markets;
and (iii) pricing models whose inputs are observable or derived principally from or corroborated by
observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the
security. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. We are amending Regulation S-X to require that
funds identify those investments whose value was determined using significant unobservable inputs.
See infra section II.C.3.

anomalies in reported data by aggregating all fund investments industry-wide into the various
level categories. These disclosures will also provide investors and the Commission staff with
more information about which of the fund’s investments are more actively traded, and which
investments are less actively traded and thus potentially less liquid. Currently, funds are required
to categorize the fair value measurement of each investment in the fair value hierarchy in their
financial statements.274 We believe that based on this requirement, funds should have pricing
information available to determine the categorization of their portfolio investments as Level 1,
Level 2, or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
Several commenters supported this aspect of our proposal, noting it would enhance
portfolio transparency and allow investors, plans, and fund fiduciaries to more accurately
evaluate liquidity and valuation risks in funds.275 Another commenter asserted that our proposal
to report the fair value level measurement for each individual investment held by the fund would
represent no incremental burden relative to the current burden of reporting the total value of each
fair value level category, because reporting systems should already contain the necessary
information at the individual security level.276
However, one commenter cautioned that different fund families currently employ
different accounting practices when classifying similar investments into fair value level
hierarchies, and warned that the Commission staff should reconsider expectations that disclosure
of these fair value levels would create comparability among different funds with regards to fair

274

ASC 820-10-50-2 (Fair Value Measurement-Disclosure-General) requires for each class of assets and
liabilities measured at fair value, the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value
measurements are categorized in their entirety (Level 1, 2, or 3).

value level hierarchy classifications.277 Another commenter echoed the sentiment that fair value
level determinations reported by funds would likely differ from one fund group to another, and
concluded that these determinations should be disclosed in aggregate by fair value level
hierarchy classification as opposed to on an individual security basis.278
Several commenters also recommended that additional related information be reported,
such as the uncertainty of valuation for thinly-traded securities and identification of the primary
pricing sources used in determining the fair value level hierarchy of the investments.279 Lastly,
one commenter noted that certain funds of funds’ investments may not have fair value level
hierarchies assigned to them pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Update 2015-07, and
requested that Form N-PORT be revised to allow funds to report “null” to account for such
investments.280
In response to the last comment, we are revising Form N-PORT to allow funds to report
“N/A” to this item if an investment does not have a fair value level hierarchy assigned to it
pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Update 2015-07. This revision will allow funds to
report fair value hierarchy information consistently across Form N-PORT and their shareholder
reports.281

sources should be made available, and third-party pricing services used should be disclosed on an
individual security basis).

281

See Item C.8 of Form N-PORT.

95

More generally, we acknowledge that there may be differences among fair value level
hierarchy classifications between funds, even for the same investments, but believe that reporting
of this information could still help Commission staff, investors, and other potential users to
identify and monitor investments that may be more susceptible to increased valuation risk and
identify potential outliers that warrant additional monitoring or inquiry.
We decline to add the additional information suggested by commenters related to
valuation, such as more information regarding thinly-traded securities or position-level
information on price sources. We believe that, unlike fair value hierarchy information, which
funds already need to track for reporting purposes, this information is not currently reported by
funds in any form and could be burdensome to begin reporting relative to the additional value it
may provide. Accordingly, we decline to revise Form N-PORT to require funds to report this
additional information.
As proposed, Form N-PORT would have required funds to report the country that
corresponds to the country of investment or issuer based on the concentrations of the
investment’s risk and economic exposure, and, if different, the country in which the issuer is
organized. As adopted, Form N-PORT will switch the sequence of those disclosures, thus
requiring funds to report the country in which the issuer is organized and, if different, the country
that corresponds to the country of investment or issuer based on the concentrations of the
investment’s risk and economic exposure.282 These disclosures will provide the Commission

282

See Item C.5 of Form N-PORT.
Also, as discussed further below, we are making the country of risk and economic exposure a
nonpublic field in all Form N-PORT filings. Under the proposal, this would have meant that funds
would be publicly reporting nothing if the country of risk and economic exposure were the same as
the country in which the issuer is organized, because in that situation funds would only be reporting
the country of risk and economic exposure, which will be nonpublic in Form N-PORT. Accordingly,

96

staff with more information about country-specific exposures associated with the fund’s
investments. Specifically, the Commission believes that providing both the country based on
concentrations of risk and economic exposure and also the country in which the issuer is
organized will assist the Commission in understanding the country-specific risks associated with
such investments. For example, knowing the country of risk and economic exposure, including
the country in which an issuer is organized, is important for understanding the effect of such
investments in a portfolio when that country might be going through times of economic stress
(e.g., monetary controls or sanctions) or political unrest or other emergency circumstances.
We received mixed comments on this aspect of our proposal. Commenters generally
supported the requirement to report the country in which the issuer is organized.283 Commenters
generally viewed the determination of country of risk as inherently subjective, but differed in
terms of whether the Commission should provide a particular standard for determining the
country of risk or whether the Commission should permit funds to report differing information
for the same securities as a result of the existing diversity of approaches currently used by funds

we are requiring funds to report the country in which the issuer is organized as the default, and, only
if different, to also report the country of risk and economic exposure.
283

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter I; Dreyfus Comment Letter; Morningstar Comment Letter.

97

and service providers.284 Commenters also disagreed regarding whether this information should
be publicly reported or even reported at all.285
Partly in response to these concerns, and as discussed above, we are revising Form NPORT to include instructions clarifying that in reporting information on Form N-PORT, funds
may generally use their own internal methodologies and the conventions of their service
providers, provided that the information they report is consistent with information that they
report elsewhere (e.g., the fund’s schedule of portfolio holdings as prepared pursuant to
Regulation S-X).286 For example, we understand that for issuers with operations in multiple
countries, some funds commonly use the issuer’s country of domicile for purposes of internal
recordkeeping and analysis and may choose to do the same for reporting country of risk on Form
N-PORT, whereas funds that utilize other methodologies may prefer to rely upon their own
chosen methodologies instead. Additionally, as discussed further below in section II.A.4, we are

284

See, e.g., Wells Fargo Comment Letter (the Commission should include guidance and instructions for
determining the country with the greatest concentration of risks and economic exposure in order to
achieve consistent reporting across funds); Interactive Data Comment Letter (the Commission should
support the prevailing diversity of approaches towards identifying country of risk as a necessary
consequence of such reporting); SIFMA Comment Letter I (the Commission should either limit the
disclosure requirement to country of issuer organization or else clarify that funds may use
classifications generated by existing methodologies or available service providers); ICI Comment
Letter (it is important for funds to have the flexibility to make these determinations using their own
good faith judgment).

285

See, e.g., Interactive Data Comment Letter (supporting the disclosure of country of risk); Schwab
Comment Letter (public disclosure may lead to investor confusion); Fidelity Comment Letter (the
Commission should require non-public disclosure of this information until it is standardized);

is proprietary and subjective, but supporting country of issuance on the grounds that it is more
objective).

286

See General Instruction G of Form N-PORT (“Funds may respond to this Form using their own
internal methodologies and the conventions of their service providers, provided the information is
consistent with information that they report internally and to current and prospective investors.
However, the methodologies and conventions must be consistently applied and the Fund’s responses
must be consistent with any instructions or other guidance relating to this Form.”). See also supra
footnote 77 and accompanying and following text.

making the country of risk and economic exposure a nonpublic field in all Form N-PORT
filings.287
More generally, several commenters sought confirmation that funds would not be
required to look through any entities in its portfolio holdings except as specifically instructed in
Form N-PORT.288 As discussed above, Form N-PORT requires funds to disclose information
about “each investment held by the Fund and its consolidated subsidiaries.”289 Thus, Form NPORT requires funds to report information about each underlying investment in a CFC, because
CFCs are consolidated subsidiaries in funds’ financial statements for reporting purposes.
The proposed form also would have required funds to identify each investment that is
“illiquid.”290 We note that the Liquidity Adopting Release, which we are adopting today,
addresses liquidity risk management programs for open-end funds, which, among other things,
requires information about the liquidity of fund investments to be reported on Form N-PORT.291]
ii.

Debt Securities

In addition to the information required above, as proposed, Form N-PORT would require
additional information about each debt security held by the fund in order to gain transparency
into the payment flows and potential convertibility into equity of such investments, as such
287

See infra footnote 515 and accompanying and following text.

288

See Invesco Comment Letter; Schwab Comment Letter; CRMC Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment
Letter I.

289

See Part C of Form N-PORT (“For each investment held by the Fund and its consolidated
subsidiaries, disclose the information requested in Part C.”).

290

As proposed, Form N-PORT would have defined “illiquid asset” as “an asset that cannot be sold or
disposed of by the Fund in the ordinary course of business within seven calendar days, at
approximately the value ascribed to it by the Fund.” This definition is the same definition used in the
liquidity guidance issued by the Commission for open-end funds. See Revisions of Guidelines to
Form N-1A, Investment Company Act Release No. 18612 (Mar. 12, 1992) [57 FR 9829 (Mar. 20,
1992)] (“1992 Release”).

information can be used to better understand the payoff profile and credit risk of these
investments. First, funds would report the maturity date and coupon (reporting the annualized
interest rate and indicating whether fixed, floating, variable, or none).292
While commenters were generally supportive of this requirement, they requested that we
provide clear standards for reporting or more granular classifications. 293 For example,
commenters noted that a more granular classification scheme for debt instruments is useful for
investors in understanding the nature of the obligation supporting the instrument, such as issuers,
security type, guarantors, and the investment’s structure.294 However, while more granular
classifications could be useful to investors, we do not believe that the additional information
would be justified in light of the burdens imposed because we believe that the classification
being adopted provides sufficient detail to allow the staff, investors, and other potential users, to
understand the nature of the fund investments. As a result, we are adopting this requirement as
proposed.295 Another commenter recommended that we consider a minimum reporting threshold
of 10% of exposure to each security type for additional security-specific reporting for debt
securities, convertible securities, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and

292

instrument”); State Street Comment Letter; Morningstar Comment Letter.

securities (e.g., corporate bonds, municipal securities), bond insurance, conduit municipal filings,

disclosures should include issuer, security type, security structure, guarantor, country, sector, and
rating).

derivatives.296 However, as we discuss below in section II.A.2.g.iv, we believe that it is
important that the Commission and investors have transparency in a fund’s investments and do
not believe that a reporting threshold for such instruments is appropriate, as it would not allow
the Commission and investors to fully understand a fund’s risks. Moreover, security-level
reporting of a fund’s underlying investments in such securities are currently reported in a fund’s
financial statements.297
As proposed, funds would also indicate whether the security is currently in default,
whether interest payments for the security are in arrears or whether any coupon payments have
been legally deferred by the issuer, as well as whether any portion of the interest is paid in
kind.298 Several commenters raised concerns regarding these disclosures. For example, one
commenter argued that the public disclosure on default, arrears, or deferred coupon payments
raises competitive concerns when a debt security is issued by a borrower that is a private
company, as private borrowers may avoid registered funds in order to limit public disclosure if
the company becomes distressed.299 The commenter noted that public disclosure that a borrower
is or may be financially distressed could increase prepayment risk and be disruptive to the fund’s
or adviser’s relationship with the borrower.300 Moreover, this disclosure could also harm private
issuers by disclosing their financial distress to vendors and key employees and customers.301
While we recognize that the disclosure of a private issuer in distress could have a negative

impact on the issuer, we believe that it is important that Commission staff have access to
information relating to fund investments that are in default or arrears in order to monitor
individual fund and industry risk. It is similarly important that fund’s investors have access to
this information so that they can make fully informed decisions regarding their investment.
Moreover, default or arrears relating to a fund’s investments in private issuer debt are already
publicly available on a fund’s quarterly financial statements.302
Another commenter recommended eliminating the requirements relating to whether a
debt security is currently in default or any of the interest payments are in arrears or have been
deferred.303 The commenter noted that these items require a subjective legal analysis on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, on which conclusions among funds may vary and thus would not
provide meaningful comparable information.304 For similar reasons, another commenter
supported the proposal, but recommended that the Commission should establish a clear standard
for designating when a security is deemed to be in arrears.305 As we previously discussed, this
type of analysis and public reporting is not new to funds, as they are required to report results in
their financial statements and on their schedules of investments.306 Rather than provide funds
with a definition that may not be applicable in all situations, or inconsistent with their financial
statement reporting, we believe that it is more appropriate to allow funds to continue to use their

own methodology in responding to these items on Form N-PORT, subject to the limitations of
General Instruction G.307
As we discuss in more detail in section II.C.3 below, commenters noted that in-kind
payments where the fund elects to receive payments-in-kind (as opposed to cash) do not raise the
same risks as an issuer that only makes in-kind payments, because such a scenario does not
represent an issuer who may be in financial difficulties and cannot pay cash dividends, as
opposed to an investor who merely chooses to receive in-kind dividends rather than cash.308 We
agree and are adding an additional clarifying clause to Item C.9.e that a fund should not
designate interest as paid-in-kind if the fund has the option to elect an in-kind payment and has
elected to be paid-in-kind 309
Finally, we proposed to require additional information for convertible securities, to
indicate whether the conversion is mandatory or contingent.310 We also proposed to require
funds to disclose for each convertible security: the conversion ratio; information about the asset
into which the debt is convertible; and the delta, which is the ratio of the change in the value of
the option to the change in the value of the asset into which the debt is convertible. This reflects
the sensitivity of the debt’s value to changes in the price of the asset into which the debt is
convertible. For example, based upon staff experience, we believe that the risk and reward
profiles for mandatory and contingent conversions vary considerably and, thus we proposed to
require disclosure of the type of conversion in order to better understand these risks. Similarly,

309

See Item C.9.e of Form N-PORT.

310

See Item C.9.f of proposed Form N-PORT.

103

we proposed to require disclosure of the conversion ratio and information about the asset into
which the debt is convertible. Furthermore, the proposed requirement to provide the delta was
also proposed to be required for options, as discussed further below, because convertible
securities have optionality.311 For similar reasons discussed below regarding options, we
expressed our belief that providing the delta for convertible securities is important to understand
the extent of both the credit exposure of the debt portion of the convertible bond as well as the
market price exposure relative to the underlying security into which it can be converted or
exchanged.
We received several comments relating to the disclosures of convertible securities. One
commenter requested that the securities be consistently reported across funds and include
additional instructions for calculating delta.312 Another commenter noted that calculating delta
for convertible bonds using the Black-Scholes model, which is commonly used for calculating
the delta for options would be impractical and therefore requested further clarification for
calculating delta for convertible bonds.313 As discussed above, while we believe that it is
important to receive consistent reporting between funds, we have endeavored to limit burdens on
funds, when possible. Thus, rather than provide prescriptive instructions for funds to calculate
delta, General Instruction G to Form N-PORT now clarifies that funds may use their own current
methodology.314 For example, based on staff experience, we understand that delta for some

311

See text accompanying and following footnote 384 (discussing information required for options,
including delta).

312

See State Street Comment Letter (reporting delta should be consistent, but should include the
following attributes to define the approach, such as: volatility used, actual volatility used in the
calculation, and attributes such as mandatory convertible.).

313

See Morningstar Comment Letter.

314

See General Instruction G of Form N-PORT; see also supra section II.A.2.a.

104

instruments could be calculated using certain formulas, such as Black-Scholes, while funds
might calculate the delta for convertible bonds using a different calculation.315 Such variations
in calculation among funds, or even by the same funds with different types of investments, are
permissible so long as the calculations are consistent with how the fund reports information
internally and to its current and prospective investors.316 However, we agree with the commenter
that calculating delta for certain convertible securities, such as contingent convertible bonds, may
not be possible. We are therefore adding the clarifying instruction to Item C.9.f.v to only
provide delta if it is applicable to that security.317
Another commenter suggested that we eliminate the additional information proposed in
Form N-PORT for convertible securities as they do not represent significant data points from
which to assess risk.318 We, however, believe that the proposed information will not only assist
staff with understanding the risks to a fund or the fund industry, it will also be used to better
understand fund investments, industry trends, and new and emerging risks. We continue to
believe that the items required for convertible securities will be valuable information for the
staff, investors, and other potential users. As a result, we are adopting Item C.9 as proposed,
subject to the clarifications in Item C.9.e and C.9.f.v. discussed above.319

iii.

Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements

As we proposed, and in addition to the information required above for all investments,
Form N-PORT requires each fund to report additional information for each repurchase and
reverse repurchase agreement held by the fund. The fund will report the category that reflects
the transaction from the perspective of the fund (repurchase, reverse repurchase), whether the
transaction is cleared by a central counterparty—and if so the name of the central counterparty—
or if not the name and LEI (if any) of the over-the-counter counterparty, repurchase rate, whether
the repurchase agreement is tri-party (to distinguish from bilateral transactions), and the maturity
date.320 Funds will also report the principal amount and value of collateral, as well as the
category of investments that most closely represents the collateral.321
These disclosures will enhance the information currently reported regarding funds’ use of
repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. Information regarding repurchase
agreements will be comparable to similar disclosures currently required to be made by money
market funds on Form N-MFP. The categories used for reporting collateral will track the
categories currently used to report tri-party repurchase agreement information to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. We believe that conforming the categories that will be used in

320

See Item C.10.a–Item C.10.e of Form N-PORT. For example, if the fund is engaged in a repurchase
transaction in which it is the cash borrower and is transferring securities to the counterparty, the fund
will report the transaction as a “reverse repurchase agreement.”

321

See Item C.10.f of Form N-PORT. Funds will report the category of investments that most closely
represents the collateral, selected from among the following (asset-backed securities; agency
collateralized mortgage obligations; agency debentures and agency strips; agency mortgage-backed
securities; private label collateralized mortgage obligations; corporate debt securities; equities; money
market; U.S. Treasuries (including strips); other instrument). If “other instrument,” funds will also
include a brief description, including, if applicable, whether it is a collateralized debt obligation,
municipal debt, whole loan, or international debt.

106

Form N-PORT to categories used in other reporting contexts will ease reporting burdens and
enhance comparability.322
One commenter agreed with our proposed reporting, but recommended, without further
elaboration, that reporting of collateral be done on the basis of aggregate security type rather than
at the individual security level.323 Another commenter noted that our proposed reporting would
align not only with information reported on Form N-MFP and collected by the Federal Reserve,
but also with information reported by fund companies operating globally and offering managed
products within Europe.324
In contrast, another commenter asserted that funds should apply the same taxonomy
when reporting collateral that would be used when reporting the fund’s portfolio investments on
Form N-PORT, which would result in a more granular disclosure of collateral.325 Other
commenters expressed concerns about public disclosure of this information on a transaction-bytransaction basis and suggested that this information be collected on a firm-by-firm basis instead
or be nonpublic, due in part to counterparties’ concerns about the disclosure of such information
to the public, including their competitors.326
After considering these comments, we are adopting this requirement as proposed. As
mentioned above, the information that funds will report is aligned with similar information

322

See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra footnote 33, at nn. 1515-1518 and
accompanying text (discussing comment letter stating that the categories used to report collateral for
tri-party repurchase agreements to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would allow for regular
and efficient comparison of current and historical risk factors regarding repurchase agreements on a
standardized basis).

publicly reported on Form N-MFP by money market funds, reported to the Federal Reserve by
banks, and publicly reported by fund companies operating globally and offering managed
products in Europe. Uniform reporting of this information under the common taxonomy that has
already been developed and is being used by other financial institutions will help facilitate the
linkage of data reported on Form N-PORT with data from other filings and sources. For these
reasons, we are not persuaded by the suggestions of one commenter to require collateral to be
reported on an aggregate level,327 nor are we persuaded by the commenter who suggested that
funds should apply the same taxonomy when reporting collateral that would be required when
reporting the fund’s portfolio investments on Form N-PORT,328 which would result in data that
would be incompatible with collateral data reported more broadly elsewhere.
We are also not persuaded by assertions by commenters that this type of information
could reveal any strategies competitors could use to their advantage. As indicated above, such
information is currently routinely publicly disclosed in other contexts, and commenters did not
specify how additional disclosure on Form N-PORT could result in harm. More generally, using
a different taxonomy for funds with regards to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements or
keeping such information nonpublic or making it available on only an aggregated basis would
hinder the ability of Commission staff as well as investors and other potential users of this
information to use the data on Form N-PORT as discussed above.
iv.

Derivatives

As discussed above and in the Proposing Release, the current reporting regime for
derivatives has led to inconsistent approaches to reporting derivatives information and, in some

327

328

See Interactive Data Comment Letter.

108

cases, insufficient information concerning the terms and underlying reference assets of
derivatives to allow the Commission or investors to understand the investment. Additionally, as
discussed further below, for options, warrants, and certain convertible bonds, the Commission
believes that it is important to have a measurement of “delta,” a measure not reported in the
financial statements or schedule of investments, to better understand the exposure to the
underlying reference asset that the options, warrants, and certain convertible bonds produce in
the portfolio. Currently, the Commission and investors are sometimes unable to accurately
assess funds’ derivatives investments and the exposures they create, which can be important to
understanding funds' investment strategies, use of leverage, and potential risk of loss.
With this rulemaking, we will increase transparency into funds’ derivatives investments
by requiring funds to disclose certain characteristics and terms of derivative contracts that are
important to understand the payoff profile of a fund’s investment in such contracts, as well as the
exposures they create or hedge in the fund. This will include, for example, exposures to
currency fluctuations, interest rate shifts, prices of the underlying reference asset, and
counterparty credit risk. As discussed further below, we are also amending Regulation S-X to
make similar changes to the reporting regime for derivatives disclosures in fund financial
statements.329
While we received comments supporting our proposal to include specific information
about position-level derivatives,330 some commenters believed that portfolio-level reporting (as
opposed to position-level reporting) would be more appropriate for understanding how funds use

329

See infra section II.C.2.

330

See, e.g., CFA Comment Letter (“Given the potential risks associated with certain uses of derivatives,
we support the new reporting requirements.”); Wells Fargo Comment Letter.

109

derivatives and funds’ derivative-based risks. 331 Other commenters requested that certain
position-level disclosures relating to derivatives not be publicly reported noting that this
information could be confusing to investors, proprietary, or potentially used by competitors to
harm fund investors through front-running or reverse engineering of fund investing strategies.332
Another requested that derivatives disclosure be subject to certain de minimis thresholds.333
As we discuss more fully below in section II.A.4, we continue to believe that it is
important that, in addition to the Commission, investors receive enough information in order to
evaluate an investment and make appropriate investing decisions. Moreover, much of the
information required in Form N-PORT is already reported in fund financial statements, or will be
with our amendments to Regulation S-X, albeit in an unstructured format. As we describe more
fully in section II.A.4 below, we generally believe that the reporting requirements of Form
N-PORT are appropriate given the filer’s status as a registered investment company with the
Commission. Moreover, we generally believe that investors, directly and indirectly, should have
access to portfolio information in a structured data format, to assist them with making more

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter (explaining that an investment-by-investment approach to
reporting does not adequately explain how derivatives are being used); Simpson Thacher Comment
Letter (derivatives reporting should focus on metrics based on a portfolio-level analysis).

See, e.g., State Street Comment Letter (details relating to nonpublic indexes or custom baskets
underlying options and swaps contracts); MFS Comment Letter (financing rates for OTC derivatives);

information should be nonpublic); Invesco Comment Letter (reference assets, specific terms,

securities, options, and warrants and derivative financing rates); Oppenheimer Comment Letter

informed investing decisions. We thus believe that certain position-level information should be
reported publicly on a quarterly basis.334
Consequently, in addition to the information required above for all investments, we
proposed to require additional information about each derivative contract in the fund’s portfolio.
As proposed, funds would report the type of derivative instrument that most closely represents
the investment (e.g., forward, future, option, etc.).335 As discussed above in section II.A.2.a,
commenters requested that we provide definitions of certain items in the form, such as
“derivatives” and “forwards.”336 For the reasons discussed above, we are not adopting
definitions for these items. Finally, a commenter suggested that we organize the disclosure of
derivatives as reflected in the recently adopted amendments to Form ADV or Item 30 of Form
PF arguing that these items would standardize the organization and reporting of derivatives
across different Commission forms.337
As discussed below in section II.C.2, the derivative instrument type categories identified
in Form N-PORT are similar to the categories disclosed by funds in amended Regulation S-X.
We designed these categories to enable funds to report position-level information on their
investments in derivatives, while leaving enough flexibility to allow funds to categorize
investments in the future that are not currently traded by funds.338 In contrast, the categories
used in the Form ADV Release and Item 30 of Form PF are designed to collect aggregated
334

See infra section II.A.4.

335

See Item C.11.a of proposed Form N-PORT. Funds would report the category of derivative that most
closely represents the investment, selected from among the following (forward, future, option,
swaption, swap, warrant, other). If “other,” funds would provide a brief description.

336

See, e.g., T. Rowe Price Comment Letter (“derivatives” and “forwards”); ICI Comment Letter
(“derivatives”).

See infra section II.C.2.

111

information at the portfolio level for investment advisers advising separately managed accounts
and private funds, respectively. As a result, the categories for Forms PF and ADV must be more
specific, as the Commission does not receive more detailed position-level information for these
types of filers. However, in the case of registered funds, the current disclosure regime requires
funds to disclose position-level information to the Commission and investors; thus it is not
necessary for more standardization across funds regarding definitions, as the Commission and
investors could always review the fund’s specific holdings.339
In the case of Form N-PORT, in addition to the categories, the Commission will receive
additional position-specific data, which will allow the user of the information to better
understand each position, without solely relying on the instrument type. However, we
acknowledge the potential for confusion regarding the categorization of different types of swaps
and are therefore adopting the derivatives instrument type categorizes that we proposed, but
subject to a modification in Item C.11.a to include a clarification that specifically identifies that
total return swaps, credit default swaps, and interest rate swaps should all be categorized under
the “swap” instrument type.340 We are adopting the derivatives instrument categories subject to
this modification.341
As proposed, funds would also report the name and LEI (if any) of the counterparty
(including a central counterparty).342 We believe, and some commenters agreed, that this
identifying information should assist the Commission, investors, and other potential users in
better identifying and monitoring derivatives held by funds and the associated counterparty

risks.343 Other than requests to keep counterparty information nonpublic344 and requests to phase
in the disclosure of counterparty LEI’s,345 which are discussed above, we generally received
positive comments on our proposed counterparty and LEI disclosures and are adopting them, as
proposed.346
As proposed, Form N-PORT would also require funds to report terms and conditions of
each derivative investment that are important to understanding the payoff profile of the
derivative.347 For options and warrants, including options on a derivative (e.g., swaptions), funds
would report the type (e.g., put), payoff profile (e.g., written), number of shares or principal
amount of underlying reference instrument per contract, exercise price or rate, expiration date,

counterparty information available to market participants. As a result, market participants could
assist the SEC in identifying emerging risks – and they would likely direct assets away from
counterparties perceived as excessively risky.”); CFA Comment Letter (supporting aspects of the
proposal that would require derivative counterparty information); Wells Fargo Comment Letter
(same). Commenters to the FSOC Notice indicated that counterparty data for derivative disclosures is
not often available and discussed the need to have more transparency in this regard. See, e.g.,
Comment Letter of Americans for Financial Reform to FSOC Notice (Mar. 27, 2015) (“Americans
For Financial Reform FSOC Notice Comment Letter”) (asserting that counterparty data in derivative
disclosures is not often available); Comment Letter of the Systemic Risk Council to FSOC Notice

liabilities).

346

See Item C.11.b of Form N-PORT; see also Morningstar Comment Letter; CFA Comment Letter;
Wells Fargo Comment Letter. As discussed below in section II.C.2.a, in response to commenters’
suggestions, for Regulation S-X purposes, we are not requiring funds to disclose the counterparty for
centrally cleared or exchange traded derivatives. See, e.g., rule 12-13, n. 4 of Regulation S-X. This is
because we believe it may be necessary to have information about the central counterparty for a
derivative (for example, to compare data with other data available to regulators) but such information
may not be necessary for financial statements, where the primary purpose for providing this
information to fund investors is to make investors aware of the fund’s counterparties and any
associated credit risk.

347

We are requiring similar information on a fund’s schedule of investments. See infra section II.C.2.

113

and the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of the option or warrant.348 Proposed Form NPORT would require funds to provide a description of the reference instrument, including name
of issuer, title of issue, and relevant securities identifier.349 We received comments supporting
these items350 and are adopting them as proposed.351
We recognize that some derivatives have underlying assets that are indexes of securities
or other assets or a “custom basket” of assets, the components of which are not always publicly
available. We proposed requirements to ensure that the Commission, investors, and other
potential users are aware of the components of such indexes or custom baskets. As proposed, if
the reference instrument is an index for which the components are publicly available on a
website and are updated on that website no less frequently than quarterly, funds would identify
the index and provide the index identifier, if any.352 We proposed to require at least quarterly
public disclosure for the components of the index because it matches the frequency with which
funds are currently required and, as adopted in this release, would continue to be required, to
disclose their portfolio investments.353 We proposed that if the index’s components are not

option contracts in Item C.2.a of Form N-PORT. See also supra footnote 265 and accompanying
text.

349

See Item C.11.c.iii.2 and Item C.11.c.iii.3 of proposed Form N-PORT. For the securities identifier,
funds would report, if available, CUSIP of the reference asset, ISIN (if CUSIP is not available), ticker
(if CUSIP and ISIN are not available), or other unique identifier (if CUSIP, ISIN, and ticker are not
available). See also supra footnote 254 and accompanying and following text.

See Item C.11.c.iii.2 of proposed Form N-PORT. If the reference instrument is a derivative, funds
would also indicate the category of derivative (e.g., swap) and will provide all information required to
be reported on Form N-PORT for that type of derivative. We received no comments on this
requirement and are adopting it as proposed.

publicly available as provided above, and the notional amount of the derivative represents 1% or
less of the NAV of the fund, the fund would provide a narrative description of the index.354 If
the index’s components are not publicly available in that manner, and the notional amount of the
derivative represents more than 1% of the NAV of the fund, we proposed that the fund would
provide the name, identifier, number of shares or notional amount or contract value as of the
trade date (all of which would be reported as negative for short positions), value, and unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of every component in the index.355
We received a number of comments on our proposal to publicly disclose the components
of the underlying index or custom basket. While some commenters agreed with our proposal,356
others requested that we include a higher threshold before requiring reporting.357 Some
commenters, for example, suggested that the threshold for requiring any reporting of components
be 5% of net asset value of the fund.358 Others agreed with our proposed 1% threshold but stated
that reporting should be based on whether the net asset value of the derivative instrument that is
relying on the index or custom basket exceeds 1% of the fund’s net asset value, rather than the

354

See supra footnote 352.

355

See id. Short positions in the index, if any, would be reported as negative numbers. The identifier for
each index component would include CUSIP, ISIN (if CUSIP is not available), ticker (if CUSIP and
ISIN are not available), or other identifier (if CUSIP, ISIN, and ticker are not available). If other
identifier is provided, the fund would indicate the type of identifier used.

derivative instrument’s notional value (as was proposed), as net asset value is a better indicator
of materiality.359
We continue to believe that it is important for the Commission, investors, and other
potential users to have transparency into a fund’s exposures to assets, regardless of whether the
fund directly holds investments in those assets or chooses to create those exposures through a
derivatives contract.360 Our proposed one percent threshold was based on our experience with
the summary schedule of investments, which requires funds to disclose investments for which
the value exceeds 1% of the fund’s NAV in that schedule.361 Similar to the threshold in the
summary schedule of investments, we believe that providing a 1% de minimis for disclosing the
components of a derivative with nonpublic reference assets considers the need for the
Commission, investors, and other potential users to have transparency into the exposures that
derivative contracts create while not requiring extensive disclosure of multiple components in a
nonpublic index for instruments that represent a small amount of the fund’s overall value.
Moreover, for purposes of this calculation, we believe that it is appropriate to measure
whether such derivative instrument exceeds the 1% threshold based on the derivative’s notional
value, as opposed to the current market value of the derivative, because derivatives with a small
market value could have a much larger potential impact on a fund’s performance than the current

359

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter I (“The proposal of 1% notional value is entirely different from the
predicate requirement on which the Commission says the proposal is based. We believe the original
1% value requirement is a far better indicator of materiality and should be adopted in this connection
as well.”); Oppenheimer Comment Letter (1% of net (not notional) value of derivatives).

360

We are also modifying Regulation S-X to require similar disclosures. See infra section II.C.2.a
(discussing proposed rule 12-13, n. 3 of Regulation S-X).

market value would suggest, and thus believe that a derivative’s notional value better measures
its potential contribution to the gains or losses of the fund.362
We also solicited comment on whether we should limit the required disclosure of index
components to the top 50 components and/or components that represent more than 1% of the
index. In response to this request for comment commenters suggested that once a nonpublic
index crosses the reporting threshold, we limit disclosure to the top 50 components and
components that represent more than one percent of the index based on the notional value of the
derivatives, as this standard is analogous to the current reporting requirement to identify holdings
in the summary schedule of investments. Commenters stated that this would reduce reporting
burdens for funds that invest in indexes with a large number of components.363
Some commenters also objected to the public disclosure of the components underlying an
index as that disclosure could harm the intellectual property rights that index providers might
assert and, as a result, harm investors who may lose the benefit of index products that would no
longer be available to them, should an index provider choose to no longer do business with a

362

See Item C.11.c.iii.2 of Form N-PORT. As discussed more fully below, we received several
comments relating to the appropriate calculation of notional amount for derivative instruments. See
infra footnotes 546–550 and accompanying text. We acknowledge that there are multiple ways of
calculating notional amount for certain investments. See id. While the staff has previously provided
examples of acceptable notional amount calculations, see id., funds may use other methods of
calculating notional amount so long as the methodology is applied consistently and is consistent with
the way the fund reports notional amount internally and to current and prospective investors. See
General Instruction G of Form N-PORT.

See current rule 12-12C of Regulation S-X; see, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; Oppenheimer Comment
Letter; see also SIFMA Comment Letter I (top 5 components or the components reflecting 50% of the
index). Commenters also noted their belief that reporting should be based on a percentage of NAV,
rather than notional value, as percentage of NAV is a better indicator of materiality. See SIFMA
Comment Letter I; Oppenheimer Comment Letter; contra Morningstar Comment Letter (“Arbitrary
limits on positions that should be disclosed for portfolios or reference indexes can mask the risk of an
instrument.”).

fund, rather than have its index’s components made publicly available.364 Other commenters
urged the Commission to delete this requirement as information on non-public indexes or custom
baskets may be difficult for funds to obtain.365 As discussed below in section III.B.3.,
commenters also noted that disclosure of the components of custom baskets underlying swaps
are considered by some as proprietary information regarding a fund’s investment strategies and
could lead to the indexing strategy being imitated, resulting in harm to the fund and its investors
through reverse engineering and free-riding.366
We believe that it is fundamental to the reporting by funds that fund shareholders have
access to the information necessary to understand the exposures of their fund’s investments.367
Moreover, we note that a fund whose investment objective tracks an index or custom basket is
currently required to publicly disclose its direct holdings quarterly in its financial statements. 368
Likewise, funds should not be able to use proprietary indexes to mask exposures to investments
underlying a custom basket for a swap or options contract.369
Moreover, while some commenters noted that obtaining information on the components
of an underlying index may be difficult,370 again, we believe that fund shareholders need
sufficient information to understand their fund’s exposures, even if such transparency requires
the fund to renegotiate licensing agreements or, in some cases results in the fund having to

forego investments in a custom basket or nonpublic index.371 As discussed further in section
II.A.4, below, we believe that we have mitigated the potential for harm to fund investors that
some commenters believed could result from the public reporting of non-public indexes and
custom baskets by delaying the public reporting of reports on Form N-PORT by 60-days.
For the reasons discussed above, we believe that it is important that the Commission and
investors have full transparency into any index or custom basket that significantly contributes to
a fund’s NAV. However, we were also persuaded by commenters that, in cases of indexes with a
large number of components, and where the index only constitutes a small portion of the fund’s
investments, disclosure of every component could yield information on underlying investments
that constitute only a “miniscule” percentage of the fund’s NAV.372 In these cases, requiring
complete reporting of all the components could be burdensome without providing information
that is minimally helpful for understanding the role of the investment in the fund. In such
situations, limiting component reporting to the largest holdings of an index or custom basket
could appropriately reduce reporting burdens while still providing transparency into the
investment.
Accordingly, we are adopting a tiered reporting structure for the reporting of the
components of an index or custom basket underlying a derivative. For investments in a nonpublic index or custom basket that represent more than 1%, but less than 5%, of a fund’s net
assets, funds will be required to report the top 50 components of the basket and, in addition,
those components that exceed 1% of the notional value of the index. For investments in a non-

371

See Morningstar Comment Letter.

372

See ICI Comment Letter.

119

public index or custom basket that exceed 5% of a fund’s net assets, funds will be required to
report all components.
We developed this tiered threshold in response to commenters, discussed above, that
suggested a higher de minimis threshold of 5% of net assets for requiring any reporting of the
underlying components. We recognize that this approach will be more burdensome for funds
holding investments that fall within these thresholds than raising the de minimis for any reporting
of components to 5% of net assets, which was suggested by some commenters. We believe,
however, that investments representing between 1% and 5% of a fund’s net assets are
sufficiently significant to a fund that some reporting of individual components is appropriate and
will help the Commission staff and investors to understand a fund’s indirect exposures to
investments that are the most significant components of the index. Further, limiting reporting for
such derivative investments to the top 50 components and those components that exceed 1% of
the notional value of the index, which is the same threshold used for the summary schedule of
investments, will reduce the reporting burdens relative to the proposal for funds with such
investments.373

Conversely, we acknowledge that limiting the required reporting for those

investments representing between 1% and 5% will not provide full transparency into such
investments; we believe, however, that this approach appropriately balances providing
information that is sufficient for the Commission and investors to understand the composition
and risk of such investments, with reducing reporting burdens for funds. For investments in nonpublic indexes or custom baskets that exceed 5% of a fund net assets, funds will be required to
report all components of the index or custom basket, as we believe that full transparency is

373

See Morningstar Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I.

120

appropriate for such investments because, as discussed above, funds should not be able to mask
significant portions of their investment strategy by using a proprietary index or custom basket.
A commenter also objected to disclosure of unrealized appreciation or depreciation for
each component of the index or custom basket arguing that such information would be costly to
maintain as the fund would be required to create a record of the value of each underlying security
in the index at the time the derivatives contract is entered into.374 We agree. Moreover, we
agree with the commenter that Form N-PORT will already require the fund to provide the
unrealized appreciation and depreciation for the option or swap contract on a monthly basis,
making the disclosure of unrealized appreciation and depreciation for components of the
underlying index unnecessary.375
Thus, if the index’s or custom basket’s components are not publicly available and the
notional amount of the derivative represents more than 1%, but less than 5%, of the net asset
value of the fund, the fund will provide the name, identifier, number of shares or notional
amount or contract value as of the trade date (all of which would be reported as negative for
short positions), and value, for (i) the 50 largest components in the index or custom basket and (ii)
any other components where the notional value for that component is over 1% of the notional
value of the index or custom basket.376 Likewise, if the index’s or custom basket’s components
are not publicly available and the notional amount of the derivative represents more than 5% of

not available), ticker (if CUSIP and ISIN are not available), or other identifier (if CUSIP, ISIN, and
ticker are not available). If other identifier is provided, the fund would indicate the type of identifier
used.

notional amount or contract value as of the trade date (all of which would be reported as negative
for short positions), and value, for all of the index’s or custom basket’s components.377
We also proposed to require funds to report the delta of options and warrants, which is
the ratio of the change in the value of the option or warrant to the change in the value of the
reference instrument.378 This measure reflects the sensitivity of the value of the option or
warrant to changes in the price of the reference instrument.
We requested comment on our proposal to require funds to report the delta for options
and warrants. Some commenters supported our proposal to require funds to report delta for
options and warrants.379 Others objected to the Commission’s proposal to collect delta because
they believed it would provide little value because of the time delay between the end of the
period date and the reporting date, and could be difficult to calculate.380 Others did not
specifically object to the Commission requiring delta, but requested that delta not be released to
the public citing concerns of investor confusion regarding the subjectivity of delta (i.e. the
calculation of delta is necessarily based upon inputs and assumptions that could vary between
funds).381
We continue to believe that the reporting of delta for options and warrants will provide
the Commission a more accurate measure of a fund’s full exposure to the fund’s investments in

options and warrants. Accordingly, we believe that having the measurement of delta for options
is important for the Commission to measure the impact, on a fund or group of funds that holds
options on an asset, of a change in such asset’s price. Also, as the Commission has previously
observed, funds can use written options as a form of obtaining a leveraged position in an
underlying reference asset.382 Having a measurement of exposures created through this type of
leverage can help the Commission better understand the risks that the fund faces as asset prices
change, since the use of this type of leverage can magnify losses or gains in assets. Thus, while
we acknowledge that the Commission will receive delta 30 days after the reporting date, it will
still be a useful tool for the Commission and its staff to understand the fund’s relative exposures
to changes in the price of the underlying reference asset. Moreover, as discussed more fully
below in section II.A.4, for the reasons discussed in that section, we have determined to make the
reporting of delta non-public for all three months, which should mitigate commenters concerns
regarding investor confusion relating to the subjectivity of calculating delta. Finally, based upon
staff experience, we believe that it is general industry practice to calculate delta for options,
warrants, and swaps.
As a result, we are adopting the requirement that funds report delta for options and
warrants as proposed. While one commenter noted that there are a variety of models to calculate
delta and requested a specific approach to calculating delta, based on staff experience analyzing
these metrics, we believe that such differences are not so large that the results would not be
useful to the staff. Therefore we are not requiring specific delta formulas be used.383 As a result,

in order to reduce burdens and provide clarity to funds, as discussed above, we are adopting an
instruction that will allow funds to use their own (or their service provider’s) methodologies to
calculate data for reports on Form N-PORT, including delta, subject to the instruction and other
guidance relating to the Form.384
For futures and forwards (other than foreign exchange forwards, which share similarities
with foreign exchange swaps and should be reported accordingly as discussed below), as
proposed, Form N-PORT would require funds to report a description of the reference instrument,
the payoff profile (i.e., long or short), expiration date, aggregate notional amount or contract
value as of the trade date, and unrealized appreciation or depreciation.385 The description of the
reference instrument would conform to the same requirements as the description of reference
instruments for warrants and options.386
One commenter noted that the terms “foreign exchange swaps” and “foreign exchange
forwards” are defined terms under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act and such terms exclude non-deliverable forwards, which are included in the
Commodity Exchange Act’s definition of swaps. As the commenter pointed out, such
distinctions between deliverable and non-deliverable forwards are not relevant in the context of
reporting of forward contracts on Form N-PORT.387 Accordingly, in order to avoid confusion,

interest-rate options, and others. The proposal could be modified to define a specific approach with
specific derivations of inputs for the most common type of derivatives.”).

See also Department of Treasury, Determination of Foreign Exchange Swaps and Foreign Exchange
Forwards under the Commodity Exchange Act (Nov. 16, 2012) (exempting foreign exchange swaps

124

we are replacing the terms “foreign exchange swaps” and “foreign exchange forwards” with
terms used in Regulation S-X, “forward foreign currency contracts” and “foreign currency
swaps,” which make no distinction between deliverable and non-deliverable foreign exchange
contracts.388 Other than modifying these terms, which should have no effect on how information
is reported on Form N-PORT, we received no other comments to this section of Form N-PORT.
We are therefore adopting the reporting for futures and forwards as proposed.389
We also received no comments relating to our proposed elements for reporting of foreign
forward foreign currency contracts and foreign currency swaps (other than the above-mentioned
term changes) and are adopting it substantially as proposed with one clarifying instruction with
respect to reporting depreciation.390 Funds will therefore report the amount and description of
currency sold, amount and description of currency purchased, settlement date, and unrealized
appreciation or depreciation.391
For swaps (other than foreign currency swaps), as proposed, funds would report the
description and terms of payments necessary for a user of financial information to understand the
nature and terms of payments to be paid and received, including, as applicable: a description of
the reference instrument, obligation, or index; financing rate to be paid or received; floating or

and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of “swap”); rule 3a69-2(c)(1) of the Securities
Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.3a69-2].

Throughout, Item C.11, where funds must report unrealized appreciation or depreciation, we added
the clarifying instruction that depreciation should be reported as a negative number. See Item

fixed rates to be paid and received; and payment frequency.392 The description of the reference
instrument would conform to the same requirements as the description of reference instruments
for forwards and futures.393 Funds would also report upfront payments or receipts, unrealized
appreciation or depreciation, termination or maturity date, and notional amount.394
Commenters expressed concern that publicly disclosing financing rates for swaps
contracts could harm shareholders as financing rates are commercial terms of a deal that are
negotiated between the fund and the counterparty to the swap.395 As several commenters
discussed, disclosure of favorable variable financing rates could result in costs to the fund in the
form of less favorable variable financing rates for future transactions.396 Counterparties could
also choose not to transact with funds as a consequence of this disclosure, increasing the
competition for the remaining counterparties resulting in higher fees for funds. However, the
increased disclosure of a swap’s terms may also improve the ability of other funds to negotiate
more favorable terms resulting in more favorable fees and financing terms for funds. Further, we
designed Form N-PORT to provide information sufficient to allow our staff, investors, and other
potential users to better understand the investments held in a fund’s portfolio. Without
information like the payment terms for derivative instruments, valuing the risks and rewards of
such an investment could be difficult for investors and other potential users. Moreover, in order
392

See Item C.11.f of proposed Form N-PORT. Funds would separately report the description and terms
of payments to be paid and received. The description of the reference instrument, obligation, or index
would include the information required to be reported for the descriptions of reference instruments for
warrants, options, futures, or forwards.

See, e.g., MFS Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter (public benefit of

public reporting of financing rates is discussed in more detail below in section II.A.4.

for the Commission to understand such investments, the Commission staff must have access to
the terms and conditions of such investments, of which the financing rates are a critical part.
One commenter noted that proposed Form N-PORT did not include certain data elements
that relate to the detailed calculations of cash flows, such as inflation index based values and lags
associated with principal resets for over-the-counter swaps and caps and floors embedded in
swaps.397
As we discussed above, as proposed, Form N-PORT would require funds to provide a
description and terms necessary for a user of financial information to understand the terms of
payments to be paid and received.398 We recognize that in complying with these instructions
funds could determine that they should report terms like those suggested by the commenter for
certain instruments. Given the variety of swaps instruments – for example, interest rate swaps,
credit defaults swaps, total return swaps, each with its own respective terms and conditions –
however, we do not believe that it is appropriate to specify the terms of the swap with the level
of granularity suggested by the commenter beyond what we specified in the instructions to Form
N-PORT. As a result, we are adopting Form N-PORT’s swaps reporting section substantially as
proposed. 399
Finally, for derivatives that do not fall into the categories enumerated in Form N-PORT,
we proposed that funds would provide a description of information sufficient for a user of
financial information to understand the nature and terms of the investment.400 This description
would include, as applicable, currency, payment terms, payment rates, call or put features,

exercise price, and a description of the reference instrument, among other things.401 As proposed,
the description of the reference instrument would conform to the same requirements as the
description of reference instruments for options and warrants.402 Funds would also report
termination or maturity (if any), notional amount(s), unrealized appreciation or depreciation, and
the delta (if applicable).403
We received no comments on this aspect of the proposal other than one commenter that
noted that the proposed list of derivative “categories” could leave major categories of derivatives
to be reported as “other.”404 As we discussed above, we continue to recognize that new
derivatives products will evolve, and therefore Form N-PORT’s derivatives reporting
requirements are designed to be flexible enough to include the reporting of new investment
products that may emerge. Moreover, funds may only categorize a derivatives as “other” if none
of the identified categories applies, thus limiting the number of derivatives that will be
categorized as “other.”405 For these reasons, we are adopting the reporting requirements for
other derivatives as proposed.406

Securities on Loan and Cash Collateral Reinvestment

and LEI of the counterparty (if any), as well as the aggregate value of all securities on loan to the
counterparty.407 We are also requiring, substantially as proposed, that funds report on Form NPORT, on an investment-by-investment level, information about securities on loan and the
reinvestment of cash collateral that secures the loans. For each investment held by the fund, a
fund will report: (1) whether any portion of the investment was on loan by the fund, and, if so,
the value of the investment on loan;408 (2) whether any amount of the investment represented
reinvestment of the cash collateral and, if so, the dollar amount of such reinvestment;409 and (3)
whether any portion of the investment represented non-cash collateral treated as part of the
fund’s assets and received to secure loaned securities and, if so, the value of such non-cash
collateral.410
These disclosures will provide information about how funds reinvest the cash collateral
received from securities lending activity and should allow for more accurate determination of the
value of collateral securing such loans. This information will also allow us to determine whether
funds that are relying on exemptive orders or no-action assurances to engage in securities lending
are complying with any associated conditions regarding collateral received for such activities.
This will improve the ability of Commission staff, as well as investors, brokers, dealers, and
other market participants to assess collateral reinvestment risks and associated potential liquidity
risk and risk of loss, as well as better understand any potential leverage creation through the

reinvestment of collateral.411 These disclosures will also help identify those investments that
funds might have to sell or redeem in the event of widespread termination or default by
borrowers. More generally, we expect that this information will help to address concerns
expressed by industry participants about the lack of transparency in funds’ securities lending
transactions.412
One commenter suggested that non-cash collateral information should not be publicly
disclosed but did not elaborate on why such information should be kept nonpublic.413 As
discussed herein, we believe that disclosure of this information can serve many purposes,
including improving the ability of Commission staff, as well as investors, brokers, dealers, and
other market participants to better understand the collateral received by funds and the associated
potential liquidity and loss risks, as well as identification of those instruments that one or more
funds might have to sell in the event of default by borrowers. For these reasons, we are
requiring, as proposed, that this information be publicly reported on Form N-PORT.
Several commenters recommended that non-cash collateral be reported in aggregate
terms rather than as individual portfolio positions.414 As discussed above in section II.A.2.d, one
commenter explained that funds typically do not treat non-cash collateral as fund assets and
consequently do not generally include non-cash collateral in their schedule of portfolio

411

As discussed above, commenters to the FSOC Notice suggested that enhanced securities lending
disclosures could be beneficial to investors and counterparties. See supra footnote 190.

investments.415 As discussed above, we are revising Form N-PORT to add a new Item requiring
funds to report the aggregate principal amount and aggregate value of each type of non-cash
collateral received for loaned securities that is not treated as a fund asset.416 If the fund does
treat the non-cash collateral as a fund asset and it is therefore included in the fund’s schedule of
portfolio investments, the fund will identify such assets on an investment-by-investment basis, as
proposed.417
h.

Miscellaneous Securities

In Part D of Form N-PORT, as we proposed, and as currently permitted by Regulation SX, funds will have the option of identifying and reporting certain investments as “miscellaneous
securities.”418 Specifically, Form N-PORT permits funds to report an aggregate amount not
exceeding 5 percent of the total value of their portfolio investments in one amount as
“Miscellaneous securities,” provided that securities so listed are not restricted, have been held for
not more than one year prior to the date of the related balance sheet, and have not previously
been reported by name to the shareholders, or set forth in any registration statement, application,
or report to shareholders or otherwise made available to the public. Funds electing to separately
report miscellaneous securities will use the same Item numbers and report the same information
that would be reported for each investment if it were not a miscellaneous security.419 Consistent
with the disclosure regime under Regulation S-X, all such responses regarding miscellaneous

securities will be nonpublic and will be used for Commission use only, notwithstanding the fact
that all other information reported for the third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter on Form NPORT will otherwise be publicly available.420 Keeping information related to these investments
nonpublic may serve to guard against the premature release of those securities positions and thus
deter front-running and other predatory trading practices, while still allowing the Commission to
have a complete record of the portfolio for monitoring, analysis, and checking for compliance
with Regulation S-X.421 The only information publicly reported for miscellaneous securities will
be their aggregate value, which is consistent with current practice as permitted by Regulation SX.422
Commenters generally supported the separate nonpublic disclosure of individual
miscellaneous securities, and noted that the current reporting provisions under Regulation S-X
regarding miscellaneous securities have been effective and not abused.423 One commenter
sought clarification as to whether an investment identified as a miscellaneous security in reports
filed on Form N-PORT for the third month of each fiscal quarter (i.e., reports that would be
made public) would also need to be identified as a miscellaneous security in reports for the first
and second months of each fiscal quarter (i.e., reports that would be nonpublic).424 As discussed
further below, all information reported on Form N-PORT for the first and second months of each
fiscal quarter will be nonpublic. Consequently, there is no need for funds to designate any of

See rule 12-12 of Regulation S-X.

their investments for those reporting periods as miscellaneous securities. For additional clarity,
however, we are adopting a modification from the proposal to instruct funds to only identify
miscellaneous securities in reports filed for the last month of each fiscal quarter.425 Another
commenter questioned whether miscellaneous securities should be measured at fair value or
estimated exposure, and recommended that miscellaneous securities should be measured at
notional, or delta-adjusted exposure, rather than book value.426 As we noted in the proposal, our
intent in allowing funds to designate certain investments as miscellaneous securities is to allow
funds to continue to report such information consistent with current practice as permitted by
Regulation S-X.427 Accordingly, we continue to believe that value rather than exposure should
be used in determining which investments qualify as miscellaneous securities (i.e., investments
totaling 5 percent or less of the total value of the fund’s portfolio), which is consistent with
current practice as permitted under Regulation S-X. For these reasons, we are adopting this
aspect of Form N-PORT as proposed.

Explanatory Notes

In Part E of Form N-PORT, as was proposed, funds will have the option of providing
explanatory notes relating to the filing.428 Any notes provided in public reports on Form
N-PORT (i.e., reports on Form N-PORT for the third month of the fund’s fiscal quarter) will be
publicly available, whereas notes provided in nonpublic filings of Form N-PORT will remain

miscellaneous securities….”).

of explaining any assumptions that they made in responding to any questions in the form).

133

nonpublic.429 Funds will also report, as applicable, the Part or Item number(s) to which the notes
are related.430
These notes, which will be optional, could be used to explain assumptions that funds
made in responding to specific items in Form N-PORT. Funds could also provide context for
seemingly anomalous responses that may benefit from further explanation or discuss issues that
could not be adequately addressed elsewhere given the constraints of the form. Similar
information in other contexts has assisted Commission staff in better understanding the
information provided by funds, and we expect that explanatory notes provided on Form N-PORT
would do the same.431
One commenter supported the proposal to allow funds to report explanatory notes, but
requested that the notes remain nonpublic.432 Likewise, another commenter recommended that
funds be allowed to designate explanatory notes as nonpublic, on a case-by-case basis.433 We are
partially persuaded by these requests. We believe that to the extent the explanatory notes would
be helpful to investors, such notes ideally should be publicly available. We also note that similar
explanatory notes are available on Form N-MFP and are publicly available.434 However, we
recognize that certain items on Form N-PORT will involve nonpublic information, and thus we
believe it is appropriate that explanatory notes related to those items should be nonpublic as well.

429

See infra section II.A.4.

430

See Part E of Form N-PORT.

431

See Dechert Comment Letter.

434

See Item C.24 of Form N-MFP (“Explanatory notes. Disclose any other information that may be

134

As a result, we have determined that explanatory notes related to nonpublic items such as
miscellaneous securities, country of risk and economic exposure, or delta for individual options,
warrants, and convertible securities will be nonpublic.435 However, explanatory notes related to
other items on Form N-PORT will be publicly available.
As discussed above, funds may generally use their own internal methodologies and the
conventions of their service providers in reporting information on Form N-PORT.436 Funds may
explain any of their methodologies, including related assumptions, in Part E of Form N-PORT.437

Exhibits

In Part F of Form N-PORT, for reports filed for the end of the first and third quarters of
the fund’s fiscal year, as proposed, a fund will also attach the fund’s complete portfolio holdings
as of the close of the period covered by the report. These portfolio holdings will be presented in
accordance with the schedules set forth in §§210.12-12 to 12-14 of Regulation S-X, and will not
be required to be reported in a structured data format.
As discussed further below in section II.B, we are rescinding Form N-Q because reports
on Form N-PORT for the first and third fiscal quarters will make similar reports on Form N-Q
unnecessarily duplicative. While we recognize that the quarterly, publicly disclosed reports on
Form N-PORT will provide structured data to investors and other potential users, we also
recognize that some individual investors may not want to access the data in an XML format. We
believe that such investors might prefer that portfolio holdings schedules for the first and third

economic exposure) and footnotes 378–381and accompanying text (discussing delta for options,

See Instruction G to Form N-PORT (“A Fund may explain any of its methodologies, including related
assumptions, in Part E.”).

135

quarters continue to be presented using the form and content specified by Regulation S-X, which
investors are accustomed to viewing in reports on Form N-Q and in shareholder reports.
Therefore, as proposed, we are requiring that, for reports on Form N-PORT for the first and third
quarters of a fund’s fiscal year, the fund will attach its complete portfolio holdings for that fiscal
quarter, presented in accordance with the schedules set forth in §§210.12-12 to 12-14 of
Regulation S-X.
Requiring funds to attach these portfolio holdings schedules to reports on Form N-PORT
will provide the Commission, investors, and other potential users with access to funds’ current
and historical portfolio holdings for those funds’ first and third fiscal quarters. This will also
consolidate these disclosures in a central location, together with other fund portfolio holdings
disclosures in shareholder reports and reports on Form N-CSR for funds’ second and fourth
fiscal quarters.
Consistent with current practice and our proposal, funds will have until 60 days after the
end of their second and fourth fiscal quarters to transmit reports to shareholders containing
portfolio holdings schedules prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X for that reporting
period.438 In addition, although we proposed that funds would have 30 days after the end of their
first and third fiscal quarters to file reports on Form N-PORT that would include portfolio
holdings schedules prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X, we have modified this
requirement from the proposal to allow funds 60 days.
Several commenters requested that funds be permitted to file Regulation S-X compliant
portfolio holdings schedules within 60 days after the end of the reporting period for the first and

section II.C (discussing our amendments to Regulation S-X).

136

third fiscal quarters consistent with how Form N-Q is filed today, rather than within 30 days after
the end of the reporting period, as we proposed.439 In light of the concerns raised by commenters
about the time needed to prepare, validate, and file this information, as well as the fact that these
schedules are designed for the benefit for investors rather than the Commission and regardless of
when this information is filed with us it would not be made public to investors until 60 days after
the end of the reporting period, we are extending the deadline to file such information until 60
days after the end of the relevant reporting period for the first and third fiscal quarters.440

Reporting of Information on Form N-PORT

As discussed above, we proposed that funds would report information on Form N-PORT
in XML, so that Commission staff, investors, and other potential users could download
structured data for immediate aggregation and comparison, for example by creating databases of
fund portfolio information to be used for data analysis. Forms N-CSR and N-Q are not currently
filed in a structured format, which results in reports that are comprehensible to a human reader,
but are not suitable for automated processing, and generally require filers to reformat the
required information from the way it is stored for normal business uses.441 By contrast, requiring
that reports on Form N-PORT be structured would allow the Commission and other potential
users to combine information from more than one report in an automated way to, for example,
construct a data base of fund portfolio investments without additional manual entry.442

Forms N-CSR and N-Q are required to be filed in HTML or ASCII/SGML. See rule 301 of
Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.301]; EDGAR, Filer Manual – Volume II, Version 27 (June 2014) at 51, available at https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/edgarfm-vol2-v27.pdf.

See, e.g., IDC Comment Letter (“We fully support the SEC’s efforts to collect information in a
structured data format to enhance its ability to aggregate and analyze the information and data.”); but

137

Most commenters generally supported reporting in a structured format. Several
commenters supported our proposal to require reports on Form N-PORT in XML, 443 while
others advocated for the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”), a tagged system
that is based on XML and was created specifically for the purpose of reporting financial and
business information.444 Another commenter noted that the Commission should standardize the
formatting requirements across all fund reporting in order to ease the burden on funds that would
have to comply with different formatting requirements (i.e., ASCII/TXT, HTML, XBRL,
XML).445 Finally, another commenter noted that much of the information that will be reported in
reports on Form N-PORT is already available in other Commission filings and is duplicative.446
Based upon our experiences with Forms N-MFP and PF, both of which require filers to
report information in an XML format, we believe that requiring funds to report information on
Form N-PORT in an XML format is the most appropriate method of structuring this type of

or necessary for fund filings). See also Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 92-93.

See Schnase Comment Letter (Commission should also ease the burdens on funds by allowing funds

fund data into a pre-formatted web form.

data.447 Moreover, the interoperability of data between Forms N-MFP, PF, and N-PORT will aid
the staff with cross-checking information reported to the Commission and in monitoring the fund
industry.448 As discussed further below in the economic analysis, the XML format will also
improve the quality of the information disclosed by imposing constraints on how the information
will be provided, by providing a built-in validation framework of the data in the reports.449
While we acknowledge that some of the information we are requiring in Form N-PORT is
duplicative to information filed in other forms, filing this information in an XML format will
allow the staff to more efficiently review and analyze data for industry trends and risk
monitoring purposes. We are therefore adopting the requirement that reports on Form N-PORT
be filed in an XML format as proposed.450
We considered, as several commenters suggested, alternative formats to XML, such as
XBRL. However, while XBRL allows issuers to capture the rich complexity of financial
information presented in accordance with GAAP, we believe that XML is more appropriate for
the reporting requirements that we are adopting. Form N-PORT, as well as Form N-CEN, as
adopted, will contain a set of relatively simple characteristics of the fund’s portfolio- and
position-level data, such as fund and class identifying information, that is more suited for XML
than XBRL, as explained further in section III.F below.

447

We anticipate that the XML structured data file would be compatible with a wide range of open
source and proprietary information management software applications. Continued advances in
structured data software, search engines, and other web-based tools may further enhance the
accessibility and usability of the data. See, e.g., Money Market Fund Reform, Investment Company
Act Release No. 29132 (Feb. 23, 2010) [75 FR 10059 (Mar. 4, 2010)] (“Money Market Fund Reform
2010 Release”) at n. 341.

We also considered, as one commenter suggested, ways to standardize the formatting
requirements across all fund reporting. However, based on staff experience reviewing fund
filings, we believe that different filing formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, XML) are appropriate for
different types of filings, depending on their uses. For example, while PDF and HTML filings
might be appropriate based on the filer, the content, and the end-user of the data, the PDF and
HTML formats are not designed for conveying large quantities of data that require more robust
validations to ensure data quality and consistency for aggregation, comparison, and analysis
purposes.451
We proposed that funds report information on Form N-PORT on a monthly basis, no later
than 30 days after the close of each month.452 For the reasons discussed herein, and consistent
with current disclosure practices, only information reported for the third month of each fund’s
fiscal quarter would be publicly available, and such information would not be made public until
60 days after the end of the third month of the fund’s fiscal quarter.453
Several commenters requested that we instead require quarterly reporting, either
permanently or for an initial period, citing to either data security concerns (discussed below), the
increased filing burdens of Form N-PORT, or both.454 However, the quarterly portfolio reports

451

452

Commission staff understands that certain funds currently report their investments to shareholders as
of the last business day of the reporting period, while other funds report their investments as of the
last calendar day of the reporting period. In recognition of this fact, and in an effort to avoid
disruptions to current fund operations, the information reported on Form N-PORT may reflect the
fund’s investments as of the last business day, or last calendar day, of the month for which the report
is filed.

453

As discussed above, portfolio schedules are currently available to the public in reports that are mailed
to shareholders or filed with the Commission either 60 or 70 days following the end of each reporting
period. See supra footnote 27 and accompanying text.

that the Commission currently receives on Forms N-Q and N-CSR can quickly become stale due
to the turnover of portfolio securities and fluctuations in the values of portfolio investments.
Monthly portfolio reporting will increase the frequency of portfolio reporting, which we believe
will be useful to the staff for fund monitoring, particularly in times of market stress. This will
also triple the frequency that data is reported to the Commission in a given year, as well as
ensure that the Commission has more current information, which should in turn enhance the
ability of staff to perform analyses of funds in the course of monitoring for industry trends, or
identifying issues for examination or inquiry.
Notwithstanding data security concerns, which are discussed further below, commenters
generally supported the proposed requirement for monthly reporting.455 However, some
commenters requested that we extend the monthly reporting deadline from 30 days to a longer
period, such as 45 or 60 days.456 Commenters noted that the data required by Form N-PORT
resides on multiple platforms, including with third-party service providers, and that the time it
will take to compile data, verify it, and convert it to an XML filing format is significant. 457

funds that invest heavily in bonds and derivatives, could take longer to complete their month-end
reconciliations.458 Finally, the same commenter noted that retrieving information from multiple
portfolio managers of sub-advised funds could also delay the process of month-end
reconciliations.459 Other commenters requested that we revise the filing periods for closed-end
funds because closed-end funds may not have approved NAVs for 45-days or longer following
month-end.460
We are requiring that funds file reports on Form N-PORT within 30 days of month-end.
Based on staff experience with funds and fund filings, we believe that 30 days is sufficient time
to report this information. Separately, we believe that requiring funds to file reports more than
30 days after month end will result in less timely data being submitted to the Commission, which
will reduce the utility of portfolio information to the Commission. Therefore, we believe a 30day filing period strikes the proper balance even though we recognize that preparing reports on
Form N-PORT will initially require a significant effort by funds.461 Moreover, as one
commenter noted while advocating for bi-monthly or quarterly reporting, lag times of more than
30 days would make monthly reporting impractical, as reports would overlap with preparation

458

See State Street Comment Letter. The same commenter also noted that funds that have high volumes
of over-the-counter derivatives trading would need more time to file reports on Form N-PORT
because it would take the funds time to collect all of the fully executed derivatives contracts from
counterparties before reporting at month-end.

459

See id.

460

See Comment Letter of UMB Fund Services, Inc. (Aug. 14, 2015); Carol Singer Comment Letter.
Based upon staff experience, it is our understanding that most closed-end funds strike their NAV on
at-least a monthly basis. Those that do not can do so, for Form N-PORT reporting purposes, by using
the internal methodologies consistent with how they report internally and to current and prospective
investors. See General Instruction G of Form N-PORT.

time.462 We also note that several commenters also noted that reporting on the same basis the
fund uses to calculate NAV (which is generally on a T+1 basis), which the Form, as adopted,
explicitly requires, will take less time relative to reporting on a T+0 basis, which is used for
financial reporting.463 For each of these reasons, we are adopting, as proposed, our requirement
for reports on Form N-PORT to be filed with the Commission within 30 days of month-end.464
Several commenters discussed the need for appropriate data security practices for the data
on Form N-PORT that will be kept nonpublic.465 In many cases, these commenters stated that
these data items could be competitively sensitive and that a breach could result in harm to the
reporting funds. Some commenters also highlighted the need for appropriate data security
safeguards should the Commission determine in the future to share any of the nonpublic
information with one or more other regulatory agencies.466 Some of these commenters believed
that, before requiring nonpublic reports on Form N-PORT, the Commission should complete an
462

Dreyfus Comment Letter (advocating for bi-monthly or quarterly reporting, with 45-60 days to file
reports on Form N-PORT).

463

See Schwab Comment Letter (reporting that converting from T+1 to T+0 accounting would add
approximately 6-10 days to the process of compiling data for Form N-PORT). Commenters
acknowledged that reporting holdings on a T+1 basis would save time and compiling data for monthend reporting. Some commenters stated that 45-days would be needed to file reports on Form NPORT on a T+0 basis, however they suggested that 30 days could be sufficient with T+1 reporting.
See Schwab Comment letter (urging the use of T+1 accounting or “alternatively” recommending a
minimum of 45 days); Wells Fargo Comment Letter (recommending a 45 day reporting period if T+0
reporting is required); Others explicitly recommended a 45-day filing period even if we allow filing
on T+1 basis. See ICI Comment Letter; Oppenheimer Comment Letter.

that the Commission revisit its practices on an ongoing basis.467 Some commenters suggested
that the Commission provide additional information about its data security controls or its
protocols for responding to an identified breach.468 As discussed above, several commenters
requested that we require quarterly, rather than monthly, reports on Form N-PORT, citing to data
security concerns.469
The Commission recognizes the importance of sound data security practices and
protocols for nonpublic information, including information that may be competitively sensitive.
The Commission has substantial experience with the storage and use of nonpublic information
reported on Form PF, delayed public disclosure of information on Form N-MFP (although the
Commission no longer delays public disclosure of reports on Form N-MFP), as well as other
nonpublic information that the Commission handles in its course of business. Commission staff
is carefully evaluating the data security protocols that will apply to nonpublic data reported on
Form N-PORT in light of the specific recommendations and concerns raised by commenters.
Drawing on its experience, the staff is working to design controls and systems for the use and
handling of Form N-PORT data in a manner that reflects the sensitivity of the data and is

Disclosure of Information Reported on Form N-PORT

As discussed above, we proposed that the information reported on Form N-PORT for the
third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter be made publicly available 60 days after the end of the
Fund’s fiscal quarter.471 We also proposed that the information reported on Form N-PORT for
the first and second months of each fund’s fiscal quarter, and any information reported in Part D
of the Form, not be made public.472
Comments were mixed on this aspect of the proposal. We received a number of
comments objecting to the public disclosure of any information on Form N-PORT on a quarterly
basis.473 Others generally supported, or did not oppose, quarterly public disclosure of Form
N-PORT, but requested that certain information items be kept nonpublic.474 In discussing these

470

See Form PF Adopting Release, supra footnote 80. We recognize that there are differences between
the N-PORT reporting requirements and the Form PF reporting requirements, such as frequency,
granularity, and registration status, and our recognition of these differences guides our evaluation of
appropriate measures for preservation of data security for reported information.

alternatives, several commenters noted similarity to the data that the Commission collects on a
nonpublic basis from private funds on Form PF.475 Finally, some commenters called for more
frequent public disclosure of the information on Form N-PORT, as the information could assist
intermediaries and market professionals with evaluating whether funds are consistently executing
their stated portfolio strategies.476 These comments are addressed below.
Most commenters who addressed this issue did not support the public reporting of all
Form N-PORT filings (i.e., public disclosure on a monthly basis).477 Such commenters generally
believed that disclosure of all month-end Form N-PORT filings could increase the risk of frontrunning or free-riding, ultimately harming investors.478 These commenters noted that more
frequent disclosures would provide non-investors with free access to the research and analysis
that investors pay advisers for through management and other fees.
As discussed further below, commenters that believed that Form N-PORT should remain
nonpublic, or that believed certain information items should remain nonpublic, raised two
concerns. First, some commenters argued that some of the information on Form N-PORT could
potentially be proprietary, and lead to harm to the fund and its investors if publicly released. For
example, for derivatives, payment terms, including financing rates, are negotiated rates; as a
result, commenters expressed concern that public disclosure may harm a fund’s ability to
country of risk; and derivative financing rates, custom baskets); BlackRock Derivatives Comment
Letter (derivatives positions).

negotiate favorable terms on behalf of its investors.479 Similarly commenters argued that
disclosing detailed information on the components of nonpublic indexes could violate the
intellectual property rights that index providers might assert and, as a result, harm investors who
may lose the benefit of index products that would no longer be available to them, should an
index provider choose to no longer do business with a fund, rather than have its index’s
components made publicly available.
Second, some commenters noted that if certain information items, such as the proposed
risk metrics, monthly return information, and country of risk are publicly disclosed, it could
potentially confuse and mislead investors.480 For example, some commenters argued that risk
metrics are calculated using inputs and assumptions that could make them subjective and
investors could mistakenly seek to compare risk metrics across funds or believe that risk metric
data represents a fund’s overall risk.481 Similarly, monthly return data (including monthly
returns attributable to derivatives) could cause investors to mistakenly focus on short-term results
or otherwise confuse investors.482 Likewise, commenters noted that the country of risk
determination is subjective and open to different determinations among funds and advisers which
may lead to investor confusion.483 Finally, some commenters that argued Form N-PORT should

remain completely nonpublic questioned the utility of the information in Form N-PORT for
investors.484
Subject to discrete information items discussed further below, the Commission is
adopting as proposed the public disclosure of funds’ quarter-end Form N-PORT with a 60-day
delay from the reporting period. We decline to adopt the suggestion of some commenters that all
reports filed on Form N-PORT remain nonpublic. The Commission believes that the public
reporting requirements of Form N-PORT generally are appropriate given the filer’s status as a
registered investment company with the Commission, which is based on the tenets of disclosure
and transparency to fund investors, and not as a private fund.485 Moreover, as we discuss below,
funds currently publicly report holdings information on a quarterly basis through Forms N-CSR
and N-Q. We also note that Section 45(a) of the Investment Company Act requires information
in reports filed with the Commission pursuant to the Investment Company Act be made public
unless we find that public disclosure is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors.486 For the reasons discussed above, we continue to believe that
public disclosure of information about most of the items required on Form N-PORT is
appropriate in the public interest, as well as for the protection of investors. Although Form NPORT is not primarily designed for disclosing information to individual investors, we believe
that many investors, particularly institutional investors, as well as academic researchers, financial
484

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter I; Schwab Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter.

See, e.g., section 45(a) of the Investment Company Act (requiring information in reports filed with
the Commission pursuant to the Investment Company Act be made public unless we find that public
disclosure is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors).
Regarding those commenters that compared the information that Form N-PORT requires to that in
Form PF, we note that Form PF is filed by private funds pursuant to Advisers Act section 204(b),
making such data subject to the confidentiality protections applicable to data required to be filed
under that section.

486

148

analysts, and economic research firms, could use the information reported on Form N-PORT to
evaluate fund portfolios and assess the potential for risks and returns of a particular fund.487
Accordingly, whether directly or through third parties, we believe that the periodic public
disclosure of the information to be reported on Form N-PORT could benefit fund investors.
Moreover, we generally believe that investors should have access to portfolio information in a
structured data format, and be given the opportunity to make their own decisions regarding the
usefulness of the data. We have, however, made several modifications to our proposals,
discussed above, in response to commenters.
We believe that, on balance, investors would benefit from the information that will be
reported on Form N-PORT. Likewise, the Commission continues to believe that public
availability of information, including the types of information that will be collected on Form NPORT that may not currently be reported or disclosed by funds, can benefit investors and other
potential users by assisting them in making more informed investment decisions.
We continue to recognize, however, that more frequent portfolio disclosure than is
currently required could potentially harm fund shareholders by expanding the opportunities for
professional traders to exploit this information by engaging in predatory trading practices, such
as trading ahead of funds, often called “front-running.”488 Similarly, the Commission is sensitive
to concerns that more frequent portfolio disclosure may facilitate the ability of non-investors to
“free ride” on a mutual fund’s investment research, by allowing those investors to reverse

487

See Russ Wermers Comment Letter; see generally Franco Comment Letter (“... the Commission
[should] adopt a more expansive view of its disclosure rulemaking mandate and more specifically a
view that considers layered forms of its disclosure (and disclosure documents) that meet the needs of
different constituent end-users of disclosure.”).

engineer and “copycat” the fund’s investment strategies and obtain for free the benefits of fund
research and investment strategies that are paid for by fund shareholders.489 Both front-running
and copycatting can adversely affect funds and their shareholders.490 We raised such concerns in
the Proposing Release, and, many commenters that discussed public disclosure of portfolio
information agreed with these concerns.491 However, one commenter argued that such effects
were unlikely.492
We recognize that some free-riding and front running activity can occur even with
quarterly disclosure, with the potential for investor harm.493 Conversely, however, and as we
noted in the Proposing Release, we previously received petitions for quarterly disclosures, noting
numerous benefits that quarterly disclosure of portfolio schedules could provide, including
allowing investors to better monitor the extent to which their funds’ portfolios overlap, and
hence enabling investors to make more informed asset allocation decisions, and providing
investors with more information about how a fund is complying with its stated investment
objective.494 The Commission cited many of these benefits when it adopted Form N-Q, and

See infra section III.B.3

494

See Quarterly Portfolio Holdings Adopting Release, supra footnote 421, at n. 32 and accompanying
text (discussing prior investor petitions for rulemaking). Investors that petitioned for quarterly
disclosure also argued that increasing the frequency of portfolio disclosure would expose ‘‘style

shed light on and prevent several potential forms of portfolio manipulation, such as ‘‘window

150

based on staff experience and outreach, believes that the current practice of quarterly portfolio
disclosures provides benefits to investors, notwithstanding the opportunities for front-running
and reverse engineering it might create.495
We have considered both the benefits to the Commission, investors, and other potential
users of public portfolio disclosures, including the reporting of such disclosures in a structured
format and additional portfolio information that will be required on Form N-PORT, as well as
the potential costs associated with making that information available to the public, which could
be ultimately borne by investors.496 Accordingly, in an attempt to minimize these potential costs
and competitive harms from front-running and reverse engineering, we are requiring public
disclosure of fund reports on Form N-PORT once each quarter, rather than monthly. This
maintains the status quo regarding the frequency and timing of public portfolio disclosure, while
providing investors and other potential users with the benefit of having more detailed portfolio
information in a structured format.
As commenters pointed out, we recognize that we are requiring additional data points in
Form N-PORT, as well as requiring the data to be structured, which represents a change
regarding the scope of information available to the public. As discussed above, however, we
believe that generally this additional information can benefit investors. Additionally, while we

are publicly disclosed, in order to convey an impression that the manager has been investing in

order to drive up the price of the stocks and inflate the fund’s performance results).
495

See id.

496

In doing so, we also considered the various comment letters that we received regarding our proposal
to make the third month’s report public, and the costs and benefits of doing so. See, e.g., SIFMA
Comment Letter II; SIFMA Comment Letter I; Schwab Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; T.
Rowe Price Comment Letter; see also Franco Comment Letter; Morningstar Comment Letter.

151

recognize that an increase in the amount of publicly available information has the potential to
facilitate predatory trading, as discussed in section III.B.3 below, we do not believe that quarterly
public disclosure with a 60-day lag will have a significant, additional competitive impact. We
discuss commenters’ concerns about specific data items below.
Funds are currently required to disclose their portfolio investments quarterly, via public
filings with the Commission and semi-annual reports distributed to shareholders, with the
exception of “miscellaneous securities” which funds are not required to disclose pursuant to
Regulation S-X. Consequently, the Commission will not make public the information reported
for the first and second months of each fund’s fiscal quarter on Form N-PORT, nor any
“miscellaneous securities” reported for the third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter.497 Only
information reported for the third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter on Form N-PORT will be
made publicly available, and such information will not be made public until 60 days after the end
of the third month of the fund’s fiscal quarter.498
We continue to believe that maintaining the status quo with regard to the frequency and
the time lag of portfolio reporting will allow the Commission, the fund industry, and the
marketplace to assess the impact of the structured and more detailed data reported on Form
N-PORT on the mix of information available to the public, and the extent to which these changes
might affect the potential for predatory trading, before determining whether more frequent or
497

See General Instruction F of Form N-PORT.

498

We are maintaining the status quo of public disclosure of quarterly information based upon each
fund’s fiscal quarters, rather than calendar quarters, to ensure that public disclosure of information
filed on Form N-PORT will be concurrent with the public portfolio disclosures reported on a semiannual fiscal year basis on Form N-CSR. We believe that such overlap will minimize the risks of
predatory trading, because otherwise funds with fiscal year-ends that fall other than on a calendar
quarter- or year-end will have their portfolios publicly available more frequently than funds with
fiscal year-ends that fall on a calendar quarter- or year-end, thus increasing the risks to those funds
discussed above related to potential front-running or reverse engineering.

152

more timely public disclosure would be beneficial to investors in funds.499 For the reasons
discussed above, we find that it is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors to make information reported for the first and second months of each
fund’s fiscal quarter on Form N-PORT or “miscellaneous securities” reported for the third month
of each fund’s fiscal quarter publicly available.500
As noted above, some commenters, while generally supporting quarterly disclosure on
Form N-PORT, believed that certain information items should remain nonpublic. Some
commenters believed that some of the information in Form N-PORT could contain potentially
proprietary information, and lead to harm to the fund and its investors if publicly released. For
example, commenters expressed concern that public disclosure of negotiated payment terms for
derivatives, such as financing rates, could harm a fund’s ability to negotiate favorable terms.501
However, as we discussed above in section II.A.2.g.iv, we designed Form N-PORT to provide
information sufficient to allow our staff, investors, and other potential users to better understand
the investments held in a fund’s portfolio. This necessarily involves disclosing the payment
terms for derivative instruments a fund invests in. Without such information, valuing the risks
and rewards of such an investment could be difficult for investors and other potential users. We

footnotes 395–399 and accompanying text (derivatives financing rates); supra footnote 203 and
accompanying text (securities lending counterparties); supra footnote 281 and accompanying text
(repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements).

500

See section 45(a) of the Investment Company Act. Form N-PORT has also been modified from the
proposal to clarify that the Commission does not intend to make public the information reported on
Form N-PORT for the first and second months of each fund’s fiscal quarter that that is identifiable to
any particular fund or adviser or any information reported with regards to country of risk and
economic exposure, delta, or miscellaneous securities, or explanatory notes related to any of those
topics that is identifiable to any particular fund or adviser. See General Instruction F of Form NPORT. However, the SEC may use information reported on Form N-PORT in its regulatory
programs, including examinations, investigations, and enforcement actions.

See, e.g., Oppenheimer Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I.

153

therefore do not believe that it would be necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the
benefit of investors to mask such information for all reports on Form N-PORT.
Similarly, as discussed above, commenters noted that disclosing detailed information on
the components of nonpublic indexes could violate the intellectual property rights that index
providers might assert. This could result in harm to investors who may lose the benefit of index
products that would no longer be available to them, should an index provider choose to no longer
do business with a fund, rather than have its index’s components made public and open the index
to front-running and reverse engineering.502 As we discussed more fully above in section
II.A.2.g.iv, we continue to believe that it is important for the Commission, investors, and other
potential users to have transparency into a fund’s exposures to assets, regardless of whether the
fund directly holds investments in those assets or chooses to create those exposures through a
derivatives contract.503
Commenters also objected to the public disclosure of securities lending information, such
as the identity of borrowers and the aggregate value of securities on loan to a counterparty, as
such disclosures could cause securities lending counterparties, in an attempt to keep their
securities lending exposures private, to be less willing to borrow securities from funds.504
However, as we stated in section II.A.2.g.v, above, public disclosure of this information will
improve the ability of Commission staff, as well as investors, brokers, dealers, and other market
participants to better understand the collateral received by funds and associated potential
liquidity and market risks, as well as identify those instruments that one or more funds might

have to sell in the event of default by borrowers. For similar reasons, one commenter requested
that the identity of counterparties to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements be kept
nonpublic.505 However, as indicated above in section II.A.2.g.iii, such information is routinely
publicly disclosed in other contexts, and we are unaware of any evidence that such disclosures
have resulted in competitive disadvantages to the entities required to make such disclosures.
As we discussed in section II.A.2.g.ii, one commenter noted that public disclosure on
default, arrears, or deferred coupon payments raises competitive concerns when a debt security
relates to an issuer that is a private company, as private borrowers may avoid registered funds in
order to avoid public disclosure if the company becomes distressed. However, as we noted in
that section, we believe that it is important that a fund’s investors have access to this information
so that they can make fully informed decisions regarding their investment.
Finally, some commenters believed that certain items could be misinterpreted by
investors, resulting in investors being misled or confused. Specifically, some commenters
believed that monthly return data (including monthly returns attributable to derivatives) could
cause investors to mistakenly focus on short-term results or otherwise confuse investors.506 We
disagree. As discussed in section II.A.2.e above, we agree with another commenter that believed
such disclosures could improve information to investors, and noted that many funds already
disclose monthly returns.507

505

See SIFMA Comment Letter I.

506

See CRMC Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I.

507

See Morningstar Comment Letter.

155

Several commenters also believed that investors would be unduly confused by the
disclosure of the portfolio-level and position-level risk metrics.508 We decline to make the
portfolio-level risk metrics (DV01/DV100 and SDV01/SDV100) nonpublic but have determined
to keep the position-level risk metrics (delta) nonpublic for all N-PORT filings.509 We agree
with commenters that the calculation of delta can require a number of inputs and assumptions.510
As a result, reported deltas for the same or similar investment products could vary because of
complex differences in methodologies and assumptions that are not reported on the form nor
easily explained to investors. Moreover, the disclosure of delta could, for some investors, imply
a false sense of precision about how a particular investment’s valuation will change in volatile
market conditions. However, we continue to believe that such information is useful for the
Commission’s monitoring purposes, as the Commission has the ability to contact funds directly,
when necessary, to better understand a fund’s methodologies and assumptions. Thus, upon
consideration of the comments, we find that it is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors to make delta publicly available at this time.511 We
recognize that, like delta, inputs and assumptions are used for calculating DV01, DV100, and
SDV01. We believe, however, that the fact that these metrics will not be reported at the positionlevel sufficiently mitigates the potential risks discussed above. Because these measures will not
be reported by position-level, investors and other potential users will not be comparing different
risk metrics for the same investment in different funds. Similarly, we believe that portfolio level

forms to be made available to the public, unless we find that public disclosure is neither necessary nor

156

risk metrics are less likely to imply a false sense of precision for some investors because such
measures are, by design, the aggregation of each investment’s assumptions and projections.512
For similar reasons, we intend to keep information reported for country of risk and
economic exposure nonpublic.513 We are persuaded by commenters that this information is
evaluated by funds using multiple factors, making it subjective, and acknowledge that, while
useful to the Commission in terms of understanding the country-specific risks, may convey a
false level of precision.514 We also acknowledge arguments by commenters that disclosure of
such information could stifle divergences in determinations and incentivize funds to seek
homogenized determinations from third party firms, potentially rendering the information less
useful to Commission staff than if it were not publicly disclosed.515 For these reasons, we find
that it is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors
to make information reported for country of risk and economic exposure publicly available at
this time.516
Lastly, as discussed above, we recognize that explanatory notes related to nonpublic
items should be nonpublic as well.517 As a result, we find that it is neither necessary nor
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to make explanatory notes

B.

Rescission of Form N-Q and Amendments to Certification Requirements of
Form N-CSR

1.

Rescission of Form N-Q

Along with our adoption of new Form N-PORT, we are also rescinding Form N-Q, as we
proposed. Management companies other than SBICs are currently required to report their
complete portfolio holdings as of the end of their first and third fiscal quarters on Form N-Q.
Because the data reported on Form N-PORT will include the portfolio holdings information
contained in reports on Form N-Q, we believe that Form N-PORT will render reports on Form
N-Q unnecessarily duplicative. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to rescind Form N-Q
rather than require funds to report similar information to the Commission on two separate forms.
However, as noted earlier, we believe that individual investors and other potential users
might prefer that portfolio holdings schedules for the first and third quarters continue to be
presented using the form and content specified by Regulation S-X, which investors are
accustomed to viewing in reports on Form N-Q and in shareholder reports. Therefore, and as
proposed, we are requiring that, for reports on Form N-PORT for the first and third quarters of a
fund’s fiscal year, the fund will attach its complete portfolio holdings for that fiscal quarter,
presented in accordance with the schedules set forth in §§210.12-12 to 12-14 of Regulation S-X
[17 CFR 210.12-12 – 12-14].
We requested comments on our proposed rescission of Form N-Q. One commenter
supported our proposed rescission of Form N-Q.519 Other commenters recommended

518

See section 45(a) of the Investment Company Act.

158

maintaining Form N-Q, noting that Form N-PORT might not serve the interests of investors,
while Form N-Q is an established channel through which funds currently provide pertinent
information to shareholders.520 We understand these concerns, but as noted above because the
data reported on Form N-PORT will include the portfolio holdings information that would be
contained in reports on Form N-Q, we believe that Form N-PORT will render reports on Form
N-Q unnecessarily duplicative. We are also concerned about the possibility of investor
confusion that may arise in the event of simultaneous public disclosure of portfolio reporting
information for the same reporting periods on Form N-PORT as well as on Form N-Q. For these
reasons, we are rescinding Form N-Q.
2.

Amendments to Certification Requirements of Form N-CSR

In connection with the Commission’s implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
Form N-Q and Form N-CSR currently require the principal executive and financial officers of
the fund to make quarterly certifications relating to (1) the accuracy of information reported to
the Commission, and (2) disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting.521 Rescission of Form N-Q will eliminate certifications as to the accuracy of the
portfolio schedules reported for the first and third fiscal quarters.
Under today’s amendments, and as we proposed, the certifications as to the accuracy of
the portfolio schedules reported for the second and fourth fiscal quarters on Form N-CSR will

(adopting release for Form N-CSR).

remain. However, and as we proposed, we are amending the form of certification in Form NCSR to require each certifying officer to state that he or she has disclosed in the report any
change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most
recent fiscal half-year, rather than the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter as currently required
by the form.522 Lengthening the look-back of this certification to six months, so that the
certifications on Form N-CSR for the semi-annual and annual reports will cover the first and
second fiscal quarters and third and fourth fiscal quarters, respectively, will fill the gap in
certification coverage regarding the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that will
otherwise occur once Form N-Q is rescinded. To the extent that certifications improve the
accuracy of the data reported, removing such certifications could have negative effects on the
quality of the data reported. Likewise, if the reduced frequency of the certifications affects the
process by which controls and procedures are assessed, requiring such certifications semiannually rather than quarterly could reduce the effectiveness of the fund’s disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. However, we expect such effects, if
any, to be minimal because certifying officers will continue to certify portfolio holdings for the
fund’s second and fourth fiscal quarters and will further provide semi-annual certifications
concerning disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that
would cover the entire year.
Commenters generally agreed with our proposed approach, although several commenters
suggested maintaining Form N-Q on the grounds that Form N-PORT may not serve the interests

12(a)(2) of Form N-CSR.

160

of investors or because of their assertions that reports on Form N-PORT should be nonpublic.523
For the reasons discussed above, and since we have determined not to make all filings of NPORT nonpublic, we are rescinding Form N-Q and amending the certification requirements in
Form N-CSR, as proposed.
C.

Amendments to Regulation S-X

1.

Overview

As part of our larger effort to modernize the manner in which funds report holdings
information to investors, we are adopting amendments to Regulation S-X, which prescribes the
form and content of financial statements required in registration statements and shareholder
reports.524 As discussed above, many of the amendments to Regulation S-X, particularly the
amendments to the disclosures concerning derivative contracts, are similar to the requirements
concerning disclosures of derivatives that will be required on reports on Form N-PORT.525 The
amendments to Regulation S-X will, among other things, require similar disclosures in a fund’s
financial statements in order to provide investors, particularly individual investors, with clear and
consistently presented disclosures across funds concerning fund investments in derivatives in an
unstructured format.

523

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (agreeing with the proposed approach); State Street Comment Letter
(same). See also Schwab Comment Letter (stating that Form N-PORT might not serve the interests of
investors); Fidelity Comment Letter (same); SIFMA Comment Letter I (stating that reports on Form
N-PORT should be nonpublic).

524

See rule 1-01, et seq. of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.1-01, et seq.]. While “funds” are defined in the
preamble as registered investment companies other than face-amount certificate companies, and any
separate series thereof—i.e., management companies and UITs—we note that our amendments to
Regulation S-X apply to both registered investment companies and BDCs. See infra section II.C.6.
Therefore, throughout this section, when discussing fund reporting requirements in the context of our
amendments to Regulation S-X, we are also including changes to the reporting requirements for
BDCs.

525

See supra section II.A.2.g.iv.

161

As outlined below, we are adopting amendments to Articles 6 and 12 of Regulation S-X
that will: (1) require new, standardized disclosures regarding fund holdings in open futures
contracts, open forward foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts,526 and additional
disclosures regarding fund holdings of written and purchased option contracts; (2) update the
disclosures for other investments and investments in and advances to affiliates, as well as
reorganize the order in which some investments are presented; and (3) amend the rules regarding
the general form and content of fund financial statements. Our amendments will require
prominent placement of details regarding investments in derivatives in a fund’s schedule of
investments, rather than allowing such schedules to be disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements.
The comments that we received relating to our proposal to amend Regulation S-X were
generally supportive of our efforts to improve the information that funds report to shareholders
and the Commission.527 However, commenters did provide comments on many aspects of our
proposal, which we discuss below.

526

We recognize that under the federal securities laws, certain derivatives fall under the definition of
securities, notwithstanding, for purposes of our amendments to Regulation S-X, we expect funds to
adhere to the requirements of the disclosure schedules for the relevant derivative investment,
regardless of how it would be defined under the federal securities laws. See, e.g., rule 12-13C of
Regulation S-X (Open swap contracts).

527

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Ernst & Young LLP (Aug. 10, 2015) (“EY Comment Letter”) (“We
agree that many of these amendments would improve the transparency and comparability of
investment company financial statements for their intended users.”); Deloitte Comment Letter (“We
believe that the proposed rule related to the Commission’s modernization project is consistent with
the SEC’s stated objective of improving the type and format of information regarding fund activities
that investment companies provide to the Commission and investors....”); SIFMA Comment Letter I
(“We support the Commission’s initiative to enhance and standardize the disclosure of derivatives
and other portfolio investments in fund financial statements and believe that most of the proposed
amendments to Regulation S-X will achieve that goal.”); see also AICPA Comment Letter. One
commenter recommended that the Commission dispense with any requirement for position-level
reporting of information regarding derivatives, as this information could confuse or mislead investors
and could contain confidential information relating to a fund’s investment strategy. Simpson Thacher

162

The rules that we are adopting will renumber the current schedules in Article 12 of
Regulation S-X and break out the reporting of derivatives currently on Schedule 12-13 into
separate schedules.528 These changes are summarized in Figure 1, below.

We believe, and commenters agreed, that these amendments will assist comparability
among funds, and increase transparency for investors regarding a fund’s use of derivatives.529
We have endeavored to mitigate burdens on the industry by requiring similar disclosures both on

Comment Letter. However, Article 12 of Regulation S-X already requires all position-level
derivatives to be reported. Moreover, GAAP already requires a minimum level of position-level
reporting of investments that does not distinguish between derivatives and securities. See, e.g., FASB
ASC 946-210-50-1 (Financial Services–Investment Companies-Disclosure—General-Schedule of
Investments-Investment Companies Other than Nonregistered investments Partnerships).
528

Throughout this release when we refer to a rule as it exists prior to any amendments we are making
today, it is described as a “current rule,” while references to a rule as amended (or an existing rule
that is not being amended today) are described as a “rule” or “new rule.”

Form N-PORT and in a fund’s financial statements.530 As we discussed in the Proposing
Release, we continue to believe that these amendments are generally consistent with how many
funds are currently reporting investments (including derivatives). 531
2.

Enhanced Derivatives Disclosures

In 2011, as part of a wider effort to review the use of derivatives by management
investment companies, we issued a concept release and request for comment on a range of
issues.532 We received comment letters on the concept release from a variety of stakeholders.
Several commenters noted that holdings of derivative investments are not currently reported by
funds in a consistent manner.533 Commenters also suggested that more disclosure on underlying
risks was necessary, including more information on counterparty exposure and reporting relating
to the notional amount of certain derivatives.534 Another commenter specifically requested that

533

Comments submitted in response to the Derivatives Concept Release are available at
http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-33-11/s73311.shtml. See Morningstar Derivatives Concept Release
Comment Letter (“This is because fund companies are not reporting derivative holdings in a
consistent manner and are not reporting derivative holdings in a manner that identifies the underlying
risk exposure.”); Comment Letter of Rydex|SGI to Derivatives Concept Release (Nov. 7, 2011)
(“Rydex|SGI Derivatives Concept Release Comment Letter”) (“However, the quality and extent of
such derivatives disclosure still varies greatly from registrant to registrant.”).

534

See Morningstar Derivatives Concept Release Comment Letter (“Notional exposure ... is a better
measure of risk”); Comment Letter of Oppenheimer Funds to Derivatives Concept Release (Nov. 7,
2011) (“Instead, counterparty risks incurred through the investments in derivatives ... should be
considered in a new SEC rulemaking that is primarily disclosure based.”); Rydex|SGI Derivatives
Concept Release Comment Letter (recommending that funds that invest in derivatives should disclose
notional exposure for non-exchanged traded derivatives and a fund’s exposure to counterparties).
Commenters to the FSOC Notice made similar observations relating to counterparty disclosures. See,
e.g., Americans for Financial Reform FSOC Notice Comment Letter (“Counterparty data is also often
not available.”); Comment Letter of The Systematic Risk Council Comment to FSOC Notice (Mar.
25, 2015) (discussing the need to have information about investment vehicles that hold bank
liabilities).

164

we revise Regulation S-X in order to keep “financial reporting current with developments in the
financial markets.”535
We are adopting rules that will standardize the reporting of certain derivative investments
for fund financial statements. While the current rules under Regulation S-X establish general
requirements for portfolio holdings disclosures in fund financial statements, they do not
prescribe standardized information to be included for derivative instruments other than options.
Current rule 12-13 of Regulation S-X (Investments other than securities) requires limited
information on the fund’s investments other than securities – that is, the investments not
disclosed under current rules 12-12, 12-12A, 12-12B, and 12-14. 536 Thus, currently, under
Regulation S-X, a fund’s disclosures of open futures contracts, open forward foreign currency
contracts, and open swap contracts are generally reported in accordance with rule 12-13.
To address issues of inconsistent disclosures and lack of transparency as to derivative
instruments, we are amending Regulation S-X by adopting new schedules for open futures
contracts, open forward foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts. We received
several comments generally supporting the Commission’s proposals to provide more information
about derivatives.537 Other commenters objected to the public reporting of position level
derivatives reporting arguing instead that we should focus on portfolio-level metrics analysis as
it would more accurately reflect an investment company’s overall use of, and, more

The current schedule to rule 12-13 requires disclosure of: (1) description; (2) balance held at close of

meaningfully reflect its net exposure to derivatives.538 Funds are currently required to report
their position-level derivatives in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation S-X.539 We believe
that it is important for funds to continue to report position-level data for all investments in order
to allow investors and other interested parties to fully understand their fund’s holdings.540
We are also modifying the current disclosure requirements for purchased and written
option contracts. Finally, we are adopting certain instructions regarding the presentation of
derivatives contracts that are generally consistent with instructions that are currently included, or
that we are adding, in either rule 12-12 (Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers) or
current rule 12-13 (Investments other than securities).541
a.

Open Option Contracts Written — Rule 12-13 (Current Rule 12-12B) and
Rule 12-12 (As Applicable to Options Purchased)

We are amending the current disclosure of written option contracts substantially as
proposed.542 We proposed to add new columns to the schedule for written option contracts that
would require a description of the contract (replacing the current column for name of the issuer),
the counterparty to the transaction,543 and the contract’s notional amount, which we are adopting
as proposed.544 Thus, for rule 12-13, for each open written options contract, funds will be

540

See id.

541

See, e.g., rule 12-12, n. 2 of Regulation S-X (instructions for categorizing investments).

542

Under current rule 12-12B, funds are required to report, for open option contracts, the name of the
issuer, number of contracts, exercise price, expiration date, and value. See current rule 12-12B of
Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-12B].

543

See infra footnote 554-555 and accompanying text.

544

While rule 12-13 is specific to open option contracts written, the same disclosures also apply for
purchased options as required by proposed Instruction 3 to rule 12-12. See also proposed rule 1212B, n. 5 of Regulation S-X.

166

required to disclose: (1) description; (2) counterparty; (3) number of contracts; (4) notional
amount; (5) exercise price; (6) expiration date; and (7) value.545
We received several comments relating to the proposed requirement to disclose notional
amounts for open options contracts. Some commenters recommended that the Commission
either eliminate the proposed notional amount column for certain options contracts as they
believed it was unnecessary because, unlike the notional amount of swaps and futures, which
communicates economic exposure, the notional amount of an option, without a delta adjustment,
may not represent an equivalent position in the underlying reference asset546 or, in the
alternative, provide a clear definition of notional amount.547 As we previously stated in the
Derivatives Proposing Release, we believe that, although derivatives vary widely in terms of
structure, asset class, risk and potential uses, for most types of derivatives the notional amount
generally serves as an important data point for investors that seek to determine a fund’s
economic exposure to an underlying reference asset or metric.548 We do not believe that it is
necessary to provide funds with a prescriptive formula for calculating notional amount because
we understand funds today calculate their derivatives’ notional amounts for risk management,

545

See rule 12-13 of Regulation S-X.

546

See ICI Comment Letter (recommending the elimination of notional amount for written options
because the exercise price component of an option contract makes the notional amount less relevant
than other derivative instruments, such as swaps and futures); MFS Comment Letter (recommending
that the Commission eliminate the proposed notional amount column in the options table).

547

See EY Comment Letter (supporting disclosures of notional amounts for open options contracts and
notional and value amounts for open futures contracts, but noting that such requirements should
include clear definitions); MFS Comment Letter (suggesting that the Commission either eliminate the
notional amount column for open options contracts or, if the requirement is retained, clarify the
methodology for calculating the notional amount of an option.); ICI Comment Letter (recommending
that the Commission eliminate this requirement, or, should the Commission require notional amount,
specify the calculation as: [number of contracts] x [exercise price] x [contract multiplier]).

Derivatives Concept Release, supra footnote 38, at n. 19 and accompanying text.

reporting or other purposes, and that funds would be able to use these calculations for financial
statement reporting. Moreover, the Commission has previously discussed different types of
derivatives transactions that are commonly used by funds, together with the method by which we
understood a fund, for risk management, reporting or other purposes, could calculate a
derivatives notional amount.549 We believe that Regulation S-X will allow a fund to use these
calculations methods, as well as other reasonable methods, to determine notional amounts of
such derivatives transactions.550
We also proposed to add an instruction (proposed instruction 3) to current rule 12-12,
which is the schedule by which purchased options are required to be disclosed, that would
require funds to provide all information required by proposed rule 12-13 for written option
contracts.551 One commenter noted that some options contracts allow for a range of underlying
securities to be delivered and requested that funds only be required to identify the security type
to be delivered, rather than the full description called for in instruction 3 to rules 12-12 and 1213.552 We believe that providing a description of the investment underlying an option is
necessary in order to fully understand the risks and rewards of such investment. For example, an
options contract could allow for a range of underlying investments to be delivered and at the time
the option is exercised, some of the investments could be riskier than others. We are therefore
adopting the instruction as proposed.
For options where the underlying investment would otherwise be presented in accordance
with another provision of rule 12-12 or proposed rules 12-13 through 12-13D, we also proposed

requiring that the presentation of that underlying investment must include a description, as
required by those provisions.553 For example, reporting for a swaption would include the
disclosures required under both the swaps rule (proposed rule 12-13C) and the options rule
(proposed rule 12-13). We received no comments on this aspect of the proposal, and we are
adopting it as proposed.
In order to assist investors in identifying and monitoring the counterparty risks associated
with a fund’s investments in derivatives, we proposed to require funds to disclose the
counterparty to a derivative.554 We also acknowledged that counterparty risk is mitigated for
exchange-traded instruments and therefore proposed an instruction for options and swaps that
funds need not disclose the counterparty for exchange-traded instruments.555 Commenters
agreed, but noted that, like exchange-traded instruments, centrally cleared derivatives also do not
bear the same type of risks (such as counterparty risk), as over-the-counter instruments.556 Based
on the comments that we received, we agree that counterparty risk can also be mitigated through
central clearance and are therefore changing instruction 4 to rule 12-13 (open options contracts)
(and instruction 4 to rule 12-13C (open swaps contracts)) to not require disclosure of the

553

See proposed rules 12-12, n. 3; 12-12B, n. 5; and 12-13, n. 3 of Regulation S-X. One commenter
requested clarification whether Regulation S-X would require disclosure of any investment with
optionality. See AICPA Comment Letter. We did not intend to extend this requirement to bonds or
other non-derivative instruments that contain optionality features.

counterparty for both exchange-traded options and swaps and centrally cleared options and
swaps.557
Another commenter suggested that funds should be required to present counterparty
exposures net of collateral received or margin posted.558 While we agree that receiving collateral
and posting margin may mitigate some counterparty risk, in order to simplify the disclosures for
investors and limit the burden for funds, we continue to believe that it is appropriate for funds to
limit disclosure to the counterparty to the transaction, without the additional burden of providing
collateral or margin information.559
As required in Form N-PORT,560 in the case of an option contract with an underlying
investment that is an index or basket of investments for which components are publicly available
on a website as of the fund’s balance sheet date, 561 or if the notional amount of the investment
does not exceed one percent of the fund’s NAV as of the close of the period, we proposed that
the fund provide information sufficient to identify the underlying investment.562 If the
underlying investment is an index whose components are not publicly available on a website as

As proposed, the components would be required to be publicly available on a website as of the fund’s
balance sheet date at the time of transmission to stockholders for any report required to be transmitted
to stockholders under rule 30e-1. The components would be required to remain publicly available on
a website as of the fund’s balance sheet date until 70 days after the fund’s next fiscal year-end. For
example, components of an index underlying an option contract for a fund’s 12/31/14 annual report
must be made publicly available on a website as of 12/31/14 by the time that the 12/31/14 annual
report is transmitted to stockholders. The components must remain publicly available until 3/10/16.

of the fund’s balance sheet date, or is based upon a custom basket of investments, and the
notional amount of the option contract exceeds one percent of the fund’s NAV as of the close of
the period, as proposed, the fund would list separately each of the investments comprising the
index or basket of investments.563 We continue to believe that disclosure of the underlying
investments of an option contract is an important element to assist investors in understanding and
evaluating the full risks of the investment. The disclosures will provide investors with more
transparency into both the terms of the underlying investment and the terms of the option. We
also proposed to include a similar instruction for swap contracts.564
We received a number of comments on our proposal to publicly disclose the components
of an underlying index, both with respect to Form N-PORT (discussed above) and Regulation SX.565 While one commenter agreed with our proposal,566 others requested that we include a
higher threshold before requiring disclosure, such as 5 percent.567 Others agreed with our
proposed 1% threshold but stated that reporting should be based on a percentage of net asset
value, rather than notional value, as percentage of net asset value is a better indicator of
materiality.568

As stated in the Proposing Release and in the Form N-PORT discussion above, we
continue to believe that it is important for the Commission, investors, and other potential users to
have transparency into exposures to assets that the fund has, regardless of whether the fund
directly holds investments in those assets or chooses to create those exposures through a
derivatives contract.569 The 1% threshold is based on our experience with the summary schedule
of investments, which requires funds to disclose investments for which the value exceeds 1% of
the fund’s NAV in that schedule.570 We believe that, similar to the 1% threshold in the summary
schedule of investments, providing a 1% de minimis threshold for disclosing the components of a
derivative with nonpublic reference assets considers the need for the Commission, investors, and
other potential users to have transparency into the exposures that derivative contracts create
while not requiring extensive disclosure of multiple components in a nonpublic index for
instruments that represent a smaller risk to the fund’s overall performance. Separately, as
discussed further below, we believe that this modification mitigates concerns some commenters
had about public disclosure of such indexes.571
We also believe that it is appropriate to measure whether such derivative instrument
exceeds the 1% threshold based on the derivative’s notional value, as opposed to the current
market value because derivatives with a small market value and a large notional amount could
magnify losses or gains in net assets as compared to derivatives with a smaller notional amount,
and thus believe that a derivative’s notional value better measures its potential contribution to the
gains or losses of the fund. Furthermore, as in Form N-PORT, we believe that providing a 1%

We are also modifying Form N-PORT to require similar disclosures. See generally supra section
II.A.2.g.iv.

de minimis for disclosing the components of a derivative with nonpublic reference assets
considers the need for investors and other potential users to have transparency into the exposures
that derivative contracts create while not requiring extensive disclosure of multiple components
in a nonpublic index for instruments that represent a small amount of the fund’s overall value.
Commenters also suggested that funds should provide narrative disclosures about the
components of a referenced index or custom basket, including any applicable industry or sector
concentrations.572 The same commenters and others suggested that once a nonpublic index
crosses the reporting threshold, we limit disclosure to the top 50 components and components
that represent more than one percent of the index based on the notional value of the derivatives,
as this standard is analogous to the current reporting requirement to identify holdings in the
summary schedule of investments.573 As discussed above, we continue to believe that the
notional amount generally serves as an appropriate measure of the index’s economic exposure to
an underlying reference asset or metric.574
While, as we discussed above, we believe that it is appropriate to adopt a tiered reporting
requirement for reporting on Form N-PORT, we are not adopting a tiered reporting requirement
for disclosures under Regulation S-X. Unlike Form N-PORT, which will be reported in a
structured XML format, schedules of investments are designed to be investor friendly
documents. By requiring the reporting in the schedule of investments of all components of an

572

See, e.g., PwC Comment Letter; AICPA Comment Letter.

573

See, e.g., PwC Comment Letter; AICPA Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; MFS Comment
Letter. Commenters also noted their belief that reporting should be based on a percentage of NAV,
rather than notional value, as percentage of NAV is a better indicator of materiality. See SIFMA
Comment Letter I; Oppenheimer Comment Letter (1% based on net, not notional, values); contra
Morningstar Comment Letter (“Arbitrary limits on positions that should be disclosed for portfolios or
reference indexes can mask the risk of an instrument.”).

173

underlying index or custom basket, we agree with commenters that noted that requiring the
potential volume of disclosing components in an index in financial statements could add
considerable length to the schedule of investments, rendering them more difficult for investors to
review than limiting such disclosures to the most significant components.575 Additionally, such
disclosures may minimize the importance to investors of direct portfolio holdings and increase
reporting costs to funds.576 Finally, investors or others interested in knowing all components of
such indexes will still have access to such information on Form N-PORT, without adding the
volume to the financial statements that could occur by requiring complete disclosure in the
financial statements.577
As a result, we are making a modification from our proposed amendments to Regulation
S-X to require funds to only report the top 50 components of the index or custom basket and any
components that represent more than one percent of the notional value of the index or custom
basket.578 Thus, if the index’s or custom basket’s components are not publicly available and the
notional amount of the derivative represents more than 1% of the net asset value of the fund, the
fund will provide a description of the index or custom basket and list separately (i) the 50 largest
components in the index or custom basket and (ii) any other components where the notional

See PWC Comment Letter (expressing concern that the cost of presenting numerous immaterial
notional positions in the financial statements will exceed the benefit to the financial statement
readers); AICPA Comment Letter (expressing concern that the cost of identifying and auditing
numerous individual notional positions which typically are not reflected in the same accounting
records as investment positions directly held, but instead appear in term sheets, counterparty
confirmations, and off-line valuation spreadsheets – will exceed the benefit to financial statement
readers).

value for that component exceeds 1% of the notional value of the index or custom basket.579 For
each investment separately listed, the fund will include the description of the underlying
investment as would be required by Article 12 of Regulation S-X as part of the description, the
quantity held, the value at the close of the period, and the percentage value when compared to
the custom basket’s net assets.580
As discussed more fully above, commenters also objected to the public disclosure of the
components underlying an index as that disclosure could harm the intellectual property rights
that index providers might assert and, as a result, harm investors who may lose the benefit of
index products that would no longer be available to them.581 However, we believe that it is
important that fund investors are provided with the information necessary to make informed
investing decisions.582 This necessarily means that investors and other potential users have
access to relevant information relating to investments in derivatives, including the components
underlying an index.583 As discussed further in section II.A.4, above, we believe that the
potential for harm to fund investors is mitigated through the current public reporting delays for
fund shareholder reports. 584 We are also adopting, as proposed, but subject to the modifications

579

See rules 12-13, n.3 and 12-13C, n.3 of Regulation S-X. We also modified language from the
proposal to delete duplicative wording; see rule 12-13, n. 3 (deleting duplicative wording to “list
separately”) and clarify instructions and conform to similar instructions in Form N-PORT; see rules
12-13, n. 3 and 12-13C, n. 3 (changing “is over” to “exceeds” and adding “custom” to “baskets”).

b.

Open Futures Contracts — New Rule 12-13A

We are adopting as proposed new rule 12-13A, which will require standardized reporting
of open futures contracts. Under current rule 12-13, many funds currently report for each open
futures contracts a description of the futures contract (including its expiration date), the number
of contracts held (under the balance held—quantity column), and any unrealized appreciation
and depreciation (under the value column).587 In order to allow investors to better understand the
economics of a fund’s investment in futures contracts, new rule 12-13A will require funds to also
report notional amount and value.588 Therefore, under new rule 12-13A, funds with open futures
contracts will report: (1) description; (2) number of contracts; (3) expiration date; (4) notional
amount; (5) value; and (6) unrealized appreciation/depreciation.589

585

See supra section II.C.4.

586

Instruction 2 will add “description” and “counterparty” to the organizational categories of options
contracts that must be listed separately. See rule 12-13, n. 2 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 4 will
clarify that the fund need not include counterparty information for exchange-traded or centrally
cleared options. See rule 12-13, n. 4 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 6 will require the fund to indicate
each investment which cannot be sold because of restrictions or conditions applicable to the
investment. See rule 12-13, n. 6 of Regulation S-X; see also infra section II.C.4. Instruction 7 will
require the fund to indicate each investment whose value was determined using significant
unobservable inputs. See rule 12-13, n. 7 of Regulation S-X; see also infra section II.C.4. Instruction
8 will require Column G (Value) to be totaled and agree with the correlative amount shown on the
related balance sheet. See rule 12-13, n. 8.

other investors.”).

176

We proposed a requirement that funds must reconcile the total of Column F (unrealized
appreciation/depreciation) to the total variation margin receivable or payable on the related
balance sheet.590 Although we received no comment on this aspect of the proposal, upon further
review, we recognize that there may be instances where the total unrealized appreciation or
depreciation for the fund’s futures contracts might not reconcile to the variation margin
receivable or payable on the balance sheet. As a result, we are therefore not adopting this
proposed instruction.
We received a comment that suggested that the Commission provide specific definitions
for the terms “notional amount” and “value” for futures contracts.591 According to the
commenter, “notional amount” may reference either the notional amount at the time the futures
contract was entered into or the current notional value. Since we believe, for Regulation S-X
purposes, that it would be more useful for investors to understand the current notional amount for
a futures contract, we are adopting rule 12-13A with a new instruction from the proposal that
instructs funds to report “current notional amount” pursuant to Column D of new rule 12-13A.592
For purposes of Article 12 of Regulation S-X, we note that section 2(a)(41) of the Investment
Company Act currently contains a definition of “value” which is applicable to Regulation S-X.593

disclosure requirements.595

Open Forward Foreign Currency Contracts — New Rule 12-13B

We are also adopting as proposed new rule 12-13B, which requires standardized
disclosures for open forward foreign currency contracts. 596 Under current rule 12-13, many
funds reported for each open forward foreign currency contract, a description of the contract
(including a description of what is to be purchased and sold under the contract and the settlement
date), the amount to be purchased and sold on settlement date (under the balance held—quantity
column), and any unrealized appreciation or depreciation (under the value column).597 In order
to allow investors to better understand counterparty risk for forward foreign currency contracts,
we are adopting as proposed, a requirement that funds also disclose the counterparty to each
transaction.598 Under new rule 12-13B, funds holding open forward foreign currency contracts
will therefore report the: (1) amount and description of currency to be purchased; (2) amount
and description of currency to be sold; (3) counterparty; (4) settlement date; (5) unrealized
appreciation/depreciation.599
One commenter recommended that we include a clear definition of “forward contract” to
avoid potential confusion and foster consistent derivatives disclosure under Form N-PORT,
595

See infra section II.C.4. Instruction 1 will require funds to organize long purchases of futures
contracts and futures contracts sold short separately. See rule 12-13A, n. 1 of Regulation S-X.
Instruction 2 will require funds to list separately futures contracts where the descriptions or expiration
dates differ. See rule 12-13A, n. 2 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 3 will clarify that the description
should include the name of the reference asset or index. See rule 12-13A, n. 3 of Regulation S-X.
Instruction 4 will require the fund to indicate each investment which cannot be sold because of
restrictions or conditions applicable to the investment. See rule 12-13A, n. 4 of Regulation S-X; see
also infra section II.C.4. Instruction 5 will require the fund to indicate each investment whose value
was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See rule 12-13A, n. 5 of Regulation S-X; see

Regulation S-X, and Form ADV.600 Many funds appear to be already classifying forward
foreign currency contracts in their financial statements, and the approach we are adopting allows
flexibility as products evolve. We are therefore declining to adopt a definition of “forward
contract.”
Commenters suggested that open forward foreign currency contracts be grouped by
currencies purchased or sold, or more specifically by US dollars when US domiciled funds mark
currency to the US dollar within financial statements.601 We do not believe that further
refinement to the grouping of forward foreign currency contracts is necessary, as the commenters
suggested, as new rule 12-13B provides funds with the flexibility to organize foreign currency
contracts in the manner that they believe provides the clearest presentation of their financial
statements. For example, if a fund concentrates its investments in a country such that its
investments are generally denominated in a currency other than the US dollar, it may determine
that grouping its contracts, including cross-currency forwards, by that currency would provide a
clearer presentation to investors. We are therefore adopting instruction 1 to rule 12-13B as
proposed, which will require the fund to separately organize forward foreign currency contracts
where the description of currency purchased, currency sold, counterparties, or settlement dates
differ.602
One commenter suggested that since most funds report derivatives on a gross basis,
appreciation and depreciation for the disclosures of non-exchange-traded derivatives such as

600

See T. Rowe Price Comment Letter.

See rule 12-13B, n. 1 of Regulation S-X.

179

forward foreign currency contracts and swaps contracts should be disclosed in two separate
columns or include subtotals, rather than in one column, as was proposed.603 We agree that in
certain circumstances this change in format would assist with reconciling the unrealized
appreciation and depreciation with the corresponding figures on the fund’s balance sheet and
would encourage this presentation to the extent it provides such assistance. In some cases,
however, an extra column may not be necessary604 and we are therefore not adopting the
commenters’ suggested modifications to the disclosure tables for those rules, although we note
that the rules do not prevent a fund from presenting the information in two separate columns, if it
so chooses.605
We are also adopting, as proposed, but subject to the modifications discussed below,606
certain new instructions to the schedule for rule 12-13B that are similar to the other derivatives
disclosure requirements.607

Open Swap Contracts — New Rule 12-13C

reporting of fund positions in open swap contracts.608 Under current rule 12-13, for each open

Instruction 1 will require the fund to separately list forward foreign currency contracts where the
description of currency purchased, currency sold, counterparties, or settlement dates differ. See rule
12-13B, n. 1 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 2 will require the fund to indicate each investment which
cannot be sold because of restrictions or conditions applicable to the investment. See rule 12-13B, n.

investment whose value was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See rule 12-13B, n. 3
of Regulation S-X; see also infra section II.C.4. Instruction 4 will clarify that Column E (unrealized
appreciation/depreciation) should be totaled and agree with the total of correlative amounts shown on
the related balance sheet. See rule 12-13B, n. 4 of Regulation S-X.

swaps contract, funds reported description (including a description of what is to be paid and
received by the fund and the contract’s maturity date), notional amount (under balance held—
quantity column), and any unrealized appreciation or depreciation (under the value column). 609
Under new rule 12-13C, funds will also be required to report the counterparty to each transaction
(except for exchange-traded and centrally cleared swaps), the contract’s value, and any upfront
payments or receipts.610 This additional information will allow investors to both better
understand the economics of the transaction, as well as its associated risks.611 Therefore, funds
will report for each swap the: (1) description and terms of payments to be received from another
party; (2) description and terms of payments to be paid to another party; (3) counterparty;
(4) maturity date; (5) notional amount; (6) value; (7) upfront payments/receipts; and
(8) unrealized appreciation/depreciation.612 Commenters were generally supportive of this
proposed disclosure, although some expressed concerns about some aspects of the disclosures, as
discussed in more detail below. We are adopting rule 12-13C substantially as proposed in an
effort to increase transparency of swap contracts, but are making some modifications in response
to comments, which are discussed below. The final rules are designed to maintain enough

611

For example, upfront payments or receipts disclose whether cash was paid or received when entering
into a swap contract, allowing investors to better understand the initial cost of the investment, if any.

612

See rule 12-13C of Regulation S-X. The description and terms of payments to be paid and received
(and other information) to and from another party should reflect the investment owned by the fund
and allow an investor to understand the full nature of the transaction. One commenter suggested that,
for over-the-counter swaps, appreciation and depreciation should be disclosed in two separate
columns or include subtotals for appreciation and depreciation instead of one column. See BlackRock
Comment Letter. But, for the same reasons as discussed in our discussion of rule 12-13B, we are not
adopting the corresponding modification to the table for rule 12-13C, although the rules do not
prevent a fund from presenting the information in two separate columns, if it so chooses.

181

flexibility for the variety of swap products that currently exist and future products that might
come to market.
In addition to the major categories of swaps, commenters also recommended that
centrally cleared swaps be grouped separately from over-the-counter swaps, as centrally cleared
swaps do not bear the same types of risks as over-the-counter swaps.613 While we do not believe
that it is necessary to separately categorize centrally cleared swaps for purposes of Regulation SX, as discussed more fully above, we are modifying proposed instruction 4 to Rule 12-13C to
reflect that both exchange-traded and centrally cleared swaps need not list counterparty
information.614 Moreover, instruction 1 to rule 12-13C provides enough flexibility as drafted to
allow funds to further categorize swaps contracts by over-the-counter or centrally cleared, should
they choose to do so.615
We are also adopting instruction 3 of rule 12-13C as proposed, which will provide
specific examples of the more common types of swap contracts (e.g., credit default swaps,
interest rate swaps, and total return swaps).616 We recognize that other types of swaps exist (e.g.,
currency swaps, commodity swaps, variance swaps, and subordinated risk swaps). For example,
for a cross-currency swap, funds will report for purposes of Column A of rule 12-13C, a
description of the interest rate to be received and the notional amount that the calculation of
interest to be received is based upon. Column B of rule 12-13C will include a description of the
interest rate to be paid and the notional amount that the calculation of interest to be paid is based

denominated, or the same information could be presented in two separate columns.
In the context of providing comments on Form N-PORT, one commenter noted that
credit default swaps are unique enough instruments that they should be treated separately from
other types of swaps.617 We designed our amendments to Regulation S-X with enough flexibility
to allow funds to report the significant elements of current and future investments and believe
that rule 12-13C adequately requires funds to disclose the information sufficient for a user of
financial information to understand the terms of payments to be received and paid of a fund’s
investments in swaps contracts, including credit default swaps. We are therefore adopting this
portion of instruction 3 as proposed and not providing a separate schedule for credit default
swaps.618
Consistent with comparable reporting requirements that we proposed in connection with
Form N-PORT and rule 12-13 (open options contracts), in the case of a swaps contract with an
underlying investment that is an index or basket of investments for which components are
publicly available on a website as of the fund’s balance sheet date, 619 or if the notional amount
of the investment does not exceed one percent of the fund’s NAV as of the close of the period,
we proposed that the fund provide information sufficient to identify the underlying
617

See Morningstar Comment Letter (Commission should require disclosure of protection written and
protection purchased with the description containing the underlying, as well as columns for notional,
ongoing payment, initial payment, maturity, and value.); see also supra section II.A.2.g.iv.

618

See rule 12-13C, n. 3 of Regulation S-X.

619

As proposed, the components would be required to be publicly available on a website as of the fund’s
balance sheet date at the time of transmission to stockholders for any report required to be transmitted
to stockholders under rule 30e-1. The components would be required to remain publicly available on
a website as of the fund’s balance sheet date until 70 days after the fund’s next fiscal year-end. For
example, components of an index underlying an option contract for a fund’s 12/31/14 annual report
must be made publicly available on a website as of 12/31/14 by the time that the 12/31/14 annual
report is transmitted to stockholders. The components must remain publicly available until 3/10/16.

investment.620 We also proposed that if the underlying investment is an index whose
components are not publicly available on a website as of the fund’s balance sheet date, or is
based upon a custom basket of investments, and the notional amount of the swaps contract
exceeds one percent of the fund’s NAV as of the close of the period, the fund would list
separately each of the investments comprising the index or basket of investments.621
In a modification from the proposal, and as discussed more fully in the open option
contracts622 and the Form N-PORT sections of this release,623 in the case of a swaps contract
with a referenced asset that is an index whose components are publicly available on a website as
of the fund’s balance sheet date, or if the notional amount of the holding does not exceed one
percent of the fund’s NAV as of the close of the period, we are requiring that the fund provide
information sufficient to identify the referenced asset, such as a description.624 If the referenced
asset is an index or custom basket whose components are not publicly available on a website as
of the balance sheet date, and the notional amount of the derivative represents more than 1% of
the net asset value of the fund as of the close of the period, the fund will provide a description of
the index or custom basket and list separately (i) the 50 largest components in the index or
custom basket and (ii) any other components where the notional value for that components is
over 1% of the notional value of the index or custom basket.625 For each investment separately
listed, the fund will include the description of the underlying investment as would be required by

Article 12 of Regulation S-X, as part of the description, the quantity held, the value at the close
of the period, and the percentage value when compared to the custom basket’s net assets.626 As
with underlying investments for option contracts, we believe that disclosure of the underlying
referenced assets of a swap would assist investors in better understanding and evaluating the full
risks of investments in swaps.
For swaps which pay or receive financing payments, we proposed that funds would
disclose variable financing rates in a manner similar to disclosure of variable interest rates on
securities in accordance with instruction 4 to proposed rule 12-12.627 Commenters expressed
concern that disclosing financing rates for swaps contracts could harm fund investors as
financing rates are negotiated between parties.628 We believe, however, that the Commission’s
objective to increase transparency and enhance investor understanding in these instruments by
giving investors the opportunity to better understand the investments held in a fund’s portfolio
justifies the disclosure of financing rates for swaps contracts.629 We are therefore adopting this
portion of instruction 3 to rule 12-13C as proposed.630

For example, negotiated terms of an investment in a restricted security of a private company are
required to be disclosed. See current rule 12-12, n. 6 of Regulation S-X. For the same reasons we
discussed above, we believe that it is necessary for funds to report the specific terms for other
derivatives holding information.

other instructions to this rule that are similar across all of our rules for derivatives contracts, as
well as one modification to our proposed instruction 7.632
e.

Other Investments — Rule 12-13D (Current Rule 12-13)

We are also adopting, as proposed, amendments to current rule 12-13 and, for
organization and consistency, are renumbering it as rule 12-13D.633 Rule 12-13D will continue,
as is currently required by rule 12-13, to be the schedule by which funds report investments not
otherwise required to be reported pursuant to Article 12.634 We received no comments on our
proposed amendments to current rule 12-13 (and are adopting rule 12-13D as proposed). Thus
rule 12-13D will require reporting of: (1) description; (2) balance held at close of periodquantity; and (3) value of each item at close of period.635 We expect that funds will report,
among other holdings, investments in physical holdings, such as real estate or commodities,
pursuant to rule 12-13D. As discussed below, we are amending current rule 12-13’s requirement
that funds disclose “each investment not readily marketable”636 in favor of disclosures

Instruction 5 will require the fund to indicate each investment which cannot be sold because of
restrictions or conditions applicable to the investment. See rule 12-13C, n. 5 of Regulation S-X; see

was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See rule 12-13C, n. 6 of Regulation S-X; see
also infra section II.C.4. Instruction 7 will require that Columns G (upfront payments/receipts) and H
(unrealized appreciation/depreciation) be totaled and agree with the totals of their respective amounts
shown on the related balance sheet. See rule 12-13C, n. 7 of Regulation S-X. Note we proposed for
instruction 7 to also include Column F (value) in the total, however, upon further review, we have
determined that correlating the amounts from Columns F, in addition to Columns G and H would be
duplicative and therefore unnecessary.

Amendments to Current Rules 12-12 through 12-12C

While we did not propose changes to the current schedules for rules 12-12, 12-12A, and
12-12C, we proposed certain additional rule instructions that would include new reporting
requirements, as well as certain clarifying changes, including renumbering several of the
schedules. With the exception of the instructions discussed below, we are adopting the
amendments to new rules 12-12 through 12-12B as proposed.
We proposed several modifications to the instructions to rule 12-12, the rule concerning
disclosure of investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers. We proposed to modify instruction
2 to rule 12-12 (and the corresponding instructions to proposed rules 12-12A, 12-12B, 12-13D,
and 12-14) which would require funds to categorize the schedule by type of investment, the
related industry, and the related country, or geographic region.639 Commenters noted that
requiring categorization of both the industry and geographic region (as opposed to categorizing

637

See proposed rule 12-13D, n. 6 of Regulation S-X (requiring the fund to indicate each investment
which cannot be sold because of restrictions or conditions applicable to the investment); rule 12-13D,
n. 7 (requiring the fund to indicate each issue of securities whose value was determined using
significant unobservable inputs); see also infra section II.C.4.

638

Instruction 1 will require the fund to organize each investment separately where any portion of the
description differs. See rule 12-13D, n. 1 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 2 will require the fund to
categorize the schedule by the type of investment, and related industry, country, or geographic region,
as applicable. See rule 12-13D, n. 2 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 3 will require that the description
of the asset include information sufficient for a user to understand the nature and terms of the
investment. See rule 12-13D, n. 3 of Regulation S-X; see also infra section II.C.4.

one factor) would add considerable length to the schedule of investments and make it more
difficult to understand.640 We were persuaded that requiring categorization of both industry and
geographic region would add unnecessary length and confusion to the schedule of investments,
which could ultimately undermine the schedule’s usefulness to investors, and are therefore not
adopting these requirements.641
One commenter requested that, should we adopt the proposed instructions relating to
categorization of both industry and geographic region (which, as discussed in the prior
paragraph, we are not adopting), the instructions should be integrated into Regulation S-X that
standardize how funds report geographic concentrations.642 Others noted that the disclosure of
country of risk or geographic region should be treated as nonpublic since it is subjective in nature
and based on unique assumptions and inputs used by fund management.643 Since we have
decided to not adopt the proposed instructions which would have required funds to categorize
investments by both industry and geographic regions, we do not think it is necessary to include
specific instructions on how funds should report geographic concentrations or treat the disclosure
as nonpublic. However, we note the current GAAP requirement to disclose significant

See, e.g., Oppenheimer Comment Letter; State Street Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter;
MFS Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment Letter (in chart or table); SIFMA Comment Letter I;
ICI Comment Letter; BlackRock Comment Letter (results in additional costs to shareholders, without
a corresponding benefit); AICPA Comment Letter. In response to our proposal to categorize
investments by both industry and geographic regions, some commenters suggested as an alternative
that funds should report the percentage of securities by country or geographic region as a separate
schedule, graph, or chart. See, e.g., State Street Comment Letter; MFS Comment Letter; ICI
Comment Letter; BlackRock Comment Letter; AICPA Comment Letter. However, given the fact that
we are not adopting this proposal, we believe a separate schedule is unnecessary.

concentrations of credit risk, which includes information about shared regions that identify the
concentration remains unchanged.644
In order to provide more transparency to a fund’s investments in debt securities, we are
adopting, with certain modifications discussed below, our proposed instruction to rule 12-12
requiring a fund to indicate the interest rate or preferential dividend rate and maturity date for
certain enumerated debt instruments.645 When disclosing the interest rate for variable rate
securities, we proposed that the fund describe the referenced rate and spread.646 In proposing
disclosures for variable rate securities, we requested comment on other alternatives, such as
period-end interest rate (e.g. the investment’s interest rate in effect at the end of the period).647
We received several comments supporting our proposal to provide the reference rate and spread
for variable rate securities, reasoning that the disclosure of the components of the variable rate
would be easier for investors and other interested parties to determine the investment’s current
rate at any given time (as opposed to the rate at the end of the reporting period).648 However,
another commenter suggested that the period-end interest rate is the most appropriate variable
rate security disclosure for shareholders.649
We continue to believe that disclosure of the referenced rate and spread will allow
investors to better understand the economics of the fund’s investments in variable rate debt

securities. We are persuaded, however, that the period-end interest rate is also important for
investors because it will provide investors with the actual interest rate of the investment at the
period end, thereby giving investors both the ability to understand the investment’s current return
(through period-end rate) and to better understand how interest rate changes could affect the
investment’s future returns. Therefore, in a modification from the proposal, we are now
including in the instruction a requirement that the fund both describe the referenced rate and
spread and provide the end of period interest rate for each investment, or include disclosure of
each referenced rate at the end of the period.650 For securities with payments-in-kind, we
proposed that the fund provide the rate paid in-kind in order to provide more transparency to
investors when the fund is generating income that is not paid in cash.651 We received no
comments addressing this item and therefore are adopting as proposed.652
We also proposed to modify the current instruction to rule 12-12653 that requires a fund to
identify each issue of securities held in connection with open put or call option contracts and
loans for short sales, by adding the requirement to also indicate where any portion of the issue is
on loan.654 We received no comments on this item. This disclosure, which we believe is

See rules 12-12, n. 4; 12-12A, n. 3; 12-14, n. 3 of Regulation S-X. For purposes of clarity, we also

as proposed, reference the instruction in rule 12-12, n. 4. Id.

identify the interest rate or preferential dividend rate and maturity date as required by Instruction 4 of
rule 12-12. See rule 12-12A, n. 3 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 4 will require the subtotals for each
category of investments, subdivided both by type of investment and industry, country, or geographic

Instructions Common to Rules 12-12 through 12-12B and 12-13 through
12-13D

We proposed several instructions to the proposed rules in order to maintain consistency
with the disclosures required by current rules 12-12 and 12-13. Current rule 12-13 contains an
instruction requiring identification of “each investment not readily marketable.”661 We proposed
to modify this requirement in current rule 12-13 (new rule 12-13D), and add it to the new
schedules we are adopting or modifying concerning derivatives, by adding instructions that funds
must indicate (1) whether an investment was fair valued by using significant unobservable

659

See rule 6-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.6-10(c)(2)]; see also Quarterly Portfolio Holdings
Adopting Release, supra footnote 421.

660

Instruction 2 will add “type of investment” to the current subtotal requirements for the summary
schedule. See proposed rule 12-12B, n. 2 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 3 will extend rule 12-12’s
requirement that funds indicate the interest rate or preferential dividend rate and maturity date for
certain enumerated securities. See rule 12-12B, n. 3 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 5 will require for
options purchased all information that would be required by rule 12-13 for written option contracts.
See rule 12-12B, n. 5 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 12 will require the fund to indicate each issue of
securities whose fair value was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See rule 12-12B, n.
12 of Regulation S-X; see also infra section II.C.4. Instruction 13 will extend rule 12-12’s
requirement that the fund indicate “where any portion of the issue is on loan.” See rule 12-12B, n. 13
of Regulation S-X.

661

See current rule 12-13, n. 4 of Regulation S-X (“The term ‘investment not readily marketable’ shall
include investments for which there is no independent publicly quoted market and investments which
cannot be sold because of restrictions or conditions applicable to the investment or the company.”).

192

inputs662 and (2) whether an investment cannot be sold because of restrictions or conditions
applicable to the investment.663 These proposed instructions were intended to increase
transparency into the marketability of, and observability of valuation inputs for, a fund’s
investments by instead requiring separate identification of investments that are restricted
investments, as well as those investments that were fair valued using significant unobservable
inputs. Similarly, for proposed rules 12-12, 12-12A, and 12-12B, we proposed to include an
instruction requiring funds to indicate whether an issue of securities was fair valued by using
significant unobservable inputs.664
We received comments generally supporting the disclosure of investments fair valued
using significant unobservable inputs. 665 However, in order to make “value” consistent with
current Article 12, the final rule amendments only refer to “value” (rather than “fair value,” as
we do in the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X), which is consistently used and defined
under Regulation S-X.666 We are therefore adopting the requirement that funds indicate if an
investment’s value was determined using significant unobservable inputs.667

We received one comment relating to our proposed instruction requiring identification of
a derivative that cannot be sold because of restrictions or conditions applicable to the
derivative.668 That commenter noted that we should clarify and provide examples of what is
meant by restrictions applicable to derivatives.669 We believe the instruction is clear that a
derivative that cannot be sold as of the reporting date because of a restriction applicable to the
investment itself (as opposed to e.g. illiquidity in the market) should be identified. Therefore, we
are adopting the instruction as proposed.670
Current rules 12-12, 12-12C, and 12-13 each contain an instruction to include tax basis
disclosures for investments.671 We proposed extending this requirement to the proposed rules
concerning derivatives holdings and securities sold short672 because we believed that this type of
tax basis information may be important to investors in investment companies, which are
generally pass-through entities pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code.673 We

measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized within different levels of the fair
value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same
level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire
measurement.”) (emphasis added); Harvest Comment Letter (supporting disclosure of level 3
securities).

Id. (“For example, it is unclear whether the lockup period for trading blocks would be included as a
restriction applicable to derivatives. If the SEC’s purpose is to have a narrow definition, then it is
unclear whether the stricter definition includes limitation on the types of entities that would be able to
buy an instrument such as rule 144a [sic] restrictions, which limits trading to qualified institutional
buyers.”). Consistent with this example, a restricted security subject to rule 144A would be identified
as restricted under rules 12-12, 12-12A, or 12-12B only if the security has restrictions and the fund
cannot sell the security to qualified institutional buyers at the report date due to those restrictions.

received several comments arguing against extending our proposed tax basis disclosures to the
proposed derivatives schedules. Several commenters noted their belief that disclosure of tax
basis by investment type would not provide meaningful disclosure to investors, while increasing
the volume and complexity of the financial statements.674 Others stated that the tax-basis
information is unnecessary in light of recently added GAAP-required disclosure of tax basis
components of dividends and distributions.675 The current GAAP requirement that funds
disclose the components of distributable earnings (including undistributed ordinary income,
undistributed long-term capital gains, capital loss carryforwards and unrealized
appreciation/depreciation) on a tax basis using the most recent tax year-end enables investors to
determine the amount of accumulated and undistributed earnings that they could potentially
receive in the future and on which they could be taxed.676 Some commenters recommended an
alternative that funds should disclose the aggregate tax basis of all investments relating to the
portfolio as whole, or those that are recorded as assets or liabilities.677
We agree that tax disclosures relating to the portfolio as a whole provides sufficient

cost of all investments in an unrealized appreciation and the cost of all assets in an unrealized
depreciation on a gross basis, which we believe may be useful to investors to further understand
the potential amounts they might receive and on which they could be taxed. As a result, we
have determined not to extend the tax basis disclosures currently required by rules 12-12, 1212B, and 12-13 to our new disclosures of derivative investments (rules 12-13 through 12-13C)
and securities sold short (rule 12-12A). For the same reasons, we are removing this disclosure
requirement from each of the rules 12-12, 12-12B (current rule 12-12C), and 12-13D (current
rule 12-13)678 and instead moving it to Article 6 of Regulation S-X as a rule of general
application requiring that funds report these tax basis disclosures relating to the portfolio as a
whole.679
We also proposed to require funds to identify illiquid investments.680 As we stated in the
proposal, liquidity is an important consideration for a fund’s investors in understanding the risk
exposure of a fund.681 We received numerous comments registering concerns with this proposed
instruction to require portfolio-level liquidity disclosures.682 For example, commenters noted

investments in which there is an excess of tax cost over value, (c) the net unrealized appreciation or
depreciation, and (d) the aggregate cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes.”)

that disclosure of illiquid assets could confuse fund shareholders, as they could erroneously
assume that disclosure of illiquid assets is an objective determination.683 Similarly, commenters
noted that liquidity information could become stale given the time delay between the end of the
period and the time that such information would become available to the public.684 Others
expressed concern that portfolio-level liquidity disclosures in financial statements would be
difficult and costly to audit, as auditors would be required to engage specialists to determine the
validity of the fund’s liquidity determinations for each investment.685 Moreover, as discussed in
the Liquidity Adopting Release, we are concurrently adopting portfolio-level liquidity reporting
on Form N-PORT which we believe mitigates many of the commenters’ concerns and is a more
appropriate method of public reporting.686 Accordingly, we are not adopting the proposed
instructions in Regulation S-X relating to the liquidity of investments.687

also suggested, as an alternative, requiring registrant to label the disclosure of illiquid investments as
“unaudited subject to change based on market conditions” as a way to mitigate financial statement
and audit costs. See Deloitte Comment Letter. However, while this suggestion may mitigate some
auditing costs for funds, as discussed above, we have determined that disclosures on Form N-PORT,
with portfolio-level liquidity information being made public, provides an appropriate method of
providing information for the benefit of the Commission, investors, and other interested third parties.

Investments In and Advances to Affiliates – Rule 12-14

We proposed amendments to rule 12-14 (Investments in and advances to affiliates).688
Rule 12-14 currently requires a fund to make certain disclosures about its investments in and
advances to any “affiliates” or companies in which the investment company owns 5% or more of
the outstanding voting securities.689 The rule currently requires that a fund disclose the “amount
of equity in net profit and loss for the period” for each controlled company, but does not require
disclosure of realized or unrealized gains or losses. Based upon staff experience, we believe that
the presentation of realized gains or losses and changes in unrealized appreciation or
depreciation would assist investors with better understanding the impact of each affiliated
investment on the fund’s statement of operations. As a result, we had proposed to modify
Column C of the schedule to rule 12-14 to require “net realized gain or loss for the period,”690
and Column D to require “net increase or decrease in unrealized appreciation or depreciation for
the period” for each affiliated investment. 691 We received one comment supporting this aspect
of the proposal and are adopting it as proposed.692
Likewise, in instruction 6(e) and (f), we proposed to require disclosure of total realized
gain or loss and total net increase or decrease in unrealized appreciation or depreciation for

688

See proposed rule 12-14 of Regulation S-X.

689

See rule 12-14 of Regulation S-X; see also section 2(a)(3)(A) of the Investment Company Act
(defining an “Affiliated person” as “any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding
with power to vote, 5 per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of such other person.”).

690

See proposed rule 12-14, Column C of Regulation S-X. Column C of current rule 12-14 requires
disclosure of the “amount of equity in net profit and loss for the period,” which is derived from the
controlled company’s income statement and does not directly translate to the impact to a fund’s
statement of operations. We proposed to replace this requirement with “net realized gain or loss for
the period.”

affiliated investments in order to correlate these totals to the statement of operations.693
Disclosure of these realized gains or losses and changes in unrealized appreciation or
depreciation, in addition to the current requirement to disclose the amount of affiliated income,
will allow investors to understand the full impact of an affiliated investment on a fund’s
statement of operations.694 We received no comments on this proposal and are therefore
adopting our modifications to instructions 6(e) and 6(f) as proposed.695
Additionally, we proposed a new instruction 7 in order to make the categorization of
investments in and advances to affiliates consistent with the method of categorization used in
rules 12-12, 12-12A, and 12-12B, for which we received no comments and are adopting as
proposed.696
We proposed several other amendments to the instructions to rule 12-14 in order to, in
part, conform the rule to our disclosure requirements in rules 12-12 and 12-13. Subject to the
modifications discussed above in section II.C.4, we are adopting as proposed. 697

Instruction 1 will delete the instruction to segregate subsidiaries consolidated in order to make the
disclosures under rule 12-14 consistent with the fund’s balance sheet. See rule 12-14, n. 1 of
Regulation S-X. Instruction 2 will require the fund to categorize the schedule to rule 12-14 in the
same manner as is required by Instruction 2 of rule 12-12. See rule 12-14, n. 2 of Regulation S-X.
Instruction 3 will require the fund to identify the interest rate or preferential dividend rated and
maturity date, as applicable. See rule 12-14, n. 3 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 4 will add Column F
to the columns to be totaled and update the instruction to state that Column F should agree with the
correlative amount shown on the related balance sheet. See rule 12-14, n. 4 of Regulation S-X.
Instruction 5 will update the reference to Instruction 8 of rule 12-12 and reference to rule 12-13 to
reflect the changes in the numbering of the instructions for those rules. See rule 12-14, n. 5 of
Regulation S-X. Instructions 6(a) and (b) will update references to Column D to reference Column E
in order to reflect our proposed changes to rule 12-14’s schedule. See rule 12-14, nn. 6(a) and (b) of
Regulation S-X. Instruction 6(d), which adds clarifying language from Instruction 7 of rule 12-12,
will provide the fund with more detail on the definition of non-income producing securities. See rule

Form and Content of Financial Statements

Finally, we are adopting substantially as proposed, revisions to Article 6 of Regulation SX, which prescribes the form and content of financial statements filed for funds. Many of the
revisions we are adopting today are intended to conform Article 6 with our changes to Article 12
and update other financial statement requirements.698 As part of these changes, we proposed to
modify the title and the description of Article 6 from “Registered Investment Companies” to
“Registered Investment Companies and Business Development Companies” to clarify that BDCs
are subject to Article 6 of Regulation S-X. 699 This amendment is a technical amendment and
does not change existing requirements for BDCs.700 Commenters did not object to this
change,701 and we are adopting it as proposed.702

12-14, n. 6(d) of Regulation S-X. Instruction 8 will require the fund to identify each issue of
securities whose fair value was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See rule 12-14, n. 8
of Regulation S-X; see supra section II.C.4. Instruction 9 will require the fund to indicate each issue
of securities held in connection with open put or call option contracts, loans for short sales, or where
any portion of the issue is on loan, as required by note 10 to rule 12-12. See rule 12-14, n. 9 of
Regulation S-X.
698

We proposed to amend the reference in rule 6-03(c) to §210.3A-05, as that section of Regulation S-X
was rescinded in 2011. See Rescission of Outdated Rules and Forms, and Amendments to Correct
References, Securities Act Release No. 33-9273 (Nov. 4, 2011) [76 FR 71872 (Nov. 21, 2011)]. We
received no comments on this proposed amendment and are adopting as proposed. See rule 6-03(c) of
Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.6-03(c)].

699

See proposed rules 6-01; 6-03; 6-03(c)(1); 6-03(d); 6-03(i); 6-04; and 6-07 of Regulation S-X.
A BDC is a closed-end fund that is operated for the purpose of making investments in small and
developing businesses and financially troubled businesses and that elects to be regulated as a BDC.
See section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act (defining BDCs). BDCs are not subject to
periodic reporting requirements under the Investment Company Act, although they must comply with
periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange Act.

700

See Instruction 1.a to Item 6.c of Form N-2 (“A business development company should comply with
the provisions of Regulation S-X generally applicable to registered management investment
companies. (See section 210.3-18 [17 CFR 210.3-18] and sections 210.6-01 through 210.6-10 of
Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.6-01 through 210.6-10]).”).

701

See, e.g., Deloitte Comment Letter. This commenter suggested that, in addition, we also clarify that
Article 6 applies to Securities Act registrants who meet the definition of “Investment Company”
under FASB or IFRS, yet are not registered under the Investment Company Act. Id. The change to

In order to allow a more uniform presentation of investment schedules in a fund’s
financial statements, we proposed to rescind subparagraph (a) of rule 6-10 under Regulation S-X,
regarding which schedules are to be filed.703 One commenter noted that consolidated subsidiary
information could be useful for investors, as information about the specific entities’ ownership
may make the structure of the fund more transparent to investors.704 We were persuaded that
such information may be useful to investors and are therefore not rescinding subparagraph (a) of
rule 6-10.705
Another commenter requested that we require disclosure of costs associated with the
management of controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”) or expenses embedded in the return
being received in the footnotes to the financial statements.706 The commenter also requested that
funds be required to report these expenses either in calculations of total operating expenses or as
acquired fund expenses in other filings.707 We believe that disclosure of these expenses are
already included, as applicable, in (1) the expenses reported within the statement of operations of

reference BDCs is a technical change that is not intended to expand the entities subject to Article 6.
See supra footnote 699 and accompanying text. The Proposing Release addressed the reporting and
disclosure of information by registered investment companies and BDCs. Since the Proposing
Release did not address the possibility of subjecting other entities, such as the ones described by the
commenter, to this rulemaking, extending the regulations could have unforeseen implications,
including potentially subjecting such entities to the requirements of Article 6. We believe such a
change is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

See rules 6-01; 6-03; 6-03(c)(1); 6-03(d); 6-03(i); 6-04; 6-04.10; and 6-07 of Regulation S-X.

the consolidated investment company where the CFC is a consolidated entity,708 or (2) in the
required Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses disclosures within the prospectus filing of the
investment company where the CFC is not consolidated; and therefore no further modifications
are necessary.709
Current rule 6-10(a) also provides that if the information required by any schedule
(including the notes thereto) is shown in the related financial statement or in a note thereto
without making such statement unclear or confusing, that procedure may be followed and the
schedule omitted.710 As we stated in the Proposing Release, we believe that some funds may
have interpreted this guidance as allowing presentation of some Article 12 schedules (e.g., rules
12-13 and 12-14) in the notes to the financial statements, as opposed to immediately following
the schedules required by rules 12-12, 12-12A, and 12-12C. Our proposal to rescind rule 6-10(a)
would have also eliminated this instruction. Commenters generally supported eliminating this
instruction as it would assist with the comparability of funds by shareholders.711 In light of the
increased use of derivatives by funds, we continue to believe that all schedules required by rule
6-10 should be presented together within a fund’s financial statements, and not in the notes to the
financial statements. We recognize that this may change current practice for some funds but
believe that, coupled with more detailed disclosure rules for derivatives, this amendment would
provide more consistent disclosure and improve the usability of financial statements for
investors. However, as discussed above, we were persuaded to not rescind rule 6-10(a) in these

final rules. Thus we are adopting a conforming modification to rule 6-10(a) to eliminate this
specific instruction.712
We also proposed changes to rules 6-03 and 6-04 to specifically reference the
investments required to be reported on separate schedules in amended Article 12.713 We
received no comment on these proposals and are adopting them as proposed.714 Additionally, we
proposed to eliminate current rule 6-04.4, which requires disclosure of “Total investments” on
the balance sheet under “Assets,” recognizing that investments reported under proposed rules 1213A through 12-13D could potentially be presented under both assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet.715 For example, a fund may hold a forward foreign currency contract with
unrealized appreciation and a different forward foreign currency contract with unrealized
depreciation. The fund may present on its balance sheet an asset balance for the contract with
unrealized appreciation and a liability balance for the contract with unrealized depreciation.
Totaling the amounts of investments reported under assets could be misleading to investors in
this example, or in other examples where a fund holds derivatives in a liability position (e.g.,
unrealized depreciation on an interest rate swap contract). A “Total investments” amount in the
Assets section of the fund’s balance sheet would include the fund’s investments in securities and

712

See rule 6-10(a) of Regulation S-X (“When information is required in schedules for both the person
and its subsidiaries consolidated, it may be represented in the form of a single schedule, provided that
items pertaining to the registrant are separately shown and that such single schedule affords a
properly summarized presentation of the facts.”) Additionally, in order to conform rule 6-10(c) with
the new requirements under Article 12, we added schedules corresponding to our proposed new
schedules of derivatives investments, as discussed above. See rule 6-10(c) of Regulation S-X.

713

See proposed rules 6-03(d); 6-04.3; 6-04.9 of Regulation S-X. We also proposed to amend rule 604.10 to reflect that the amount of liabilities for securities sold short and for open options contracts
written would be reported under proposed rule 6-04.9. See proposed rule 6-04.10 of Regulation S-X.

derivatives that are in an appreciated position, but it would not include the unrealized
depreciation on the interest rate swap contract, which would be classified under the Liabilities
section of the fund’s balance sheet. Given the increasing use of derivatives by funds, we
continue to believe eliminating current rule 6-04.4 would provide more complete information to
investors. We received no comments on this proposal and are adopting this change as proposed,
as well as the corresponding proposed change in rule 6-03(d) to remove the reference to “total
investments reported under [rule 6-04.4].”716 As discussed above in section II.C.4, we are also
adding a requirement to rule 6-03(h) requiring funds to report the cost of all investments in an
unrealized appreciation and the cost of all assets in an unrealized depreciation on a gross basis.717
We are also adopting, as proposed, an amendment to rule 6-04 to refer individually to our
derivatives disclosures in proposed rules 12-13A through 12-13C.718 As is currently the case,
these proposed amendments are not meant to require gross presentation where netting is allowed
under U.S. GAAP.719 For example, if a fund held a forward foreign currency contract which had
unrealized appreciation and another forward foreign currency contract which had unrealized
depreciation, the fact that forward foreign currency contracts are mentioned in proposed rules 604.3(b) and 6-04.9(d) is not meant to require both contracts to be presented gross on the balance
sheet if netting were allowed under U.S. GAAP. We received no comments on this proposal.
We also proposed, amendments to rule 6-05.3 which would specifically require
presentation of items relating to investments other than securities in the notes to financial

of disclosures required by rules 6-04.10 through 6-04.13, which include information relating to
securities sold short and open option contracts written.721 Our proposal would also have
amended rule 6-05.3 to require fund financial statements to reflect all unaffiliated investments
other than securities presented on separate schedules under Article 12.722 We received no
comments on this aspect of the proposal and are adopting it as proposed.723
We also proposed to add new disclosure requirements that are designed to increase
transparency to investors about certain investments and activities. First, we proposed to add new
subsection (m) to rule 6-03 that would require funds to make certain disclosures in connection
with a fund’s securities lending activities and cash collateral management in order to allow
investors to better understand the income generated from, as well as the expenses associated
with, securities lending activities.724 As discussed in more detail below, after consideration of
issues raised by commenters, we have determined that it is more appropriate to require that these
disclosures be made in a fund’s Statement of Additional Information (or, for closed-end funds,
reports on Form N-CSR) or in Form N-CEN, rather than to require their inclusion in its financial
statements.725
Second, we proposed to amend rule 6-07 to require funds to make a separate disclosure
for income from non-cash dividends and payment-in-kind interest on the statement of

operations.726 Our proposed amendment to rule 6-07 was intended to increase transparency for
investors in order to allow them to better understand when fund income is earned, but not
received, in the form of cash. While one commenter generally supported disclosure for in-kind
payments,727 many recommended, if the Commission should adopt such a disclosure, that we
provide a disclosure threshold for non-cash income, such as one similar to the requirement to
disclose expense items that exceed 5 percent of total expenses.728 We agree with commenters’
that a disclosure threshold for non-cash disclosures would alleviate unnecessary reporting
burdens. We also agree with commenters that, in order to keep all income disclosures under rule
6-07.1 consistent, a 5 percent de minimis threshold, which is the current requirement for
categories of investment income and expenses under current rule 6-07.1, is also appropriate for
our amended non-cash income disclosure under rule 6-07.1.729 As a result, we are modifying the
proposal by adopting a new instruction to rule 6-07.1 clarifying that a separate disclosure of
income from payment-in-kind interest or non-cash dividends, like other types of income under
current rule 6-07.1, is only required if all income of this type exceeds 5 percent of the fund’s
investment.730

206

Other commenters requested that we define “non-cash dividends” and “payment-in-kindinterest earned.”731 Finally, as in Form N-PORT, some commenters noted that certain in-kind
payments, such as when a fund has the option to elect to receive either cash or in-kind payments,
do not raise the same risks as in-kind payments resulting from a distressed issuer and should
therefore be disclosed separately.732 As discussed above in connection with Form N-PORT, we
agree that in-kind payments resulting from an election, rather than, for example, issuer distress,
do not involve the same risk of issuer default. Therefore not requiring funds to report on Form
N-PORT interest paid in-kind if the fund has the option of electing in-kind payments and has
elected to be paid in-kind.733 However, we believe for the statement of operations, it is important
that all types of income from in-kind payments be subject to the separate disclosure threshold so
that investors can compare this information to other funds. Thus, we do not believe that it is
appropriate or necessary to provide prescriptive definitions of “non-cash dividends” and
“payment-in-kind-interest earned ”for purposes of income statement disclosure and, unlike Form
N-PORT, we are not amending Regulation S-X to differentiate income from different types of
in-kind payments.734
We proposed to amend rule 6-07.7(a) in order to conform statement of operations
disclosures of the net realized gains or losses from investments to include our additional

734

See rule 6-07.1 of Regulation S-X. Commenters specifically requested that we not require separate
disclosures for amortization and accretion as it is unnecessary because shareholders generally do not
distinguish between cash interest income and income in the form of accretion or amortization. See,
e.g., PwC Comment Letter; MFS Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; AICPA Comment Letter.
We agree and are not including a separate disclosure for amortizations and accretions.

207

derivatives disclosures in proposed rules 12-13A through 12-13C.735 Likewise, we proposed
similar changes to proposed rule 6-07.7(c) (current rule 6-07.7(d)) in order to conform statement
of operations disclosures of the net increase or decrease in the unrealized appreciation or
depreciation of investments to include our new derivatives disclosures.736 We received no
comments on this proposal and are adopting both changes as proposed.737
We also proposed to eliminate Regulation S-X’s requirement for specific disclosure of
written options activity under current rule 6-07.7(c).738 This provision was adopted prior to
FASB adopting disclosures generally applicable to derivatives, including written options, now
required by FASB ASC Topic 815.739 We continue to believe that the requirement for specific

of derivative instruments, gains and losses on derivative instruments, and information that would

for this proposal, which we are adopting.741
We proposed to eliminate the exception in Schedule II of current rule 6-10 which does
not require reporting under current rule 12-13 if the investments, at both the beginning and end
of the period, amount to one percent or less of the value of total investments.742 We believe that
it is appropriate to eliminate this exception, because a fund may have significant notional
amounts in its portfolio that could be valued at one percent or less of the value of total
investments. Accordingly, removing this exception will provide more transparency to investors
regarding a fund’s derivatives activity. We received no comments on this proposal, and we are
adopting it as proposed.743
D.

Form N-CEN and Rescission of Form N-SAR

1.

Overview

We are adopting a new framework by which registered investment companies will report
census-type information to the Commission by rescinding Form N-SAR and replacing it with a

740

Id. Rule 6-07.7(c) requires disclosure in a note to the financial statements of the number and
associated dollar amounts as to option contracts written: (i) At the beginning of the period; (ii) during
the period; (iii) expired during the period; (iv) closed during the period; (v) exercised during the
period; and (vi) balance at end of the period. The balances at the beginning of the period and end of
the period are available in the prior period-end and current period-end schedules of open option
contracts written, respectively. By eliminating the written options roll-forward, investors would no
longer have information regarding the number of contracts expired, closed, or exercised during the
period. However, disclosures required by ASC 815 provide gains and losses on derivative
instruments, including written options, along with information that would enable users to understand
the volume of derivative activity during the period.

See current rule 6-10(c)(1) Schedule II of Regulation S-X; see also proposed rule 6-10(b)(1) Schedule
II of Regulation S-X.

743

We also made several technical, non-substantive changes to the proposed rules. See rules 6-03(d) and
6-07 (moved “business development companies” to after “other than face-amount certificates.”).

209

new form—Form N-CEN.744 Most commenters generally supported our proposal to replace
Form N-SAR with Form N-CEN, agreeing that Form N-CEN provides both the Commission and
the public with enhanced and updated census-type information on a wide range of compliance,
risk assessment, and policy related matters.745 Form N-SAR was adopted by the Commission in
1985 and requires that funds report a variety of census-type information to the Commission,
including information relating to a fund’s organization, service providers, fees and expenses,
portfolio strategies and investments, portfolio transactions, and share transactions. Funds
generally must file reports on Form N-SAR semi-annually, except for UITs, which file
annually.746 By contrast, as discussed further below, all funds will now file reports on Form
N-CEN annually.747
In recent years, Commission staff has found that the utility of the information reported on
Form N-SAR has become increasingly limited. We believe there are two primary reasons for
this limited utility. First, in the past two decades, we have not substantively updated the
information reported on the form to reflect new market developments, products, investment
practices, or risks. Second, the technology by which funds file reports on Form N-SAR has not
been updated and limits the Commission staff’s ability to extract and analyze the data reported.
We believe that by updating the content and format requirements for census reporting through

744

We are rescinding Form N-SAR and replacing it with a new census reporting form, Form N-CEN,
rather than amending Form N-SAR in order to avoid technical difficulties that could arise with filing
reports on an amended Form N-SAR (e.g., difficulties related to changes to filing format and form
specifications). We have modified the numbering convention for items within Form N-CEN to be
consistent with that of the numbering conventions of other forms (e.g., Forms N-MFP and N-PORT).

Comment Letter; BlackRock Comment Letter.

new Form N-CEN, the Commission will be better able to carry out its regulatory functions while
at the same time reducing burdens on filers.
Many commenters agreed that Form N-SAR is outdated and commended the
Commission’s efforts to improve the relevance of information reported to the Commission.748
Commenters generally supported Form N-CEN as proposed, and we are adopting the form
substantially as proposed with some modifications to address specific issues raised by
commenters, as discussed in more detail below.
Form N-CEN gathers similar census information about the fund industry that funds
currently report on Form N-SAR, which will be able to be aggregated and analyzed by
Commission staff to better understand industry trends, inform policy, and assist with the
Commission’s examination program. To improve the quality and utility of information reported,
Form N-CEN streamlines and updates information reported to the Commission to reflect current
Commission staff information needs and developments in the industry.749 Where possible, we
have endeavored to exclude items from Form N-CEN that are disclosed or reported pursuant to
other Commission forms, or are otherwise available; however, in some limited cases, we are
collecting information on Form N-CEN that may be similarly disclosed or reported elsewhere,
but that the staff would benefit from collecting in a structured format.

748

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I; Invesco Comment Letter; BlackRock
Comment Letter.

749

We are streamlining our data collection, in part, through the use of yes/no questions in order to flag
certain information for follow-up, if necessary, by Commission staff. See, e.g., Item B.10 and Item
C.6.a of Form N-CEN. For example, staff of our Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations
may rely on responses to flag questions in Form N-CEN to indicate areas for follow-up discussion or
to request additional information.

211

In order to improve the utility of the information reported to the Commission, we are
requiring that reports on Form N-CEN be structured in an XML format.750 Under this format,
filers will no longer be required to use outdated technology for census reporting. Additionally,
the XML structured format will allow reported information to be more efficiently and effectively
validated, aggregated, compared, and analyzed through automated means and, therefore, more
useful to end users.
One commenter expressed support for the XML format.751 As discussed above in
connection with Form N-PORT, certain others generally advocated for XBRL, a tagged system
that is based on XML and was created specifically for the purpose of reporting financial and
business information.752 Another commenter noted that the Commission should standardize the
formatting requirements (i.e., ASCII/TXT, HTML, XBRL, XML) across all fund reporting in
order to ease the burden on funds that would have to comply with different formatting
requirements.753
As discussed above in connection with Form N-PORT, based upon our experiences with
Forms N-MFP and PF, both of which require filers to report information in an XML format, we
believe that requiring funds to report information on Form N-CEN in an XML format will

750

The Commission has adopted a number of other forms that are structured in an XML format,
including Form N-MFP. Reports on Form N-SAR, by contrast, are filed using an outdated filing
application.

and reduce the amount of defective reporting currently possible in Form N-SAR).

See AICPA Comment Letter; XBRL US Comment Letter; but see Morningstar Comment Letter

standard are too lenient for regular data validation.”). See also supra footnotes 444–449 and
accompanying text.

753

See Schnase Comment Letter (opining that the Commission should also ease the burdens on funds by
allowing funds to input their data through a pre-formatted web portal or web form).

212

provide the information that we seek in an appropriate manner.754 Moreover, the interoperability
of data between Forms N-MFP, PF, N-PORT, and N-CEN will aid the staff with cross-checking
information reported to the Commission and in monitoring the fund industry.755 As discussed
further below in the economic analysis, the XML format will also improve the quality of the
information disclosed by imposing constraints on how the information will be provided and by
providing a built-in validation framework of the data in the reports.756 We are therefore adopting
the requirement that reports on Form N-CEN be filed in an XML format as proposed.
2.

Who Must File Reports on Form N-CEN

We are adopting, as proposed, the requirement that all registered investment companies,
except face-amount certificate companies,757 file reports on Form N-CEN.758 No commenters
objected to this requirement.759 As proposed, funds offering multiple series will be required to

754

See supra footnotes 444–449 and accompanying text. Based on our experience with reports on Form
N-MFP and other XML-based reports, we anticipate that the XML structured data file will be
compatible with a wide range of open source and proprietary information management software
applications. Continued advances in structured data software, search engines, and other web-based
tools may further enhance the accessibility and usability of the data. See, e.g., Money Market Reform
2010 Release, supra footnote 447, at n. 341.

755

See Morningstar Comment Letter.

756

See infra section III.B.

757

Face-amount certificate companies are investment companies which are engaged or propose to
engage in the business of issuing face-amount certificates of the installment type, or which have been
engaged in such businesses and have any such certificates outstanding. See section 4(1) of the
Investment Company Act. Face-amount certificate companies currently are not required to file
reports on Form N-SAR. See General Instruction A of Form N-SAR. Face-amount certificate
companies will continue to file periodic reports pursuant to section 13 [17 CFR 240.13a-1] or section
15(d) of the Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.15d-1].

758

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at section II.E.2. See also rule 30a-1. Consistent with Form
N-SAR, BDCs, which are not registered investment companies, will not be required to file reports on
Form N-CEN.

759

See Morningstar Comment Letter (noting that the filing requirement is appropriate, but also
suggesting that the Commission allow flexibility on how a fund chooses to report the data, including
filing at the CIK-level with separate “nodes” for each series ID and designing the data base that is to
house this information using the filing data and CIK as a key for each registrant-level data record).

213

report information in Part C of the form as to each series separately, even if some information is
the same for two or more series.760 One commenter opined that one report covering multiple
series would be sufficient as many questions apply to the registrant.761
Like Form N-SAR, the sections of Form N-CEN that a fund is required to complete will
depend on the type of registrant in order to better tailor the reporting requirements.762 As was
proposed, all funds will be required to complete Parts A and B, and file any attachments required
under Part G. In addition, funds will be required to complete the following Parts as applicable:


All management companies, other than SBICs, will complete Part C;



Closed-end funds and SBICs will complete Part D;



ETFs (including those that are UITs) will complete Part E;763 and



UITs will complete Part F.764

760

General Instruction A of Form N-CEN. Unlike Form N-PORT where separate reports will be filed
for each series, registrants will file one report on Form N-CEN covering all series (as is currently
done with reports on Form N-SAR). We are adopting this framework for Form N-CEN to help
minimize reporting burdens, as much of the information that will be required by Form N-CEN (for
example, the information reported pursuant to Part A and Part B) will be the same across a fund’s
various series. We note that Form N-SAR’s approach to series information is slightly different than
that of Form N-CEN, in that Form N-SAR allows registrants to indicate instances where the
information is the same across all series, rather than requiring repetitive information. See General
Instruction D(8) of Form N-SAR. Unlike Form N-SAR, however, to limit the reporting of repetitive
information, Form N-CEN is organized such that information that is generally the same for all series
is reported in Parts A and B of the form, with Part C, the part of the form that requires each series to
respond separately, requesting information that is more likely to differ between series.

761

See State Street Comment Letter.

762

See General Instruction A of Form N-CEN. As reflected in General Instruction A, registrants will be
required to respond to each item in each required Part. To the extent an item in a required Part is
inapplicable to a registrant, the registrant should respond “N/A” to that item. Registrants will not,
however, have to provide responses to items in Parts they are not required to respond to.

763

See id. Certain investment products known as “exchange-traded managed funds” will also be
required to complete Part E of Form N-CEN.

764

See id. Management companies that are registered on Form N-3 are also required to complete
certain items in Part F as directed by Item B.6.c.i of Form N-CEN. See General Instruction A of
Form N-CEN.

214

3.

Frequency of Reporting and Filing Deadline

Management investment companies currently file reports on Form N-SAR semiannually,765 and UITs file such reports annually.766 To reduce reporting burdens, we proposed
that reports on Form N-CEN be filed on an annual basis, regardless of type of filer.767 While one
commenter suggested semi-annual reporting on Form N-CEN if certain additional requirements
were to be included,768 most commenters generally supported the annual filing requirement.769
Because Form N-CEN requires census-type information, which in our experience does not
change as frequently as, for example, portfolio holdings information, we continue to believe that
an annual filing requirement will be sufficient for purposes of review by Commission staff, as
well as investors and other market participants that might use this information.770 We are,
therefore, adopting as proposed the requirement that reports on Form N-CEN be filed on an
annual basis.771
We proposed that for all funds, the reporting period for Form N-CEN reports would be

765

See current rule 30b1-1.

766

See current rule 30a-1.

767

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33634.

768

See Morningstar Comment Letter (suggesting semi-annual reporting as of the fund’s fiscal year end
should the Commission decide to include Items 34–44, Items 47–52, Item 54, Item 72, and Item 75 of
Form N-SAR, as suggested). See infra section II.D.5 concerning these current Form N-SAR Items.

769

See, e.g., Carol Singer Comment Letter; State Street Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment Letter.

770

As discussed above, certain items that are currently reported on Form N-SAR that would be helpful to
have updated on a more frequent basis are included on Form N-PORT. For example, Item 28 of
Form N-SAR requires the fund to provide its monthly sales and repurchases of the
Registrant’s/Series’ shares. In order to increase the timeliness of the information reported to the staff
for funds flows, certain information relating to monthly flows will be reported on Item B.6 of Form
N-PORT.

771

Because Form N-CEN is to be filed annually by all registered investment companies, we are
rescinding 17 CFR 270.30b1-1 and revising 17 CFR 270.30a-1 to require all registered investment
companies to file reports on Form N-CEN, as proposed. See infra section II.G (concerning technical
and conforming amendments related to current rule 30b1-1 and current rule 30a-1). See rule 30a-1.

215

based on the fund’s fiscal year.772 Currently, management companies file Form N-SAR reports
on a fiscal year basis,773 while UITs file Form N-SAR reports on a calendar year basis.774 After
further consideration, we have determined to require that management companies and UITs
include in Form N-CEN reports information from the same time period as they currently report
on Form N-SAR because we believe that calendar-year reporting for UITs will yield more
comparable data while also reducing costs for reporting UITs.775 One commenter expressed
support for reporting by funds on a fiscal year basis, as that would permit comparisons by data
users between information reported on Form N-CEN and information on Form N-CSR.776 As
regards management investment companies, which are required to file reports on Form N-CSR,
we agree that fiscal year reporting could have this beneficial effect, though the same would not
be true of UITs. Therefore, under the final rule, management companies will file reports on
Form N-CEN on a fiscal year basis while UITs will file such reports on a calendar year basis.777
We have also added an instruction to the form to clarify that management investment
companies that offer multiple series with different fiscal year ends must file a report as of each
772

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33634.

773

See current rule 30b1-1.

774

See current rule 30a-1.

775

In particular, we note that the items relating to UITs in Part F require reporting of aggregate
information across all series of the UIT (as distinct from Part C, which requires series-specific
information in the case of management companies offering multiple series). As proposed, UITs with
multiple series with different fiscal year end dates would have been required to file more than once
per year, at least once for each unique date. Considering that the reported information itself relates to
the entire UIT and not each individual series, we have determined, after further consideration, that it
would be less costly for UITs to report once per year, even if their series have different fiscal years.
Moreover, we believe that the resulting data will be more useful to the Commission and other data
users because the reported information will be as of a consistent date across UITs, and therefore more
readily compared and contrasted. Accordingly, we are requiring UITs to file Form N-CEN reports on
a calendar year basis even where the UIT offers multiple series with different fiscal years.

776

See Morningstar Comment Letter.

777

See rule 30a-1.

216

fiscal year end that responds to (i) Parts A, B, and G, and (ii) Part C and, if applicable, Part E as
to only those series with the fiscal year end covered by the report.778 UITs that offer multiple
series will file a single annual report covering all series as of the end of the calendar year.
Additionally, we received a number of comments on the proposed 60-day filing period.
Some commenters supported this proposed filing period.779 Several other commenters, however,
requested that the filing period be extended to at least a 75-day period, arguing, among other
things, that a longer time period would help stagger the filing deadline from other end-of-month
filing requirements and allow sufficient time to address accounting-related questions.780
We have been persuaded by these comments and are adopting a filing period of 75 days
after the fiscal year-end (for management companies) and calendar year-end (for UITs). We
believe that a 75-day filing period appropriately balances the staff’s need for timely information
against the time necessary for a fund to collect, verify, and report the required information to the
Commission. Furthermore, the census-type information reported on Form N-CEN, in our
experience, does not change frequently, thereby reducing the risk that a longer filing period
would cause the information provided to become stale.
Current rule 30b1-3 under the Investment Company Act requires a fund to file a
transition report on Form N-SAR when a fund’s fiscal year changes.781 Because reports on Form

778

See General Instruction C.1 of Form N-CEN.

779

See Carol Singer Comment Letter; State Street Comment Letter.

780

See, e.g., Comment Letter of The Committee of Annuity Insurers (Aug. 11, 2015) (“CAI Comment
Letter”) (75 days after fiscal year end); ICI Comment Letter (at least 75 days); Invesco Comment
Letter (75 days after fiscal year end); MFS Comment Letter (75 days after fiscal year end, at least for
initial filing for all funds in the fund complex); T. Rowe Price Comment Letter (75 days after fiscal
year end).

See current rule 30b1-3; see also infra section II.G concerning technical and conforming amendments
to current rule 30b1-3.

217

N-CEN are required to be filed annually rather semi-annually, we believe that a rule outlining the
requirements for a transition report will no longer be necessary as transition report filing
requirements for fiscal year changes involve less complexity in the case of reports required to be
filed once a year rather than twice a year. Consequently, we are rescinding rule 30b1-3 as
proposed. We received no comments on this aspect of the proposal. To ensure, however, that
reports are filed at least annually, we are requiring that reports on Form N-CEN not cover a
period of more than 12 months as proposed.782 Thus, if a fund changes its fiscal year, a report
filed on Form N-CEN may cover a period shorter than 12 months, but may not cover a period
longer than 12 months or a period that overlaps with a period covered by a previously filed
report.783 We received no comments on this aspect of the proposal.
As proposed, a fund would be able to file an amendment to a previously filed report on
Form N-CEN at any time, including an amendment to correct a mistake or error in a previously
filed report.784 A fund that files an amendment to a previously filed report on the form should
provide information in response to all items of Form N-CEN, regardless of why the amendment
is filed.785 Commenters did not object to these proposed requirements although one commenter
suggested that an amendment should not be required for any subsequent changes to previously
reported information and that, except for any material errors, any subsequent changes should be
reported in the next filing period.786 We are adopting these requirements as proposed.787

218

Although funds generally should correct a material mistake in a Form N-CEN report by filing an
amendment to that report, Form N-CEN does not generally require registrants to file
amendments in order to update information throughout the year. Rather, changes in information
during the course of the year would be reflected in the fund’s next report on the form.
Similar to Form N-PORT,788 Form N-CEN also includes general filing instructions,789 as
well as definitions of specific terms referenced in the form.790 As discussed in connection with
Form N-PORT above, we have eliminated proposed instructions regarding the signature and
filing of reports,791 because we believe that the general rules and regulations applicable under the
Act provide sufficient guidance regarding those issues.792 As discussed further below, we have
also revised, consistent with the changes to Form N-PORT discussed above, the definitions of
“Exchange-Traded Fund” and “Exchange-Traded Managed Funds” to clarify that the terms
would apply to a series or class of a UIT organized as an ETF or ETMF.793 We have also revised,
as we did in Form N-PORT, the definition of “LEI” to reflect new terminology regarding
LEIs.794

Information Required on Form N-CEN

a.

Part A — General Information

We are adopting, as proposed, Part A of Form N-CEN. We did not receive comments on
Part A. Part A, which will be completed by all funds, will collect information about the
reporting period covered by the report. It requires funds to report the fiscal-year end date and
indicate if the report covers a period of less than 12 months.795
b.

Part B — Information About the Registrant

We proposed a number of reporting items under Part B of Form N-CEN to provide
information about the registrant. Although commenters did not raise broad objections to the
reporting requirements under Part B, many commenters raised concerns with and/or requested
clarification on specific reporting items. We are adopting Part B substantially as proposed with
some modifications in response to comments on specific reporting items. Where we have
received comments on specific reporting requirements, we discuss them in more detail below.
As proposed, Part B of Form N-CEN would have been required to have been completed
by all funds and would have required certain background and other identifying information about
the funds. Part B of Form N-CEN, as proposed, would have included an instruction that required
funds offering multiple series to provide a response for each series when the response to an item
in Part B of the form differed between series, and to label the response with the name and series
identification number of the series to which a response relates.796 In order to provide more
clarity to filers as to when series information is required in Part B of the form, we have removed
the proposed instruction to Part B and have instead added sub-items requesting series

795

See Item A.1 of Form N-CEN.

796

See Instruction to Part B of proposed Form N-CEN.

220

information, when applicable, for certain items in Part B of the form. We have added these subitems to the items in Part B where we believe identification of the particular series would be
most helpful to our monitoring efforts and general review and analysis of the information
reported on the form.797
As proposed, Part B of the form requires certain background and other identifying
information about the fund. This background information will allow the staff to categorize filers
by fund type and will assist with our oversight of funds. Included in this background
information is the fund’s name,798 Investment Company Act filing number,799 and other
identifying information, such as its CIK800 and LEI,801 each of which we are adopting as
proposed. In addition, we are adopting as proposed the requirement that the report include the
fund’s address, telephone number, and public website (if any),802 and the location of the fund’s
books and records.803 While the fund’s name, address, telephone number, and filing number are
currently required by Form N-SAR,804 some of the additional information, such as the fund’s
CIK, LEI, public website and location of books and records are new. As discussed in the

797

See Item B.10, Item B.11, Item B.14, Item B.19, Item B.20, Item B.22, and Item B.23 of Form
N-CEN. We note that, with respect to those items in Part B that do not include sub-items for series
information, a registrant may still provide more than one response to the item (where applicable), but
the response will not be required to indicate the relevant series to which it relates.

798

Item B.1.a of Form N-CEN.

799

Item B.1.b of Form N-CEN.

800

Item B.1.c of Form N-CEN. Because UITs that register on Form N-8B-2 obtain CIKs for the UIT
itself as well as for series offered by the UIT, we have made a clarifying modification to Form NCEN by including a requirement in Part F of the form that such UITs also report the CIKs for each of
their existing series. See Item F.6.b of Form N-CEN.

proposal and the Form N-PORT section above, information such as the CIK and LEI will assist
the Commission and other data users with organizing the data and allow the data reported on
Form N-CEN to be cross-referenced with data received from other sources.805 For tracking
purposes, Form N-CEN also requires information relating to whether the filing is the initial or
final filing.806
We are adopting, as proposed, the requirement that funds include the location of their
books and records in reports on Form N-CEN. We note that books and records information is
currently required by fund registration forms;807 however, this information is not filed with the
Commission in a structured format. We believe that having books and records information in a
structured format will increase our efficiency in preparing for exams and, thus, we have
determined to include this information in Form N-CEN.808 In addition, so as not to create
unnecessary burdens, we are adopting proposed amendments to Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and

805

See supra section II.A.2.a (discussing additional information such as CIK and LEI and comment
letters received regarding the use of identifiers).

806

Item B.4 of Form N-CEN. As proposed, the instruction to Item B.4—then numbered as “Item 5”—
stated that a fund should indicate that a filing is its final filing on Form N-CEN only if the fund has
filed an application to deregister on Form N-8F “or otherwise.” We believe it would be useful to
filers for the instruction to provide more context as to what should be considered “or otherwise.”
Therefore, the final Form clarifies that a fund should indicate that a filing on Form N-CEN is its final
filing “only if the Registrant has filed an application to deregister or will file an application to
deregister before its next required filing on this form.” We note that even if a fund indicates a filing
is its final filing on Form N-CEN, a fund is required to file reports on Form N-CEN until it is
deregistered.

Item 31 of Form N-6.

808

Additionally, by including books and records information in Form N-CEN, we may receive more
frequently updated books and records information from closed-end funds. Closed-end funds do not
update their registration statements as regularly as open-end funds and, thus, the information
regarding their books and records may not always be current.

N-6 to exempt funds from those forms’ respective books and records disclosure requirements if
the information is provided in a fund’s most recent report on Form N-CEN.809
Similar to Form N-SAR,810 Form N-CEN requires information regarding whether the
fund is part of a “family of investment companies.”811 The form, which includes a substantially
similar definition as Form N-SAR,812 defines a “family of investment companies” to mean,
except with respect to insurance company separate accounts, any two or more registered
investment companies that (i) share the same investment adviser or principal underwriter; and
(ii) hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and
investor services.813 This item will assist Commission staff with analyzing multiple funds across
the same family of investment companies. One commenter suggested that a broader term such as
“fund complex” would be a beneficial alternative to the proposed term “family of investment
companies.”814 We believe, however, that “fund complex,” as such term is defined for purposes
of Form N-1A, for example, could be overly broad (e.g., could unintentionally incorporate
unaffiliated sub-advisers), and thus, we have determined to adopt the item as proposed.815

809

Funds that have not yet filed a report on Form N-CEN will have to continue to include this
information in their registration statement filings.

companies” in Form N-SAR, also clarifies that insurance company separate accounts that may not
hold themselves out to investors as related companies (products) for purposes of investment and
investor services should consider themselves part of the same family if the operational or accounting
or control systems under which these entities function are substantially similar. See General
Instruction H to Form N-SAR.

We are adopting, as proposed, a requirement in Form N-CEN that the fund provide its
classification (e.g., open-end fund, closed-end fund), similar to Form N-SAR.816 Unlike the
requirements of Form N-SAR, however, we are also adopting, as proposed, a requirement in
Form N-CEN that specifically asks whether the fund issues a class of securities registered under
the Securities Act.817 These questions are intended to elicit background information on the fund,
which will assist us in our monitoring and oversight functions (for example, identifying those
funds that have not issued securities registered under the Securities Act).
We are also adopting, as proposed, the requirement in Form N-CEN that a management
company report information about its directors, including each director’s name, whether they are
an “interested person” (as defined by section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act), and the
Investment Company Act file number of any other registered investment company for which
they serve as a director.818 Some commenters supported inclusion of such information819 and
one commenter suggested that the Commission request additional information concerning
individual directors (and chief compliance officers (“CCOs”)), such as length of service, roles

purposes of investment and investor services; or (2) have a common investment adviser or have an
investment adviser that is an affiliated person of the investment adviser of any of the other registered
investment companies).

Item B.6 of Form N-CEN; see also Item 5, Item 6, Item 27, Item 58, Item 59 and Item 117 of Form
N-SAR. If the registrant is an open-end fund, Form N-CEN also requires information on the total
number of series of the registrant and, if a series of the registrant with a fiscal year end covered by the
report was terminated during the reporting period, information regarding that series. See Item
B.6.a.i–Item B.6.a.ii of Form N-CEN. In addition, registrants that indicate they are management
companies registered on Form N-3 are directed by Item B.6 to respond to certain additional items in
Part F of the form that relate to insurance company separate accounts. See Item B.6.c.i of Form
N-CEN.

commenter opposed the inclusion of additional disclosure requirements concerning the board or
individual directors beyond those in the proposed form without a prior statement of regulatory
purpose and opportunity for public comment.821 We have determined to adopt these
requirements as proposed because we believe it appropriately balances the need for director
information in a structured format with efforts to minimize the partially duplicative reporting
requirements.822
However, in a modification from the proposal, we have determined to add one additional
reporting requirement concerning directors. In the Proposing Release, we solicited comment
regarding whether Form N-CEN should require any additional information concerning directors.
In response, a commenter stated that, as discussed below, the proposed form would require funds

820

Morningstar Comment Letter.

821

See IDC Comment Letter. It was unclear whether the commenter intended also to express concerns
about the proposed requirements concerning directors, in addition to the concerns it expressed about
other potential requirements concerning directors. Id. (“First, the Release asks about the information
regarding fund directors that is proposed to be included in Form N-CEN, which includes each
director’s name, whether they are an “interested person” and the Investment Company Act file
number of any other fund for which they serve as a director. Specifically, the Release asks whether
funds should be required to include on Form N-CEN any additional information concerning the board
or individual directors, such as information about the length of service of directors. The Release does
not discuss why the Commission might be interested in this or other possible director-related
information or how it would be used. Absent a clear statement of how information about directors
would assist the Commission in carrying out its regulatory functions, and the opportunity to comment
on any such information, we do not support adding it to Form N-CEN.”) To the extent that the
commenter was commenting on the proposed requirements, we note, as we did in the Proposing
Release, that although the information is reported in a management company’s Statement of
Additional Information and provided in annual reports to shareholders, providing this information to
the Commission in a structured format will allow the Commission and other potential data users to
sort and analyze the data more efficiently. See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33636.

822

This information (along with additional director information) is also disclosed in a management
company’s Statement of Additional Information and its annual report to shareholders, albeit in an
HTML or ASCII, rather than structured, format. See, e.g., Item 17 and Item 27(b)(5) of Form N-1A
(requiring, for example, disclosures regarding length of service, position(s) held with the fund, and
other directorships held by the director).

225

to report CRD numbers for CCOs, as applicable, and suggested that data users could more
readily analyze particular directors across funds and over time if a unique identifier were
reported for each director.823 We acknowledge that not all fund directors have associated CRD
numbers, but we are persuaded by the commenter that, for those that do, reporting of the CRD
number would improve data comparability and help us in our risk assessment and examination
functions by making it easier for Commission staff to identify persons and collect information
across funds.824
In addition, as proposed, a fund will be required to provide the CCO’s name, CRD
number (if any), address, and phone number,825 as well as indicate if the CCO has changed since
the last filing.826 If the fund’s CCO is compensated or employed by any person other than the
fund, or an affiliated person of the fund, for providing CCO services, the fund will also be
required to report the name and IRS Employer Identification Number of the person providing
such compensation.827 One commenter objected to this reporting requirement stating that the
information is already provided in other Commission filings.828 As we stated in the Proposing
Release, we recognize that some funds provide this information in their registration statements.

See Morningstar Comment Letter; infra notes 825–833 and accompanying text.

824

Item B.8.b of Form N-CEN.

825

Item B.9 of Form N-CEN. Because we expect that funds will provide the CCO’s direct phone
number in response to this information request, the CCO’s phone number will not be made publicly
available in Form N-CEN filings on EDGAR. See General Instruction D to Form N-CEN.

826

Item B.9.i of Form N-CEN.

827

Item B.9.j of Form N-CEN. We proposed to require funds provide the name and “Employee
Identification Number” of the person providing compensation for CCO services (Proposing Release,
supra footnote 7, at n. 409 and accompanying text). We are adopting a reference to “IRS Employer
Identification Number” to conform with Form ADV (see, e.g., Item 7 of Schedule A of Form ADV).

828

See Schnase Comment Letter.

226

However, as we also noted, not all funds do829 and we believe that this requirement will provide
staff with information on all fund CCOs and will allow the staff to contact a fund’s CCO
directly.
One commenter suggested that the Commission require additional information
concerning CCOs, such as “length of service and prior experience in order to aid in assessing the
caliber of a fund or a fund company’s regulatory practices.”830 We believe, however, that the
reporting requirement as proposed and adopted is sufficient for our regulatory oversight purposes
and appropriately balances the benefits of additional information for Form N-CEN data users
against the burdens imposed upon filers. Specifically, because Commission data users could link
Form N-CEN information about CCOs across filings, over time, using the required CRD
number, the reporting requirements that we are adopting today will still allow users to inform
themselves about a CCO’s length of service without adding another reporting requirement.831
Another commenter expressed support for the CCO reporting requirement but suggested that the
item should also require the fund to report the name of the investment adviser’s CCO as well.832
We are not adopting this suggestion because Form N-CEN is designed to collect census-type
information, including certain corporate governance information, about funds—not similar
information about investment advisers. Investment advisers are currently required to report the
829

See, e.g., Item 17 of Form N-1A (requesting information regarding fund officers). For example, Form
N-1A defines the term “officer” to mean “the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer,
controller, or any other officer who performs policy-making functions.” It is our understanding that
in some fund complexes, the CCO does not fit within the category of officers covered by this
definition (i.e., the CCO does not perform a policy-making function), and therefore, information as to
their CCO is not provided pursuant to the item.

830

The same commenter stated that the required CRD numbers should be sufficiently specific to analyze
the information over time. See id.

227

name and contact information of the adviser’s CCO on Form ADV, which facilitates the ability
of the Commission to link fund and investment adviser CCO data without imposing an additional
reporting burden on funds.833 Accordingly, we believe that the item requirement as proposed is
appropriate and are adopting it without any changes.
We are also adopting, substantially as proposed, the requirement in Part B that funds
report matters that have been submitted to a vote of security holders during the relevant
period.834 Information regarding submissions of matters to a vote of securities holders is
currently reported in Form N-SAR by management companies in the form of an attachment with
multiple reporting requirements.835 In order to alleviate the burden on filers, we are reducing the
information to be reported regarding votes of security holders to a yes/no question that is
primarily meant to allow staff to quickly identify funds with such votes, so that they can follow
up as appropriate, such as by reviewing more detailed information required by other filings.836
Form N-CEN, like Form N-SAR, will also include an item relating to material legal
proceedings during the reporting period.837 One commenter suggested that the Commission

833

See, e.g., Item 1.J of Part 1A of Form ADV.

834

See Item B.10 of Form N-CEN. We have added an instruction to the item to clarify that registrants
registered on Forms N-3, N-4 or N-6, should respond “yes” to the item only if security holder votes
were solicited on contract-level matters.

835

See Item 77.C of Form N-SAR; see also Instruction to Specific Items for Item 77C of N-SAR.

836

See, e.g., rule 30e-1(b) under the Investment Company Act (requiring management companies to
include in shareholder reports certain information relating to matters submitted to a vote of
shareholders through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise) [17 CFR 270.30e-1(b)]. The
information request in Form N-CEN applies to UITs as well as management companies. The Form
N-SAR requirement applies only to management companies (see Item 77.C of Form N-SAR; see also
Instruction to Specific Items for Item 77C of Form N-SAR). We believe it is important for the
Commission to have information for all registered investment companies on matters submitted for
security holder vote in order to assist us in our oversight and examination functions.

837

Item B.11 of Form N-CEN. As in Item 77.E of Form N-SAR, if there were any material legal
proceedings, or if a proceeding previously reported had been terminated, the registrant will file an
attachment as required by Part G of Form N-CEN. See Item G.1.a.i of Form N-CEN. We note that

228

define legal proceedings for purposes of Form N-CEN.838 The relevant item includes an
instruction highlighting certain proceedings that should be described in response to the item839
and the item itself only requests information on “material legal proceedings, other than routine
litigation incidental to the business.” We believe the instruction and language of the item
appropriately describes the legal proceedings funds should include when responding to this item.
Another commenter suggested that the Commission state that derivative suits reported in
response to this item are deemed to satisfy the requirements under section 33 of the Investment
Company Act for filing pleadings and other documents in connection with that type of lawsuit.840
Section 33 requires every fund which is a party and every affiliated person of such fund who is a
party defendant to any action or claim by a fund or a security holder thereof in a derivative
capacity or representative capacity against certain persons to file certain documents related to the
action or claim with the Commission.841 We do not believe that reporting pursuant to this
requirement, taken alone, would be an appropriate alternative for a fund to use to satisfy the legal
proceeding filing requirements under section 33, as Form N-CEN requires only a brief
description of the proceeding (as well as the case or docket number (if any) and names of the

Form N-CEN, unlike Form N-SAR, will require UITs to respond to the information request related to
material legal proceedings. For the same reasons discussed above with respect to matters submitted
for security holder vote, we believe it is important to have information on material legal proceedings
of all registered investment companies. See supra footnotes 834–836 and accompanying text.
838

See State Street Comment Letter.

839

See Instruction to Item B.11 of Form N-CEN, which states, “[f]or purposes of this Item, the following
proceedings should be described: (1) any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding with respect
to the Registrant or any of its significant subsidiaries; (2) any proceeding to which any director,
officer or other affiliated person of the Registrant is a party adverse to the Registrant or any of its
subsidiaries; and (3) any proceeding involving the revocation or suspension of the right of the
Registrant to sell securities.”

principal parties to the proceeding) and does not itself require the filing of all materials plainly
required by section 33.842 Moreover, for data users interested in the materials required to be filed
under section 33, the reporting required by Form N-CEN would not be the same as, nor in many
cases a suitable substitute for, the materials themselves. Accordingly, we are adopting the
reporting item as proposed.
Form N-SAR currently requires management companies to report a number of data points
relating to fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance policy coverage.843 As proposed, we
are limiting this request to two separate items in Form N-CEN in order to limit the number of
items to those most useful to the Commission staff and reduce burdens on filers.
One item requires funds to report if any claims were filed under the management
company’s fidelity bond and the aggregate dollar amount of any such claims.844 One commenter
requested that we eliminate the item requesting fidelity bond information, stating that the
information is already provided elsewhere by funds.845 The other item requires registrants to
report if the management company’s officers or directors are covered under any directors and
officers/errors and omissions insurance policy and, if so, whether any claims were filed under the
policy during the reporting period with respect to the registrant.846 The staff appreciates that
some of this information may be disclosed in other filings with the Commission, although it is

We note that the commenter did not explain how reporting pursuant to this requirement, taken alone,
would be consistent with the requirements of section 33.

not reported in a structured data format.847 We continue to believe that having responses to these
questions in a structured data format will help alert Commission staff to insurance claims made
by the fund or its officers and directors as a result of legal issues related to the fund.
Accordingly, we are adopting these reporting requirements as proposed.
In order to better understand instances when funds receive financial support from an
affiliated entity, we are adopting, substantially as proposed but with a modification that is
designed to address a commenter’s suggestion, a new requirement for information regarding the
provision of such financial support.848 We adopted disclosure requirements relating to fund
sponsors’ support of money market funds as part of our money market reform amendments in
2014, including a new requirement that money market funds file reports on Form N-CR,
reporting, among other things, the receipt of financial support.849 As with money market funds,
we believe that it is important that the Commission understand the nature and extent to which a
fund’s sponsor provides financial support to a fund. Therefore, we are extending this
requirement to all funds that will file reports on Form N-CEN. As we stated in the Proposing
Release, although we believe it is an infrequent practice, based on staff experience, non-money
market funds have received sponsor support in the past and we believe this item will allow
Commission staff to readily identify any funds that have received such support for further
analysis and review, as appropriate.

847

For example, a fund is required to provide and maintain a fidelity bond against larceny and
embezzlement, which in general covers each officer and employee of the fund who has access to
securities or funds. See rule 17g-1(a) under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.17g-1(a)].

848

Item B.14 of Form N-CEN.

849

See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra footnote 33.

231

One commenter suggested that, for purposes of Form N-CEN, the instruction concerning
the definition of “financial support” provide additional guidance concerning exclusions from the
definition. The proposed instruction regarding the definition of “financial support” provided for
certain of the exclusions suggested by the commenter, such as for routine waiver of fees or
reimbursement of fund expenses and routine inter-fund lending.850 We continue to think that the
proposed exclusions are appropriate, and we are adopting those exclusions today.851 However,
the commenter also suggested specifying that the purchase of a defaulted or devalued security
would constitute “financial support” only when it is intended to increase or stabilize the value or
liquidity of the fund’s portfolio.852 We agree with the commenter that purchases of a defaulted
or devalued security at fair value need only be characterized as “financial support” for purposes
of Form N-CEN if they are intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund’s
portfolio, and, accordingly, have modified the instruction in this manner.853 In addition, and as
proposed, if a fund other than a money market fund received financial support, it will also be
required to provide more detailed information in the form of an attachment as required by Part G
of Form N-CEN.854
We are also adopting, as proposed, an item in Form N-CEN requiring reporting as to
whether the fund relied on orders from the Commission granting the fund an exemption from one
or more provisions of the Investment Company Act, Securities Act or Securities Exchange Act

Item G.1.a.ii of Form N-CEN. Money market funds currently provide this information through
reports on Form N-CR. However, all funds, including money market funds, will be required to
respond “yes” or “no” to Item B.14 of Form N-CEN.

232

during the reporting period.855 Funds are required to identify any such order by release
number.856 Collecting this information in a structured format will assist us with our oversight
functions and improve our ability to monitor fund reliance on exemptive orders.
One commenter expressed support for this new reporting requirement, including the
reporting of release numbers applicable to such exemptive orders.857 The commenter suggested,
however, that in addition to release numbers, the form include the classification or category of
the exemptive order in relation to the Commission’s Investment Company Act Notices and
Orders Category Listing webpage858 and similar reporting requirements for a fund’s reliance on
staff no-action letters.859 We have determined to adopt the reporting item as proposed. We
believe that reporting requirements regarding reliance on no-action letters may impose additional
administrative costs on filers. Therefore, we believe that the requested information as proposed
balances the Commission’s need for information to monitor a fund’s regulatory compliance with
the costs imposed on registrants reporting this information.
As proposed, Form N-CEN, similar to Form N-SAR,860 will require identifying
information for the fund’s principal underwriters861 and independent public accountants,862

855

Item B.15 of Form N-CEN. If any actions were taken during the reporting period, which were
required to be reported on Form N-1Q pursuant to an exemptive order, Form N-SAR requires that
information be reported in response to Sub-Item 77P of Form N-SAR. See Instructions to Sub-Items
77P and 102O of Form N-SAR. Form N-CEN requires the fund to file as an attachment any
information required to be filed pursuant to exemptive orders issued by the Commission and relied on
by the fund. Instruction 5 to Item G.1 of Form N-CEN.

including, as applicable, name, SEC file number, CRD number, PCAOB number, LEI (if any),
state or foreign country, and whether a principal underwriter was hired or terminated or if the
independent public accountant changed since the last filing.863 We are adopting these
requirements as proposed.
If the independent public accountant changed since the last filing, under the proposal, the
fund would also have been required to provide a detailed narrative attachment to Form N-CEN
similar to the exhibit in Form N-SAR reporting a change in independent registered public
accountants, along with the predecessor accountant’s letter reporting the change in independent
registered public accountants also required to be reported on Form N-SAR.864
Some commenters expressed concern that because Form N-CEN would be an annual
reporting form, rather than a semi-annual reporting form like Form N-SAR, the exhibit may be
filed a significant amount of time after an accountant had changed.865 Commenters instead
suggested that the proposed attachment be filed by funds with their semi-annual Form N-CSR
filings.866 We are persuaded by these concerns, and are modifying the requirement by moving
the change in independent public accountant attachment from Form N-CEN to Form N-CSR as a

Item 24, Instruction 5, of Form N-2 both require that the management statement required under Item
4.01 of Form 8-K be presented in both semi-annual and annual shareholder reports. Thus, for any
change in accountants occurring in the first six months of a registrant’s fiscal year, management’s
statement regarding a change in accountants would be required to be issued and filed publicly in the
fund’s semi-annual shareholder report while the predecessor accountant’s letter reported semiannually on former Form N-SAR would, under the proposal, have been filed in Form N-CEN six
months later).

See AICPA Comment Letter; and PwC Comment Letter.

234

new attachment to reports on that form.867 We share commenters’ concerns that, as proposed, a
significant amount of time may lapse before shareholders would be provided the letter reporting
a change in independent registered public accountants. We also believe that moving the
attachment from Form N-CEN to Form N-CSR will help ensure concurrent review and written
agreement by the predecessor accountant of the required management statement in both annual
and semi-annual reports, as reports on Form N-CSR are required to be filed no later than 10 days
after reports to shareholders are transmitted. Thus, Form N-CEN provides a means to track
funds that change accountants in a structured data format on an annual basis, while the
accountant’s letter regarding the change will become available to the public semi-annually as an
exhibit on Form N-CSR.
We also proposed to include for all funds several other accounting and valuation related
items that are currently required for management companies by Form N-SAR, and that provide
important information to the Commission regarding possible accounting and valuation issues
related to a fund. Commenters generally did not object to these proposed reporting
requirements,868 and we are adopting them largely as proposed, with some revisions in response
to specific commenter suggestions. These items include a question relating to material changes
in the method of valuation of the fund’s assets.869 If there have been material changes in the

Item B.20 of Form N-CEN.
As discussed in the Proposing Release, valuation methodologies are approved by fund directors for
use by funds to determine, in good faith, the fair value of portfolio securities (and other assets) for
which market quotations are not readily available. For example, valuation methodology changes may
include, but are not limited to, changing from use of bid price to mid-price for fixed income securities
or changes in the trigger threshold for use of fair value factors on international equity securities.

235

method of valuation of assets during the reporting period, Item B.20 requires that the fund report
the types of investments involved.
One commenter expressed support for this reporting requirement, noting that the
information would be sufficient to conduct due diligence on pricing and valuation issues.870 This
commenter also suggested aligning the type of investments involved with the list of asset types
identified in Form N-PORT.871 After considering the commenter’s request, we have added an
additional sub-item and clarifying instructions to Item B.20 to require the applicable “asset type”
category specified in Item C of Form N-PORT.872 We believe that requiring responses based on
the categories used in Form N-PORT will provide some measure of standardization that will
generally assist the staff in its monitoring of changes in valuation methodologies by asset class,
and will provide regulatory consistency that will assist Commission staff in its review of
information reported pursuant to both forms.
In addition, and as proposed, funds will also be required to provide a brief description of
the types of investments involved.873 However, we have modified the instruction to this subItem from the proposal to provide that if the change in methodology relates to a sub-asset type
included in the response to Item B.20.c, then funds should report the sub-asset class in

Unlike Form N-SAR, this requirement will apply to UITs as well as management investment
companies. As we noted in the Proposing Release, we believe it is important for the Commission to
have information on accounting and valuation for all registered investment companies in order to
assist us in our oversight and examination functions.

responding to Item B.20.d.874 This modification is intended to avoid duplicative responses to
Item B.20.c and Item B.20.d by eliciting more specific information as to any sub-asset classes
contained in the broader Form N-PORT asset categories that are impacted by the change of
valuation methodologies. Unlike reports on Form N-SAR, Form N-CEN does not require a
separate attachment detailing the circumstances surrounding a change in valuation methods.875
Instead, to facilitate review of this information in a structured format, Form N-CEN includes
specific items in the form itself, including the date of change, explanation of change, type of
investment, statutory or regulatory basis for the change, and the fund(s) involved.876 Also as
proposed, Form N-CEN carries forward the requirement from Form N-SAR877 that the fund
identify whether there have been any changes in accounting principles or practices, and, if any,
to provide more detailed information in a narrative attachment to the form.878
We are also adopting, largely as proposed, a requirement in Form N-CEN that
management companies other than SBICs, file a copy of their independent public accountant’s

874

See Instruction to Item B.20 of Form N-CEN. Thus, if a fund changed its valuation methodologies
with respect to municipal securities, the fund would report “debt’ in response to Item B.20.c and
“municipal securities” in response to Item B.20.d.

875

See Item 77.J and Item 102.I of Form N-SAR.

876

Compare Item 77.J of Form N-SAR with Item B.20 of Form N-CEN. An instruction to Item B.20 of
Form N-CEN clarifies that we do not expect responses to this item to include changes to valuation
techniques used for individual securities (e.g., changing from market approach to income approach
for a private equity security). Form N-SAR does not contain a similar instruction, but we are
including it in Form N-CEN to provide clarity for filers and because we believe that responding to
Item B.20 of Form N-CEN for individual securities may be overly burdensome.

877

See Item 77.L and Item 102.K of Form N-SAR.

878

Item B.21 and Item G.1.a.iv of Form N-CEN. Like the information requested regarding changes in
valuation methods, Form N-SAR only requests information from management companies regarding
changes in accounting principles and practices. Unlike Form N-SAR, Form N-CEN requires this
information from UITs as well, for the same reasons as discussed above with respect to changes in
valuation methods. See supra footnote 869.

237

report on internal control as an attachment to their reports on the form.879 To flag instances
where a report noted any material weaknesses, Form N-CEN also includes, as proposed, a
question that asks whether the report on internal control noted any material weaknesses.880 In
addition, as was proposed, Form N-CEN contains a new requirement that the fund report if the
certifying accountant issued an opinion other than an unqualified opinion with respect to its audit
of the fund’s financial statements.881 These questions will elicit information on potential
accounting issues identified by a fund’s accountant.
We are also adopting, largely as proposed, a requirement in Form N-CEN, not contained
in Form N-SAR, to indicate whether, during the reporting period, an open-end fund made any
payments to shareholders or reprocessed shareholder accounts as a result of an NAV error.882
One commenter expressed support for additional information related to NAV errors.883 Another
commenter recommended that this item be omitted from Form N-CEN, arguing that the item is
not an appropriate reporting item for a census form, would likely engender inquiries and claims
from potential litigants, and could be obtained through the Commission’s examination

879

Item G.1.a.iii of Form N-CEN. Management companies other than SBICs are currently required to
file a copy of the independent public accountant’s report on internal control with their reports on
Form N-SAR. See Item 77.B of Form N-SAR. We continue to believe that a copy of the
management company’s report on internal control should be filed with the Commission and thus are
carrying over the filing requirement to Form N-CEN.

880

Item B.18 of Form N-CEN. One commenter suggested that the word “find” in the text of proposed
Item 19 be changed to “note,” stating that the term “find” could be misinterpreted, creating an
“expectation gap” over the nature of the consideration of internal control in an audit of financial
statements, particularly for investment companies, which (except for BDCs) are not subject to the
integrated audit requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. See PwC Comment Letter. We are
persuaded by the commenter’s concern and have revised the language of the item from “find” to
“note” as recommended.

program.884 We continue to believe, however, that the item will assist the staff’s monitoring
efforts and the yes/no reporting structure of the item will be a useful means to flag the
occurrence of NAV corrections whereby Commission staff can request further information in
connection with staff examinations and other inquiries.885
In addition, one commenter requested that we revise the item to ensure that any errors
that “exceeded the registrant’s threshold for reprocessing” were captured, even if the
reprocessing was paid for by a service provider.886 After consideration of the comment, we
agree that this question should capture all incidents of reprocessed shareholder accounts
regardless of the source of payment and have revised the item to clarify that a registrant should
respond affirmatively if any payments were made to shareholders (i.e., regardless of the source
of the payment) or if any shareholder accounts were reprocessed as a result of an error in
calculating the registrant’s NAV.887
As proposed, Form N-CEN also requires information from management companies
regarding payments of dividends or distributions that required a written statement pursuant to
section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act and rule 19a-1 thereunder.888 These questions will

884

See SIFMA Comment Letter I.

885

Regarding the commenter’s concerns regarding potential increased litigation risk or inquiries based
on public disclosure, based on our experience, we understand that these types of payments and
reprocessing transactions are typically already disclosed to investors through account statements.

886

See BlackRock Comment Letter.

887

Item B.22.a of Form N-CEN.

888

Item B.23 of Form N-CEN. Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act generally prohibits a fund
from making a distribution from any source other than the fund’s net income, unless that payment is
accompanied by a written statement that adequately discloses the source or sources of the payment.
See 15 U.S.C. 80a-19(a). Rule 19a-1 under the Investment Company Act specifies the information
required to be disclosed in the written statement. [17 CFR 270.19a-1]; see also Shareholder Notices
of the Sources of Fund Distributions – Electronic Delivery, IM Guidance Update No. 2013-11 (Nov.
2013), available at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/guidance/im-guidance-2013-11.pdf.

assist the staff in monitoring valuation of fund assets and the calculation of the fund’s NAV, as
well as compliance with distribution requirements under section 19(a) and rule 19a-1. One
commenter stated that there is not currently a consistent method used across funds to determine
whether a rule 19a-1 notice is required, and that this inconsistency could limit comparability of
the reported data.889 The commenter suggested that the Commission could increase
comparability of the reported data by clarifying the method that should be used to determine
whether a 19a-1 notice is required.890 Although we recognize, as the commenter suggests, that
different substantive practices relating to 19a-1 notices could affect the comparability of the
reported data, revising the substantive provisions of rule 19a-1 is beyond the intended scope of
the requirements of Form N-CEN.
c.

Part C — Items Relating to Management Investment Companies

i.

Background and Classification of Funds

We proposed a number of reporting items under Part C of Form N-CEN to provide the
Commission and its staff with background information on the fund industry and to assist us in
meeting our legal and regulatory requirements, such as requirements under the Paperwork
Reduction Act. Additionally, certain demographic information in Part C will allow the
Commission to better identify particular types of management companies for monitoring and
analysis if, for example, an issue arose with respect to a particular fund type. We are adopting
those reporting items substantially as proposed with some modifications in response to
comments. Where we have received comments on specific reporting requirements, we discuss
them in more detail below.

889

See State Street Comment Letter.

890

Id.

240

Part C will be completed by management investment companies other than SBICs. As in
the proposal, for management companies offering multiple series, the required information will
be reported separately as to each series.891
Similar to Form N-SAR and as proposed, Form N-CEN includes general identifying
information on management companies and any series thereof, including the full name of the
fund, the fund’s series identification number and LEI, and whether it is the fund’s first time filing
the form.892 Unlike Form N-SAR, specific information on the classes of open-end management
companies, including information relating to the number of classes authorized, added, and
terminated during the relevant period are required under Form N-CEN.893 In addition, Form
N-CEN includes a requirement (unlike Form N-SAR) to specifically provide identifying
information for each share class outstanding, including the name of the class, the class
identification number, and ticker symbol.894
Form N-CEN also requires—substantially as proposed with some modifications in
response to public comment—management companies to identify if they are any of the following
types of funds:895 ETF or exchange-traded managed fund (“ETMF”);896 index fund;897 fund

891

General Instruction A to Form N-CEN.

892

Item C.1 of Form N-CEN; see also supra section II.A.2.a (discussing the use of LEIs for purposes of
Form N-PORT and related comments received regarding the use of LEIs). The requirements relating
to the name of the fund and if this is the first filing with respect to the fund are currently required by
Form N-SAR. See Item 3 and Item 7.C of Form N-SAR.

893

Item C.2.a–Item C.2.c of Form N-CEN.

894

Item C.2.d of Form N-CEN.

895

Item C.3 of Form N-CEN. As discussed herein, many of the types of funds listed in Item C.3 are
defined in Form N-CEN. With the exception of “index fund” and “money market fund,” these terms
are not currently defined in Form N-SAR. See General Instruction H and Item 69 of Form N-SAR.

896

Item C.3.a of Form N-CEN. As discussed above, we have revised, consistent with the changes to
Form N-PORT discussed above, the definitions of “Exchange-Traded Fund” and “Exchange-Traded
Managed Funds” to clarify that the definitions would apply to a class or series of a UIT organized as

241

seeking to achieve performance results that are a multiple of an index or other benchmark, the
inverse of an index or other benchmark, or a multiple of the inverse of an index or other
benchmark;898 interval fund;899 fund of funds;900 master-feeder fund;901 money market fund;902
target date fund;903 and underlying fund to a variable annuity or variable life insurance contract.

an ETF or ETMF. See supra footnote 793 and accompanying text. Consequently, for purposes of
reporting on Form N-CEN, “exchange-traded fund” is defined as an open-end management
investment company (or series or class thereof) or UIT (or series thereof), the shares of which are
listed and traded on a national securities exchange at market prices, and that has formed and operates
under an exemptive order under the Investment Company Act granted by the Commission or in
reliance on an exemptive rule under the Act adopted by the Commission. Similarly, “exchangetraded managed fund” is defined as an open-end management investment company (or series or class
thereof) or UIT (or series thereof), the shares of which are listed and traded on a national securities
exchange at NAV-based prices, and that has formed and operates under an exemptive order under the
Investment Company Act granted by the Commission or in reliance on an exemptive rule under the
Act adopted by the Commission. See General Instruction E of Form N-CEN. These definitions are
substantially identical to the definitions we proposed, however, we have added a parenthetical to each
definition to clarify that an ETF or exchange-traded managed fund would include a series of a UIT
that meets the rest of the applicable definition. We believe that these are appropriate definitions as
they are similar to the one used for determining the applicability of ETF registration statement
disclosure requirements for open-end funds. See General Instruction A of Form N-1A. Currently, all
ETFs and exchange-traded managed funds rely on relief from certain provisions of the Investment
Company Act that is granted by Commission order. See ETF Proposing Release, supra footnote 5;
Eaton Vance Management, et al., Investment Company Act Release No. 31333 (Nov. 6, 2014) [79 FR
67471 (Nov. 13, 2014)] (Notice); Eaton Vance Management, et al., Investment Company Act Release
No. 31361 (Dec. 2, 2014) (Order). The Commission, however, proposed in 2008 to codify the
exemptive relief previously granted to ETFs by order. See ETF Proposing Release, supra footnote 5
(proposing rule 6c-11).
897

Item C.3.b of Form N-CEN.

898

Item C.3.c of Form N-CEN. This item is being modified from the proposed requirement, which
would have required a fund to indicate if it seeks to achieve performance results that are a multiple of
a benchmark, the inverse of a benchmark, or a multiple of the inverse of a benchmark. The
modifications clarify that the benchmark may be an index.

901

Item C.3.f of Form N-CEN.

902

Item C.3.g of Form N-CEN.

903

Item C.3.h of Form N-CEN. As in the proposal, for purposes of reporting on Form N-CEN, “target
date fund” is defined as an investment company that has an investment objective or strategy of
providing varying degrees of long-term appreciation and capital preservation through a mix of equity
and fixed income exposures that changes over time based on an investor’s age, target retirement date,

242

For purposes of reporting on Form N-CEN, as proposed, “index fund” is defined as an
investment company, including an ETF, which seeks to track the performance of a specified
index.904 The definition is largely similar to the definition of “index fund” in rule 2a19-3 under
the Investment Company Act, but will capture both broad-based and affiliated indexes.905
Additionally, we note that the definition is substantially similar to the definition of “index fund”
in Form N-SAR, but also takes into account the emergence of ETFs.906 One commenter
expressed support for the proposed definition of index fund, but strongly encouraged that funds
using indexes constructed by affiliated service providers be disclosed clearly and that funds
disclose whether the index tracked by the fund is exclusively constructed for the fund.907 We
agree with the commenter and are requiring index funds to indicate whether the index whose
performance the fund tracks is constructed by an affiliated person of the fund and whether the
index is exclusively constructed for the fund.908 We believe this information will further assist
Commission staff in monitoring trends in funds that track these indexes, which often use more
complex methodologies that choose constituents by weighing factors other than market
capitalization. It also will assist staff in monitoring conflicts of interest that could exist when an
or life expectancy. See Instruction 5 to Item C.3.b of Form N-CEN. This is the same definition as
was proposed by the Commission in our 2010 proposing release relating to target date funds. See
Investment Company Advertising Release, supra footnote 6. We note that one commenter suggested
that target-date funds should also self-identify whether their glide path is “to” or “through”
retirement. See Morningstar Comment Letter. We have not made any changes in response to this
comment because we believe that the identifying information requested by the form with respect to
target-date funds is sufficient for the Commission’s purposes.
904

See Instruction 2 to Item C.3 of Form N-CEN.

905

See rule 2a19-3 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.2a19-3] (referring to an index fund

one or more broad-based securities indices…”).

As proposed, “interval fund” is defined as a closed-end management company that makes
periodic repurchases of its shares pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act.909
One commenter suggested that the definition of interval fund should not be limited to closed-end
funds, but rather, expanded to other investment companies.910 We believe, however, that the
definition is appropriate as proposed because the term “interval fund” is commonly used to refer
to funds that rely on rule 23c-3.911
For purposes of reporting on Form N-CEN, we also proposed to define “fund of funds” as
a fund that acquires securities issued by another investment company in excess of the amounts
permitted under section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act.912 Some commenters
suggested that we revise the definition to exclude funds that invest in money market funds for
cash management purposes in excess of the amount permitted under section 12(d)(1)(A) in
reliance on rule 12d1-1 of the Investment Company Act.913 After consideration of these
comments, we acknowledge that the definition as proposed would have included a larger
universe of funds than we intended for our regulatory purposes. The proposed definition would

Morningstar Comment Letter (noting that there is one investment company registered on Form N-1A
whose redemption parameters are largely similar to an interval fund pursuant to exemptive relief and
suggesting that the definition of interval fund be expanded to other investment companies in light of
the existence of this fund).

911

See rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.23c-3]. We believe that it is more
appropriate to maintain the definition of interval fund as a closed-end fund that makes periodic
purchases of its shares pursuant to rule 23c-3 as proposed, rather than expand the definition to capture
funds that share some similar characteristics with interval funds but operate outside the context of rule
23c-3. For example, we believe that reports on Form N-CEN will appropriately capture an open-end
fund that operates with redemption procedures similar to an interval fund pursuant to exemptive relief
in response to Item B.15 of Form N-CEN.

have yielded data that would have impeded identification of those funds that acquire securities
issued by another investment company in excess of the amounts permitted under section
12(d)(1)(A) other than those that do so only for short-term cash management purposes.
Therefore, we have revised the instructions to Item C.3 to note that for purposes of the item, the
term “fund of funds” does not include a fund that acquires securities issued by another
investment company solely in reliance on rule 12d1-1.914 We received no other comments on the
other definitions for fund types.
As proposed, “master-feeder fund” was defined as a two-tiered arrangement in which one
or more funds holds shares of a single fund in accordance with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the
Investment Company Act.915 We understand that certain interpretations of this definition could
exclude some funds that operate in a master-feeder structure and hold themselves out as masterfeeder funds, but for technical reasons must obtain exemptive relief from the Commission rather
than rely on section 12(d)(1)(E) to operate in this manner. Accordingly, we have revised the
definition of “master-feeder fund” to more clearly include two-tiered arrangements in which one
or more funds holds shares of a single fund pursuant to exemptive relief granted by the
Commission.916
ETFs and ETMFs, index funds, and master-feeder funds are also required to provide
additional information under Part C.917 First, as in the proposal, Form N-CEN requires a

914

See Instruction 1 to Item C.3 of Form N-CEN.

915

See Instruction 4 to Item 27 of proposed Form N-CEN.

916

See Instruction 4 to Item C.3. of Form N-CEN which defines the term “master-feeder fund” to mean
“a two-tiered arrangement in which one or more funds (each a feeder fund) holds shares of a single
Fund (the master fund) in accordance with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-12(d)(1)(E))
or pursuant to exemptive relief granted by the Commission” (emphasis added).

management company to further indicate if it is an ETF or an ETMF.918 Second, as in the
proposal, index funds will be required to report certain standard industry calculations of relative
performance. In particular, index funds will be required to report a measure of the difference
between the index fund’s total return during the reporting period919 and the index’s return both
before and after fees and expenses—commonly called the “tracking difference” 920 —and also a
measure of the volatility of the day-to-day tracking difference over the course of the reporting
period—commonly called the fund’s “tracking error.”921 One commenter suggested that tracking
difference and tracking error should be reported monthly on Form N-PORT rather than annually
on Form N-CEN, because monthly reporting would allow the Commission to receive
observations for all index funds for the same time period, and the commenter opined that the
additional information would help the Commission be more responsive, particularly in times of
market stress.922 Although we recognize that there may be additional potential benefits of
monthly reporting, as the commenter suggests, we continue to believe that annual reporting more

918

See Item C.3.a.i and Item C.3.a.ii of Form N-CEN.

919

With respect to index funds that are ETFs, we expect a fund to use its NAV-based total return, rather
than market-based total return, in responding to Item C.3.a.i and Item C.3.a.ii of Form N-CEN.

920

Item C.3.b.i of Form N-CEN. The tracking difference is the return difference between the fund and
the index it is following, annualized. Morningstar ETF Research, Ben Johnson, et al., On the Right
Track: Measuring Tracking Efficiency in ETFs (Feb. 2013) (“Morningstar Paper”) at 29, available at
http://media.morningstar.com/uk/MEDIA/Research_Paper/
Morningstar_Report_Measuring_Tracking_Efficiency_in_ETFs_February_2013.pdf. Thus, tracking
difference = (1 + RNAV – RINDEX)1/N – 1, where RNAV is the total return for the fund over the reporting
period, RINDEX is the total return for the index for the reporting period, and N is the length of the
reporting period in years. N will equal to 1 if the reporting period is the fiscal year. Id.

921

See Item C.3.b.ii of Form N-CEN. Tracking error is commonly understood as the standard deviation
of the daily difference in return between the fund and the index it is following,
annualized. Morningstar Paper, supra footnote 920, at 29. Thus, tracking error = std (RNAV – RINDEX)
x √n, where RNAV is the daily return for the fund, RINDEX is the daily return for the index, std(∙)
represents the standard deviation function, and n is the number of trading days in the fiscal year. Id.

922

See Morningstar Comment Letter (recommending that tracking difference and tracking error be
reported on N-PORT with trailing one-year data rather than annually on Form N-CEN).

246

appropriately balances the usefulness of the reported information to the Commission and other
data users with the additional administrative costs that would be associated with a requirement
for monthly reporting and the associated recordkeeping necessary to support it. Moreover, we
believe that the frequency and timeliness of reports on Form N-CEN are, both generally and
specifically with respect to these reporting requirements, sufficient for collecting census-type
information, but that reporting of these particular annualized figures on Form N-PORT would
not be so timely or so frequent as to advance the purposes the commenter suggested (viz., to
respond in periods of market stress), particularly in light of the Form N-PORT 60-day reporting
delay.
While supporting the inclusion of tracking difference and tracking error reporting items, a
couple of commenters suggested alternatives to the calculation methods underlying the reporting
requirements, including, for example, measuring tracking error on a weekly or monthly basis
rather than a daily basis as proposed.923 With respect to tracking error, we believe that it is
important to calculate tracking error using the same observation frequency across funds and that,
based on staff experience, a daily frequency for tracking data is likely more commonly
calculated and therefore more readily available to funds than the alternatives proposed. We also
believe that daily calculations better reflect the nature of the daily redeemability of an open-end
fund, including capturing the daily trading activities on the secondary market for ETFs. One
commenter argued that daily tracking error calculations may contain temporary anomalies
outside portfolio management control, such as differences in holidays or pricing sources used by
923

See Invesco Comment Letter (recommending that tracking error be based on a monthly basis rather
than a daily basis and that tracking difference be calculated pursuant to an excess return calculation);
Confluence Comment Letter (recommending that tracking error be based on a weekly basis rather
than a daily basis, arguing that daily periodicity will show excess volatility, providing the
Commission and investors with a skewed picture of tracking error).

247

the fund and/or index providers or temporary market aberrations which may cause a higher daily
tracking error.924 We do not believe such differences would be uninformative. Rather, we
believe receiving information on these potential anomalies will better inform investors and
Commission staff about the behaviors of index funds and the indexes they track and assist the
Commission in our oversight responsibilities. Overall, we do not perceive significant additional
benefits in the alternative calculation methods recommended by commenters and continue to
believe that the calculation methodologies for tracking difference and tracking error, as proposed,
are appropriate.
Specifically, tracking difference will be calculated as the annualized difference between
the index fund’s total return during the reporting period and the index’s return during the
reporting period, and tracking error will be calculated as the annualized standard deviation of the
daily difference between the index fund’s total return and the index’s return during the reporting
period.925 Reporting of these measures will help data users, including the Commission,
investors, and other potential users, evaluate the degree to which particular index funds replicate
the performance of the target index.926 In addition, tracking difference and tracking error before
fees and expenses927 will allow data users to better understand the effect of factors other than
fees and expenses on the degree to which the index fund replicates the performance of the target
index.928

understand which funds are best tracking their target indexes and could highlight outlier funds.

Finally, as proposed, master funds will be required to provide identifying information
with respect to each feeder fund, including information on unregistered feeder funds (i.e., feeder
funds not registered as investment companies with the Commission), such as offshore feeder
funds.929 Similarly, a feeder fund will be required to provide identifying information of its
master fund.930
We are also adopting, as proposed, the requirement in Form N-CEN that a management
company report if it seeks to operate as a non-diversified company, as defined in section 5(b)(2)
of the Investment Company Act.931 Form N-SAR, in contrast, asks if the management company
was a diversified investment company at any time during the period or at the end of the reporting
period.932 The item in Form N-CEN is forward looking rather than backward looking as in Form
N-SAR and is intended to include as part of the universe of non-diversified funds those funds
that seek to operate as non-diversified companies even if they should happen to meet the
definition of a “diversified company” as of the end of a particular reporting period.933 We
believe this item will allow our staff to more accurately ascertain the universe of non-diversified
funds and, thus, better assist us in our analysis and inspection functions. One commenter
suggested that this reporting requirement also consider the identification of funds that intended to
operate as non-diversified at some point during the reporting period but have since changed to

929

Item C.3.f.ii of Form N-CEN.

930

Item C.3.f.i of Form N-CEN.

931

Item C.4 of Form N-CEN.

932

See Item 60 of Form N-SAR.

933

For example, if a fund generally operates as a non-diversified fund, but as a result of market
conditions or other reasons, happens to meet the definition of “diversified fund” as of the end of the
reporting period, it will still be required to indicate that it was a non-diversified fund for purposes of
this item.

249

diversified status.934 We believe that the reporting requirement as proposed is appropriate for
our purpose of being able to efficiently identify non-diversified companies.
ii.

Investments in Certain Foreign Corporations

Form N-CEN requires, as proposed, that a management company identify if it invests in a
CFC for the purpose of investing in certain types of instruments, such as commodities.935 If it
does, it must include the name and LEI of such corporation, if any.936 As discussed above in
section II.A.2.b, some funds use CFCs for making certain investments, particularly in
commodities and commodity-linked derivatives, often for tax purposes. Information regarding
assets invested in a CFC for the purpose of investing in certain types of instruments will provide
investors greater insight into CFCs that may have certain legal, tax, and country-specific risks
associated with them. Combined with the information that we are collecting in Form N-PORT,
Commission staff will use this information to better understand the use of CFCs, which could
allow for more efficient collaboration with foreign financial regulatory authorities to the extent
the Commission may need books and records or other information for specific funds or general
inquiries related to CFCs.

Securities Lending

As discussed above, we are adopting requirements that funds provide certain securities
lending information in reports on Form N-PORT to help inform the Commission, investors and
other market participants about the scale of securities lending activity by funds and their related

934

See Schnase Comment Letter.

935

Item C.5.a of Form N-CEN. As in the proposal, an instruction to the item defines “controlled foreign
corporation” as having the meaning provided in section 957 of the Internal Revenue Code.

cash collateral reinvestments.937 Additionally, we are adopting requirements that funds include
in their statements of additional information938 certain information concerning their income and
expenses associated with securities lending activities in order to increase the transparency of this
information to investors and other potential users.939
We proposed, and continue to believe it is appropriate, that some important information
concerning securities lending activity by funds should be reported in a structured format, but on a
less frequent basis than reports on Form N-PORT. In this regard, we believe that the proposed
annual reporting requirement on Form N-CEN yields sufficiently timely data and more
appropriately balances the requirements’ benefits with their associated costs than would
additional monthly reporting requirements on Form N-PORT. Some commenters expressed
general support for reporting securities lending information on Form N-CEN.940 One commenter
suggested that the Commission require even more detailed reporting requirements concerning
services provided by securities lending agents, including, for example, information about how
securities are selected for loan, contending that the public availability of the information may

938

“Statement of additional information” means the statement of additional information required by Part
B of the registration form applicable to the fund.

939

See discussion infra section II.F regarding securities lending disclosures in the Statement of
Additional Information and Form N-CSR; see also supra footnote 192.

940

See, e.g., BlackRock Comment Letter; Blackrock Directors Comment Letter; CFA Comment Letter;
EY Comment Letter (suggesting, however, that securities lending disclosures proposed in Regulation
S-X would be more appropriate in Form N-CEN than on Form N-PORT); Fidelity Comment Letter
(recommending, however, that information concerning third-party lending agent arrangements should
be non-public); Morningstar Comment Letter; RMA Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I;
State Street Comment Letter.

251

assist a fund board in understanding fees and services and drawing conclusions concerning their
comparability.941
We acknowledge that the commenter’s recommended additions could yield information
that may be useful to the Commission as well as to some data users, and recognize that a fund
board’s consideration of securities lending services may rightfully include consideration of how
securities are selected for loan and the other matters raised by the commenter. However, the
information required by Form N-CEN is intended primarily for Commission regulatory purposes,
and—balancing those purposes against the reporting costs associated with additional
requirements—we have determined that the requirements we are adopting today are appropriate.
The adopted requirements are meant to yield census-type information that is, to the extent
practicable, comparable across reporting funds and that permits the Commission and other
potential users to follow up, as appropriate, on patterns and idiosyncrasies in the reported data.
We believe, therefore, that the nuanced information the commenter suggests requiring is better
provided in a fund’s registration statement than in reports on Form N-CEN, to the extent
required.
We are therefore adopting, as proposed, a requirement that each management company
report annually on new Form N-CEN whether it is authorized to engage in securities lending
transactions and whether it loaned securities during the reporting period.942 In addition, we are
adopting, as proposed, reporting requirements regarding information about the fees associated

941

See Blackrock Directors Comment Letter (recommending that the Commission specifically require
disclosures on whether qualified dividend income management is provided by lending agents, the
client fund, or other third parties; whether securities for loan are selected by the lending agent, the
client fund, or other third parties; and whether the lender’s securities lending program includes
“specials” only (and, if so, how “specials” are defined) or general collateral as well).

942

Item C.6.a–Item C.6.b of Form N-CEN.

with securities lending activity and information about the management company’s relationship
with certain securities-lending-related service providers.
As in the proposal, management companies that loaned any securities during the
reporting period will be required to report certain information, with some modifications in
response to comments. Specifically, those management companies will be required to report
annually whether any borrower of securities failed to return the loaned securities by the
contractual deadline with the result that the fund (or its securities lending agent) liquidated
collateral pledged to secure the loaned securities or that the fund was otherwise adversely
impacted during the reporting period.943
However, this reporting requirement has been modified from the proposal, which would
have required funds to report whether a borrower defaulted on its obligations to return loaned
securities or return them on time in connection with a security on loan during that period. Some
commenters requested that the Commission narrow the definition of borrower default to exclude
“technical” defaults, citing concerns that the item, as proposed, could be read to require that
funds report any default, including defaults that are not likely to result in potential harm to the
fund and would not appropriately represent counterparty risk.944 These types of defaults may
occur when loaned securities are returned to a fund after the contractual deadline due to
operational issues related to processing or communication, which, according to commenters, is
not uncommon.945 Commenters recommended various alternatives to defining borrower default,

943

Item C.6.b.i of Form N-CEN.

944

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I; Vanguard Comment Letter.

945

See ICI Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I; Vanguard Comment Letter (recommending that
the definition of borrower default be limited to any default that causes a fund to liquidate securities
lending collateral pledged in connection with the securities lending arrangement); RMA Comment
Letter and State Street Comment Letter (recommending that borrower default be limited to any

253

including, for example, as any default that causes a fund to liquidate securities lending collateral
pledged in connection with the securities lending arrangement946 or any default that results in
losses to the fund.947 Others noted that a fund can be further protected from borrower default if it
is indemnified by the securities lending agent against loss resulting from a shortfall in pledged
collateral when a borrower has defaulted.948
We are persuaded by commenters and have modified the reporting requirement regarding
borrower default to focus on failures to return loaned securities that result in the fund (or its
securities lending agent) having to liquidate collateral pledged to secure the loaned securities or
the fund otherwise being adversely impacted.949 We have also added an instruction to clarify
that, for purposes of this reporting requirement, other adverse impacts to the fund would include,
for example, (1) a loss to the fund if collateral and indemnification were not sufficient to replace
the loaned securities or their value, (2) the fund’s ineligibility to vote shares in a proxy,950 or (3)

default due to events of insolvency or upon an agent lender otherwise formally declaring a default by
the borrower pursuant to the relevant borrower agreement); Fidelity Comment Letter (recommending
that borrower default be limited to any default that results in losses to the fund, which could arise
when the value of collateral for loaned securities and any reimbursement payments due to the fund
are insufficient to eliminate losses associated with the default).
946

See ICI Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I.

947

See Fidelity Comment Letter. See also RMA Comment Letter and State Street Comment Letter
(generally recommending borrower default being defined as any default due to events of insolvency
or upon an agent lender otherwise formally declaring a default by the borrower pursuant to the
relevant borrower agreement). We believe these recommended definitions of default are too narrow
because a fund could be harmed by a borrower’s failure to return loaned securities whether or not the
borrower is insolvent or the lending agent declares an event of default.

the fund’s ineligibility to receive a direct distribution from the issuer.951 We believe that with
these modifications to the proposal, the Commission may better monitor the risks associated with
borrower defaults that have the potential to expose the fund and its shareholders to harm without
having funds account for technical defaults that do not pose the same risks.
We are also adopting, as proposed, a requirement that management companies report
whether a securities lending agent or any other entity indemnifies the fund against borrower
default on loans administered by the agent and certain identifying information about the entity
providing indemnification if not the securities lending agent.952 In addition, in a modification
from the proposal, we are now including a requirement that management companies report
whether the fund exercised its indemnification rights during the reporting period.953 A
commenter recommended that the Commission require funds to report whether they exercised
their indemnification rights to, in part, provide information about defaults and the extent to
which counterparty risks are covered by third parties that provide indemnification.954 We agree
with the commenter that this additional requirement would illuminate the frequency of defaults
and indemnifications thereby providing the Commission with information about such
counterparty defaults and the extent to which those risks are covered by third parties that provide
indemnification. We believe that this additional requirement, together with the other default and
indemnification requirements, will yield data that will allow the Commission, investors, and
other potential users to more effectively assess the counterparty risks associated with borrower

default in the securities lending market and the extent to which those risks are mitigated by—or
concentrated in—third parties that provide indemnification against default.955
One commenter recommended that details concerning indemnification protection should
be made nonpublic.956 We continue to believe, however, that public reporting is a necessary part
of improving transparency regarding a fund’s securities lending activities. Specifically, we
believe that the information regarding indemnification provisions is relevant to investors
evaluating the risks associated with securities lending and comparing those risks across funds,
particularly for funds that regularly engage in securities lending activities.
Because management companies often engage external service providers as securities
lending agents or cash collateral managers, we believe that some of the risks associated with
securities lending activities by management companies could be impacted by these service
providers and the nature of their relationships with the management companies and the
interconnectedness these service providers may have one with another. Accordingly, we are
adopting, as proposed, a requirement that management companies report some basic identifying
information about each securities lending agent and cash collateral manager.957 One commenter
suggested that the Commission define the terms “securities lending agent” and “cash collateral
manager” for purposes of Form N-CEN.958 While we continue to believe that these terms are

As discussed above, commenters to the FSOC Notice suggested that enhanced securities lending
disclosures could be beneficial to investors and counterparties. See supra footnote 190.

See Fidelity Comment Letter (noting that public disclosure may negatively impact a fund’s ability to
negotiate for lending services).

See RMA Comment Letter (noting that the terms are generally well-understood within the fund
industry, but suggesting that, for purposes of Form N-CEN, the Commission could define the term
“securities lending agent” to mean a party employed by a lender to administer the lender’s securities
lending program according to the prescribed terms of a legal agreement and the term “cash collateral

256

generally understood within the fund industry, we have clarified in the Form that the term “cash
collateral manager” refers to an entity that manages a pooled investment vehicle in which a
fund’s cash collateral is invested.959 In addition, we are requiring that funds report whether each
of these service providers is a first- or second-tier affiliated person of the management
company.960 One commenter specifically expressed support for this reporting requirement.961
This data will highlight those funds that might be expected to rely on Commission exemptive
relief in order to engage in securities lending activities with affiliates.962

Additionally, the

disclosure of whether the cash collateral manager is a first- or second-tier affiliate of the

manager” to mean a party employed by the lender to manage cash collateral on behalf of securities
loans).
959

See Item C.6.d of Form N-CEN.

960

See Item C.6.c.iii and Item C.6.d.iv of Form N-CEN (requiring a Fund to report if the named
securities lending agent or cash collateral manager is an “affiliated person” (i.e. first-tier affiliate) or
“an affiliated person of an affiliated person” (i.e. second-tier affiliate) of the Fund). See also section
2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act for a definition of the term “affiliated person.” 15 U.S.C.
80a-2(a)(3).

961

See RMA Comment Letter.

962

Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act makes it unlawful for a first- or second-tier affiliate,
among others, acting as principal, to effect any transaction in which the fund, or a company it
controls, is a joint or a joint and several participant in contravention of Commission rules. 15 U.S.C.
80a-17(d). Rule 17d-1(a) prohibits a first- or second-tier affiliate of a registered fund, among others,
acting as principal from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint
enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which the fund (or any company it
controls) is a participant unless an application or arrangement or plan has been filed with the
Commission and has been granted. 17 CFR 270.17d-1. These provisions would prohibit a fund from
lending to a borrower that is a first- or second-tier affiliate or compensating a securities lending agent
that is a first- or second-tier affiliate with a share of revenue generated by the lending program unless
the fund (and/or its affiliate) has obtained an exemptive order from the Commission. These
provisions also generally prohibit a fund from investing cash collateral in a first- or second-tier
affiliated liquidity pool unless the fund satisfies the conditions in rule 12d1-1 under the Investment
Company Act, which provides exemptive relief, subject to certain conditions, for fund investments in
an affiliated registered money market fund and a pooled investment vehicle that would be an
investment company but for sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and that the
fund reasonably believes operates in compliance with money market fund regulations. See Fund of
Funds Investments, Investment Company Act Release No. 27399 (June 20, 2006) [71 FR 36640 (June
27, 2006)] at n. 27 and accompanying text.

securities lending agent963 could alert the Commission, investors, and other market participants
to potential conflicts of interest when an entity managing a cash collateral reinvestment portfolio
is affiliated with a securities lending agent that is compensated with a share of revenue generated
by the cash collateral reinvestment pool.
As proposed, Form N-CEN also requires each management company to report whether it
has made any of several specific types of payments, including a revenue sharing split, nonrevenue sharing split (other than an administrative fee), administrative fee, cash collateral
reinvestment fee, and indemnification fee, to one or more securities lending agents or cash
collateral managers during the reporting period.964 In the Proposing Release, we sought
comment on whether, in addition to requiring management companies to report whether they
made each of the proposed types of payments associated with securities lending, we should also
require disclosure of specific rates or amounts paid for each of the enumerated types of
compensation.965 Two commenters expressed general support for disclosure of securities
lending income and compensation of securities lending agents and cash collateral managers but
recommended that, if compensation figures were required, that they be calculated on the basis of
income and fees paid during the reporting period.966

963

Item C.6.d.iii of Form N-CEN.

964

See Item C.6.e of Form N-CEN; see also Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at section II.E.4.c.iii.
Management companies that report that “other” payments were made to one or more securities
lending agents or cash collateral managers during the reporting period will also be required to
describe the type or types of other payments. See Item C.6.e.vi of Form N-CEN. In addition,
management companies will be required to disclose the total amount of each payment for the
reporting period and describe the services provided for the payment. See infra section II.F.2
regarding amendments to the Statement of Additional Information and Form N-CSR.

965

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33641–42.

966

See RMA Comment Letter; State Street Comment Letter.

258

We believe that the information we proposed about the types of payments relating to
securities lending activities will allow the Commission, investors and other management
company boards of directors to understand better the nature of fees a management company pays
in connection with securities lending activities and whether, for example, the revenue sharing
split that the company pays to a securities lending agent includes compensation for other services
such as administration or cash collateral management.967 We recognize the potential benefits for
some data users of access to information about amounts paid for each of the types of
compensation in a structured format. However, in light of the fact that Form N-CEN reporting
requirements are intended primarily for the Commission’s regulatory purposes and that there
would be additional reporting costs related to such a change, and further recognizing that
additional securities lending information will now be available to investors pursuant to new
Statement of Additional Information (or, for closed-end funds, Form N-CSR) requirements
discussed below,968 we have determined not to require reporting of specific compensation
amounts or fee rates in reports on Form N-CEN. In addition, we have included in Form N-CEN,
a requirement that management companies report the monthly average of the value of portfolio

967

In evaluating the fees and services of any securities lending agent, the board of directors of a
management company that engages in securities lending may be assisted by reviewing and comparing
information on securities lending agent fee arrangements of other management companies. See, e.g.,
SIFE Trust Fund, SEC No-Action Letter (pub. avail. Feb. 17, 1982) (management company’s board
of directors determines that the securities lending agent’s fee is reasonable and based solely on the
services rendered); Neuberger Berman Equity Funds, et al., Investment Company Act Release No.
25880 (Jan. 2, 2003) [68 FR 1071 (Jan. 8, 2003)] (Notice); Neuberger Berman Equity Funds, et al.,
Investment Company Act Release No. 25916 (Jan. 28, 2003) (Order) (management company’s board
of directors, including a majority of independent directors, will determine initially and review
annually, among other things, that (i) the services to be performed by the affiliated securities lending
agent are appropriate for the lending fund, (ii) the nature and quality of the services to be provided by
the agent are at least equal to those provided by others offering the same or similar services; and (iii)
the fees for the agent’s services are fair and reasonable in light of the usual and customary charges
imposed by others for services of the same nature and quality).

968

See infra section II.F.

259

securities on loan during the reporting period.969 This requirement was originally proposed to be
included in Regulation S-X along with other securities lending disclosure requirements.970 We
have determined to move this information to Form N-CEN as we believe having this information
in a structured format will assist our staff in its analyses of the information. As previously noted,
we have also determined to move the other proposed securities lending disclosures from
Regulation S-X to the Statement of Additional Information (or, for closed-end funds, Form
N-CSR), as we believe the Statement of Additional Information (or, for closed-end funds, Form
N-CSR) is a more appropriate location for these disclosures.971 One commenter recommended
that funds be required to report average monthly aggregate dollar amounts on loan for each
counterparty to the securities loan.972 We continue to believe, however, that information on the
overall monthly average of the value of portfolio securities on loan provides a better
understanding of a fund’s securities lending program without burdening registrants with
additional counterparty reporting requirements.
Finally, we are also adopting a requirement that funds report the net income from
securities lending activities in Form N-CEN.973 We proposed to require disclosure of this
information in fund financial statements pursuant to proposed amendments to Regulation S-X,
and we sought comment on whether the information should be required in reports on Form
N-CEN.974 One commenter suggested that the proposed securities lending financial statement

disclosure requirements be instead included in Form N-CEN, as presentation there would be less
likely to detract from other material information in the financial statements.975 Another
commenter suggested that requiring additional information on Form N-CEN, including income
from securities lending activities, would make the other required information more complete and
useful.976 We agree with commenters that reporting of net income from securities lending
activities would yield useful information for the Commission and other data users and have
determined to add this requirement. In particular, information about net income from securities
lending activity in a structured format provides useful context for the other securities lending
reporting requirements, such as those concerning fees.
Together, the data that these requirements will yield will allow the Commission to better
understand the interaction of these service providers with management companies. We also
believe that the reporting of this data will increase the transparency of information available to
the public on the lending and borrowing of securities by funds, a subset of the market
participants engaged in securities lending activities.977 In addition to informing the
Commission’s risk analysis, we believe that this information will also help inform other data
users about the use of, and possible risks associated with, the lending of portfolio securities by
management companies.
iv.

Reliance on Certain Rules

We are adopting, as proposed, a requirement in Form N-CEN that management
companies report whether they relied on certain rules under the Investment Company Act during

975

976

See BlackRock Directors Comment Letter.

977

See, e.g., supra footnote 192.

261

the reporting period.978 A similar reporting item is contained in Form N-SAR. 979 However,
Form N-CEN requires information with respect to additional rules not currently covered by Form
N-SAR.980 We are collecting information on these additional rules to better monitor reliance on
exemptive rules and to assist us with our accounting, auditing and oversight functions, including,
for some rules, compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. For example, reporting of
reliance on rules 15a-4 and 17a-8 under the Investment Company Act will allow the staff to
monitor significant events relating to interim investment advisory agreements and affiliated
mergers, respectively.
One commenter suggested that the Commission specify the name of each rule next to the
rule number.981 We believe, however, that the rule number descriptions as proposed in Item C.7
are consistent with other reporting forms and provide sufficient information for registrants, and
thus, are adopting the item as proposed.

Item C.7 of Form N-CEN.

Compare id. (requiring management companies to identify if they relied upon any of the following

(distribution of shares by registered open-end management investment company)).

In addition, we are adopting, as proposed, amendments to rule 10f-3 to eliminate the
requirement that funds provide the Commission with reports on Form N-SAR regarding any
transactions effected pursuant to the rule.982 Rule 10f-3 currently requires funds to maintain and
preserve certain information—the same information also required to be filed pursuant to Form
N-SAR—in its records regarding rule 10f-3 transactions.983 Our amendments to rule 10f-3 will
eliminate the requirement to periodically report this information,984 but will not alter the
requirement to maintain and preserve it. The Commission believes it is unnecessary for funds to
continue to file this information because Commission staff can request the information in
connection with staff inspections, examinations and other inquiries.985 We did not receive
comment on this aspect of the proposal.
v.

Expense Limitations

As in Form N-SAR,986 Form N-CEN requires information regarding expense
limitations.987 The requirements in Form N-CEN are, as proposed, modified from Form N-SAR

982

See adopted amendments to rule 10f-3.

983

See rule 10f-3(c)(12) under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.10f-3(c)(12)].

984

See rule 10f-3(c)(9) under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 27010f-3(c)(9)].

985

Similar exemptive rules take this approach and do not require filings with the Commission. See, e.g.,
rule 17a-7 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.17a-7] and rule 17e-1 under the
Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.17e-1]. We note that we previously proposed deleting this
filing requirement from rule 10f-3 in 1996. See Exemption for the Acquisition of Securities During
the Existence of an Underwriting Syndicate, Investment Company Act Release No. 21838 (Mar. 21,
1996) [61 FR 13620 (Mar. 27, 1996)]. We chose not to delete the filing requirement in the final
amended rule in light of the other amendments to the rule at that time, including the increase in the
percentage limit on the principal amount of an offering that an affiliated fund could purchase. See
Exemption for the Acquisition of Securities During the Existence of an Underwriting of Selling
Syndicate, Investment Company Act Release No. 22775 (July 31, 1997) [62 FR 42401 (Aug. 7,
1997)].

986

See Item 53.A–Item 53.C of Form N-SAR (requiring the fund to identify if expenses of the
Registrant/Series were limited or reduced during the reporting period by agreement, and, if so,
identify if the limitation was based upon assets or income).

987

Item C.8 of Form N-CEN.

263

and require information on whether the management company had an expense limitation
arrangement in place, whether any expenses of the fund were waived or reduced pursuant to the
arrangement, whether the waived fees are subject to recoupment, and whether any expenses
previously waived were recouped during the period.988 We believe that more specific questions
relating to management company expense limitation arrangements will limit uncertainty for
management companies when responding to these items and will be a useful means to flag the
occurrence of expense limitations whereby Commission staff can request further information in
connection with staff examinations and other inquiries. One commenter expressed support for
the expense limitation reporting requirement but suggested that the item include reporting of the
actual dollar values of the expense information.989 We continue to believe, however, that the
reporting item, as proposed, appropriately balances the burden on funds of providing this
information and information necessary for our regulatory purposes. The adopted requirements
are meant to yield census-type information that is, to the extent practicable, comparable across
reporting funds and that permits the Commission and other potential users to follow up, as
appropriate, on patterns and idiosyncrasies in the reported data. We believe therefore that the
detailed and nuanced information the commenter suggests requiring is better provided in a fund’s
registration statement than in reports on Form N-CEN, to the extent required or otherwise
appropriate.

988

Id. Form N-CEN also includes an instruction that filers should provide information in response to the
item concerning any direct or indirect limitations, waivers or reductions, on the level of expenses
incurred by the fund during the reporting period. The instructions also provide an example of how an
expense limit may be applied – when an adviser agrees to accept a reduced fee pursuant to a
voluntary fee waiver or for a temporary period such as for a new fund in its start-up phase. See
Instruction to Item C.8 of Form N-CEN.

Service Providers

Form N-CEN (similar to Form N-SAR)990 will, as proposed, collect identifying
information on the management company’s service providers, including its advisers and subadvisers,991 transfer agents,992 pricing services agents,993 custodians (including custodians that
provide services as sub-custodians),994 shareholder servicing agents,995 administrators,996 and
affiliated broker-dealers.997 Together, these items will assist the Commission in analyzing the
use of third-party service providers by management companies, as well as identify service
providers that service large portions of the fund industry.
Unlike Form N-SAR, Form N-CEN will, as proposed, also require the management
company to provide information on whether the service provider was hired or terminated during
the reporting period and whether it is affiliated with the fund or its adviser(s).998 In addition, like
Form N-SAR, and as proposed, Form N-CEN requests custodians to indicate the type of custody,
but will expand upon the types of custody listed.999

One commenter recommended that the text of Item C.10 separate the term “transfer
agent” from “sub-transfer agents” by including disclosures about the nature of the services
rendered by sub-transfer agents to help assess shareholder costs paid.1000 The commenter did
not, however, suggest a particular list of specific services. We note that the proposed form
requested information with respect to “each” service provider, which we believe would include
service providers providing services to the fund in a sub-service provider capacity.1001 However,
in response to this comment, we have clarified for each relevant service provider, including
transfers agents, that the fund must report sub-service providers in response to the service
provider items.1002 Thus, with respect to the item, we have added a sub-item requiring that funds
indicate if the transfer agent is a sub-transfer agent.1003 We have determined not to require a
description of the services provided by each transfer agent (or of other service providers) in
Form N-CEN as we believe the information as proposed is sufficient for our regulatory purposes
and because it is unclear whether, absent a specific set of listed services in Form N-CEN, which
the commenter did not provide, this information on services would yield comparable census-type
data across funds.
With respect to custodian information, one commenter suggested that the form should
require identification of the primary custodian only, citing that the primary custodian is the
primary service provider of the fund, whereas any sub-custodians, depositories, or clearing
1000

Morningstar Comment Letter.

1001

We understand that a sub-service provider generally contracts with a primary service provider of the
fund, rather than the fund itself, to provide a certain subset of the services that the primary service
provider has otherwise agreed to provide the fund.

1002

See Item C.10.a.vii, Item C.12.a.vi, Item C.13.a.vi, and Item C.14.a.vi of Form N-CEN. We note that
a similar requirement was proposed with respect to custodians. See Item 37.a.vi of proposed Form
N-CEN.

1003

See Item C.10.a.vii of Form N-CEN.

266

organizations that provide custodial services will be a function of the specific instruments that
the fund invests in during the reporting period.1004 We note that identifying sub-custodians on
Form N-CEN is consistent with reporting requirements on Form N-SAR.1005 Because subcustodians and other sub-service providers may provide important services to funds, we continue
to believe that requesting information about sub-custodians and other sub-service providers in
addition to the primary service providers is appropriate and useful for purposes of our oversight
responsibilities. For example, should an adverse market event affect a particular sub-custodian,
Commission data analysts could use the required information about sub-custodians to identify
potentially affected funds. Information about the primary custodian alone would not permit such
identification.
As proposed, the form would have included two new requirements regarding pricing
services. Management companies would have to provide identifying information on persons that
provided pricing services during the reporting period,1006 as well as persons that formerly
provided pricing services to the management company during the current and immediately prior
reporting period that no longer provide services to that company.1007 Based on staff experience,
management companies and their boards often rely on pricing agents to help price securities held
by the fund.

One commenter expressed support for the new reporting requirements, noting that the
information would be sufficient to conduct due diligence on pricing and valuation issues.1008
One commenter expressed concern that reporting pricing services no longer retained could
improperly imply that valuation services provided by the former service provider were incorrect
and/or unreliable.1009 In response to that comment, we have determined to remove from the form
the item requiring funds to provide information on pricing services no longer retained. We have
instead revised Item C.11 of the form, which requires information on persons who provided
pricing services to the fund during the reporting period, to ask whether a pricing agent was hired
or terminated during the report period.1010 Unlike the proposed requirement and in response to
the commenter’s concern, Item C.11 as modified does not identify specifically the pricing
service that was terminated. A similar question is also included in the form for other fund
service providers and, as with the information provided for other service providers, will still
provide Commission staff with a method for identifying whether a fund has initiated or
terminated a service provider relationship during the reporting period.1011
As in the proposal, Part C will also require identifying information on the ten entities
that, during the reporting period, received the largest dollar amount of brokerage commissions
from the management company1012 and with which the management company did the largest

1008

1009

See Fidelity Comment Letter.

1010

As proposed, Item 35(f) would have asked “Was the pricing service first retained by the Fund to
provide pricing services during the current reporting period?” As adopted, Item C.11.b asks “Was a
pricing service hired or terminated during the reporting period?”.

1011

See, e.g., Item C.10–Item C.14 of Form N-CEN (requesting information regarding transfer agents,
custodians, shareholder servicing agents, and third-party administrators).

dollar amount of principal transactions.1013 Form N-SAR also requests identifying information
on these entities,1014 which is not available elsewhere in a structured format. We continue to
believe that brokerage commission and principal transaction information provides valuable
information to Commission staff about management company brokerage practices, and will
assist the staff in identifying the broker-dealers who service management company clients,
monitoring for changes in business practices, and assessing the types of trading activities in
which funds are engaged. Additionally, similar to Form N-SAR, Form N-CEN requires
information concerning whether the management company paid commissions to broker-dealers
for “brokerage and research services” within the meaning of section 28(e) of the Exchange
Act.1015 We did not receive comment on these aspects of the proposal.
In a modification from the proposal, we are now including a requirement that (1) funds
other than money market funds report their monthly average net assets during the reporting

1013

Item C.17 of Form N-CEN.

1014

Items 20–23 of Form N-SAR. Form N-SAR includes an instruction designed to help filers
distinguish between agency and principal transactions for purposes of reporting information regarding
brokerage commissions and principal transactions. See Instruction to Items 20–23 of Form N-SAR.
A substantially similar instruction will be included in Form N-CEN. See Instructions to Item C.16
and Item C.17 of Form N-CEN.

1015

Item C.18 of Form N-CEN; see also Item 26.B of Form N-SAR (requiring disclosure if the fund’s
receipt of investment research and statistical information from a broker or dealer was a consideration
which affected the participation of brokers or dealers or other entities in commissions or other
compensation paid on portfolio transactions of Registrant). Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act
establishes a safe harbor that allows money managers to use client funds to purchase “brokerage and
research services” for their managed accounts under certain circumstances without breaching their
fiduciary duties to clients. See 15 U.S.C. 78bb(e); see also Commission Guidance Regarding Client
Commission Practices Under Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 34-54165 (July 18, 2006) [71 FR 41978 (July 24, 2006)]. We continue to
believe that an item indicating whether a fund uses soft dollars will assist our staff in their
examinations and provide census data as to the number and type of funds that rely on the safe harbor
provided by section 28(e).

period,1016 and (2) money market funds report the daily average net assets during the reporting
period.1017 Funds currently report this information on Form N-SAR reports.1018
One commenter suggested that such net asset information (e.g., Item 75) as well as fee
and expense information (e.g., Items 34–44, 47–52, 54, and 72), currently available semiannually on Form N-SAR should carry over into Form N-CEN, arguing that the removal of these
reporting items will make the fee and expense information more difficult to acquire and
analyze.1019 The commenter argued, in part, that while this information could be calculated
based on information available through other sources, the manual aggregation of this information
would put comprehensive analysis out of reach for investors and fund boards unless they were
using services from third-party market data providers that may have the means to conduct such
data aggregation. We continue to believe that fee and expense information reported on Form NSAR need not be reported on Form N-CEN because fee and expense information is largely
already disclosed in fund registration statements and, with respect to some information, in a
structured format.1020 However, we find the commenter’s suggestion regarding reporting of
average net assets persuasive and have added the reporting items of Item 75 of Form N-SAR
into Form N-CEN.1021 We believe that this information will assist data users in their analysis of

Part D — Closed-End Management Companies and Small Business
Investment Companies

The Commission recognizes that closed-end funds and SBICs have particular
characteristics that warrant questions targeted specifically to them.1022 Like Form N-SAR and as
proposed, Form N-CEN requires additional information to be reported by closed-end funds in
Part D of the form and also treats SBICs differently than other management investment
companies, requiring them to complete Part D of the form in lieu of Part C.1023 The information
required in Part D will provide us with information that is particular to closed-end funds and
SBICs and, thus, will assist us in monitoring the activities of these funds and our examiners in
their preparation for exams of these funds. Where we have received comments on specific
reporting requirements of Part D, we discuss them in more detail below.
Similar to Form N-SAR, we are adopting, as proposed, a reporting requirement in Part D
of Form N-CEN for information on the securities that have been issued by the closed-end fund or
SBIC, including the type of security issued (common stock, preferred stock, warrants,
convertible securities, bonds, or any security considered “other”), title of each class, exchange
where listed, and ticker symbol.1024 As in the proposal, we are requiring new information

1022

See Items 86–88 of Form N-SAR (relating specifically to closed-end funds) and Items 89–104 of
Form N-SAR (relating specifically to SBICs).

1023

As discussed above, SBICs are unique investment companies that operate differently than other
management investment companies. See supra footnote 49.

1024

Item D.1 of Form N-CEN; cf. Items 87–88 and Item 96 of Form N-SAR (requesting information on
the title and ticker of each class of securities issued on an exchange and information regarding certain

271

relating to rights offerings1025 and secondary offerings by the closed-end fund or SBIC,1026
including whether there was such an offering during the reporting period and if so, the type of
security involved.1027 Together, this information will allow the staff to quickly identify and track
the securities and offerings of closed-end funds and SBICs when monitoring and examining
these funds.
Like Form N-SAR,1028 we are also adopting, as proposed, a requirement that each closedend fund or SBIC report information on repurchases of its securities during the reporting
period.1029 However, unlike Form N-SAR, which requires information on the number of shares
or principal amount of debt and net consideration received or paid for sales and repurchases for
common stock, preferred stock, and debt securities, we are adopting, as proposed, the
requirement in Form N-CEN that a closed-end fund or SBIC only needs to indicate if it
repurchased any outstanding securities issued by the closed-end fund or SBIC during the
reporting period and indicate which type of security.1030

specific types of securities). An instruction to Item D.1 of Form N-CEN indicates that the fund
should provide the ticker symbol for any security not listed on an exchange, but has a ticker symbol.

1026

Item D.3 of Form N-CEN.

1027

See Item D.3.a and Item D.3.b of Form N-CEN. Item D.2.c of Form N-CEN also requires the
percentage of participation in a primary rights offering and an accompanying instruction to this item
addresses the method of calculating such percentage.

1028

See Item 86 and Item 95 of Form N-SAR.

1029

Item D.4 of Form N-CEN.

1030

We note that, with respect to closed-end funds, financial information relating to monthly sales and
repurchases of shares will be reported monthly on Form N-PORT. See Item B.6 of Form N-PORT
(requiring the aggregate dollar amounts for sales and redemptions/repurchases of fund shares during
each of the last three months).

272

As proposed, we are also carrying over Form N-SAR’s requirements1031 relating to
default on long-term debt1032 and dividends in arrears.1033 However, unlike Form N-SAR, which
requires an attachment providing detailed information on defaults and arrears on senior
securities,1034 Form N-CEN only will require a yes/no question and text-based responses.1035
Also as proposed, we are similarly carrying over the Form N-SAR requirement1036 regarding
modifications to the constituent’s instruments defining the rights of holders.1037 Similar to Form
N-SAR, if a closed-end fund or SBIC made modifications to such an instrument, it also will be
required to file an attachment in Part G of Form N-CEN with a more detailed description of the
modification.1038 This item provides the Commission with information on and copies of
documents reflecting changes to shareholders’ rights.
We are also adopting, as proposed, requirements in Part G of Form N-CEN that closedend funds or SBICs file attachments regarding material amendments to organizational
documents,1039 new or amended investment advisory contracts,1040 information called for by Item

1031

See Item 77.G and Item 102.F of Form N-SAR.

1033

Item D.6 of Form N-CEN.

1034

Item 77.G and Item 102.F of Form N-SAR.

1035

Item D.5 of Form N-CEN requires, with respect to any default on long-term debt, the nature of the
default, the date of the default, the amount of the default per $1000 face amount, and the total amount
of default. An instruction to this item defines “long-term debt” to mean a debt with a period of time
from date of initial issuance to maturity of one year or greater. Item D.6 of Form N-CEN requires,
with respect to any dividends in arrears, the title of the issue and the amount per share in arrears. This
item defines “dividends in arrears” to mean dividends that have not been declared by the board of
directors or other governing body of the fund at the end of each relevant dividend period set forth in
the constituent instruments establishing the rights of the stockholders.

405 of Regulation S-K,1041 and, for SBICs only, senior officer codes of ethics.1042 Where
possible, we sought to eliminate the need to file attachments with the report in order to simplify
the filing process and maximize the amount of information we receive in a data tagged format.
However, the attachments required by Form N-CEN will provide us with information that is not
otherwise updated or filed with the Commission and, thus, we believe they should continue to be
filed in attachment form. All of the attachments in Form N-CEN that are specific to closed-end
funds and SBICs are also currently required by Form N-SAR.1043
Similar to Form N-SAR, we are adopting, as proposed, a requirement for other censustype information relating to management fees and net operating expenses. Closed-end funds will
be required to report the fund’s advisory fee as of the end of the reporting period as a percentage
of net assets.1044 Some commenters expressed support for this specific item requirement.1045
One of the commenters also suggested that funds report the actual management fee paid as a
percentage of the average NAV of the fund during the reporting period so that the fee reported

1041

Item G.1.b.iv of Form N-CEN.

1042

Item G.1.b.v of Form N-CEN. This item applies only to SBICs because other management
investment companies, including closed-end funds, provide this information in filings on Form NCSR. See Item 2 and Item 3 of Form N-CSR; see also rule 30d-1 under the Investment Company Act
[17 CFR 270.30d-1].

1043

Compare Item G.1.b of Form N-CEN with Item 77.Q.1, Item 77.Q.2, Item 102.P.1, Item 102.P.2, and
Item 102.P.3 of Form N-SAR; see also Instructions to Specific Item 77Q1(a), Item 77Q1(e), Item
77Q2, Item 102P1(a), Item 102P1(e), Item 102P2, and Item 102P3 of Form N-SAR.

1044

Item D.8 of Form N-CEN; cf. Items 47–52 and Item 72.F of Form N-SAR (requesting advisory fee
information for management companies, including closed-end funds). Whereas Form N-SAR
requests information regarding the advisory fee rate and the dollar amount of gross advisory fees, an
instruction to Item D.8 of Form N-CEN explains that the management fee reported should be based
on the percentage of amounts incurred during the reporting period.

1045

See ICI Comment Letter (agreeing that management fee information should be backward looking);
State Street Comment Letter (also agreeing that the advisory fee should be backward looking, noting
that backward looking disclosures are consistent with the annual financial statements of regulated
investment companies).

274

reflects the fee charged during the reporting period.1046 We are adopting the requirement as
proposed because it meets our regulatory purposes and is consistent with the fee disclosure
requirements for closed-end funds in their registration statements.1047 We believe that reporting
in this manner will yield information that is more readily comparable across types of funds, as
open-end funds must currently disclose tagged fee information as a percentage of net assets in
XBRL in the fund’s risk/return summary.1048
Additionally, as proposed, closed-end funds and SBICs will both be required to report the
fund’s net annual operating expenses as of the end of the reporting period (net of any waivers or
reimbursements) as a percentage of net assets. 1049 Unlike open-end funds, which provide
management fee and net expense information to the Commission in a structured format,1050 such
information is not reported to or updated with the Commission in a structured format by closedend funds or SBICs. This information will allow the Commission to track industry trends
relating to fees. As proposed, Form N-CEN carries forward the Form N-SAR requirement that
market price per share1051 and NAV per share1052 of the fund’s common stock be reported for the
end of the reporting period.

1046

See ICI Comment Letter.

1047

See Item 3 of Form N-2 (requesting management fee information as a percentage of net assets
attributable to common shares).

1048

See General Instruction C.3.G to Form N-1A.

1049

Item D.9 of Form N-CEN; cf. Item 72.X and Item 97.X of Form N-SAR (requesting total expenses in
dollars for closed-end funds and SBICs).

1050

Management fee information for open-end funds is currently tagged in XBRL format in the fund’s
risk return summary and is therefore not required by Form N-CEN. See General Instruction C.3.G to
Form N-1A.

1051

Item D.10 of Form N-CEN; see Item 76 and Item 101 of Form N-SAR

1052

Item D.11 of Form N-CEN; see Item 74.V.1 and Item 99.V of Form N-SAR.

275

Finally, as proposed, Form N-CEN (like Form N-SAR) will require information
regarding an SBIC’s investment advisers,1053 transfer agents,1054 and custodians (including
custodians that provide services as sub-custodians).1055 This information is the same as what will
be reported by open-end and closed-end funds in Part C of Form N-CEN, but SBICs will not be
required to fill out Part C of the form. The majority of questions in Part C of Form N-CEN are
inapplicable to SBICs or otherwise request information that will not be helpful to us in carrying
out our regulatory functions with respect to SBICs. Accordingly, we are excepting SBICs from
filling out Part C of the form and instead including for SBICs certain service provider questions
from Part C in Part D of the form.
e.

Part E — Exchange-Traded Funds and Exchange-Traded Managed Funds

As we proposed, we are adopting a section in Form N-CEN related specifically to
ETFs—Part E—which ETFs will complete in addition to Parts A, B, and G, and either Part C
(for open-end funds) or Part F (for UITs). For purposes of Form N-CEN, an ETF is a special
type of investment company that is registered under the Investment Company Act as either an
open-end fund or a UIT. Unlike other open-end funds and UITs, an ETF generally does not sell
or redeem its shares except in large blocks (or “creation units”) and with broker-dealers that have
contractual arrangements with the ETF (called “authorized participants”).1056 However, national

1053

Item D.12 of Form N-CEN.

1054

Item D.13; see supra footnotes 990–997 and accompanying text; see also supra footnotes 1000–1002,
and accompanying text (discussing the addition of a sub-item related to sub-transfer agents).

1055

Item D.14 of Form N-CEN.

1056

For purposes of Form N-CEN, “creation unit” is defined as “a specified number of Exchange-Traded
Fund or Exchange-Traded Managed Fund shares that the fund will issue to (or redeem from) an
authorized participant in exchange for the deposit (or delivery) of specified securities, positions, cash,
and other assets.” Instruction to Item E.3 of Form N-CEN. We have made a modification from the
proposed definition of “creation unit” to clarify, consistent with current Commission exemptive relief,
that a “creation unit” could also include “positions” that may not be “assets.” For purposes of Form

276

securities exchanges list ETF shares for trading, which allows investors to purchase and sell
individual shares throughout the day in the secondary market. Thus, ETFs possess
characteristics of traditional open-end funds and UITs, which issue redeemable shares, and of
closed-end funds, which generally issue shares that trade at negotiated prices on national
securities exchanges and that are not redeemable.1057
ETFs currently are subject to the same information reporting requirements on Form
N-SAR as are other open-end funds or UITs, and they are not required to report additional, more
specialized information because Form N-SAR predates the introduction of ETFs to the market
and has not been amended to address ETFs’ distinct characteristics. In 2009, the Commission
amended its registration statement disclosure requirements for ETFs1058 that are open-end funds
to better meet the needs of investors who purchase those ETF shares in secondary market
transactions.1059 We believe that it is appropriate to similarly tailor some of the comprehensive
information reporting requirements in Form N-CEN to the special characteristics of ETFs. As
we proposed, funds and UITs meeting the definition of “exchange-traded fund” in Form N-CEN
will be required to report information pursuant to the items in Part E of the form, as will certain
N-CEN, “authorized participant” is defined as “a broker-dealer that is also a member of a clearing
agency registered with the Commission or a DTC Participant, and which has a written agreement with
the Exchange-Traded Fund or Exchange-Traded Managed Fund or one of its designated service
providers that allows the authorized participant to place orders to purchase or redeem creation units of
the Exchange-Traded Fund or Exchange-Traded Managed Fund.” Instruction to Item E.1.b of Form
N-CEN. We have made a modification from the proposed definition of “authorized participant” to
clarify, consistent with current Commission exemptive relief, that the definition of “authorized
participant” includes broker-dealers that are DTC participants and otherwise fall within the
definition’s scope.

similar investment products known as “exchange-traded managed funds.”1060 Taken together,
we believe that, in addition to informing the Commission’s risk analysis and, potentially, future
policymaking concerning ETFs, the information these requirements will yield could also help
inform the interested public about the operation of, and possible risks associated with, these
funds.
Some commenters supported having a distinct section for ETFs.1061 However, as
discussed in detail below, some commenters expressed certain concerns about specific reporting
items, and, in particular, the public disclosure of certain reporting items.1062 We are adopting
proposed Part E, with some modifications in response to specific commenter concerns, which are
addressed in more detail below. In particular, several of the modifications we are making today
are intended to address concerns raised by commenters that certain of the proposed Part E
reporting requirements may yield data that is not representative of the ETF’s activity over the
course of the reporting period and may not be appropriately reflective of the range of activity in
the ETF primary market today or in the future.1063
Some of the new reporting requirements for ETFs that we are adopting today as part of
Form N-CEN relate to an ETF’s (or its service provider’s) interaction with authorized
participants. These entities have an important role to play in the orderly distribution and trading
of ETF shares and are significant to the ETF marketplace.1064 Because of their importance, we

Currently, the information we have regarding reliance by ETFs on particular authorized
participants is limited, and we believe that collecting information concerning these entities on an
annual basis will allow us to understand and better assess the size, capacity, and concentration of
the authorized participant framework and also inform the public about certain characteristics of
the ETF primary markets. Accordingly, we are adopting, as proposed, a new requirement for
each ETF to report identifying information about its authorized participants.1066 More
specifically, Form N-CEN will require an ETF to report the name of each of its authorized
participants (even if the authorized participant did not purchase or redeem any ETF shares during
the reporting period)1067 and certain other identifying information,1068 including the authorized
participant’s SEC file number.1069 One commenter expressly supported reporting of this
information, but suggested that authorized participants, rather than funds, should be required to
provide this identifying information to the Commission, reasoning that authorized participants
would have more ready access to the required information than funds.1070 Although we
acknowledge that authorized participants would be expected to have access to the required

participants with which it has contracted, but that the additional information proposed in Part E

dollar value of the ETF shares purchased and redeemed during the reporting period) would be more
appropriately requested from the authorized participants themselves).

279

information, we believe that, because authorized participants are counterparties to ETFs in
primary market transactions, the required information should also be available to ETFs with
which the authorized participants contract and transact. Because the requirements are intended
in part to yield information about reliance by ETFs on particular authorized participants, and the
Commission as well as other data users seeking census-type information about ETFs will likely
be able to find and analyze it most efficiently using reports on Form N-CEN, we believe that
ETFs themselves are the most appropriate source for the required information.
In addition, we are adopting a requirement for each ETF to report the dollar value of the
ETF shares that each authorized participant purchased and redeemed from the ETF during the
reporting period.1071 Some commenters objected to the inclusion of this requirement in Form
N-CEN, expressing concerns that reporting authorized participant activities on Form N-CEN
could discourage authorized participants from participating in the ETF market, leading to further
concentration in the authorized participant community or authorized participants’ moving their
ETF-related trading activities to banks or “clearing” authorized participants.1072 We continue to
believe, however, that collection of this additional information may allow the Commission staff
to monitor how ETF purchase and redemption activity is distributed across authorized
participants and, for example, the extent to which a particular ETF—or ETFs as a group—may
be reliant on one or more particular authorized participants. We believe that adopting the new
reporting requirements is appropriate in light of these benefits notwithstanding the possibility

Comment Letter.

that public availability of the information might affect the ETF primary markets in the manner
those commenters suggest.
We also proposed, in the Liquidity Proposing Release, to require an ETF to report
whether it required that an authorized participant post collateral to the ETF or any of its
designated service providers in connection with the purchase or redemption of ETF shares during
the reporting period.1073 We understand that some ETFs (or their custodians), particularly ETFs
that invest in non-U.S. securities, require authorized participants transacting primarily on an inkind basis to post collateral when purchasing or redeeming shares, most often for the duration of
the settlement process. This can protect the ETF in the event, for example, that the authorized
participant fails to deliver the basket securities.1074 The requirement to post collateral for creating
or redeeming ETF shares impacts the authorized participant’s operating capital, which could, in
turn, affect the ability and willingness of authorized participants to transact with such ETFs or
transact with other market makers on an agency basis. Accordingly, we continue to believe that
information about required posting of collateral by authorized participants when purchasing or
redeeming shares—alongside the other information that will be required in Form N-CEN—will
be helpful in understanding whether, and to what extent, there may be concentration in the
authorized participant framework for such ETFs. Therefore, we are adopting this requirement as
proposed.1075

See, e.g., ICI, The Role and Activities of Authorized Participants of Exchange-Traded Funds (Mar.

in non-U.S. securities, Commission Staff understands that there are other ETFs that have collateral
requirements for purchases and redemptions, such as ETFs that invest in debt securities.

1075

Item E.2.g of Form N-CEN.

281

Other new reporting requirements relate to certain characteristics of ETF creation units—
the large blocks of shares that authorized participants may purchase from or redeem with the
ETF. In the primary market, ETF shares, bundled in creation units, are sold or redeemed for
consideration composed of some combination of the ETF’s constituent portfolio securities (i.e.,
an “in-kind” basis) and cash (i.e., on a cash basis). Whether transacting in kind or in cash, there
may be costs that result from the process of carrying out the transaction. In addition, when an
authorized participant purchases (or redeems) ETF shares all or partly in cash, absent a
countervailing effect, the ETF would experience additional costs (e.g., brokerage, taxes)
involved with buying the securities with cash or selling portfolio securities to satisfy a cash
redemption. In the course of such primary market transaction, the particular authorized
participant wishing to purchase (or redeem) shares typically bears the costs associated with
transacting in the creation unit or units in the form of one or more transaction fees. The costs,
therefore, are not directly borne by non-transacting shareholders. In the Proposing Release, we
characterized these transaction fees as taking two specific forms (viz., “fixed fees” and “variable
fees”) with corresponding purposes, and that characterization reflects our understanding of the
typical transaction costs in the ETF primary markets today.1076 As discussed below, a
commenter raised concerns that transaction fees may not uniformly fit within the two types of
fees discussed in the Proposing Release, and we are persuaded that it is appropriate to modify the

1076

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33646. We characterized a “fixed fee” as a fee covering
the transactional costs associated with assembling (or disassembling) creation units. Id. We
characterized a “variable fee” as one intended to ensure that the purchasing or redeeming party bears
the costs associated with transacting entirely or partially on a cash basis. Id.

282

proposed form’s characterization of these transaction fees in Form N-CEN as we are adopting it
today.1077
In order to better understand the capital markets implications of different creation unit
requirements, primary market transaction methods, and transaction fees, we proposed
requirements that ETFs annually report summary information about these characteristics of
creation units and primary market transactions. ETFs are not currently required to report the
information discussed below in a structured format, and public availability of many of the new
data items is limited and indeterminable. To better understand how common different
transaction methods are and the degree to which they vary across ETFs and over time, we
proposed to require that ETFs report the total value (i) of creation units that were purchased by
authorized participants “primarily” in exchange for portfolio securities on an in-kind basis; (ii) of
those that were redeemed “primarily” on an in-kind basis; (iii) of those that were purchased by
authorized participants “primarily” in exchange for cash; and (iv) of those that were redeemed
“primarily” on a cash basis.1078 For purposes of these reporting requirements concerning
transaction methods and transaction fees, we proposed to define “primarily” to mean greater than
50% of the value of the creation unit.1079 One commenter expressed general support for this
information, opining that it would be helpful for investors.1080 Another commenter, however,
expressed concerns with the proposed distinction between transactions conducted “primarily” on
an in-kind basis and those conducted “primarily” in exchange for cash, arguing that treating a

creation unit that is almost entirely in-kind with a small cash balancing amount as equivalent to
one that is effected with nearly half the value of the creation unit in the form of cash would yield
data that would not serve the requirement’s purpose.1081
We found this comment persuasive, and we agree with the commenter that it would better
achieve the proposed requirement’s purpose of better understanding different creation unit
requirements, primary market transaction methods, and transaction fees to collect such
information in a manner that obviates the need for the “primarily” distinction about which the
commenter expressed concern. Therefore, in a modification from the proposal, we have
eliminated the proposed distinction between “primarily” in-kind and “primarily” cash
transactions. Instead, as adopted, Form N-CEN will require ETFs to report, based on the dollar
value paid for each creation unit purchased by authorized participants during the reporting
period, (i) the average percentage of that value composed of cash;1082 (ii) the standard deviation
of the percentage of that value composed of cash;1083 (iii) the average percentage of that value
composed of non-cash assets and other positions exchanged on an in-kind basis:1084 and (iv) the
standard deviation of the percentage of that value composed of non-cash assets and other
positions exchanged on an in-kind basis.1085 The ETF will also be required to report, based on
the total dollar value of creation units redeemed by authorized participants during the reporting
period, (i) the average percentage of that value composed of cash;1086 (ii) the standard deviation

standard deviation of the percentage of that value composed of non-cash assets and other
positions exchanged on an in-kind basis.1089 We believe that this modified requirement will
better achieve the purposes of the proposed requirement and address the commenter’s concerns
about the proposed distinction between “primarily” in-kind and “primarily” cash transactions.
To better understand the effects of primary market transaction fees on ETF pricing and
trading and to better inform the public about such fees, we also proposed a requirement that
ETFs report applicable transaction fees—including each of “fixed” and “variable” fees—
applicable to the last creation unit purchased and the last creation unit redeemed during the
reporting period of which some or all of the creation unit was transacted on a cash basis, as well
as the same figures for the last creation unit purchased and the last creation unit redeemed during
the reporting period of which some or all of the creation unit was transacted on an in-kind
basis.1090
As discussed above, one commenter expressed concerns about a potential lack of
uniformity in how ETFs name and calculate transactional fees and suggested that the
Commission provide definitional guidance about the types of fees to be reported in order to
receive accurate and standardized information.1091 Another commenter expressed concerns that

the information the proposed requirement would have yielded—which would have pertained
specifically to the last creation units purchased or redeemed in the reporting period—may not be
representative of the transactions occurring during the period and suggested that an alternative
formulation would be more meaningful and helpful for investors.1092
We find both of these comments persuasive, and consistent with our overarching
objectives of the proposed requirement to collect information that helps data users better
understand the effects of primary market transaction fees on ETF pricing and trading and to
better inform the public about such fees in a manner that is more representative of the ETF’s
activity over the course of the reporting period, while being flexible enough to embrace the range
of activity in the ETF market today and, to the extent practicable, in the future. Therefore, in a
modification from the proposal that we believe will better help us meet these objectives while
also responding to commenters’ concerns, we are requiring reporting of average fees based on
the terms by which they are applied rather than how they are characterized or what purpose they
serve. Thus we have modified the proposed requirement in two respects: First, the terms “fixed
fee” and “variable fee” have been eliminated, and the fees required to be reported have been
specified in a manner that would allow ETFs that today or in the future employ an alternative
transaction fee schedule to report those fees consistent with their actual practice. Second, the
requirement to report as to the last creation unit purchased or redeemed has been replaced with a
requirement to report as to the average creation unit purchased or redeemed during the reporting
period, so that the information reported will better reflect the ETF’s fees over the course of the
reporting period rather than at a specific moment in time. Accordingly, we are adopting a

1092

BlackRock Comment Letter (suggesting instead that a range of fees paid over the reporting period be
required).

286

requirement that, as to creation units purchased by authorized participants during the reporting
period, ETFs report the average transaction fee (i) charged in dollars per creation unit;1093
(ii) charged for one or more creation units on the same business day;1094 and (iii) charged as a
percentage of the value of the creation unit.1095 ETFs will also be required to report, as to only
those creation units purchased by authorized participants that were fully or partially composed of
cash, the average transaction fee (i) charged in dollars per creation unit;1096 (ii) charged for one
or more creation units on the same business day;1097 and (iii) charged as a percentage of the value
of the cash in the creation unit.1098 Finally, as in the proposed requirements, ETFs will be
required to report the parallel information for the redemption of creation units by authorized
participants.1099 We believe that this modified requirement will better achieve the purposes of
the proposed requirement and address the commenters’ concerns about the lack of uniformity in
the naming and calculating of ETF primary market transaction fees as well as the
representativeness of the fees on the last business day of the reporting period.
We also are adopting, as proposed, a requirement for ETFs to report the number of ETF
shares required to form a creation unit as of the last business day of the reporting period,1100
which we believe will also allow the Commission and other data users to better analyze any
effects that ETFs’ creation unit size requirements may have on ETF pricing and trading. One

commenter expressed support for this information, opining that it would be helpful for
investors.1101 In addition to information about authorized participants and creation units, we are
requiring, as proposed, that ETFs, like closed-end funds, report the exchange on which the ETF
is listed so that Commission staff may be better able to quickly gather information as to which
ETFs may be affected should an idiosyncratic risk or market event arise in connection with a
particular exchange.1102 In a modification from the proposal, we are also adopting a requirement
that ETFs provide their ticker symbol. As discussed above, management investment companies
with one or more classes of shares outstanding will be required to provide a ticker symbol, if
any, relating to that class,1103 and as we observed throughout the Proposing Release, identifiers
will assist the Commission with organizing the data received and allow the staff to crossreference the data reported on Form N-CEN with data received from other sources.1104 We have
determined that it is appropriate for ETFs to provide a ticker symbol also, as not all ETFs would
be subject to the ticker symbol requirement for management investment companies.
Finally, with respect to ETFs that are UITs, we are requiring information regarding
whether the index whose performance the fund tracks is constructed by an affiliated person of
the fund and/or exclusively constructed for the fund, as requested by a commenter,1105 and, as
proposed, information regarding tracking difference and tracking error.1106 One commenter
expressed support for the reporting of tracking difference and tracking error, stating that it would

on a monthly basis, rather than on a daily basis, as proposed.1108 The index fund information is
also required of open-end index funds and, for the same reasons discussed above in connection
with those requirements, the form will require this same information of ETFs that are UITs.1109
As discussed above, commenters made similar suggestions about the methodology for
calculating tracking error in the open-end fund index context, and we have determined to adopt
the proposed methodology for the same reasons discussed in connection with the open-end index
fund requirements.1110
f.

Part F — Unit Investment Trusts

As proposed, Part F of Form N-CEN requires information specific to UITs. Like Form
N-SAR, Form N-CEN recognizes that UITs have particular characteristics that warrant questions
targeted specifically to them.1111 The information requested in Part F will inform us further
about the scope and composition of the UIT industry and, thus, will assist us in monitoring the
activities of UITs and our examiners in their preparation for exams of UITs. We did not receive
specific comments on Part F of the form and are adopting it as proposed.
Form N-CEN (similar to Form N-SAR1112) also requires certain identifying information
relating to a UIT’s service providers and entities involved in the formation and governance of

UITs, including its depositor,1113 sponsor,1114 trustee,1115 and administrator.1116 We are also
adopting, as proposed, an item in Form N-CEN that asks whether a UIT is a separate account of
an insurance company,1117 and, depending on a UIT’s response to this item, it will then proceed
to answer certain additional questions in Part F.1118 While Form N-SAR generally does not
differentiate between UITs that are and are not separate accounts of insurance companies, Form
N-CEN makes this distinction. We believe that by distinguishing between these different types
of UITs, the form will allow us to better target the information requests in the form appropriate
to the type of UIT. We also believe this new approach will allow filers to better understand the
information being requested of them because it will be more reflective of their operations and
should thus improve the consistency of the information reported.
As in the proposal and similar to Form N-SAR,1119 a UIT that is not a separate account of
an insurance company will provide the number of series existing at the end of the reporting
period that had securities registered under the Securities Act1120 and, for new series, the number
of series for which registration statements under the Securities Act became effective during the

Item F.6.a of Form N-CEN. As noted earlier, because UITs that register on Form N-8B-2 obtain
CIKs for the UIT itself as well as for series offered by the UIT, we have made a clarifying
modification to Form N-CEN by including a requirement that such UITs report the CIKs for each of
their existing series in response to Item F.6.b of Part F of the form in addition to reporting the CIK for
the UIT itself in response to Item B.1.c. See supra footnote 800.

reporting period1121 and the total value of the portfolio securities on the date of deposit.1122 As
proposed, Form N-CEN also carries over from Form N-SAR1123 requirements relating to the
number of series with a current prospectus,1124 the number of existing series (and total value) for
which additional units were registered under the Securities Act,1125 and the value of units placed
in portfolios of subsequent series.1126 We are also adopting, as proposed, a requirement in Form
N-CEN that a UIT that is not a separate account of an insurance company provide the total assets
of all series combined as of the reporting period,1127 which is also currently required by Form
N-SAR.1128
We are also adopting, as proposed, new requirements in Form N-CEN for separate
accounts offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. Specifically, if the UIT
is a separate account of an insurance company, Form N-CEN requires reporting of its series
identification number1129 and, for each security that has a contract identification number assigned
pursuant to rule 313 of Regulation S-T, the number of individual contracts that are in force at the
end of the reporting period.1130

With respect to insurance company separate accounts, we are also adopting, as proposed,
new requirements in Form N-CEN to identify and provide census information for each security
issued through the separate account. These requirements will include the name of the
security,1131 contract identification number,1132 total assets attributable to the security,1133 number
of contracts sold,1134 gross premiums received,1135 and amount of contract value redeemed.1136
This item also requires additional information relating to section 1035 exchanges, including
gross premiums received pursuant to section 1035 exchanges,1137 number of contracts affected in
connection with such premiums,1138 amount of contract value redeemed pursuant to section 1035
redemptions1139 and the number of contracts affected by such redemptions.1140 In addition, as
proposed, insurance company separate accounts will be required to provide information on
whether they relied on rules 6c-71141 and 11a-21142 under the Investment Company Act. This
information, which is specific to UITs that are separate accounts of insurance companies and is

assist the Commission in its oversight of UITs, including monitoring trends in the variable
annuity and variable life insurance markets.
Finally, as proposed, Form N-CEN carries over the Form N-SAR1143 requirement that a
UIT provide certain information relating to divestments under section 13(c) of the Investment
Company Act.1144 Thus, if a UIT intends to avail itself of the safe harbor provided by section
13(c) with respect to its divestment of certain securities, it will continue to make the following
disclosures on Form N-CEN: identifying information for the issuer, total number of shares or
principal amount divested, date that the securities were divested, and the name of the statute that
added the provisions of section 13(c) in accordance with which the securities were divested.1145
If the UIT holds any securities of the issuer on the date of the filing, it will also provide the ticker
symbol, CUSIP number, and total number of shares or, for debt securities, the principal amount
held on the date of the filing.1146

1143

Item 133 of Form N-SAR. Section 13(c) of the Investment Company Act provides a safe harbor for a
registered investment company and its employees, officers, directors and investment advisers, based
solely upon the investment company divesting from, or avoiding investing in, securities issued by
persons that the investment company determines, using credible information that is available to the
public, engage in certain investment activities in Iran or Sudan. The safe harbor, however, provides
that this limitation on actions does not apply unless the investment company makes disclosures about
the divestments in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission. See 15 U.S.C. 80a13(c)(2)(B). Management investment companies are required to provide the disclosure on Form
N-CSR, pursuant to Item 6(b) of the form, and UITs are required to provide the disclosure on Form
N-SAR, pursuant to Item 133 of the form. See Technical Amendments to Forms N-CSR and N-SAR

Part G — Attachments

Like Form N-SAR,1147 Form N-CEN requires, substantially as proposed, certain
attachments to reports filed on the form in order to provide the staff with more granular
information regarding certain key issues.1148 Due to the narrative format of the information
required, these attachments will not be required to be reported in a structured data format.
Where possible, we eliminated the need to file attachments with the census reporting form in
order to simplify the filing process and maximize the amount of information we receive in a
structured format.1149 Accordingly, we believe we have limited the number of attachments to the
form to those that are most useful to the staff, either because of investor protection issues or
because the information is not available elsewhere. Moreover, all except one of the attachments
to Form N-CEN are current requirements in Form N-SAR.1150
Thus, as proposed, all funds are required, where applicable, to file attachments regarding
legal proceedings,1151 provision of financial support,1152 independent public accountant’s report

1147

See Item 77.E, Item 77.I, Item 77.K, Item 77.L, Item 77.N, Item 77.P, Item 77.Q.1, Item 77.Q.2, Item
102.D, Item 102.H, Item 102.J, Item 102.K, Item 102.M, Item 102.O, Item 102.P.1, Item 102.P.2, and
Item 102.P.3 of Form N-SAR.

1148

Form N-SAR requires only management companies to file attachments to reports on the form,
whereas Form N-CEN requires certain attachments for all Registrants.

1149

With respect to certain attachments currently in Form N-SAR, we are integrating the data
requirements into the form itself, rather than keep the attachment requirements. See, e.g., Item 77.G
and Item 102.F of Form N-SAR; Item D.5 (default on long-term debt) and Item D.6 (dividends in
arrears) of Form N-CEN. However, not all of the attachments currently required by Form N-SAR
lend themselves to integration into the form, either because of the amount of information reported in
the attachment or because the attachment is a standalone document (e.g., the accountant’s report on
internal control).

1152

Item G.1.a.ii of Form N-CEN.

on internal control,1153 and changes in accounting principles and practices, where applicable.1154
Unlike the proposal, however, the registrant will not be required under the form to file an
attachment related to changes in the fund’s independent public accountant (i.e., information
called for by Item 4 of Form 8-K under the Exchange Act). As previously discussed in section
II.D.4.b above, this change was made in response to comments.1155
In addition, as in the proposal, all funds will be required, where applicable, to provide
attachments relating to information required to be filed pursuant to exemptive orders issued by
the Commission and relied on by the registrant,1156 and other information required to be included
as an attachment pursuant to Commission rules and regulations.1157 Moreover, we are adopting,
as proposed, requirements for closed-end funds and SBICs to provide attachments, where
applicable, relating to material amendments to organizational documents,1158 instruments
defining the rights of the holders of any new or amended class of securities,1159 new or amended
investment advisory contracts,1160 information called for by Item 405 of Regulation S-K,1161 and,

1153

Item G.1.a.iii of Form N-CEN. As noted in Item G.1.a.iii, this item will only apply to management
companies other than SBICs.

1158

Item G.1.b.i of Form N-CEN. Unlike open-end funds, closed-end funds and SBICs do not otherwise

information should continue to be filed as an attachment to the census reporting form.

Item G.1.b.iii of Form N-CEN. Unlike open-end funds, closed-end funds and SBICs do not otherwise

1161

Item G.1.b.iv of Form N-CEN.

295

for SBICs only, senior officer codes of ethics.1162 As proposed, each attachment required by
Form N-CEN includes instructions describing the information that should be provided in the
attachment.1163
As noted earlier, all of the attachments required by Form N-CEN, except one, are
currently required by Form N-SAR.1164 The new attachment relates to the provision of financial
support and will be filed by a fund (other than a money market fund) if an affiliate, promoter or
principal underwriter of the fund, or affiliate of such person, provided financial support to the
fund during the reporting period.1165 As discussed in section II.D.4.b, we are adopting this
requirement, as proposed, and including it in Form N-CEN because we believe that it is
important that the Commission understand the nature and extent to which a fund’s sponsor
provides financial support to a fund.
5.

Items Required by Form N-SAR That Will be Eliminated by Form N-CEN

As we discussed above and in the Proposing Release, with Form N-CEN, we seek to
modernize and improve the information that we collect in order to reflect changes in the fund
industry since Form N-SAR’s adoption in 1985. Accordingly, and substantially as proposed, we
are not carrying forward certain items in Form N-SAR to Form N-CEN that we believe are no
longer needed by Commission staff or are outdated in their current form. For example, in Form
N-CEN, we are not including Form N-SAR’s requirement relating to considerations which

1162

Item G.1.b.v of Form N-CEN.

1163

For example, the instructions to Item G.1.b.v require SBICs to attach detailed information regarding
the senior officer code of ethics and certain information regarding the audit committee. The
instructions also require SBICs to meet certain requirements regarding the availability of their senior
office code of ethics.

1164

See supra footnote 1150 and accompanying text.

1165

Item G.1.a.ii of Form N-CEN.

296

affected the participation of brokers or dealers or other entities in commissions or other
compensation paid on portfolio transactions.1166 Many commenters agreed that Form N-SAR is
outdated and commended the Commission’s efforts to improve the relevance of information
reported to the Commission.1167 Where we have received comments on specific reporting
requirements, we discuss them in more detail below.
As proposed, Form N-CEN eliminates a number of Form N-SAR items where the
information is (or will be) reported elsewhere—for example, items relating to fees and expenses,
including front-end and deferred/contingent sales loads, redemption and account maintenance
fees, rule 12b-1 fees, and advisory fees.1168 Many of the fee and expense items required by Form
N-SAR are already reported, in a structured format, in the risk-return summary required by Form
N-1A for open-end funds, as well as in an unstructured format in other places in fund registration
statements.1169 For other fee and expense items, the information is either not frequently used by
Commission staff or we believe that the benefit of having such information is minimal while the
burden to funds of reporting such information is costly.1170 For similar reasons as above, we are

1166

Item 26 of Form N-SAR. Form N-CEN does, however, contain information relating to funds that
paid commissions to brokers and dealers for research services. See Item C.18 of Form N-CEN.

1167

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I; Invesco Comment Letter; BlackRock
Comment Letter.

1168

See generally Items 29–44 and Items 47–52 of Form N-SAR. Form N-CEN does, however, contain
an item relating to expense limitations, reductions, and waivers. See Item C.8 of Form N-CEN. As
discussed above, Form N-CEN also requires information on management fees and net operating
expenses for closed-end funds, as that information is not available elsewhere in a structured format.
See Item D.8 and Item D.9 of Form N-CEN; see also supra section II.D.4.d.

1169

See General Instruction C.3.G to Form N-1A; see generally Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-4, Form
N-5, and Form N-6.

1170

We acknowledge that some of the information reported in reports on Form N-SAR related to loads
paid to captive or unaffiliated broker-dealers has been used by interested third-parties, including
researchers. See, e.g., Susan E. K. Christoffersen, Richard Evans, & David K. Musto, What do
Consumers’ Fund Flows Maximize? Evidence from Their Brokers’ Incentives, J. OF FIN., Vol. 68(1),
201-235 (2013) (“Christoffersen Journal Article”). While this is evidence of a discrete instance

297

also not requiring other information in Form N-CEN, including information relating to
adjustments to shares outstanding by stock split or stock dividend, minimum initial investments,
investment practices, portfolio turnover, number of shares outstanding, number of shareholder
accounts, and certain other condensed balance sheet data items.1171
One commenter requested that the Commission include certain information required on
Form N-SAR that was proposed to be eliminated in Form N-CEN.1172 That commenter, for
example, suggested that certain fee and expense information currently available semi-annually
on Form N-SAR (e.g., Items 34–44, 47–52, 54, 72, and 75) should carry over into Form N-CEN.
As discussed above, we find the commenter’s concerns persuasive with respect to Item 75 of
Form N-SAR and have added a reporting requirement in Form N-CEN that (1) funds other than
money market funds provide the fund’s monthly average net assets during the reporting period,
and (2) money market funds provide the fund’s daily average net assets during the reporting
period.1173 Otherwise, we continue to believe that Form N-CEN strikes an appropriate balance
between the current information needs of Commission staff as well as the developments in the
fund industry and the reduction of reporting burdens for registrants where information may be
similarly disclosed or reported elsewhere.
We are also eliminating, as proposed, certain information requirements specifically
relating to SBICs and UITs that we no longer believe are necessary to collect on a census form
where such information has been useful to a third party, based on staff experience with this
information and Form N-SAR information generally, we believe that no longer requiring funds to
gather and report this information appropriately balances the burden on funds of providing this
information and the overall utility of the information to the Commission, investors and third parties.
1171

See generally Item 57, Item 61, and Items 70–74 of Form N-SAR.

1172

See Morningstar Comment Letter.

1173

See discussion at supra footnotes 1016–1021 and accompanying text (discussing Item C.19 of Form
N-CEN.

298

because, much like the items discussed above, the benefit of having such information is minimal
to the Commission’s oversight and examination functions while the burdens to these funds of
reporting such information is costly.1174 Additionally, with respect to the Form N-SAR item
relating to closed-end fund monthly sales and repurchases of shares,1175 this information will be
reported on Form N-PORT,1176 rather than Form N-CEN.
The full list of items from Form N-SAR that will be included in Form N-CEN or
eliminated is included in Figure 2 below.

Option for Website Transmission of Shareholder Reports

The Commission proposed new rule 30e-3 under the Investment Company Act, which
would have permitted a fund to satisfy requirements under the Act and rules thereunder to
transmit reports to shareholders if the fund made the reports and certain other materials
accessible on a website. Reliance on the rule would have been subject to certain conditions,
including conditions relating to (1) the availability of the shareholder report and other required
information; (2) implied shareholder consent; (3) notice to shareholders of the availability of
shareholder reports; and (4) shareholder ability to request paper copies of the shareholder report
or other required information. The proposed option was intended to modernize the manner in
which periodic information is transmitted to shareholders. When we proposed the rule, we stated

309

that we believed it would improve the information’s overall accessibility while reducing burdens
such as printing and mailing costs that are borne by funds and, ultimately, by fund
shareholders.1177
Proposed rule 30e-3 generated substantial public comment, with over 900 commenters
expressing views on the rule. Comments received on the proposal were mixed. Many
commenters expressed support for the proposed rule, citing, for example, positive internet access
and use trends, consistency with the preferences of many investors, intra- and inter-agency
regulatory consistency benefits, and anticipated reduction in printing and mailing expenses for
funds and their shareholders.1178 However, many other commenters expressed concerns with the
proposed rule, arguing, for example, that the proposed rule would have potential adverse effects
on investor readership of shareholder reports generally and on certain demographic groups in
particular.1179 Commenters also disagreed about the size and distribution of printing and mailing

investors who purchase shares through intermediaries.1180
While the Commission plans to continue to consider how to promote electronic
transmission to those who might prefer it, the comments discussed above raised issues with
respect to this proposal that merit further consideration. We have, therefore, determined not to
adopt proposed rule 30e-3 at this time.

Amendments to Forms Regarding Securities Lending Activities

We are also adopting form amendments that require a management investment company
to disclose in its registration statement (or, in the case of a closed-end fund, its reports on Form
N-CSR) certain disclosures regarding securities lending activities.1181 We proposed similar
requirements as part of the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X, including disclosure in the
fund’s financial statements of (1) the gross income from securities lending, including income
from cash collateral reinvestment; (2) the dollar amount of all fees and/or compensation paid by
the fund for securities lending activities and related services, including borrower rebates and cash
collateral management services; (3) the net income from securities lending activities; (4) the
terms governing the compensation of the securities lending agent, including any revenue sharing
split, with the related percentage split between the fund and the securities lending agent, and/or
any fee-for-service, and a description of services included; (5) the details of any other fees paid
directly or indirectly, including any fees paid directly by the fund for cash collateral management

See, e.g., Broadridge Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter.

1181

See Item 19(i) of Form N-1A; Item 21(j) of Form N-3; Item 12 of Form N-CSR. Because closed-end
funds do not offer their shares continuously, and are therefore generally not required to maintain an
updated Statement of Additional Information to meet their obligations under the Securities Act, we
are requiring closed-end funds to disclose their securities lending activities information annually on
Form N-CSR.

and any management fee deducted from a pooled investment vehicle in which cash collateral is
invested; and (6) the monthly average of the value of portfolio securities on loan.1182 We
proposed these disclosures in order to allow investors to better understand the income generated
from, as well as the expenses associated with, a fund’s securities lending activities.1183
We received a number of comments addressing our proposed securities lending
disclosures. Comments on the proposed disclosure requirements were mixed. Most of the
commenters who addressed the issue expressed support for requiring disclosure of securities
lending income and fees, although some specifically opposed or expressed concerns about the
proposed requirement to disclose the terms governing the compensation of the securities lending
agent.1184 Some commenters expressed opposition generally to the public nature of the proposed

agent other than for related parties); BlackRock Comment Letter (stating that “investor protection is
well served by a level playing field that allows investors to make informed choices on a risk adjusted
basis” and that uniform and clear information requirements associated with securities lending
activities will empower mutual fund directors to more effectively evaluate and compare securities
lending services); Deloitte Comment Letter (opposing required financial statement disclosure of
indirect fees); Fidelity Comment Letter (expressing support for enabling investors to better
understand the income generated from securities lending activity and all proposed disclosures except
for fee split with a third-party lending agent); ICI Comment Letter (expressing support for the
proposed requirements except the required public disclosure of the terms governing the compensation

for borrower rebates and recommending requirements for actual income and fees paid rather than
contractual terms); cf. BlackRock Directors Comment Letter (stating, in the context of proposed Form
N-CEN requirements, that “[i]mproved transparency as to the economic terms in the market for

new disclosure requirements concerning fund securities lending activities.1185 Some commenters
also expressed particular concerns relating to the location of the required disclosure in the fund’s
financial statements.1186
We continue to believe that because net earnings from securities lending can contribute to
the investment performance of a fund, investors and others would benefit from the additional
transparency into the impact of securities lending fees on the income from these activities and
further believe that the benefits of this additional transparency justify the potential unintended
consequences, highlighted by commenters and discussed below, of public disclosure of certain
information. We have, however, made certain modifications to the proposed requirements in an
effort to mitigate some of these potential consequences.1187 As discussed in greater detail below,
these modifications include, for example, replacing the proposed requirement that funds disclose
the terms governing the compensation of the securities lending agent—including any revenue
split—with a requirement to report actual fees paid during the fund’s prior fiscal year, because
commenters persuaded us that backward-looking dollar-based requirements would yield clearer
disclosure than would the proposed requirements and may also enhance disclosure comparability
across funds for investors and reduce preparation complexity for funds.

Determination to Adopt Requirements as Amendments to Registration
Statement and Annual Report Forms

As proposed, certain disclosures relating to securities lending activities, including income
and expenses, would have been required to be included in a fund’s financial statements.1188
However, we sought public comment on whether the proposed or similar disclosures should
instead be provided as part of other disclosure documents such as the Statement of Additional
Information.1189 In response, some commenters raised concerns about including this information
in the fund’s financial statements, including concerns about cost and that lengthy disclosure
concerning securities lending activity in a fund’s financial statements could detract from other
financial statement disclosures.1190 After consideration of these issues raised by commenters, we
have determined that it is appropriate to require funds to include these disclosures in their
Statements of Additional Information (or, for closed-end funds, in their reports on Form N-CSR),
rather than to require their inclusion in fund financial statements. Therefore, we are adopting
these disclosure requirements as amendments to the fund registration forms (viz., Forms N-1A
and N-3) and reports on Form N-CSR (for closed-end funds only), rather than as amendments to
Regulation S-X.1191

that could detract from other material information presented in the financial statements” and
recommending that “the Commission use other reporting mechanisms more suited for that purpose”).

Requirement to Disclose Securities Lending Income, Expenses, and Services

As discussed in detail below, the final rules will require funds to disclose gross and net
income from securities lending activities, fees and compensation in total and broken out by
enumerated types, and a description of the services provided to the fund by the securities lending
agent. We proposed to require disclosure of gross income from securities lending, including
income from cash collateral reinvestment;1192 the dollar amount of fees and compensation paid
by the fund for securities lending activities and related services, including borrower rebates and
payments for cash collateral management services;1193 the net income from securities lending
activities;1194 the details of any other fees paid directly or indirectly, including any fees paid
directly by the fund for cash collateral management and any management fee deducted from a
pooled investment vehicle in which cash collateral is invested;1195 and the terms governing the
compensation of the securities lending agent, including any revenue sharing split, with the
related percentage split between the fund and the securities lending agent, and/or any fee for
service and a description of services included.1196 After consideration of issues raised by
commenters, we are generally adopting the substance of the proposed fee disclosure
requirements but are requiring funds to make these disclosures in their Statements of Additional
Information (or, in the case of a closed-end fund, Form N-CSR) rather than as part of their
financial statements (as proposed). We are amending the Statement of Additional Information
requirements in Forms N-1A and N-3, and Form N-CSR (for closed-end funds) to require funds

Table 1
The modifications from the proposed requirements are designed to, among other things,
enhance comparability of the disclosed information and potentially ameliorate some concerns
commenters expressed about the proposed required public disclosure of the terms governing
compensation of the securities lending agent. Several commenters expressed concern that the
proposed disclosure requirements could yield information that would suggest, inaptly, that fees
and expenses related to securities lending activities among funds are readily compared and

1197

contrasted.1198 Specifically, one commenter highlighted that information provided under the
proposed requirements might not be comparable due to the subjectivity of related inputs and
assumptions.1199 Another commenter, however, suggested that we could facilitate comparability
by specifying the fees for particular services that must be disclosed.1200 We have considered
these commenters’ views and suggestions and have been persuaded to specify in the final rules
which specific fees should be disclosed and what those fees should include rather than requiring,
as proposed, disclosure of all fees and/or compensation paid for securities lending and related
services without specifying which fees should be disclosed.1201 We believe that these
modifications will enhance comparability of the disclosed fees and compensation. The list of
specific fees we are enumerating has been adapted from the list of securities lending payments
about which reporting will be required by Form N-CEN, which, as discussed above, we are
adopting as proposed.1202 We have determined that, in specifying the specific categories of fees
that are required to be disclosed, it is appropriate to adapt the list of fees from proposed Form
N-CEN because consistency between the two lists will allow for better comparability of

reinvestment vehicle—that are not included in the revenue split; administrative fees that are not
included in the revenue split; fees for indemnification that are not included in the revenue split;

information from reports on Form N-CEN and disclosures in funds’ Statements of Additional
Information and, with respect to closed-end funds, reports on Form N-CSR.
The comparability of the disclosed fee and expense information may also depend on the
nature of the services provided to a particular fund in connection with its securities lending
activities. To that end, we proposed a disclosure requirement for a description of services
included in the fund’s arrangement with its securities lending agent.1203 One commenter
suggested robust disclosure of the services provided by the securities lending agent and provided
several examples of the types of services that should be disclosed to improve comparability.1204
The commenter stated that it had observed a lack of uniformity in the package of services
performed by securities lending agents, which can hinder understanding of securities lending
fees.1205 We agree with the commenter that enhanced and more comparable disclosure of
services provided can help users of the information to better understand the particular services
provided by securities lending agents for the aggregate fees they were paid over the reporting
period. Accordingly, to further enhance the comparability of the disclosed information and
allow users to better assess fee and expense information, we have determined to specify that this
information should be provided on the basis of the services actually provided to the fund in its
most recent fiscal year. Some examples of the types of services that could be enumerated
include, as applicable, locating borrowers, monitoring daily the value of the loaned securities and
collateral, requiring additional collateral as necessary, cash collateral management, qualified
dividend management, negotiation of loan terms, selection of securities to be loaned,

recordkeeping and account servicing, monitoring dividend activity and material proxy votes
relating to loaned securities, and arranging for return of loaned securities to the fund at loan
termination.1206
Another commenter expressed concerns that the proposed fee and expense information
could be used to evaluate the terms of a fund’s lending arrangements and could, without access
to additional information, result in potentially inappropriate conclusions that a fund negotiated its
arrangements poorly or was otherwise disadvantaged in its negotiations.1207 That commenter
noted that the revenue split can depend on numerous factors, including the range, amount, and
attractiveness of the securities a fund complex as a whole may make available for loan.1208 Two
commenters suggested eliminating the proposed requirement for disclosure of borrower rebates,
reasoning that they are primarily a function of prevailing short-term interest rates.1209 However,
we continue to believe that it is appropriate to require disclosure of borrower rebates, because,
irrespective of how they may be determined in particular cases, they are nonetheless an expense
of securities lending. One commenter argued that a fund board wishing to evaluate the fund’s
securities lending program would have access to more detailed analyses than could be practically
included in the fund’s financial statements.1210 Conversely, another commenter stated that
uniform and clear information requirements would have the benefit of empowering more

effective evaluation and comparison of securities lending services.1211 While, as commenters
suggested, a thorough evaluation of a fund’s securities lending activities, such as an evaluation
by that fund’s board, may appropriately include information beyond the scope of the disclosure
requirements we are adopting today, we believe that these new requirements will nonetheless
enhance comparability and allow investors to better understand the expenses associated with
securities lending activities. We also note that today’s amendments are not meant to
circumscribe the factors to be rightfully considered in such an evaluation.
Commenters also expressed concerns with the proposed requirements based on the
currently nonpublic character of some of the information that would be required to be disclosed
publicly, particularly the proposed requirement to disclose the terms governing compensation of
the securities lending agent.1212 Commenters argued that some funds currently enjoy privately
negotiated competitive advantages with securities lending services or counterparties that could
be jeopardized should their arrangements with their securities lending agents be made public.1213
We continue to believe, however, that the required fee information will allow investors to better
understand the expenses associated with securities lending activities and have therefore
determined to adopt these modified disclosure requirements with modifications to address
commenters’ concerns. We believe that the modifications to the proposed requirements that we
are making today eliminate the disclosures from the proposed requirements that some

commenters indicated could be the most sensitive—specifically, the terms of the revenue split
and the terms governing the compensation of the securities lending agent more generally—while
retaining the required information that we think will be most useful to investors in understanding
the expenses associated with fund securities lending activities.
In particular, some commenters suggested that, rather than requiring disclosure of the
terms governing the compensation of the securities lending agent, as we proposed,1214 we
consider instead requiring disclosure of backward-looking actual compensation levels.1215 One
of these commenters argued that, because there are a variety of fee arrangements in the
marketplace, such an alternative disclosure requirement may provide a clearer, more concise
view of each party’s compensation.1216 We have been persuaded by these commenters’
suggestions that backward-looking dollar-based requirements would yield clearer disclosure than
would the proposed requirements and may also enhance disclosure comparability across funds
for investors and reduce preparation complexity for funds and thus have modified the
requirements accordingly.1217 This dollar-based requirement would also eliminate the
requirement that potentially sensitive negotiated contractual terms be disclosed, while
nonetheless allowing investors to better understand the expenses associated with securities
lending activities. A commenter also counseled against placing undue emphasis on the securities
lending agent’s revenue split at the expense of other securities lending fees and expenses,1218 and

1214

321

we believe that the schedule of fees and expenses we are requiring to be disclosed places an
appropriate level of emphasis on that figure situated among the other required fee and expense
disclosures.1219
We also proposed to require disclosure of gross income from securities lending, including
income from cash collateral reinvestment,1220 as well as net income.1221 We did not receive
comments specific to these proposed requirements. We are adopting the proposed requirement
to disclose gross income from securities lending activities. Moreover, as further clarification
about the types of income that could be included in this total, we note that—in addition to
income from cash collateral reinvestment—disclosed gross income may also include negative
rebates (i.e., those paid by the borrower to the lender), loan fees paid by borrowers when
collateral is noncash, management fees from a pooled cash collateral reinvestment vehicle that
are deducted from the vehicle’s assets before income is distributed, and any other income.1222
We are adopting the proposed requirement to disclose net income and clarifying that the reported
figure should be equal to the difference between gross income and aggregate
fees/compensation.1223

Item 19(i)(1)(i) of Form N-1A; ; Item 21(j)(i)(A) of Form N-3 (same); Item 12(a)(1) of Form N-CSR.
Gross income for purposes of this disclosure generally should include indirect fees paid for cash
collateral management services—i.e., management services provided to a pooled investment vehicle
in which cash collateral is invested. Those fees are indirect because they are taken from the pooled
assets before any income is distributed to the lending fund. In order for the net income disclosure
from securities lending to sum to the net income for securities lending reported at period end, we
believe that indirect fees for cash collateral management generally should be added to the gross
income from securities lending in the Statement of Additional Information or, with respect to closedend funds, in reports on Form N-CSR.

Required Disclosures of Monthly Average Value on Loan

We also proposed to require disclosure of the monthly average of the value of portfolio
securities on loan.1224 As discussed above, we have determined to adopt a similar requirement in
Form N-CEN where it will be available in a structured data format and are not including it in the
amendments to Forms N-1A, N-3, and N-CSR.1225
G.

Technical and Conforming Amendments

As proposed, we are also adopting technical and conforming amendments to various rules
and forms. As discussed above, we are rescinding Form N-Q and adopting new Form N-PORT.
In order to implement this change, we are revising Forms N-1A, N-2, and N-3 to refer to the
availability of portfolio holdings schedules attached to reports on Form N-PORT and posted on
fund websites rather than on reports on Form N-Q.1226 In addition, we are rescinding 17 CFR
249.332 and revising the following rules to remove references to Form N-Q: 17 CFR 232.401,
17 CFR 270.8b-33, 17 CFR 270.30a-2, 17 CFR 270.30a-3, and 17 CFR 270.30d-1.
We are also rescinding Form N-SAR and replacing it with new Form N-CEN. In order to
implement this change, we are revising the following rules and sections to remove references to
Form N-SAR and replacing them with references to Form N-CEN: 17 CFR 232.301, 17 CFR
240.10A-1, 17 CFR 240.12b-25, 17 CFR 249.322, 17 CFR 249.330, 17 CFR 270.8b-16,
270.30d-1, 17 CFR 274.101, and Form N-8F.1227

to Item 19(e)(ii) of Form N-3.

1227

Although we are deleting references to Form N-SAR in 17 CFR 232.301, we are not replacing them
with references to Form N-CEN because the references in that section relate to specific portions of
the EDGAR Filer Manual that would not be relevant to Form N-CEN.

323

Currently, reports on Form N-SAR are filed semi-annually by management investment
companies as required by 17 CFR 270.30b1-1, and annually by UITs as required by 17 CFR
270.30a-1. Because we are requiring reports on Form N-CEN to be filed annually by all
registered investment companies, we are rescinding 17 CFR 270.30b1-1 and revising 17 CFR
270.30a-1 to require all registered investment companies to file reports on Form N-CEN. We are
also revising the following rules to remove references to 17 CFR 270.30b1-1 and add references
to revised rule 17 CFR 270.30a-1: 17 CFR 240.13a-10, 17 CFR 240.13a-11, 17 CFR 240.13a-13,
17 CFR 240.13a-16, 17 CFR 240.15d-10, 17 CFR 240.15d-11, 17 CFR 240.15d-13, and 17 CFR
240.15d-16.
In addition, as a result of the proposed new annual reporting requirement that would
apply to all registered investment companies, we are rescinding 17 CFR 270.30b1-2—which
currently permits wholly-owned management investment company subsidiaries of management
investment companies to not file Form N-SAR under certain circumstances—and adopting new
rule 17 CFR 270.30a-4—which will permit wholly-owned management investment company
subsidiaries of management investment companies to not file Form N-CEN under those same
circumstances. We are also amending 17 CFR 200.800 to display control numbers assigned to
information collection requirements for Forms N-PORT and N-CEN by the Office of
Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act. As discussed further below,
an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.1228

1228

See infra section IV.

324

Our amendments to Regulation S-X will, among other things, require management
investment companies to report new schedules for certain derivatives holdings.1229 To
implement these changes, we are renumbering the sections for schedules required to be reported
by management investment companies and renumbering the list of schedules provided in 17 CFR
210.6-10, which outlines the schedules to be reported by investment companies.1230 We are also
adopting conforming changes to references to Regulation S-X in the following forms: Form N1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, and Form N-14.1231
We are also amending Form N-CSR to revise instructions addressing how disclosures and
certifications as to the effectiveness and changes in the registrant’s internal control over financial
reporting should be handled during the transition period when certifications for funds’ portfolio
holdings for their first and third fiscal quarters will no longer be provided on Form N-Q but
instead will provided on Form N-CSR.1232 In the Proposing Release we proposed deleting these
instructions, but we are revising the instructions to clarify how these disclosures and
1229

Our amendments require new schedules to be filed to report open futures contracts, open forward
foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts. See new rules 12-13A–C of Regulation S-X.

1230

Among other things, our amendments will renumber the CFR sections for open option contracts and
the summary schedule of investments in unaffiliated issuers from 17 CFR 210.12-12B and 17 CFR
210.12-12C to 17 CFR 210.12-13 and 17 CFR 210.12-B, respectively. These amendments group the
schedule for open option contracts written together with the new schedules for open futures contracts,
open forward foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts, and list the summary schedule
sequentially after the investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers. We are also amending 17 CFR
210.6-10 to, among other things, add new schedules V, VI, and VII for open futures contracts, open
forward foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts, respectively, and renumber schedule II
for investments other than securities and schedule VI for summary of investments in securities of
unaffiliated issuers as schedules VIII and IX, respectively. See amended rule 6-10 of Regulation S-X
(listing the schedules required to be filed by management investment companies, UITs, and faceamount certificate companies).

1231

See Item 27(b)(1) of Form N-1A (reference to schedule VI changed to schedule IX and reference to
schedule I are corrected to cite to the appropriate CFR section); Instruction 7 to Item 24 of Form N-2
(we are updating references to schedule VI); Instruction 7(i) and (ii) to Item 28(a) of Form N-3 (we
are updating references to schedule VI).

1232

Item 11 and Item 12 of Form N-CSR.

certifications shall be handled with regards to smaller entities as opposed to larger entities during
the transition period.
We are also removing and reserving paragraph (a) of 17 CFR 232.105, which currently
requires electronic filers to submit Forms N-SAR and 13F in ASCII. We are rescinding Form NSAR, and Form 13F has been submitted by electronic filers in XML, rather than ASCII, since
2013.1233 Although we also proposed to revise the section heading of 17 CFR 232.105 and
redesignate paragraphs (b) and (c) as (a) and (b), respectively, upon further consideration we
believe those changes are unnecessary at this time.
We received no comments on these technical and conforming amendments, and are
adopting them substantially as proposed, as discussed herein.
H.

Compliance Dates

We are adopting the following compliance dates for our amendments, as set forth below.
1.

Form N-PORT, Rescission of Form N-Q, and Amendments to the
Certification Requirements of Form N-CSR

As proposed, given the nature and frequency of filings on Form N-PORT, the
Commission is providing a tiered set of compliance dates based on asset size. Specifically, for
larger entities—namely, funds that together with other investment companies in the same “group
of related investment companies”1234 have net assets of $1 billion or more as of the end of the

1233

See SEC, Announcement: Notice to EDGAR Form 13F Filers (Mar. 29, 2013), available at
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/imannouncements/notice-form-13f-im.htm (requiring funds
to file Form 13F according to EDGAR XML Technical Specifications beginning on April 29, 2013).

1234

For these purposes, the threshold is based on the definition of “group of related investment
companies,” as such term is defined in rule 0-10 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.010]. Rule 0-10 defines the term as “two or more management companies (including series thereof)
that: (i) Hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and
investor services; and (ii) Either: (A) Have a common investment adviser or have investment
advisers that are affiliated persons of each other; or (B) Have a common administrator; and […] In
the case of a unit investment trust, the term group of related investment companies shall mean two or

326

most recent fiscal year of the fund—we are adopting a compliance date of June 1, 2018. This
will result in larger funds filing their first reports on Form N-PORT, reflecting data as of June
30, no later than July 30, and will provide those funds with a compliance period of at least 18
months, consistent with our proposal. For these entities, we expect that this period of time will
provide an adequate period of time for funds, intermediaries, and other service providers to
conduct the requisite operational changes to their systems and to establish internal processes to
prepare, validate, and file reports on new Form N-PORT with the Commission.1235
For smaller entities (i.e., funds that together with other investment companies in the same
“group of related investment companies” have net assets of less than $1 billion as of the end of
the most recent fiscal year of the fund),1236 the compliance date will be June 1, 2019. This will
provide smaller entities an extra 12 months, as proposed, to comply with the new reporting
requirements. We believe that smaller groups will benefit from this extra time to comply with
the filing requirements for Form N-PORT and will potentially benefit from the lessons learned

more unit investment trusts (including series thereof) that have a common sponsor.” We believe that
this broad definition will encompass most types of fund complexes and therefore is an appropriate
definition for compliance date purposes.
1235

We believe that this compliance period for larger groups of investment companies is an adequate
amount of time for funds to implement new Form N-PORT and make the necessary system and
operational changes. We adopted a nine month compliance period when we first required money
market funds to report their portfolio holdings to the Commission on a monthly basis on Form NMFP. Based upon our Form N-MFP compliance experience, and the larger number of non-money
market fund filers, we believe that doubling the Form N-MFP compliance period to eighteen months
for filing reports on Forms N-PORT is appropriate. See Money Market Fund Reform 2010 Release,
supra footnote 447, at 10087.

1236

Based on staff analysis of data obtained from Morningstar Direct, as of June 30, 2016, we estimate
that a $1 billion assets threshold would provide an extended compliance period to more than 67% of
fund groups, but only 0.6% of all fund assets. We therefore believe that the $1 billion threshold will
appropriately balance the need to provide smaller groups of investment companies with more time to
prepare for the initial filing of reports on Form N-PORT, while still including the vast majority of
fund assets in the initial compliance period.

327

by larger investment companies and groups of investment companies during the adoption period
for Form N-PORT.
In the Proposing Release, we stated that we intended to rescind Form N-Q and require
implementation of the amendments to the certification requirements of Form N-CSR within a
timing that would be consistent with this adoption. We received no comments on this aspect of
the proposal. Therefore, consistent with the timing for the implementation of reporting
requirements for Form N-PORT, we are also rescinding Form N-Q (referenced in 17 CFR
274.130) and implementing the amendments to the certification requirements of Form N-CSR
(referenced in 17 CFR 274.128) with approximately the same time frame. However, we are
delaying the rescission of Form N-Q by two additional months to allow funds sufficient time to
satisfy Form N-Q’s 60-day filing requirements with regard to their final filing on Form N-Q for
the reporting period preceding their first filing on Form N-PORT. Thus, the compliance dates
for the amendments to the certification requirements of Form N-CSR will be June 1, 2018 for
larger entities, and June 1, 2019 (12 months later) for smaller entities. Form N-Q and related
rules referencing Form N-Q will be rescinded two months later, on August 1, 2019. In addition,
as discussed below, the compliance date for reporting a change in independent public accountant
on Form N-CSR will be consistent with the compliance date for other information reported on
Form N-CEN.1237
We understand that certain changes to issuers’ and market participants’ systems may not
be able to occur until the final technical requirements are published in the EDGAR Filer Manual
and EDGAR Technical Specifications documents. In order to provide issuers and other filers
time to make adjustments to their systems, we anticipate making a draft of the EDGAR
1237

See infra section II.H.2.

328

Technical Specifications documents available in advance. We believe that test submissions may
assist both the Commission and issuers with addressing unknown and unforeseeable issues that
may arise with the reporting of information on Form N-PORT. We will permit funds to file test
submissions during a trial period.
Additionally, we have determined to maintain as nonpublic all reports filed on Form
N-PORT for the first six months following June 1, 2018. We believe that, separate from the
voluntary trial, having a time period where all funds are required to file reports on Form
N-PORT with the Commission but not have those reports disclosed publicly will allow funds and
the Commission to make adjustments to fine-tune the technical specifications and data validation
processes. We believe that this process can ultimately improve the data that is reported to the
Commission and, as required disclosed to the public. Accordingly, we find that it is neither
necessary nor appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to make reports
filed on Form N-PORT during the first six months following the compliance date publicly
available.1238 However, portfolio information attached as exhibits to Form N-PORT for the first
and third quarters of a fund’s fiscal year will still be made public during this period, to ensure
that information about funds’ portfolio holdings continues to be publicly available to investors
and other users during the six month period when reports on Form N-PORT will not be made
publicly available.1239
One commenter did not explicitly address compliance dates for Form N-PORT, but
suggested that the compliance period for Regulation S-X be changed to 18 months so that Form

1238

See section 45(a) of the Investment Company Act.

1239

See supra section II.A.2.j (discussing exhibits to Form N-PORT).

329

N-PORT and the amendments to Regulation S-X would have the same compliance date.1240
Other commenters suggested extending the compliance period for Form N-PORT for all funds,
including specific recommendations for 24 months, 30 months, or 36 months after the later of the
effective date for this rulemaking or the adoption of amendments requiring funds to report
liquidity information on Form N-PORT.1241
We are adopting an initial compliance date for Form N-PORT of June 1, 2018, which is
consistent with the 18-month compliance period we proposed. As discussed above, we
anticipate that the information that will be reported on Form N-PORT will enable us to further
our mission to protect investors by assisting us in carrying out our regulatory responsibilities
related to the asset management industry. We believe that it is important for the Commission to
obtain and benefit from such information as soon as it is reasonably possible for this information
to be reported. Although several commenters recommended extending the compliance period in
order to update reporting systems,1242 based in part upon our experience with Form N-MFP
reporting implementation, we continue to believe that 18 months for larger entities and 30
months for smaller entities will provide sufficient time for funds and their service providers to
prepare to file reports on Form N-PORT.

1240

See State Street Comment Letter (stating that “[m]any of the changes to disclosures for derivatives are
aligned with the information required within Form N-PORT and will require significant
enhancements to systems”).

1241

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter (compliance date of 24 months after the effective date); SIFMA
Comment Letter I (later of 24 months following adoption or six months following publication of the
final XML data structure for Form N-PORT); Fidelity Comment Letter (30 months after the effective
date); ICI Comment Letter (30 months after the effective date of Form N-PORT or the requirement to
report liquidity information on Form N-PORT); Oppenheimer Comment Letter (30 months after the
effective date); Pioneer Comment Letter (36 months after the effective date).

1242

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter; Pioneer Comment Letter; and Invesco
Comment Letter.

330

Separately, as discussed above, our adoption includes numerous modifications from or
clarifications to the proposal that address concerns raised by commenters and that are intended,
in part, to decrease reporting and implementation burdens relative to the proposal. For example,
we have added an instruction to Form N-PORT specifying that funds must report portfolio
information on the same basis used in computing NAV, which is generally a T+1 basis, rather
than on a T+0 basis, which is currently used for financial statement reporting. Several
commenters asked for this clarification, as filing on a T+0 basis would have required timeintensive conversion of portfolio transactions normally recorded on a T+1 basis.1243 We are also
permitting funds to attach Regulation S-X compliant portfolio holdings schedules to Form
N-PORT within 60 days after the end of the first and third fiscal quarters as opposed to our
proposed 30 days, thus allowing funds to focus on preparing their Form N-PORT filings as
opposed to also preparing their Regulation S-X compliant portfolio holdings schedules
simultaneously.1244 More generally, we are permitting a fund to generally use its own
methodology or the methodology of its service provider, so long as the methodology is
consistently applied and is consistent with the way the fund reports internally and to current and
prospective investors, which should help circumvent operational challenges that would have
arisen if firms had attempted to standardize reporting of certain non-standardized information
such as country of risk for each portfolio holding.1245
Several commenters suggested that the Commission should provide for a phase-in period
based on a fund’s fiscal year-end, such that the Commission would require each fund to first

1243

1244

1245

See supra footnote 79 and accompanying and following text.

331

begin filing its Form N-PORT as of its next fiscal year following the compliance date.1246 We
decline to adopt this suggestion. A rolling compliance period based on fiscal year would mean
that some funds would be filing reports on Form N-PORT while other funds would be filing
reports on Form N-Q for the same reporting period, which would delay the Commission and
other users from obtaining complete information about the industry on Form N-PORT for up to a
year. Commission staff believes that this would diminish the value of the information reported
on Form N-PORT in terms of assessing industry trends, identifying outliers, and monitoring
industry developments, because only a portion of the industry would be filing reports on Form
N-PORT each month in a structured data format. This would also create complexities for
investors who might not understand why some of their funds would be reporting on one form
while other funds would be reporting on a different form, and would diminish the ability of
investors to compare the information reported by one fund with information reported by another
fund if each fund reported information on a different form. While our staggered compliance
approach will also result in some funds reporting on Form N-PORT while others are still
reporting on Form N-Q, the difference will be less significant than with a rolling compliance date
because under our approach only smaller funds representing a relatively small proportion of
assets will continue to use Form N-Q after the initial compliance date.
One commenter suggested that the Commission should consider limiting liability for
Form N-PORT filings for a transition period, similar to what was done with earlier structured

1246

See ICI Comment Letter (recommending a rolling compliance period, with each fund not required to
file Form N-PORT until the beginning of its next fiscal year following 30 months after the effective
date); Invesco Comment Letter (same, except each fund not required to file Form N-PORT until the
beginning of its next fiscal year following 36 months after the effective date).

332

data reporting rules.1247 We decline to adopt this suggestion. In the prior structured data
reporting rules, filers were required to report the same information in both structured and nonstructured formats, with limited liability for the information reported in a structured format and
full liability for that same information when reported in a non-structured format. In this case, the
information will be reported on Form N-PORT in only a structured data format.
One commenter suggested raising the asset threshold for determining the larger entities
that would be required to comply with Form N-PORT filing requirements following an 18 month
compliance period, as opposed to 30 months for smaller entities that fell below the asset
threshold.1248 As discussed above, we estimate that our proposed $1 billion assets threshold will
provide an extended compliance period to more than 67% of the fund groups, but only 0.6% of
all fund assets, and therefore believe that the $1 billion threshold will appropriately balance the
need to provide smaller groups of investment companies with more time to prepare for the initial
filing of reports on Form N-PORT, while still including the vast majority of fund assets in the
initial compliance period.1249
2.

Form N-CEN, Rescission of Form N-SAR, and Amendments to the Exhibit
Requirements of Form N-CSR

We are adopting a compliance date of June 1, 2018 to comply with the new Form N-CEN
reporting requirements. We expect that this compliance period, consistent with the 18 month
compliance period that we proposed, will provide an adequate period of time for funds,

1247

See Simpson Thacher Comment Letter (for a two-year transition period, structured data filings
remained subject to standard antifraud provisions under federal securities laws, but were not subject
to section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934). See also Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting, Investment Company Act
Release No. 28609 (Jan. 30, 2009) [74 FR 6776 (Feb. 10, 2009)].

333

intermediaries, and other service providers to conduct the requisite operational changes to their
systems and to establish internal processes to prepare, validate, and file reports on Form N-CEN
with the Commission. We are adopting the same compliance date for the related amendments to
other rules and forms we are adopting today, including the rescission of Form N-SAR and related
rules referencing Form N-SAR.1250
We also are adopting a compliance date of June 1, 2018 to comply with the modified
reporting requirement for a registrant to file as an exhibit to Form N-CSR the letter reporting a
change in independent registered public accountants. This exhibit was already required to be
reported semi-annually on Form N-SAR, and as such, we do not expect that registrants will
require significant amounts of time to modify systems or establish internal processes to prepare
exhibit filings on Form N-CSR in accordance with our amendments.
Unlike Form N-PORT, we are not providing a tiered compliance date based on asset size.
We believe that it is less likely that smaller fund complexes will need additional time to comply
with the requirements to file Form N-CEN because the requirements are similar to the current
requirements to file Form N-SAR, and we expect that filers will prefer the updated, more
efficient filing format of Form N-CEN. We are therefore requiring all funds, regardless of size,
to file reports on Form N-CEN with the same compliance period.
Furthermore, unlike Form N-PORT, we are not keeping reports filed during a phase in
period after the compliance date nonpublic. Much of the information that will be filed on Form
N-CEN is currently already reported by funds on Form N-SAR, and thus funds should already
have processes and procedures in place to reduce the risk of inadvertent errors. In addition,

1250

We similarly are rescinding Form N-SAR (referenced in 17 CFR 274.101) with a timing that is
consistent with this adoption.

334

filings on Form N-CEN are not expected to be as technically complex nor present comparable
challenges in terms of reporting and data validation as filings on Form N-PORT. However, as
with Form N-PORT, we anticipate allowing funds to file test submissions on Form N-CEN on a
voluntary basis for a period of time before the compliance date.
Some commenters suggested that the compliance period be extended to the later of 30
months after the adoption of Form N-CEN, or 18 months after the effective date of amendments
requiring funds to report liquidity information on Form N-CEN.1251 We decline to adopt these
suggestions. As discussed above, much of the information that will be reported on Form N-CEN
is currently already reported by funds on Form N-SAR, and was reported by funds pursuant to a
six-month compliance period upon our adoption of Form N-SAR.1252 One commenter also
estimated in the Form N-PORT context that implementing processes to report structured
information in an XML format would take six months following publication of the final XML
data structure.1253 We therefore continue to believe, based in part upon this comment and also
our prior experience with implementation of reporting requirements for Form N-SAR, that 18
months is an appropriate compliance period for Form N-CEN.

1251

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (suggesting a compliance date of 30 months after the adoption of
Form N-CEN); MFS Comment Letter (same); CAI Comment Letter (same); IDC Comment Letter
(same); Comment Letter of David W. Blass, General Counsel, Investment Company Institute (Jan. 13,
2016) (suggesting the later of 30 months after the adoption of Form N-CEN or 18 months after the
adoption of amendments requiring funds to report liquidity information on Form N-CEN).

3.

Regulation S-X, Statement of Additional Information, and Related
Amendments

As discussed above, our amendments to Regulation S-X are largely consistent with
existing fund disclosure practices. As such, we do not expect that funds, intermediaries, or
service providers will require significant amounts of time to modify systems or establish internal
processes to prepare financial statements in accordance with our proposed amendments to
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, we are adopting a compliance date for our amendments to
Regulation S-X of August 1, 2017. This is consistent with our proposed compliance period of
eight months. The same compliance date will apply to conforming amendments related to our
amendments to Regulation S-X, including the related amendments to the Statement of Additional
Information (and Form N-CSR for closed-end funds) we are adopting today.
One commenter supported the proposed compliance date for the amendments to
Regulation to S-X, although the commenter suggested that implementation be required for each
fund with its next fiscal year end following the proposed compliance date.1254 However, the
commenter’s rationale for a rolling compliance date was not that funds needed more time to
comply, but rather that enhanced disclosure pursuant to the amendments to Regulation S-X
should be initially provided over an entire fiscal year, as opposed to just a portion of the first
fiscal year during which the amendments become effective.
Many other commenters requested that the compliance date be extended, with four
commenters suggesting a compliance period of 18 months after the effective date of the
amendments, one commenter recommending 24 months, and another commenter recommending

1254

See Wells Fargo Comment Letter.

336

36 months.1255 Commenters supported their requests for a longer compliance date by asserting
that the information that will be reported pursuant to the amendments to Regulation S-X overlaps
with the information that will be reported on Form N-PORT, and thus the compliance date for
Regulation S-X should be identical to the compliance date for Form N-PORT.1256
We decline to adopt these suggestions. Although some of the information that will be
reported pursuant to the amendments to Regulation S-X overlaps with the information that will
be reported on Form N-PORT, many of the amendments to Regulation S-X are unrelated to what
will be reported in Form N-PORT. More significantly, as discussed above, our amendments to
Regulation S-X are generally consistent with existing disclosure practices of many funds. As
such, we do not expect that funds, intermediaries, or service providers will require significant
amounts of time to modify systems or establish internal processes to prepare financial statements
in accordance with our final amendments to Regulation S-X.
Additionally, some of the amendments we are adopting to Form N-CEN and the
Statement of Additional Information (and Form N-CSR for closed-end funds) were originally
proposed as part of our amendments to Regulation S-X, and we received no objections to our
proposed timeframe for compliance for those portions of the amendments to Regulation S-X.
Furthermore, the amendments to the Statement of Additional Information and Form N-CSR, like
the amendments to Regulation S-X, do not entail the complications of having to develop and test
1255

S-X be the same as SIFMA’s recommended compliance date for Form N-PORT, namely 24 months
after the effective date or six months after publication of the final XML data structure for Form
N-PORT); Invesco Comment Letter (recommending 36 months, after the effective date with

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.

Introduction

The Commission is sensitive to the economic effects, including the benefits and costs and
the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation that will result from the adopted
changes to the current reporting regime. Changes to the current reporting regime include new
Form N-PORT, the rescission of Form N-Q, amendments to the certification and exhibit filing
requirements for Form N-CSR, amendments to Regulation S-X, new Form N-CEN, and the
rescission of Form N-SAR. The economic effects of the adopted changes are discussed below.
The Commission is modernizing the content and format requirements of reports and
disclosures by funds, and the manner in which information is filed with the Commission and
disclosed to the public. The amendments are designed to enhance the Commission’s ability to
effectively oversee and monitor the activities of investment companies in order to better carry
out its regulatory functions and to aid investors and other market participants to better assess the
benefits, costs, and risks of investing in different fund products. In summary, and as discussed in
greater detail in section II above, the Commission is adopting the following changes to its rules
and forms:


We are requiring registered management investment companies and ETFs organized as
UITs, other than money market funds and SBICs, to report monthly portfolio information
in a structured data format on a new form, Form N-PORT.



We are rescinding Form N-Q. We are also lengthening the look-back for Sarbanes-Oxley
certifications on Form N-CSR to six months to cover the gap in certification coverage
that would otherwise occur once Form N-Q is rescinded.
338



We are revising Regulation S-X to require new, standardized enhanced disclosures
regarding fund holdings in derivatives instruments; update the disclosures for other
investments; and amend the rules regarding the general form and content of fund
financial statements.



We are rescinding Form N-SAR and replacing it with new Form N-CEN, which will
require the annual reporting of similar and additional census information in an updated,
structured data format.



We are adopting amendments to Forms N-1A, N-3, and N-CSR (for closed-end funds) to
require certain disclosures in fund Statements of Additional Information regarding
securities lending activities.
The current disclosure of information by funds serves as the baseline against which the

costs and benefits as well as the impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation are
discussed. The baseline includes the current set of requirements for funds to file reports on
Forms N-CSR, N-Q, and N-SAR with the Commission and the content of such reports, including
Regulation S-X, and in particular, its schedule of investments. The baseline also includes
guidance from Commission staff and other industry groups that have established industry
practices for the disclosure of a fund’s schedule of investments and financial statements. Lastly,
the baseline includes the current practice of some funds to voluntarily disclose additional
information, and the requirement that actively managed ETFs, and many index ETFs, disclose
their portfolios on a daily basis. For example, some funds disclose monthly or quarterly
portfolio investment information on their websites or to third-party information providers, and
disclose additional information (e.g., particular information on derivative positions) in fund
financial statements that is not currently required under Regulation S-X. The parties that will be

339

affected by the new rules, forms, and amendments are funds that have registered or will register
with the Commission; the Commission; and other current and future users of fund information
including investors, third-party information providers, and other potential users; and other
market participants that could be affected by the change in fund disclosures.
We discuss separately below the economic effects of each of the following new rules,
forms, and amendments: the introduction of Form N-PORT, the rescission of Form N-Q, the
amendments to Form N-CSR, the amendments to Regulation S-X, the introduction of Form NCEN, the rescission of Form N-SAR, and the amendments to multiple registration statement
forms. We identify for each of the new rules, forms, and amendments the baseline from which
the economic effects will be discussed and the parties most likely to be affected.
As noted above, the assets of registered investment companies exceeded $18 trillion at
year-end 2015, having grown from about $5.8 trillion at the end of 1998.1257 In addition,
approximately 93 million individuals own shares of registered investment companies,
representing 55 million or 44% of U.S. households.1258 Among investment companies, we
estimate that, as of December 2015, there were 3,113 active investment companies registered
with the Commission, of which 1,642 were open-end funds, 750 were closed-end funds
(including 1 SBIC), and 721 were UITs (including 5 exchange-traded funds).1259 We further
estimate that those registered investment companies included 17,052 funds or series thereof, of
which 1,594 were exchange-traded funds (including eight organized as UITs), 5,188 were UITs,
750 were closed-end funds, 481 were money market funds, and 9,039 were other mutual funds.

and enforcement efforts of the asset management industry. An essential factor to the
Commission’s ability to carry out its regulatory functions is regular, timely information about
portfolio holdings and general, census information about funds. In general, the new rules, forms,
and amendments will modernize the fund reporting regime and, among other effects, will result

341

in an increased transparency of fund portfolios and investment practices. The increased
transparency will improve the ability of the Commission to fulfill its regulatory functions. These
functions include the development of policy and guidance, the staff’s review of fund registration
statements and disclosures, and the Commission’s examination and enforcement programs. We
believe that the increase in transparency will also improve the ability of investors to select funds
for investment, and therefore improve their ability to allocate capital across funds and other
investments to more closely reflect their investment risk preferences. We also believe that the
increase in transparency will enhance competition among funds to attract investors.
At the outset, the Commission notes that, where possible, it has sought to quantify the
costs, benefits, and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation expected to result
from each of the new rules, forms, and amendments and its reasonable alternatives. As discussed
in further detail below, in many cases the Commission is unable to quantify the economic effects
because it lacks the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate.
The economic effects depend upon a number of factors that we cannot estimate or
quantify. Factors include the extent to which investor protection would increase along with the
ability of the Commission to oversee the fund industry; the amount of new information that
would become available as a result of requiring such information in regulatory filings (as
opposed to information that is provided voluntarily); the change in the availability of fund
information to all investors, institutional and individual; and the extent to which investors are
able to use the information to make more informed investment decisions either through direct use
or through third-party service providers. Therefore, much of the discussion below is qualitative
in nature although we describe where possible the direction of these effects.

342

In the Proposing Release, we requested general comment on the feasible alternatives to
the information we proposed to require funds to report that would minimize the reporting
burdens on funds while maintaining the anticipated benefits of the reporting and disclosure, as
well as the utility of the information proposed to be included in reports to the Commission,
investors, and the public in relation to the costs to funds of providing the reports.1260 In adopting
today’s rules, forms, and amendments, we considered, among other things, such alternatives,
utility, and costs.

Form N-PORT, Rescission of Form N-Q, and Amendments to Form N-CSR

1.

Introduction and Economic Baseline

Form N-PORT will require registered management investment companies and ETFs
organized as UITs, other than money market funds and SBICs, to report portfolio investment
information to the Commission on a monthly basis. As discussed, only information reported for
the last month of each fiscal quarter will be made available to the public in order to minimize
potential costs associated with making the information public, including front-running or reverse
engineering of a fund’s investment strategies. Reports will be filed in a structured data format
using XML to allow for easier aggregation and manipulation of the data. As discussed above,
we are also rescinding Form N-Q but requiring that funds attach their complete portfolio
holdings to Form N-PORT for the first and third fiscal quarters in accordance with Regulation
S-X. We are also amending the form of certification in Form N-CSR to require each certifying
officer to state that he or she has disclosed in the report any change in the registrant’s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal half-year to fill the

1260

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at nn. 160-161.

343

gap in certification coverage that would otherwise occur once Form N-Q is rescinded.1261 As
discussed above, we also are moving the management’s statement regarding a change in
accountant, which originally was an exhibit filed on Form N-SAR and was proposed as an
attachment to Form N-CEN, to an exhibit to Form N-CSR.1262 In addition, as discussed above,
we are adopting amendments to require closed-end funds to report on Form N-CSR certain
disclosures regarding securities lending activities.1263
The current set of requirements under which registered management investment
companies (other than money market funds and SBICs) and ETFs organized as UITs publicly
report their complete portfolio investments to the Commission on a quarterly basis and certain
other information on a semi-annual basis,1264 as well as the current practice of some investment
companies to voluntarily disclose portfolio investment information either on their websites or to
third-party information providers on a more frequent basis, is the baseline from which we will
discuss the economic effects of new Form N-PORT.1265 The parties that could be affected by the
introduction of Form N-PORT are registered management investment companies (other than
money market funds and SBICs) and ETFs organized as UITs, that have registered or will

1263

See Item 12 of Form N-CSR; see also supra footnote 1181 and accompanying text and section II.F.

1264

Form N-PORT will also require information that is currently being reported on Form N-SAR such as
information on fund flows, assets, and liabilities. The current requirement to report this information
as part of Form N-SAR is also part of this baseline.
The baseline also includes the current obligation of Form N-Q filers to make certifications regarding
(1) the accuracy of the portfolio holdings information reported on that form, and (2) the fund’s
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.

1265

Additionally, many funds currently provide information concerning derivatives investments, similar
to the requirements we are adopting in our amendments to Regulation S-X. See discussion supra
section II.C.2.

register with the Commission; the Commission; and other current and future users of investment
company portfolio investment information including investors, third-party information providers,
and other interested potential users; and other market participants that could be affected by the
change in fund disclosure of portfolio investment information.
Currently, the Commission requires registered management investment companies (other
than money market funds and SBICs) to report their complete portfolio investments to the
Commission on a quarterly basis.1266 These funds are required to provide this information in
reports on Form N-Q as of the end of the first and third fiscal quarters of each year1267 and in
reports on Form N-CSR as of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year.1268
Both forms require that the reported schedule of portfolio investments conform to the
requirements of Regulation S-X, and the schedule for the close of the fiscal year must be audited
(but those schedules for the other three fiscal quarters need not be).1269 These reports are
generally required to be filed on the EDGAR system and are made publicly available upon
receipt.1270 Reports on Form N-CSR may be filed up to 70 days after the end of the reporting
period,1271 and reports on Form N-Q may be filed up to 60 days after the end of the reporting
period.

Form N-CSR must be filed within 10 days after the shareholder report is sent to shareholders, and the
shareholder report must be sent within 60 days after the end of the reporting period. Rule 30b2-1(a);
rule 30e-1(c).

345

Forms N-CSR and N-Q are required to be filed in HTML or ASCII/SGML format.1272 In
order to prepare reports in HTML and ASCII/SGML, reporting persons generally need to
reformat information from the way the information is stored for normal business use.1273 The
resulting format, when rendered in an end user’s web browser, is comprehensible to a human
reader, but it is not suitable for automated processing. These formats do not allow the
Commission or other interested data users to combine information from more than one report in
an automated way to, for example, construct a database of fund portfolio positions without
additional formatting.
We received no comments that specifically addressed the baseline described in the
Proposing Release. We believe that the economic effects from the introduction of new Form NPORT will largely result from the disclosure of portfolio investment information in a structured
data format, as well as the additional information that investment companies will report relative
to current reporting practices. We also believe that the economic effects will depend on the
extent to which the portfolios and investment activities of investment companies become more
transparent as a result of the increase in the amount and availability of portfolio investment
information, and the ability of Commission staff, investors, and others to utilize the information.
The current reporting requirements for investment companies, however, limit the ability of
Commission staff to evaluate the potential economic effects. For example, the non-structured
data format of reported portfolio investment information and the lack of standardized reporting
requirements for certain types of portfolio investments all reduce the ability of Commission staff

1272

See rule 301 of Regulation S-T; EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II) version 27 (June 2014), at 5-1.

1273

In so doing, reporting persons typically strip out incompatible metadata (i.e., syntax that is not part of
the HTML or ASCII/SGML specification) that their business systems use to ascribe meaning to the
stored data items and to represent the relationships among different data items.

346

to aggregate information across the fund industry and to evaluate the economic effects of the
regulatory changes.
The new rules, forms, and amendments will increase the amount of portfolio investment
information available for some investment companies more so than others. For example,
investment companies that utilize derivatives as part of their investment strategy, or that
otherwise engage in alternative strategies, will provide more information about their businesses
than other investment companies. Information from Form N-SAR provides some indication as to
the current use of derivatives by investment companies. Form N-SAR requires investment
companies to identify permitted investment policies, and if permitted, investment policies
engaged in during the reporting period. As of the second half of 2015, on average 76.5% of
investment companies reported as permitted investment policies involving the writing or
investing in options or futures, and on average 5.3% of investment companies reported engaging
in each one of these policies during the report period.1274 In addition, the total net assets of
alternative funds from which more information would become available were as of year-end

1274

See Item 70 of Form N-SAR for a list of permitted investment policies, and if permitted, the
investment policies engaged in during the reporting period. The percentages are calculated from the
percentage of funds that report affirmatively to either of the two parts for Items 70.B though 70.I.
There is little difference in the proportion of investment companies that reported as permitted the
investment practices relating to Items 70.B through 70.I. The greatest proportion of funds reported
engaging in writing or investing in stock index futures (14.0%) and engaging in writing or investing
in interest rate futures (12.5%), and the smallest proportion of funds reported engaging in writing or
investing in other commodity futures (1.6%) and engaging in writing or investing in options on stock
index futures (0.7%). Aggregate condensed balance sheet information reported on Form N-SAR
indicates that funds held $3.4 billion in options on equities and options on all futures (Item 74.G and
Item 74.H) or 0.018% of net assets from the second half of 2015. Aggregate condensed balance sheet
information reported on Form N-SAR from the second half of 2015 also indicates that funds had
$54.1 billion in short sales (Item 74.R.(2)) and $3.8 billion in written options (Item 74.R.(3)), or
0.291% and 0.020% of net assets, respectively. The estimates are approximate.

347

2015 approximately $219 billion or 1.3% of the total net assets of the mutual fund market.1275
Although the percentage of net assets of alternative funds relative to the mutual fund market is
currently small, the percentage of flows to alternative funds was 11.9% in 2013, 4.0% in 2014,
and 6.1% in 2015.1276
Information from a White Paper prepared by staff in the Division of Economic and Risk
Analysis also describes current fund use of derivatives.1277 For example, based on data from
Morningstar, the number of funds that can be categorized as engaging in alternative investment
strategies increased from 2010 to 2014 at an annual rate of 17%, whereas the total number of all
funds increased at an average annual rate of 8%.1278 In addition, based on a random sample of
funds drawn from Form N-CSR filings, 32% of funds held one or more derivatives, and the
average aggregate exposure from derivatives, financial commitment transactions and other senior
securities was 23% of net asset value. Evidence from the random sample also indicates that
funds engaging in alternative investment strategies tended to use derivatives more often than
other fund types, which the White Paper described collectively as “Traditional” mutual funds.

1275

See supra footnote 39. These statistics were obtained from staff analysis of Morningstar Direct data,
and are based on fund categories as defined by Morningstar.

Benefits

As discussed, Form N-PORT will improve the information that registered management
investment companies and ETFs organized as UITs (other than money market funds and SBICs)
disclose to the Commission. The increase in the reporting frequency, the update to the structure
of the information that reporting funds will disclose, and the additional information that reporting
funds do not currently disclose, discussed in further detail below, will improve the ability of the
Commission to understand, analyze, and monitor the fund industry. We believe that the
information we receive on these reports will facilitate the oversight of reporting funds and will
assist the Commission, as the primary regulator of such funds, to better effectuate its mission to
protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation,
through better informed policy decisions, more specific guidance and comments in the disclosure
review process, and more targeted examination and enforcement efforts.
To the extent that monthly portfolio investment information is not currently available, the
requirement that funds make available monthly portfolio investment information to the
Commission on Form N-PORT will improve the ability of the Commission to oversee reporting
funds by increasing the timeliness of the information available, and by providing a larger number
of data points. The expanded reporting also will increase the ability of Commission staff to
identify trends in investment strategies and fund products as well as industry outliers.1279 As

1279

See, e.g., supra section II. Although likely not a significant effect, the increase in the frequency of
portfolio investment disclosure to the Commission could also reduce the ability of investment
companies to alter or “window-dress” portfolio investments in an attempt to disguise investment
strategies and risk profiles. To the extent that managers may window-dress to affect public
perception, managerial incentives for doing so would not change because the frequency of public
disclosure of portfolio investment information would remain the same. See, e.g., Vikas Agarwal,
Gerald D. Gay, and Leng Ling, Window Dressing in Mutual Funds, REV. OF FIN. STUD., Vol. 27(11),
3133–3170 (2014).

349

discussed above, the quarterly portfolio reports that the Commission currently receives on Forms
N-Q and N-CSR can become stale due to changes in the holdings of portfolio securities or
fluctuations in the values of the portfolio’s investments. Requiring monthly filings on Form NPORT will increase the timeliness of the information the Commission receives from funds.
More timely portfolio investment information will improve the ability of Commission staff to
oversee the fund industry by monitoring industry trends, informing policy and rulemaking,
identifying risks, and assisting Commission staff in examination and enforcement efforts.
The ability of Commission staff to effectively use the information reported in Form
N-PORT depends on the ability of staff to compile and aggregate information into a single
database that can then be used to conduct industry-wide analyses. Otherwise, the information
would only improve the ability of staff to analyze a single or a small number of funds at any one
time. Several commenters agreed that the structuring of the information will improve the ability
of the Commission to compile and aggregate information across all reporting funds, and to
analyze individual funds or a group of funds, and will increase the overall efficiency of staff to
analyze the information.1280 For example, the ability to compare portfolio investment
information across reporting funds or for a single fund across report dates will improve the
ability of the Commission to identify funds for examination and to identify trends in the fund
industry. The Commission is requiring that filers disclose information using the Commission’s
XML schema. Based on the comments received and the Commission’s experience, the
Commission believes that requiring the information to be disclosed in an XML format will
facilitate enhanced search capabilities, and statistical and comparative analyses across filings.
1280

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (“Receiving this information in XML format will facilitate the
Commission’s ability to efficiently analyze fund portfolio information on a regular basis.”);
Morningstar Comment Letter; but see Federated Comment Letter.

350

With the data structured in XML, the Commission and the public can immediately download the
information directly into databases and analyze it using various software packages. This
enhances both the Commission’s and the public’s abilities to conduct large-scale analysis and
immediate comparison across funds and date ranges.
The usefulness of structured data depends on the care with which filers report the data. If
filers were to report data that did not conform to the Commission’s XML schema, data quality
would be diminished and would impair the Commission’s and the public’s ability to aggregate,
compare, and analyze the data. As a result, the Commission’s XML schema also incorporates
certain validations to help ensure consistent formatting among all filings, in other words, to help
ensure data quality. Validations are restrictions placed on the formatting for each data element
so that comparable data is presented comparably. However, these formatting validations are not
designed to ensure the underlying accuracy of the data; they can only help ensure data quality.
These validations cannot exist in the current reporting formats for Form N-CSR and Form N-Q.
XML is an open standard1281 that is maintained by an organization other than the
Commission and undergoes constant review. As updates to XML or industry practice develop,
the Commission’s XML schema will also be updated to reflect those developments, with the
outdated version of the schema replaced in order to maintain data quality and consistency.
As we discussed above in section II.A.3, we considered, as several commenters
suggested, alternative formats to XML, such as XBRL.1282 While the XBRL format allows funds
to capture the rich complexity of financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we
1281

The term ‘‘open standard’’ is generally applied to technological specifications that are widely
available to the public, royalty-free, at no cost.

1282

See, e.g., XBRL US Comment Letter; Deloitte Comment Letter; but see Morningstar Comment Letter
(“Extensible Business Reporting Language has had very limited success, and certain aspects of the
standard are too lenient for regular data validation.”).

351

believe that XML is more appropriate for the reporting requirements that we are adopting. Form
N-PORT, as well as Form N-CEN, as adopted, will contain a set of relatively simple
characteristics of the fund’s portfolio- and position-level data, such as fund and class identifying
information that is more suited for XML. While XBRL has more enhanced validation features,
the simpler reporting elements on Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN do not require those
enhanced features to ensure similar levels of formatting consistency.
In light of the benefits of structured data, we acknowledge that Form N-PORT duplicates
some information filed in other forms, while also requiring funds to report information that is not
currently required to be reported to the Commission, including portfolio- and position- level risk
metrics and additional information describing debt securities and derivatives, securities lending
activities, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, the pricing of securities, and fund
flows and returns. Requesting data in a structured format may promote additional efficiency
among investment companies to the extent that the new, standardized reporting requirements
facilitate more automated report assembly, validation, and review processes for the disclosure
and transmission of filings. Furthermore, filing this information in an XML format will allow
the Commission staff to more efficiently review and analyze data for industry trends, and to
better understand the risks of a particular fund (in the context of the fund’s investment strategy),
a group of funds, and the fund industry by being able to conduct large-scale analysis more easily,
which will help in identifying outliers or trends that could warrant further investigation in a more
immediate fashion.1283

1283

See supra section II.A.2.c. See also, e.g., BlackRock Comment Letter (“Importantly, the greater
depth and frequency of information requested by the Commission will help the Commission better
identify and monitor emerging risks associated with specific RICs or categories of RICs as well as
asset management activities.”); Wells Fargo Comment Letter (“we believe that the enhanced
disclosure requirements of the Proposals represent appropriate valuable information for the

The requirement to report portfolio- and position-level risk metrics will provide
Commission staff with a set of quantitative measurements that provide information about the risk
exposures of a fund. The risk metrics will improve the ability of Commission staff to efficiently
analyze information for all reporting funds based on exposure to certain risks, and to determine
whether additional guidance or policy measures are appropriate to improve disclosures. We are
requiring funds to report risk measures, rather than the raw inputs used to calculate risk
measures, because the calculation of position-level measures of risk for some derivatives,
including derivatives with unique or complicated payoff structures, sometimes requires timeintensive computational methods or additional information that Form N-PORT will not
require.1284 While the Commission would retain greater flexibility if funds were required to
report substantially more detailed information regarding raw inputs on Form N-PORT,1285 it
could be difficult for the Commission to efficiently calculate these same measures and funds
would incur an increase in reporting costs. We recognize that requiring funds to report these risk
measures increases reporting burdens, but as discussed above, based on staff experience and
outreach, we understand that most funds currently calculate risk measures for such securities and
hence do not believe that the burden is significant.
Commission to have in order to assess trends in risks, for example, across the mutual fund
industry.”); CFA Comment Letter (supporting transparency of derivatives holdings); Morningstar
Comment Letter. See also ICI Comment Letter (“Much of the additional information the SEC
proposes to collect can enhance its ability to monitor and oversee the fund industry.”). But see
Federated Comment Letter (“A majority of the Commission’s proposed amendments to Form N-1A,
N-PORT, and N-CEN would require a large effort from funds while offering data that is, at best, of
little utility, and, at worst, misleading. Many of these deficiencies relate to flaws inherent in a
security-level disclosure scheme.”).
1284

One commenter stated that the Commission should not require that funds report risk sensitivity
measures, and instead calculate the risk sensitivity measures using raw inputs (Vanguard Comment
Letter). The commenter noted that the Commission would therefore be able to calculate the measures
consistently and in doing so draw “apples-to-apples” comparisons.

1285

See id.

353

The requirement for investment companies to provide risk metrics at the position-level
and at the portfolio-level will improve the ability of staff to efficiently identify the risk exposures
of funds regardless of the types of investments held or that could be introduced to the
marketplace. The portfolio-level measures of risk will also improve the ability of staff to
efficiently identify interest rate and credit spread exposures at the fund level and conduct
analyses without first aggregating position-level measures. Also, staff could use the risk
measures in combination to conduct additional analyses. For example, Commission staff can use
the two measures of interest rate duration (i.e., DV01 and DV100) to generate a proxy for
interest rate convexity.
We have, however, made certain modifications to the proposed reporting requirements
regarding the reporting of risk metrics in response to comments received. For example, as
discussed in detail above, we are requiring the reporting of fewer key rates to reduce the
reporting burden for funds, adopting a 1% de minimis threshold for reporting risk metrics for
each currency to which the fund is exposed, and raising the threshold for fixed income allocation
for risk reporting from 20% to 25% to align the reporting requirement with current disclosures
required in the prospectus. To the extent that adopting a de minimis amount for reporting risk
metrics for each currency will prevent the Commission, investors, and other users from seeing an
exhaustive view of fund’s currency risk exposures, there could be a reduction in the
informational benefit to the Commission, investors, and other users relative to the proposal.
However, relative to the baseline, we believe the economic effects of the disclosure of currency
risk metrics are substantially similar with or without the adoption of a de minimis. Similarly,
there could be a reduction in the informational benefit to the Commission, investors, and other
users relative to the proposal to the extent that certain funds that would have had to report risk

354

metrics under the 20% threshold do not have to report them under the 25% threshold, although
we again believe that such a change will not significantly impact the benefits of this disclosure
relative to the baseline because it is unlikely that funds that make investments in debt
instruments as a significant part of their investment strategy have less than 25% of their NAV
invested in such instruments. We believe, however, that such modifications are appropriate in
light of the lower reporting burden for funds. Conversely, the Commission is adding a
requirement to report DV100 in addition to DV01 to provide information about larger changes in
interest rates, as well as information about nonparallel shifts in the yield curve. While funds will
have an increased reporting cost to report DV100 in addition to DV01 relative to the proposal, as
DV100 is a standard measure of interest rate sensitivity and a common measure of duration we
do not believe the cost to funds relative to the baseline will change. Furthermore, we believe that
this modification will provide the Commission with the ability to analyze data about larger shifts
in the yield curve, as well as changes in the shape of the yield curve. Similarly, while funds will
have a decreased reporting cost in light of our modification to require the reporting of fewer key
rates, we do not believe that the decrease in information collected by the Commission will
substantially affect our ability to analyze how debt portfolios will react to different interest rate
changes and credit spreads along the Treasury curve, given that the rates at which funds will
report these metrics are, in general, largely representative of bond funds’ overall exposures.
Form N-PORT will require reporting funds to provide the contractual terms for debt
securities and many of the more common derivatives including options, futures, forwards, and
swaps; the reference instrument for convertible debt securities and derivatives; and information
describing the size of the position. This information will provide Commission staff the ability to

355

identify funds with interest rate risk exposure or exposure to other risks such as those pertaining
to a company, industry, or region.
As discussed, for securities lending activities and reverse repurchase agreements, Form
N-PORT will require counterparty identification information, contractual terms, and information
describing the collateral and reinvestment of the collateral. The additional information could
improve the ability of Commission staff to assess fund compliance with the conditions that they
must meet to engage in securities lending, as well as better analyze the extent to which funds are
exposed to the creditworthiness of counterparties, the loss of principal of the reinvested
collateral, and leverage creation through the reinvestment of collateral.
Form N-PORT will also require additional identification information regarding the
reporting fund, the issuers of the fund’s portfolio investments, and the investments themselves,
including the reference instruments for convertible debt securities and derivatives investments.
The adopting release differs from the proposal with respect to the treatment of reference assets
that are custom baskets or nonpublic indexes of securities in that for those that represent more
than 1%, but less than 5%, of the fund’s NAV, funds will be required to disclose the top 50
components of the basket and, in addition, those components that exceed 1% of the notional
value of the index. For nonpublic indexes or custom baskets that represent greater than 5% of
the fund’s NAV, all components will be required to be disclosed. For nonpublic custom baskets
or indexes that represent less than 1% of the fund’s NAV, no disclosure is required. Although
this modification will provide the Commission, investors, and other users with less than
complete transparency into any such derivative investment that represents between 1% and 5%
of a fund’s NAV, given that this modification will still allow the Commission to collect
information on a large portion of the significant reference assets for these investments, we do not

356

believe this change will significantly impact the benefits derived relative to those discussed in
the proposal. The additional identification information will benefit the Commission by
improving the ability of staff to link the information from Form N-PORT to information from
other sources that identify market participants and investments using these same identifiers, such
as Form N-CEN. The additional identification information will improve upon the current
requirement for funds to provide just the issuer name, and as such will aid the Commission in
identifying both the issuers of fund portfolio investments and the investments themselves. As a
result, Commission staff will be better able to identify and compare funds that have exposures to
particular investments or issuers regardless of the whether the exposure is direct or indirect such
as through a derivative security.
Investors, third-party information providers, and other potential users will also experience
benefits from the introduction of Form N-PORT.1286 While the frequency of the public
disclosure of portfolio information will not change, we believe that the structured data format of
this information will allow investors and other potential users to more efficiently analyze
portfolio investment information. Investors and other potential users will also have disclosure of
additional information that is currently not included in the schedule of investments reported on
Form N-Q and Form N-CSR. The structure of the information, as well as the additional
information, will increase the transparency of a fund’s investment strategies and improve the
ability of investors and other potential users to more efficiently identify its risk exposures.
Form N-PORT will benefit investors, to the extent that they use the information, to better
differentiate investment companies based on their investment strategies and other activities. For
1286

See also Morningstar Comment Letter (stating that modern electronic reporting should apply to all
registered investment companies, as investors use open-end funds, ETFs, closed-end funds, and UITs
as “tools to build portfolios.”).

357

example, investors will be able to more efficiently identify funds that use derivatives and the
extent to which they use derivatives as part of their investment strategies.1287 In general, we
expect that institutional investors and other market participants will directly use the information
from Form N-PORT more so than individual investors. For individual investors who choose not
to access the data in an XML format, those investors can access similar information through the
additional disclosure requirements in an unstructured format for investment companies,
including the requirement for investment companies to attach to Form N-PORT complete
portfolio holdings in accordance with Regulation S-X for the first and third fiscal quarters.1288
Investors, and in particular individual investors, could also indirectly benefit from the
information in Form N-PORT to the extent that third-party information providers and other
interested parties obtain, aggregate, provide, and report on the information. Investors could also
indirectly benefit from the information in Form N-PORT to the extent that other entities,
including investment advisers and broker-dealers, utilize the information to help investors make
more informed investment decisions.
We received a number of comments supporting quarterly public disclosure of Form NPORT, but requesting that certain information items be kept nonpublic.1289 In response to these

1287

Form N-PORT will also eliminate the reporting gap between money market funds, which report
portfolio investment information in an XML format on Form N-MFP, and funds engaging in similar
investment strategies such as ultra-short bond funds, which will be required to file reports on Form NPORT.

1288

See discussion supra section II.A.2.j.

1289

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (portfolio risk metrics, delta, liquidity determinations, country of risk
and derivatives financing rates should be kept non-public); BlackRock Comment Letter (risk
metrics); Invesco Comment Letter (portfolio level risk metrics, derivatives information, illiquidity
determinations, and securities lending information should remain non-public); Oppenheimer
Comment Letter (risk metrics, illiquidity determinations, country of risk determinations, derivatives
payment terms (including financing rates), and securities lending fees and revenue sharing splits
should be kept non-public).

358

comments, and in contrast to the proposing release, three items reported on Form N-PORT will
be kept nonpublic: delta, country of risk, and the explanatory notes related to delta and country
of risk. Given that the Commission will still collect this information, we do not believe there
will be a significant economic impact relative to the Proposing Release due to keeping these data
items nonpublic, as the Commission is the primary user of these data elements. A discussion of
the issue of public versus nonpublic data can be found in section II.A.4.
One clarifying change that has been made from the proposing release in response to
commenters is the addition of an instruction that funds may use their own methodologies in
General Instruction G. General Instruction G now provides that funds may respond to Form NPORT using their own internal methodologies and the conventions of their service providers,
provided the information is consistent with information that they report internally and to current
and prospective investors, and the Fund’s methodologies and conventions are consistently
applied and the Fund’s responses are consistent with any instructions or other guidance relating
to the Form. To the extent this instruction decreases the comparability of the data collected,
there could be some reduction in benefit relative to the proposal, although funds will likely
benefit from the decreased reporting burden associated with explicitly allowing them to rely on
their existing practices.
The portfolio investment information that investment companies report to the
Commission is informative in describing the investment strategy funds implement,1290 and
investors could use the information to select funds based on security selection, industry focus,
1290

Academic research indicates that the portfolio investment information funds provide to the
Commission, such as on Form N-CSR and Form N-Q, has value even though the information is
publicly available only after a time-lag. See infra footnotes 1307-1314. Just as investors can use the
information to front-run, predatory trade, or copycat/reverse engineer of the trading strategy of a
reporting fund, investors of funds can also use the information to identify funds for investment.

level of diversification, and the use of leverage and derivatives.1291 We believe that an increase
in the ability of investors to differentiate investment companies could allow investors to allocate
capital across reporting funds more in line with their risk preferences and increase the
competition among funds for investor capital. In addition, by improving the ability of investors
to understand the risks of investments and hence their ability to allocate capital across funds and
other investments more efficiently, we believe that the introduction of Form N-PORT could also
promote capital formation.
Rescission of Form N-Q, along with its certifications of the accuracy of the portfolio
schedules reported for each fund’s first and third fiscal quarters, may result in some cost savings
by funds in terms of administrative or filing costs. However, we expect any such savings, if any,
to be minimal, because each fund will still be required to file portfolio schedules prepared in
accordance with §§210.12-12 to 12-14 of Regulation S-X for the fund’s first and third fiscal
quarters, by attaching those schedules as attachments to its reports on Form N-PORT for those
reporting periods.

Costs

Form N-PORT will require registered management investment companies and ETFs
organized as UITs, other than money market funds and SBICs, to incur one-time and ongoing
costs to comply with the new filing requirements. Funds will incur additional ongoing costs to
report portfolio investment information on a monthly basis on Form N-PORT instead of a
quarterly basis as currently reported on Forms N-Q and N-CSR. Funds that voluntarily provide
1291

Empirical research shows that fund flows are sensitive to many factors including past fund
performance and investor search costs. See, e.g., Erik R. Sirri & Peter Tufano, Costly Search and
Mutual Fund Flows, 53 J. OF FIN., 1589 (1998); Zoran Ivković & Scott Weisbenner, Individual
Investor Mutual Fund Flows, 92 J. OF FIN. ECON., 223 (2009); George D. Cashman, Convenience in
the Mutual Fund Industry, 18 J. OF CORP. FIN., 1326 (2012).

information to third-party information providers and on fund websites, including monthly
portfolio investments, and additional information in fund financial statements, including
additional information regarding derivatives similar to the requirements that we are adopting
today, will bear fewer costs than those funds that do not.1292 The Commission is aware that even
funds that do so report will nonetheless likely incur additional costs on reports on Form N-PORT
than on voluntary submissions, such as validation and signoff processes, given that reports on
Form N-PORT will be a required regulatory filing and will require different data than the funds
are currently providing to third-party information providers. However, over time, the filings
could become highly automated and could involve fewer costs.1293
Funds will incur costs to file reports on Form N-PORT in a structured data format. Based
on staff experience with other XML filings, however, these costs are expected to be minimal
given the technology that will be used to structure the data.1294 XML is a widely used data
format, and based on the Commission’s understanding of current practices, most reporting
persons and third party service providers have systems already in place to report schedules of
1292

Monthly portfolio investment information is available for approximately 42% of funds covered by
The CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Database as of the fourth quarter of 2015. The
database covers more than 10,000 open-ended mutual funds during this time period. This estimate
suggests that a large proportion of funds already report monthly portfolio investment information,
although it is unclear whether monthly information is reported following each month or if information
relating to several months is periodically reported at a later date. Calculated based on data from The
CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Database © 2015 Center for Research in Security Prices
(CRSP®), The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. One commenter also cited the
proportion of funds that are currently reporting monthly portfolio investment information, 6,500 of
12,000 portfolios, as well as the proportion of funds that report portfolio investment monthly
information within 45 days, 6,200 of 6,500. Morningstar Comment Letter.

1293

Costs related to such processes are included in the estimate below of the paperwork costs related to
Form N-PORT, discussed below.

1294

See, e.g., Form PF Adopting Release, supra footnote 80, at text following n. 357 (discussing the costs
to advisers to private funds of filing Form PF in XML format); Money Market Fund Reform 2010
Release, supra footnote 447, at nn. 341–344 and accompanying text (discussing the costs to money
market funds of filing reports on Form N-MFP in XML format).

361

investments and other information. Systems should be able to accommodate XML data without
significant costs, and large-scale changes will likely not be necessary to output structured data
files. In an effort to reduce some of the potential burdens on smaller entities, we are extending
the compliance period to begin filing reports on Form N-PORT to thirty months after the
effective date for groups of funds with assets under $1 billion.1295 The additional time could
increase the ability of these investment companies to comply with the filing requirements by
providing more time for system and operation changes and from observing larger fund groups.
Form N-PORT will also require the disclosure of certain information that is not currently
required by the Commission. To the extent that the new form will require information to be
reported that is not currently contained in fund accounting or financial reporting systems, funds
will bear one-time costs to update systems to adhere to the new filing requirements. The onetime costs will depend on the extent to which investment companies currently report the
information required to be disclosed. The one-time costs will also depend on whether and to
what extent an investment company would need to implement new systems and to integrate
information maintained in separate internal systems or by third parties to comply with the new
requirements. For example, based on staff outreach to funds, we believe that funds will incur
systems or licensing costs to obtain a software solution or to retain a service provider in order to
report data on risk metrics, as risk metrics are not currently required to be reported on the fund
financial statements. Our experience with and outreach to funds indicates that the types of
systems funds use for warehousing and aggregating data, including data on risk metrics, varies
widely.

1295

See supra section II.H.1.

362

In some instances, such as in the case of increased disclosures regarding derivatives
investments and information concerning the pricing of investments, the Commission is requiring
parallel disclosures in the fund’s schedule of investments prepared pursuant to Regulation S-X;
accordingly, we expect funds will generally incur one set of costs to adhere to the reporting of
new information on Form N-PORT and in its schedule of investments. For other information,
such as the reporting of particular asset classifications, identification of investments and
reference instruments, and risk measures, the information will be disclosed on Form N-PORT
only.
The Commission is sensitive to the costs that funds will incur to prepare, review, and file
reports on Form N-PORT. Relative to the proposal, the Commission is making modifications to
these final rules that should reduce the burden on investment companies to file reports on Form
N-PORT. In particular, and in response to commenters,1296 we have raised the threshold for
requiring reporting of portfolio level risk metrics and are providing a de minimis for requiring
reporting of risk metrics for currency exposures. We are also modifying the requirements with
respect to reference assets that are custom baskets or nonpublic indexes of securities so that for
such investments that constitute more than 1%, but less than 5% of the fund’s NAV, funds will
be required to report only the top 50 components of the basket and, in addition, those
components that represent more than 1% of the notional value of the index. We believe this will
result in a decreased burden for filers relative to the proposal. In addition, and as requested by
commenters, funds will report portfolio information on Form N-PORT on the same basis they
use in NAV calculations under rule 2a-4 (generally a T+1 basis), which will alleviate the need of

1296

See, e.g., Oppenheimer Comment Letter; MFS Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment Letter.

363

the majority of funds to alter reporting systems to report on a T+0 basis.1297 Although we did not
specify the appropriate basis for reporting in the proposing release, commenters suggested that
reporting on the same basis used in NAV calculations (generally a T+1 basis) was preferable to
T+0, and we are sensitive to their concerns. Finally, we are adopting a new General Instruction
G that clarifies that in reporting information on Form N-PORT, the fund may respond using its
own internal methodologies and the conventions of its service providers, provided the
information is consistent with information that they report internally and to current and
prospective investors, and the fund’s methodologies and conventions are consistent with any
instructions or other guidance relating to the Form. We believe that this alteration eases the
reporting burden on funds by allowing them to rely on their existing practices and could result in
a cost savings for filers relative to the proposal as it makes clear that they do not have to alter
systems or methodology for reporting information items on Form N-PORT.
To the extent possible, we have attempted to quantify these costs. Based on updated
industry statistics, we estimate that 11,382 funds will file Form N-PORT.1298 As discussed
below, we estimate that these funds will incur certain costs associated with preparing, reviewing,
and filing reports on Form N-PORT.1299 Assuming that 35% of funds (3,984 funds) will choose
to license a software solution to file reports on Form N-PORT, we estimate costs to funds

third-party service provider to provide data aggregation and validation services as part of the
preparation and filing of reports on Form N-PORT, and we estimate costs to funds choosing this
option of $55,492 per fund for the first year1302 with annual ongoing costs of $39,214 per

annual costs of $479,205,732.1304
Although there will be no change to the frequency or time-lag for which investment
company security position information is publicly disclosed, the increase in the amount of
publicly available information and the greater ability to analyze the information as a result of its
structure may facilitate activities such as “front-running,” “predatory trading,” and
“copycatting/reverse engineering of trading strategies” by other investors.1305 Investors that
trade ahead of funds could reduce the profitability of funds by increasing the prices at which
funds purchase securities and by decreasing the prices at which funds sell securities. These
activities can reduce the returns to shareholders who invest in actively managed funds, making
actively managed funds less attractive investment options.1306 Portfolio investment information,

These estimates are based upon the following calculations: $636,350,904 = (3,984 funds x $56,682
per fund) + (7,398 funds x $55,492 per fund). $479,205,732 = (3,984 funds x $47,465 per fund) +
(7,398 funds x $39,214 per fund).

1305

One commenter questioned the potential impact of monthly public disclosure of Form N-PORT on
the ability of other investors to engage in predatory trading or copycatting activities citing to the large
proportion of funds that currently report monthly portfolio investment information (Morningstar
Comment Letter). Although a large percentage of funds report monthly portfolio investment
information, a large percentage of funds currently do not. See supra footnote 1292. The incentives of
funds to report portfolio investment information on a more frequent basis is dependent on many
factors including their perception of the impact of more frequent public disclosure on future returns.
Other commenters expressed concern that the increase in the amount of publicly available
information and the greater ability to analyze the information as a result of its structure would
increase front-running, predatory trading, and copycatting/reverse engineering of trading strategies by
other investors and suggested that reports filed on Form N-PORT be made non-public (Schwab
Comment Letter; T. Rowe Price Comment Letter). Another commenter recommended the quarterly
reporting of monthly information to reduce these concerns (Dodge & Cox Comment Letter).

1306

See, e.g., Potential Effects of More Frequent Disclosure, supra footnote 490.

366

along with flow information, can also create opportunities for other market participants to frontrun the sales of funds that experience large outflows and the purchases of funds that experience
large inflows,1307 or create opportunities for other market participants to engage in predatory
trading that could further hinder fund ability to unwind positions.1308 For example, Form NPORT will result in the disclosure of additional information, such as pertaining to derivatives
and securities lending activities, which could more clearly reveal the investment strategy of
reporting funds and their risk exposures.1309 We note, however, that much, though not all, of the
information that Form N-PORT requires is already reported by funds on Form N-CSR and Form
N-Q.1310 The structured data format of portfolio investments disclosure could improve the ability
of other investors to obtain and aggregate the data, and identify specific funds to front-run or
trade in a predatory manner. These activities could reduce the profitability from developing new
investment strategies, and therefore could reduce innovation and adversely impact competition in
the fund industry.
A trading strategy that follows the publicly reported holdings of actively managed funds
can also earn similar if not higher after expense returns.1311 An implication of this observation is
that the public disclosure of portfolio investment information could induce free-riding by
investors that use the information and reduce the potential benefit from developing new

investment strategies and engaging in proprietary market research. The effect of free-riding
would reduce the ability of investment companies with longer investment horizons to benefit
from researching investment opportunities and developing new strategies more so than
investment companies with shorter investment horizons because of the increased likelihood that
the disclosed portfolio investment information would reveal their long-term investment
strategies.1312
A comparison can be made between the economic effects from the introduction of Form
N-PORT and the economic effects from the introduction of Form N-Q in May 2004 which
increased the reporting frequency of portfolio investment information to the Commission from
semiannual to quarterly. The introduction of Form N-Q resulted in an increase in the amount of
information that could have been acted upon by other investors. For example, studies suggest
that the ability of copycat funds to outperform actively managed funds increased after the
introduction of Form N-Q,1313 and additional studies suggest that the performance of those funds
with better previous performance or that invest in low-information stocks decreased following
the introduction of Form N-Q.1314 The increase in the frequency of portfolio investment
information as a result of Form N-Q resulted in an increase in the amount of portfolio investment
information available. Although Form N-PORT will not increase the frequency of public
1312

Performance, 70 J. OF FIN. ECON. 2733 (DEC. 2015) (“Agarwal et al.”), available at

See Verbeek & Wang, supra footnote 1312.

1314

See Agarwal et al., supra footnote 1312. Low information stocks include stocks with smaller market
capitalization, less liquidity, and less analyst coverage. The authors also observed that the liquidity of
stocks with higher fund ownership increased following the introduction of Form N-Q. Although the
increase in liquidity will benefit investors by reducing trading costs, this benefit stems as a result of
the costly disclosure of potential investment opportunities.

368

disclosure, Form N-PORT will increase the amount of portfolio investment information
available. In addition, Form N-PORT, unlike Form N-Q, will also increase the accessibility of
the information as a result of its structured data format. By maintaining the status quo with
respect to the frequency and timing of the disclosure of publicly available portfolio information,
we aim to mitigate added costs while allowing the Commission, the fund industry, and the
marketplace to assess the impact of the structured, more detailed data reported on Form NPORT, and the extent to which these changes might affect the likelihood of predatory trading.
The additional information and the structure of the information that is required under Form NPORT, however, could improve the ability of investors to obtain, aggregate, and analyze all fund
investments. Thus, Form N-PORT could negatively affect actively managed funds by increasing
the ability of other investors to front-run, predatory trade, and copycat/reverse engineer trading
strategies, and in particular those funds that would have more additional information disclosed,
such as funds that use derivatives as part of their investment strategies.1315 We believe, however,
that even though the reported information will be more easily and efficiently accessed and
aggregated given the nature of structured data, the contribution of structured data to frontrunning, predatory trading, and reverse-engineering will be minimal compared to the baseline
given that funds currently have a quarterly public reporting frequency with a 60-day reporting
delay. The Commission has considered the needs of the Commission, investors, and other users
of portfolio investment information and the potential that other investors may use the
information to the detriment of the reporting funds.
Form N-PORT will require the disclosure of information that is currently nonpublic and
could result in additional or other costs to funds and to market participants. For example, we
1315

See supra footnote 1314 and accompanying text.

369

proposed that Form N-PORT would require a fund to report the identities and weights of all of
the individual components in custom baskets or indexes comprising the reference instruments
underlying the fund’s derivative investments, as well as each component that represents more
than one percent of the reference asset based on the notional value of the derivatives, unless the
reference instrument is an index or custom basket whose components are publicly available on a
website and are updated on that website no less frequently than quarterly, or the notional amount
of the derivative represents 1% or less of the net asset value of the fund.1316 Commenters
informed us that index providers assert intellectual property rights to many indexes or custom
baskets used as reference instruments in derivative investments to index providers, and are
subject to licensing agreements between the index provider and the fund.1317 As further noted by
commenters, we acknowledge that disclosing the components of a nonpublic index or custom
basket could result in costs to both the index provider, whose indexing strategy could be imitated,
and the fund, whose investments could be front-run.1318 Moreover, as stated by commenters,
disclosing the underlying components of such an index or custom basket could subject the fund
to one-time costs associated with renegotiating licensing agreements and the ongoing payment of
fees in order to obtain the rights to disclose the components of the index or custom basket.1319
Additionally, the increased transparency in nonpublic indexes and custom baskets could

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter I; see also Antti Petajisto, The Index Premium and its Hidden Cost
for Index Funds, 18 J. OF EMPIRICAL FIN. 271 (2011). Petajisto analysis suggests that mechanically
induced demand changes to demand, such as index fund rebalancing, can result in price effects. If
predictable, then other investors could take advantage of the changes to the proprietary indexes by
front-running future trades.

1319

See ICI Comment Letter. The Commission does not have information available to provide a reliable
estimate of the increased costs of such licensing agreements because funds are currently not required
to disclose the agreements or the components of the index or custom basket.

370

ultimately decrease the incentives of index providers to license the use of such indexes or custom
baskets to funds as well as fund demand for securities products that incorporate these indexes.
We are unable to quantify the extent to which these reporting requirements could affect the costs
associated with licensing agreements, fees, and incentives.
Although our determination to keep certain items nonpublic was based on factors other
than competitive concerns,1320 by keeping delta and country of risk nonpublic relative to the
proposal, as recommended by commenters, potential costs of disclosing previously nonpublic
information may have been mitigated as well. We recognize that Form N-PORT, as well as the
amendments to regulation S-X, will require funds to report certain information regarding fees
and financing terms for certain derivatives contracts, particularly OTC swaps, which are not
currently required to be publicly disclosed.1321 As asserted by commenters, the increased
transparency could increase the competition among swap and security-based swap dealers to
offer favorable fees and financing terms, as the fees and financing terms offered to one fund
would be known to other funds negotiating the terms of such contracts.1322 There is a possibility,
however, that counterparties may choose not to transact with funds as a consequence of this
disclosure, in which funds would have fewer potential counterparties to work with and the fees
paid by funds would likely rise.
Form N-PORT also requires funds to disclose the variable financing rates for swaps that
pay or receive financing payments.1323 Some commenters noted that variable financing rates for
swap contracts are commercial terms of a deal that are negotiated between the fund and the
1320

371

counterparty to the swap.1324 Disclosure of favorable variable financing rates could result in
costs to the fund in the form of less favorable variable financing rates for future transactions, but
may also improve the ability of other funds to negotiate more favorable terms. However, the
increased transparency could increase the competition among swap and security-based swap
dealers to offer favorable fees and financing terms thereby decreasing the fees paid by funds.
Counterparties could also choose not to transact with funds as a consequence of this disclosure,
in which case competition for counterparties would increase and the fees paid by funds would
rise.
Finally, some commenters noted that reporting of distressed debt issued by private
companies could affect the private company’s relationship with the fund. For example, one
commenter argued that the public disclosure of default, arrears, or deferred coupon payments
raises competitive concerns when a debt security is issued by a borrower that is a private
company, as private borrowers may avoid registered funds in order to limit public disclosure if
the company becomes distressed.1325 The commenter noted that public disclosure that a
borrower is or may be financially distressed could increase prepayment risk and be disruptive to
the fund’s or adviser’s relationship with the borrower.1326 Moreover, this disclosure could also
harm private issuers by disclosing their financial distress to vendors and key employees and
customers.1327 While we recognize that the disclosure of a private issuer in distress could result
in costs for the issuer in the forms discussed above (e.g. a potentially negative impact on existing

1324

See, e.g., MFS Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; and ICI Comment Letter (public benefit of
disclosure does not outweigh potential competitive harm).

outside relationships or a decrease in prospective future borrowers), we believe that it is
important that Commission staff have access to information relating to fund investments that are
in default or arrears in order to monitor individual fund and industry risk. Moreover, funds
investors will benefit from the transparency into the financial health of the fund’s investments
which will allow them to make more fully informed decisions regarding their investment.
Moreover, default or arrears relating to a fund’s investments in private issuer debt are already
publicly available on a fund’s quarterly financial statements, further mitigating any potential new
costs to the fund or its private counterparties.1328
As discussed, we expect that institutional investors and other market participants will
directly use the information from Form N-PORT more so than individual investors as a result of
the format and associated readability.1329 To the extent that third-party information providers
obtain and present the information in a format that individual investors could understand, then
individual investors will also benefit from the information that funds report on Form N-PORT.
We recognize that some commenters were concerned that individual investors may misinterpret
the portfolio investment information that funds report on Form N-PORT, possibly including
portfolio and position level risk metrics, country of risk and portfolio return information. As
discussed above, we have determined to keep position-level reporting of delta and of country of
risk nonpublic.1330 Regarding the other information, however, while there is some possibility of

1328

See rule 12-12, n. 5 of Regulation S-X.

1329

As discussed in section I.B.1., while we do not anticipate that many individual investors will analyze
data using Form N-PORT, we believe that individual investors will benefit indirectly from the
information collected on reports on Form N PORT, through enhanced Commission monitoring and
oversight of the fund industry and through analyses prepared by third-party service providers and
other parties, such as industry observers and academics.

1330

See, e.g., IDC Comment Letter (warning of possible investor confusion from public disclosure of risk
metrics); SIFMA Comment Letter I (same); Invesco Comment Letter (same); Schwab Comment

373

misinterpretation, we believe investors could benefit from the information and, accordingly
determined that the disclosure of such information is appropriate and in the public’s interest.
For funds that invest in debt instruments or derivatives we are modifying our
requirements from the proposing release in several ways that may affect the costs borne by
affected filers. For example, as discussed in detail above, we are requiring the reporting of fewer
key rates in order to reduce the reporting burden for funds, adding de minimis for reporting such
metrics for certain currencies, and raising the threshold for fixed income allocation for risk
reporting from 20% to 25% to align the reporting requirement with current disclosures required
in the prospectus, which could reduce the number of funds that must report such metrics. We are
also requiring filers to report DV100 in addition to DV01, which will result in an additional
reporting cost relative to the proposal; however, we believe that the extent of such reporting costs
will be mitigated because DV100 is among the most common measures of interest rate
sensitivity and that it will not be costly to report. Similarly, we are adding the requirement to
report net realized gain (or losses) and net change in unrealized appreciation (or depreciation)
attributable to derivatives by derivative instrument, in addition to by asset category as proposed,
which will add an incremental cost relative to the proposal; however, as discussed above, we
understand from commenters that funds already keep this information by derivative instrument
type, which should mitigate the incremental increase in cost relative to the proposal.1331
As discussed above, although Form N-Q would be rescinded, it would also require funds
to file portfolio schedules prepared in accordance with §§210.12-12 to 12-14 of Regulation S-X

Letter (same); ICI Comment Letter (same); CRMC Comment Letter (warning of possible investor
confusion from public disclosure of portfolio return information); SIFMA Comment Letter I (same).
1331

See supra section II.A.2.e.

374

for the fund’s first and third fiscal quarters, by attaching those schedules to its reports on Form
N-PORT for those reporting periods. The schedules attached to Form N-PORT would be largely
identical to the information currently reported on Form N-Q to ensure that such information
continues to be presented using the form and content which investors are accustomed to viewing
in reports on Form N-Q, and we have modified this requirement from the Proposing Release to
allow funds 60 days from the end of the reporting period to file this attachment, as opposed to 30
days as proposed. This should lower the burden of preparing such attachments relative to the
proposal, without any change in benefit, as the attachment is intended for investors and quarterend Form N-PORT filings are made public 60 days after the end of the reporting period.
Rescission of Form N-Q would eliminate certifications of the accuracy of the portfolio
schedules reported for the first and third fiscal quarters. Rescission would also result in funds
certifying their disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting
semi-annually (at the end of the second and fourth quarters) rather than quarterly. To the extent
that such certifications improve the accuracy of the data reported, removing such certifications
could have negative effects on the quality of the data reported. Likewise, if the reduced
frequency of the certifications affects the process by which controls and procedures are assessed,
requiring such certifications semi-annually rather than quarterly could reduce the effectiveness of
the fund’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.
However, we expect such effects, if any, to be minimal because certifying officers would
continue to certify portfolio holdings for the fund’s second and fourth fiscal quarters and would
further provide semi-annual certifications concerning disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting that would cover the entire year.

375

Lastly, registrants also will be required to file the management’s statement regarding a
change in independent public accountant as an exhibit to reports on Form N-CSR. This exhibit
filing requirement originated in Form N-SAR. Commission staff believes that moving this
reporting requirement from Form N-SAR to Form N-CSR does not have new economic
implications from the proposal. We have, however, attributed an annual burden of an additional
one-tenth of an hour per registrant1332 and approximately an additional $32.40 per registrant1333
in reporting paperwork costs to Form N-CSR as a result of the modification.
4.

Alternatives

The Commission has explored other ways to modernize and improve the utility and the
quality of the portfolio investment information that funds provide to the Commission and to
investors.1334 Commission staff examined how portfolio investment information reported to the
Commission could be improved to assist the Commission in its rulemaking, inspection,
examination, policymaking, and risk-monitoring functions, and how technology could be used to
facilitate those ends. Commission staff also examined enhancements that would benefit
investors and other potential users of this information, including updating the reporting
obligations of funds to keep pace with the changes in the fund industry. We have considered
many alternatives to the individual elements contained in this release, and those alternatives are
discussed above in the sections pertinent to the major components of this rulemaking.1335

1332

See infra footnote1612 and accompanying text.

1333

See infra footnote 1609 and accompanying text.

1334

We discuss other alternatives to the adopted changes to the current regulatory regime in section III.F,
below. Other alternatives include the information that funds will report on Form N-PORT relative to
the information that funds will report on Form N-CEN, and alternative formats for structuring the
data.

1335

See generally supra section II.

376

Alternatives to the filing of Form N-PORT and the disclosure of portfolio investment
information relate to the timing and frequency of the reports, the public disclosure of the
information, and the information that Form N-PORT would request.
Funds will file reports on Form N-PORT no later than 30 days after the close of each
month. The monthly reporting and the 30-day reporting lag will increase the timeliness of the
information and improve the ability of the Commission to oversee investment companies.
Alternatives include extending the filing period from thirty days, as recommended by many
commenters, or shortening the filing period, which no commenters specifically recommended,1336
and to require the filing of monthly portfolio investment information at a quarterly frequency, as
recommended by another commenter.1337 While a shorter filing period would provide more
timely information to the Commission, it would also increase the burden on funds that need time
to collect, verify, and report the required information to the Commission. Conversely, a longer
filing period or a decrease in the frequency in which funds provide monthly information would
give funds more time to report the information and may decrease the potential costs from frontrunning, predatory trading, and copycatting/reverse engineering of trading strategies by other
investors,1338 but may also decrease the ability of the Commission to oversee investment

1336

See, e.g., State Street Comment Letter (supporting a 30-day reporting lag, but requesting an additional
15 days for the first year of reporting); Morningstar Comment Letter (supporting a 30- or 45-day
reporting lag); Vanguard Comment Letter (supporting a 45-day reporting lag); CRMC Comment
Letter (supporting a 60-day reporting lag); Dechert Comment Letter (generally supporting a longer
reporting period, or alternatively a longer compliance period to enable the systems necessary to
produce accurate information to be developed and implemented).

1337

See, e,g., Dodge & Cox Comment Letter (supporting quarterly filings of monthly data).

1338

See, e.g., Dodge & Cox Comment Letter (advocating for quarterly filings of monthly data due, in
part, to concerns regarding potential data breaches regarding monthly portfolio data); Morningstar
Comment Letter (supporting public disclosure of portfolio investment information at the monthly
frequency, citing to the large number of funds already reporting monthly portfolio investment

377

companies and to identify risks a fund is facing, particularly during times of market stress, as the
information is more likely to be stale or outdated. As discussed above in section II.A.3,we
believe that the monthly reporting of Form N-PORT with a 30-day filing period appropriately
balances the staff’s need for timely information against the appropriate amount of time for funds
to collect, verify, and report information to the Commission.
As discussed above in section II.A.2.a and in response to comments received, the final
amendments now include an instruction that funds report portfolio information on Form NPORT on the same basis used in calculating NAV under rule 2a-4 (generally a T+1 basis).
Alternatives include requiring all funds to file reports on Form N-PORT on a T+0 basis or,
providing the reporting fund the explicit option to file reports on Form N-PORT on either a T+0
basis or a T+1 basis, as recommended by a commenter.1339 Although requiring funds to file
reports on Form N-PORT on a T+0 basis would be consistent with the current filing
requirements for Form N-CSR and Form N-Q and thus would result in information that is
reported on a more consistent basis across reports, the shorter time to file Form N-PORT relative
to Form N-CSR and Form N-Q could require funds to alter reporting systems and result in
additional filing costs, as pointed out by several commenters.1340 In addition, although providing
funds the option to report on either a T+0 or a T+1 basis would eliminate the potential costs for
all funds to alter systems to report on either a T+0 or a T+1 basis, providing funds the option to
report on either a T+0 or a T+1 basis would result in information that is less comparable between
funds.

378

Funds will have 18 to 30 months after the effective date to comply with the new reporting
requirements for Form N-PORT. The compliance period varies with fund size, with smaller fund
entities having an additional 12 months to comply with the new reporting requirements. An
alternative would be to not allow for tiered compliance and require all investment companies to
begin filing reports on Form N-PORT within 18 months. Other alternatives would be to extend
the compliance period for all investment companies, as recommended by many commenters.1341
As discussed above, we believe it is appropriate to tier the compliance period to provide the
smaller fund complexes more time to make the system and internal process changes necessary to
prepare reports on Form N-PORT. We also continue to believe that 18 months would provide an
adequate period of time for larger fund entities, intermediaries, and other service providers to
update systems to conduct the requisite operational changes to their systems and to establish
internal processes to prepare, validate, and file reports on Form N-PORT with the Commission.
Nonetheless, as discussed above, we intend to keep the first six months of filings reported on
Form N-PORT after the compliance date nonpublic, to allow funds and the Commission to refine
the technical specifications and data validation processes.1342
Another alternative for tiered compliance would be to set the threshold at a level different
than $1 billion. A higher threshold, such as $20 billion, as recommended by one commenter,1343
would increase the number of entities that could benefit from the additional time to update
systems to adhere to the additional filing requirements, but would also decrease the amount of

379

portfolio investment information that would be available to the Commission, investors, and other
interested parties in a structured data format. A lower threshold, on the other hand, would have
the opposite effects. As discussed above, the Commission believes that a $1 billion threshold for
tiered compliance will address the need for structured portfolio investment information while
providing smaller entities in most need of additional time a better opportunity to update systems.
The information that funds report on Form N-PORT for the last month of each fiscal
quarter will be made publicly available (with the exception of delta, country of risk, and
associated explanatory notes) 60 days after month-end (thirty days after the filing deadline).
Additional alternatives include making more of the portfolio and other information reported on
the form either nonpublic or public, including making all or none of the information reported on
Form N-PORT each month publicly available, as discussed above in section II.A.3.1344
In response to comments received we have removed delta, country of risk, and the
associated explanatory notes from the public reporting requirements, but we believe that making
more of the portfolio and other information reported on Form N-PORT nonpublic would reduce
the amount of information investors have access to when making investment decisions.
However, as discussed above, making more of the portfolio and other information reported on
the form public, including making all of the information reported on Form N-PORT each month
publicly available, could increase the risk of front-running, predatory trading, and
copycatting/reverse engineering of trading strategies by other investors, as well as the public
disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information.1345 We believe that making the vast majority

1344

Commenters had mixed views on the public disclosure of N-PORT information; those comments are
discussed supra section II.A.3.

1345

See infra section III.C.3

380

of items reported on Form N-PORT public, as well as keeping eight of the twelve months of data
collected by the Commission on Form N-PORT nonpublic, balances the public’s need for and
the usefulness of the information without unnecessarily subjecting funds to potentially harmful
trading strategies by other market participants.
Form N-PORT will require funds to report additional portfolio investment information
relative to what is currently reported in Form N-CSR and Form N-Q. Alternatives include not
requiring some of this additional information, or requiring information in addition to what will
be required to be reported as currently adopted. Other alternatives would be to request
information that is more granular, information that is more aggregate, and information that is
more consistent with other current regulatory forms or that substitutes compliance with other
current regulatory regimes.1346 Although we recognize that there are various alternative
reporting requirements imposed in other contexts and by other regulators, the reporting
requirements imposed by Form N-PORT have been designed specifically to meet the
Commission’s regulatory needs with regards to monitoring and oversight of registered funds. As
discussed above, the information reported on Form N-PORT will increase the ability of
Commission staff to better understand the risks of a particular fund, a group of funds, and the
fund industry. Investors, third-party information providers, and other potential users will also
experience benefits from the introduction of Form N-PORT. For example, to the extent that
investors use the information, Form N-PORT will improve the ability of investors to differentiate
funds based on their investment strategies and other activities. Although the new information

1346

One commenter suggested that the Commission should use the same interest rate and credit spread
risk metrics as is required in Form PF (BlackRock Comment Letter). Another commenter suggested
that the Commission and the CFTC should agree on and implement a substituted compliance regime
(SIFMA Comment Letter I).

381

that will be reported on Form N-PORT could increase the initial and ongoing reporting costs for
investment companies, and could increase the likelihood of front-running, predatory trading, and
copycatting/reverse-engineering by other investors, the Commission continues to believe that the
information is important to fully describe a fund’s investments. The Commission also believes
that the reporting requirements of Form N-PORT are appropriate given each filer’s status as a
registered investment company with the Commission and not as a private fund.1347
As discussed above, the Commission is requiring funds to report risk metrics at the
portfolio and position level on Form N-PORT. In response to commenters’ suggestions, we are
now requiring the disclosure of measures of duration for a smaller number of key interest rates
than we had originally proposed. However, an alternative would be to request those key rates
detailed in the proposing release, or even additional measures. As discussed above, we believe
that the number of key rates that we are adopting today will provide us with sufficient
information and flexibility while also reducing the reporting burden. Other alternatives that
would increase the reporting of risk-sensitivity measures include requiring funds to report
additional portfolio level measures that describe the sensitivity of a reporting fund at additional
basis point changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and a measure (or measures) of
convexity, and include requiring funds to report additional position level measures such as vega,
as requested by one commenter.1348 Investment companies could also report fewer portfolio or
position level risk-sensitivity measures, such as a single or total portfolio level measure of

1347

See supra footnote 485 and accompanying text.

1348

See State Street Comment Letter (requesting that funds also be required to report credit spread, delta,
duration, yield to maturity, option adjusted spread, exposure, delta-adjusted exposure, duration
equivalents, foreign exchange sensitivity/risk, and vega).

382

interest rate and credit spread duration, as recommended by some commenters,1349 or instead
report the underlying data to calculate the measures, as recommended by another commenter.1350
As discussed above and in response to commenters’ suggestions, we have made a
modification from the proposed requirement to report only DV01 to now require filers to report
both DV01 and DV100 on Form N-PORT. The Commission believes that DV100 is among the
most common measures of interest rate sensitivity and that it will, in conjunction with DV01,
provide more useful information about non-parallel shifts in the yield curve than smaller
measures, such as DV25 and DV5, while not requiring filers that do not calculate convexity
internally to begin doing so. However, while potentially useful, requiring all funds to report
further additional portfolio- or position-level risk-sensitivity measures would increase the burden
on all funds and not significantly improve the ability of Commission staff to monitor the funds in
most market environments, and in particular for funds which do not extensively use derivatives
as part of their investment strategy (while we are requiring funds to report DV100, we believe
the marginal cost of reporting it is minimal because we understand that many funds likely
already calculate it). Although the burden to investment companies to report risk metrics would
decrease if fewer or no risk-sensitivity measures were required by the Commission, the staff
believes that the benefits from requiring the measures that we are including in Form N-PORT
today, including the ability of Commission staff to efficiently identify and size specific
investment risks, justify the costs to investment companies to provide the information. Lastly,
we believe that requiring funds to provide the risk measures would improve the ability of the

1349

See Simpson Thacher Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter; ICI
Comment Letter; and Wells Fargo Comment Letter.

1350

See Vanguard Comment Letter (suggesting that the Commission calculate risk metrics from
information that funds report on Form N-PORT).

383

Commission, investors, or other potential users to efficiently analyze the information rather than
requiring funds to provide the inputs that might be necessary for interested parties to calculate
these measures themselves,1351 and would enhance the ability of Commission staff to efficiently
identify risk exposures, especially during times of market stress.
Other alternatives to the reporting of portfolio level risk-sensitivity measures relate to the
allocation thresholds for funds to report portfolio interest rate risk exposures and currency risk
exposures. Given commenters’ recommendations, we are raising the threshold for fixed income
allocation for risk reporting from 20% to 25%, and providing a de minimis threshold for
reporting currency risk of 1%. We could, however, require lower/higher thresholds that would
result in more/fewer funds reporting interest rate or currency risk exposures, respectively. As
discussed above, the Commission believes that the reporting thresholds for Form N-PORT
provide Commission staff the ability to analyze interest rate and currency exposures while
reducing reporting burdens and the potential that funds inadvertently trigger the reporting
requirement when the exposures are not part of its principal investment strategy.
Form N-PORT will also require funds to report terms and conditions of each derivative
investment that are important to understanding the payoff profile of the derivative, including the
reference instrument.1352 As discussed above, for reference instruments that are indexes or
custom baskets of securities that are not publicly available, Form N-PORT will require funds to
report all the components of the index or custom basket if the investment constitutes more than 5%
of the fund’s NAV, and the top 50 components of the index or custom basket and any

1351

See supra section II.A.2.g.iv.

1352

We are requiring similar information on a fund’s schedule of investments. See supra section
II.A.2.g.iv.

384

components that represent more than 1% of the notional value of the index or custom basket if
the investment represents more than1% but less than 5% of the fund’s NAV. Alternatives would
be for funds to report fewer or additional components of the underlying indexes or custom
baskets.
Lastly, funds will no longer be required to file reports on Form N-Q. An alternative is for
funds to continue reporting Form N-Q along with Form N-PORT at the end of first and third
fiscal quarters. Commission staff believes, however, that the new reporting requirements for
portfolio investment information, including the amendments to the certification requirements of
Form N-CSR, would cause Form N-Q to become redundant if not outdated, and therefore impose
costs on funds to file reports that would result in little benefit. Although requiring that certifying
officers state that they have disclosed in the report any change in the registrant’s internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal half-year will increase the
burden of filing Form N-CSR, these certifications will fill the gap in certification coverage
regarding the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise exist
once Form N-Q is rescinded.
C.

Amendments to Regulation S-X

1.

Introduction and Economic Baseline

Regulation S-X prescribes the form and content required in financial statements. The
amendments to Regulation S-X will require new disclosures regarding fund holdings in open
futures contracts, open forward foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts, and
additional disclosures regarding fund holdings of written and purchased option contracts; update
the disclosures for other investments with conforming amendments, as well as reorganize the
order in which some investments are presented; and amend the rules regarding the general form
and content of fund financial statements, including requiring prominent placement of
385

investments in derivative investments in a fund’s financial statements, rather than allowing such
schedules to be placed in the notes to the financial statements.1353
The current set of requirements under Regulation S-X, as well as the current practice of
many funds1354 to voluntarily disclose additional portfolio investment information in fund
financial statements and to follow industry guidance and other industry practices, is the baseline
from which we discuss the economic effects of amendments to Regulation S-X.1355 The parties
that could be affected by the amendments to Regulation S-X include funds that file or will file
reports with the Commission and update or will update registration statements on file with the
Commission, the Commission, current and future investors of investment companies, and other
market participants that could be affected by the increase in the disclosure of portfolio
investment information. We did not receive any specific comments on the proposed economic
baseline for the amendments to Regulation S-X.
Previously, Regulation S-X did not prescribe specific information to be disclosed for
many investments in derivatives, which could result in inconsistent reporting between funds and
reduced transparency of the information reported, and in some cases could result in insufficient

1353

See supra section II.C. As discussed above, rule 12-13 of Regulation S-X requires limited generic
information on the fund’s investments other than securities. To address issues of inconsistent
disclosures and lack of transparency, the amendments will have a consistent presentation of a fund’s
disclosures of open futures contacts, foreign currency forward contracts, and swaps. In addition,
while many of the amendments to Regulation S-X are similar to the proposed disclosures in Form NPORT (e.g., enhanced derivatives disclosures), the amendments to Regulation S-X will be in an
unstructured but consistently presented format (as opposed to Form N-PORT’s structured data).

1354

As we discussed supra footnote 524, while “funds” are defined in the preamble as registered
investment companies other than face-amount certificate companies and any separate series thereof—
i.e., management companies and UITs, we note that our amendments to Regulation S-X apply to both
registered investment companies and BDCs. See supra footnotes 699 and 700. Therefore, when
discussing fund reporting requirements in the context of our amendments to Regulation S-X, we are
also including changes to the reporting requirements for BDCs.

1355

See discussion supra section II.C.1.

386

information concerning the terms and underlying reference assets of derivatives to allow
investors to understand the investment.
We expect that many of the economic effects from the amendments to Regulation S-X
will largely result from an increase in investor ability to make investment decisions dependent on
the more transparent disclosure in financial statements, as noted by commenters.1356 As
discussed above, the total economic effects will depend on the extent to which the portfolios and
investment practices of all investment companies become more transparent, and the ability of
investors, and in particular individual investors, to utilize financial statements to compare funds
and to make investment decisions. The economic effects will also depend on the extent to which
investment companies already voluntarily provide disclosures that will be required by the
amendments, and the extent to which the amendments to Regulation S-X standardize financial
statements across funds. As a result of these factors, some of which are difficult to quantify or
unquantifiable, the discussion below is largely qualitative although certain one-time and ongoing
costs associated with the amendments are quantified below.
2.

Benefits

The amendments to Regulation S-X will benefit investors by updating the information
funds disclose in the financial statements of registration statements and shareholder reports.
Several commenters noted that the amendments will benefit investors through increased
transparency and comparability of fund financial statements, particularly for individual investors
that we would not expect to use the information in Form N-PORT because of its structured data

1356

See, e.g., PwC Comment Letter (”We believe that the Proposed Rule will generally provide investors
with greater access to information relating to their investments and investment advisors.”); Deloitte
Comment Letter.

387

format.1357 In particular, the additional information that Regulation S-X will require for open
option contracts both written and purchased, open futures contracts, open forward foreign
currency contracts, open swap contracts, and other investments will increase the transparency of
the fund’s portfolio investments and risk exposures.1358
Other amendments will also improve the transparency into the fund’s investments. For
example, we are requiring funds to identify each investment whose value was determined using
significant unobservable inputs.1359 Likewise, we are requiring that funds separately identify
restricted investments.1360 In addition, in a modification from the proposal, we are now
including a requirement that should benefit investors and other users of the information by
providing more transparency to a fund’s investments in debt securities, and in particular variable
rate securities. As discussed more fully below and in section II.C.3, in light of comments we
received and in order to give investors both the ability to understand the investment’s current
return (through end-period rate) and to better understand how interest rate changes could affect
the investment’s future returns, we are adopting an instruction that would require a fund, for its
investments in variable rate securities, to both describe the referenced rate and spread and
provide the end of period interest rate for each investment, or include disclosure of each
referenced rate at the end of the period.1361

1357

See PwC Comment Letter; EY Comment Letter.

and 12-13D, n. 7 of Regulation S-X.

12-13D, n. 6 of Regulation S-X.

1361

See rules 12-12, n. 4 and 12-12B, n. 3 of Regulation S-X.

388

In a change from the proposal and Form N-PORT, we are requiring funds to separately
list the top 50 components and the components that represent more than 1% of the notional value
of the referenced assets underlying swap and option contracts, rather than separately listing every
component. We believe that this alteration benefits investors by making it easy for them to
understand and evaluate the specific risk exposures of a fund from certain swap and option
contracts, while simultaneously reducing the reporting burden for funds.
We believe that the changes to the form and content of financial statements in Article 6 of
Regulation S-X will similarly benefit investors, particularly individual investors who in general
may not have the tools and resources possessed by institutional investors, through greater
transparency in a fund’s financial statements. For example, we are requiring funds to disclose
their investments in derivatives in the financial statements, as opposed to in the notes to the
financial statements.1362 To the extent funds do not do this already, we believe, and commenters
agreed, that more prominent placement of investments in derivatives in the financial statements
(immediately following the schedules for investments in securities of unaffiliated investors and
securities sold short), will benefit investors through increased visibility of fund investments in
derivatives and comparability between funds.1363 Likewise, we are eliminating the financial
statement disclosure of “Total investments” on the balance sheet under “Assets”.1364 As we
discuss in more detail in section II.C.6, recognizing that funds could present investments in
derivatives under both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, eliminating this disclosure will
benefit investors by providing a more complete representation of the effect of these investments

Letter (supporting the requirement to present derivatives schedules in the fund’s financial statements).

389

on a balance sheet.1365 Other parties that will be affected by the amendments to Regulation S-X
include the Commission and other market participants that would use shareholder reports and
registration statements to obtain fund information. Although the amendments to Regulation S-X
will primarily benefit investors and particularly individual investors, the Commission and other
market participants could use the information reported in a fund’s financial statements, and
would benefit from an increase in transparency into a fund’s financial statements. For example,
Commission staff could utilize the information in a fund’s financial statements during
examinations.
Commission staff believes that a large number of funds currently adhere to industry
practices from which the amendments to Regulation S-X are derived. The amendments to
Regulation S-X, therefore, will effectively standardize the information that all funds disclose on
financial statements, and make the schedule of investments and financial statement disclosures
consistent and thus more comparable across funds, as noted by commenters.1366 Similar to new
Form N-PORT, the amendments to Regulation S-X, to the extent that they increase the
transparency and consistency of shareholder reports across funds, could improve the ability of
investors, particularly individual investors, to differentiate investment companies and make
investment decisions either by themselves or by way of third-party information providers. An
increase in the ability of investors to differentiate investment companies and allocate capital
across reporting funds closer to their risk preferences will increase the competition among funds
for investor capital. In addition, by improving the ability of investors to understand investment
risks and hence their ability to allocate capital across funds and other investments more

1365

390

efficiently, we also believe that the introduction of Form N-PORT could also promote capital
formation.
3.

Costs

We believe that registrants on average will likely incur minimal costs from our
amendments to Regulation S-X because, as discussed above, based upon staff experience, we
believe that a majority of funds are already providing the information that will be required by the
amendments to Regulation S-X in their financial statements.1367 The costs to a fund of
complying with the new rules will depend upon the extent to which funds are already making
such disclosures currently.1368 As discussed above, the Commission will require parallel
disclosures in Form N-PORT, and funds will incur one set of costs, both one-time and ongoing,
to obtain the information that will be disclosed in Form N-PORT and in financial statements. In
addition, other costs that relate to the disclosure of portfolio investment information, including
the ability of other investors to front-run, trade predatorily, and copycat/reverse engineer trading
strategies of funds, will primarily relate to Form N-PORT because of the additional ability of
other interested third-parties and market participants to efficiently obtain, aggregate, and analyze
the information as a result of its structured data format as compared to the non-structured data
format of portfolio investment information reported in financial statements.
For example, as discussed above in section II.C.2.a, in response to commenters’ concerns
relating to the burdens associated with our proposed requirement that funds list all components

1367

In order to reduce burdens on funds, we also endeavored, where appropriate, to require consistent
derivatives holdings disclosures between Form N-PORT and Regulation S-X.

1368

Moreover, as we discussed above in section III.C.1, we expect minimal audit costs as a result of our
amendments to Regulation S-X because many funds are already voluntarily providing this
information in their audited financial statements.

391

underlying a nonpublic index or custom basket,1369 we are instead requiring funds to separately
list the top 50 components and the components that represent more than 1% of the notional value
of the referenced assets underlying swap1370 and option contracts.1371 Commenters noted, and we
agree, that the potential volume of all of the components underlying nonpublic indexes and
custom baskets were disclosed would make the fund’s financial statements difficult to
understand.1372 Thus requiring funds to report only the most significant components could
benefit investors by making it easier for them to understand and evaluate the specific risk
exposures of a fund from certain swap and option contracts.1373 Moreover, limiting the reporting
of nonpublic indexes and custom baskets will reduce fund auditing costs by eliminating the
burdens of requiring an auditor to verify every component of a nonpublic index, which could
potentially include thousands of investments.
We further believe this change provides the necessary benefit without being unduly
burdensome. We understand that index providers might assert intellectual property rights to
certain indexes, and these may be subject to licensing agreements between the index provider
and the fund.1374 Disclosing the underlying components of an index could subject the fund to
costs associated with negotiating or renegotiating licensing agreements in order to publicly
disclose the components of the index.1375 The Commission does not have information available

to provide a reliable estimate of the increased costs of licensing agreements because funds
currently are not required to disclose the agreements or the components of the index. In addition,
disclosing the components of a nonpublic index may include costs to both the index provider,
whose indexing strategy could be reverse-engineered, and the fund, whose rebalancing trades
could be front-run.1376 Finally, the possibility exists that index providers will refuse to permit
disclosure and the funds might not be able to use such indexes any longer. This could potentially
drive up competition for index providers, in turn raising costs for funds. Requiring the
disclosure of only those proprietary components that meet a materiality threshold could help
alleviate some of these costs and concerns. However, the underlying components would be more
accessible in Form N-PORT as a result of its structured data format as compared to the nonstructured data format of the information in financial statements, so we believe that the costs of
disclosing the information will therefore primarily relate to Form N-PORT, and reporting of
components will be more comprehensive in Form N-PORT, as discussed in greater detail above.
As another example, the amendments include an instruction to disclose the variable
financing rates for swaps that pay or receive financing payments.1377 It is our understanding that
variable financing rates for swap contracts are often commercial terms of a deal that are
negotiated between the fund and the counterparty to the swap.1378 Disclosure of favorable
variable financing rates could result in costs to the fund in the form of less favorable variable
financing rates for future transactions, but may also improve the ability of other funds to
negotiate more favorable terms. Similar to the introduction of Form N-PORT, the increased
1376

1377

1378

See, e.g., MFS Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; and ICI Comment Letter (public benefit of
disclosure does not outweigh potential competitive harm).

393

transparency could increase the competition among swap and security-based swap dealers to
offer favorable fees and financing terms thereby decreasing the fees paid by funds.
Counterparties could also, however, choose not to transact with funds as a consequence of this
disclosure, in which case competition for counterparties would increase and the fees paid by
funds would rise. As with the disclosure of the components of an index, we believe that the
majority of the costs associated with disclosures of variable financing rates, including the
increase in competition for favorable fees and terms, will instead derive from the similar
requirements in Form N-PORT.1379
In response to commenters concerns, we also made changes from the proposal to
eliminate several disclosures. For example, we are amending our proposed instruction which
would require funds to categorize the schedule by type of investment, the related industry, and
the related country or geographic region.1380 We agreed with commenters that requiring
categorization of both the industry and geographic region (as opposed to categorizing one)
would add considerable length to the schedule of investments, which could ultimately undermine
the schedule’s usefulness to investors.1381 In the interest of reducing burdens for investors and
making financial statements easier to review, we are not adopting this proposed requirement.
We similarly determined to eliminate an instruction in Regulation S-X requiring funds to
include tax basis disclosures. As discussed above in section II.C.4, this instruction is contained
in current rules 12-12, 12-12C, and 12-13 and we proposed to extend the instruction to proposed
rules 12-12A, 12-13A, 12-13B, 12-13C, and 12-13D. We were, however, persuaded by

Comment Letter; and BlackRock Comment Letter.

394

commenters that this disclosure of tax basis by investment type would not provide meaningful
disclosure to investors, while increasing the volume and complexity of financial statements.1382
In the interest of reducing burdens to both investors and funds, while making financial
statements easier for investors to understand, we are eliminating the tax basis instruction from
the current rules and not adopting it for the other rules.
We also proposed to require funds to identify illiquid investments.1383 We received
several comments noting that, among other things, this disclosure would be difficult and costly to
audit, as auditors would be required to determine the validity of the fund’s liquidity
determinations for each investment. 1384 We were persuaded by comments relating to the costs of
auditing liquidity disclosures and, as discussed further in the Liquidity Adopting Release we are
adopting concurrently, also believe that such position-level information regarding liquidity is
better suited for nonpublic reporting to the Commission in Form N-PORT.
Finally, in order to provide more transparency to a fund’s investments in debt securities,
we had proposed an instruction requiring a fund to disclose, for its investment in variable rate
securities, the referenced rate and spread.1385 We received several comments supporting our
proposal to provide the reference rate and spread for variable rate securities, reasoning that the
disclosure of the components of the variable rate would be easier for investors and other
interested parties to determine the investment’s current rate at any given time (as opposed to the

Letter; and MFS Comment Letter.

395

rate at the end of the reporting period).1386 However, another commenter suggested that the endperiod interest rate is the most appropriate variable rate security disclosure for shareholders.1387
As discussed more fully in section II.C.3, in order to give investors both the ability to understand
the investment’s current return (through end-period rate) and to better understand how interest
rate changes could affect the investment’s future returns, we have made a change to the proposed
instruction so that it now requires a fund to both describe the reference rate and spread and
provide the end of period interest rate for each investment, or include disclosure of each
reference rate at the end of the period.1388 Requiring a fund to disclose both the period-end rate
and reference rate and spread will necessarily add costs relating to a fund’s financial statement
and auditing costs, albeit, we expect that cost to be minimal because these pieces of information
are generally not difficult to obtain and verify as, based on staff experience, we believe that this
information is currently collected by funds and commonly available in a fund’s accounting
system.
Funds will incur one-time and ongoing costs to comply with the amendments to
Regulation S-X in addition to the costs attributable to new Form N-PORT. For the amendments
to Regulation S-X, funds will incur one-time and ongoing costs to obtain the additional
information that will be disclosed on shareholder reports and registration statements, and that
will also not be disclosed on Form N-PORT; and funds will also incur one-time costs to format
for presentation all additional information that will be reported in financial statements. In
addition, we will require funds, to the extent they do not already do so, to present the schedules

investors to identify when cash flows associated with a fund’s returns are fixed or variable).

associated with rules 12-13 through 12-13D and 12-14 in the financial statements, as opposed to
in the notes to the financial statements.1389 Funds that do not currently present their schedule of
investments in this manner will incur a one-time cost of modifying the presentation of their
financial statements to conform to the amendments.
Additionally, we proposed to add a new disclosure requirement that was designed to
increase transparency into a fund’s securities lending and cash collateral management
activities.1390 Some commenters expressed concerns relating to the location of the required
disclosure in the fund’s financial statements in particular.1391 One commenter in particular noted
that additional costs of auditing the disclosure of these fees “would most likely outweigh any
benefits of reporting this information.”1392 While we continue to believe that investors and other
interested parties will benefit from disclosures relating to a fund’s securities lending and cash
collateral management activities, after consideration of the issues raised by commenters,
including the added auditing costs that funds would incur, we determined that it is more
appropriate to require these disclosures be made in a fund’s Statement of Additional Information
(or, with respect to closed-end funds, a fund’s reports on Form N-CSR) rather than to require
their inclusion in its financial statements.1393

See Deloitte Comment Letter (noting that indirect fees “are typically a management’s estimate that is

presentation of detailed information with varying degrees of usefulness that could detract from other
material information presented in the financial statements” and recommending that “the Commission
use other reporting mechanisms more suited for that purpose”).

To the extent possible, we have attempted to quantify these costs. As discussed below in
section IV.C, we estimate that management investment companies will incur certain one-time
additional paperwork and other costs associated with preparing, reviewing, and filing semiannual reports in accordance with the amendments to Regulation S-X in the amount of
approximately $1,911 per fund1394 and $22,662,549 in the aggregate.1395 We similarly estimate
that management investment companies will incur certain ongoing paperwork and other costs
associated with preparing, reviewing, and filing semi-annual reports in accordance with our
amendments to Regulation S-X in the amount of approximately $683 per fund1396 and
$8,099,697 in the aggregate.1397 Likewise, we estimate that UITs will incur certain one-time
additional paperwork and other costs associated with preparing, reviewing, and filing semiannual reports in accordance with the amendments to Regulation S-X in the amount of
approximately $1,911 per fund1398 and $1,377,831 in the aggregate.1399 We similarly estimate

Alternatives

The Commission has also explored other ways to modernize and improve the utility,
quality, and consistency of the information that funds report to the Commission and to investors
in the financial statements required in shareholder reports and other registration statements.
Commission staff examined how the information funds provide to the Commission and to
investors could be made more informative and more consistent across funds. Alternatives to the
amendments to Regulation S-X relate to the compliance period to adhere to the new amendments
and to the information that funds report in the financial statements.
Funds will have 8 months after the effective date to comply with the amendments to
Regulation S-X. An alternative would be to extend the compliance period, as suggested by
several commenters.1402 We believe, however, that most entities would not need additional time

to modify systems to adhere to the amendments to Regulation S-X because, with the exception of
the disclosure of index components, the proposed amendments are largely consistent with current
fund disclosure practices. As such, we do not expect that funds, intermediaries, or service
providers will require significant amounts of time to modify systems or establish internal
processes to prepare financial statements in accordance with our final amendments to Regulation
S-X. Another alternative would be to provide a tiered compliance period to provide smaller fund
complexes more time, as we do for Form N-PORT. However, we do not believe that smaller
entities would relatively benefit from additional time, since while fixed costs in general are
proportionately higher for smaller entities, the amendments to Regulation S-X do not add
additional fixed costs, but rather the amendments are largely consistent with current disclosure
practices. Extending the compliance period for all entities or for smaller entities, however,
would delay the benefits to investors (and to the Commission and to other market participants)
from the increased transparency and standardization of shareholder reports and other financial
statements.
The amendments to Regulation S-X will update the information funds disclose in
financial statements. Alternatives to the amendments to Regulation S-X include the disclosures
of different information. For example, the amendments to Regulation S-X will require funds to
report information describing derivative contracts including, in some instances, the components
of reference indexes that surpass certain materiality thresholds. As alternatives, we could require
funds to only disclose a brief description of the index, require a different threshold for
identifying the components of the swap or options contract, or require the reporting of all
components. Although the alternatives that would increase the reporting of the components of
reference indexes would increase the transparency for investors into the assets underlying a swap

400

or options contract including the underlying risks of the fund, these alternatives would increase
the costs of funds to report the information. However, although the alternatives that would
decrease the reporting of the components of reference indexes would decrease the costs to funds
to report the information, these alternatives would decrease the ability of investors to understand
fund portfolio investments. We believe that the amendments to Regulation S-X adopted today
provide investors with sufficient information to broadly understand funds’ investments without
unduly burdening funds.
Amendments to Regulation S-X will also not require funds to report information
describing their securities lending activities in the financial statements, as proposed, but will
instead require funds to report the information in the Statement of Additional Information (or, for
closed-end funds, their reports on Form N-CSR). An alternative, similar to proposed rule
6.03(m), would be for funds to report information describing their securities lending activities as
part of the financial statements. However, the requirement that securities lending information
would be disclosed as part of financial statements would increase the costs to audit and report the
information.1403 Another alternative would be for funds to not provide the information altogether.
However, we believe that the information is important to investors, the Commission, and other
interested parties to understand the economic implications of a fund’s securities lending activities.
To the extent that investors utilize this information or that it benefits the Commission, we believe
that the Statement of Additional Information (or, for closed-end funds, reports on Form N-CSR)
is an appropriate place to disclose this information.
Similarly, amendments to Regulation S-X will also not require funds in their financial
statements to identify illiquid securities, as was initially proposed. An alternative is to adopt the
1403

Deloitte Comment Letter.

401

proposed approach and require funds in their financial statements to identify illiquid securities.
The disclosure of the liquidity of securities on financial statements, however, could increase the
costs to audit financial statements.1404 In addition, some commenters asserted the disclosure of
security liquidity could cause investors, and in particular individual investors, to misinterpret the
information as objective.1405 As discussed in the Liquidity Adopting Release, we are adopting
portfolio-level liquidity reporting on Form N-PORT which we believe mitigates many of the
commenters’ concerns and is a more appropriate method of public reporting.1406 Accordingly,
we are not adopting the proposed instructions in Regulation S-X relating to the liquidity of
investments.
Lastly, amendments to Regulation S-X will include instructions to funds to make a
separate disclosure for income from non-cash dividends and payment-in-kind interest on the
statement of operations. Funds will report income from payment-in-kind interest or non-cash
dividends only if the income exceeds 5 percent of the fund’s investment income, as suggested by
commenters who requested a materiality threshold, which is consistent with the other income
disclosures under rule 6-07.1.1407 An alternative, similar to the proposal, would be for funds to
make a separate disclosure for all income from payment-in-kind interest or non-cash dividends
regardless of the amount.

D.

Form N-CEN and Rescission of Form N-SAR

1.

Introduction and Economic Baseline

Form N-CEN requires funds to report census information to the Commission on an
annual basis. Although Form N-CEN includes many of the same data elements as the current
census-type reporting form, Form N-SAR, it replaces items that are outdated or no longer
informative with items of greater importance for the oversight and examination of investment
companies, and eliminates certain items that are also reported to the Commission in other forms.
Investment companies will file reports on Form N-CEN in a structured, XML format to allow for
easier aggregation and manipulation of the data. Form N-SAR will be rescinded.
The current set of requirements for funds to file reports on Form N-SAR is the baseline
from which we discuss the economic effects of Form N-CEN.1408 The parties that could be
affected by the introduction of Form N-CEN and the rescission of Form N-SAR include funds
that currently file reports on Form N-SAR and funds that will file reports on Form N-CEN; the
Commission; and, other current and future users of fund census information including investors,
third-party information providers, and other interested potential users.
At the time it was adopted, Form N-SAR was intended to reduce reporting burdens and
better align the information reported with the characteristics of the fund industry. As the fund
industry has developed, including the development of new products, so has the need to update
the information the Commission requires in order to improve its ability to monitor the
compliance and risks of reporting funds. The format in which information is reported in Form
N-SAR is also outdated, which reduces the ability of Commission staff to obtain and aggregate
1408

Management companies must file reports on Form N-SAR semi-annually, and UITs must file reports
on Form N-SAR annually. See current rule 30b1-1 for management companies, and see current rule
30a-1 for UITs.

403

the information. Likewise, the technology in which Form N-SAR is filed does not allow for
certain validation checks, reducing the data quality of the information (e.g., the Form N-SAR
application is unable to check related fields for arithmetic consistency) and therefore the ability
of Commission staff to compare the information across funds is constrained.
The economic effects from the introduction of new Form N-CEN and the rescission of
Form N-SAR will largely result from an update to the format of the information reported, as well
as the update to the census information that investment companies will report. The economic
effects will therefore depend on the extent to which investment companies become more
transparent, and the ability of Commission staff and investors to utilize the updated disclosures.
Form N-CEN requires census information about the fund industry reported in a structured data
format. However, while Form N-SAR information is also reported in a structured data format,
Form N-CEN information will be reported in XML format, a much more modern and useful data
format, and one that allows for more efficient data collection than does the baseline format,
aggregation, manipulation, and rendering. Therefore, although the introduction of Form N-CEN
will increase the transparency of the fund industry by making the information reported therein
more readily available, more easily shared or retrieved, and more relevant, we cannot quantify
the significance of its economic implications.
2.

Benefits

The Commission is rescinding Form N-SAR and replacing it with new Form N-CEN to
improve the quality and the utility of the information investment companies report to the
Commission. The improvement in the quality and utility of the information will allow
Commission staff to better understand industry trends, inform policy, and assist with the
Commission’s examination program.

404

Similar to Form N-PORT, the ability of the Commission to most effectively use the
information is dependent on the ability of staff to compile and aggregate the information into a
single database. The structuring of the information in an XML format will improve the ability
and efficiency of Commission staff to obtain and analyze the information. An improved
structured data format could also promote additional efficiency to the extent that the new
standardized reporting requirements encourage more automated report assembly, validation, and
review processes for the disclosure and transmission of information.1409 In ways similar to those
discussed above in relation to Form N-PORT, an XML format also improves the quality of
census information obtained by the Commission by providing constraints as to how information
can be provided and by allowing for built-in validation.1410
Form N-CEN also modernizes the census information that funds provide and increases its
utility to Commission staff, investors, and other interested parties by reflecting the changes to the
fund industry in a structured data format. The Commission will use the information in Form
N-CEN to improve its understanding of fund industry trends and practices, and assist with the
Commission’s examination program. Commission staff has identified specific information that
could improve its ability to effectively oversee funds.
Along with the other information, Form N-CEN adds new requirements for information
specifically relating to the ETF primary markets, including more detailed information on
1409

See, e.g., CFA Comment Letter (noting that requiring information to be reported through a structured
data format will allow better collection and analysis of information); see also XBRL US Comment
Letter (expressing the belief that a structured data format will make data computer-readable,
consistent and comparable across different reporting entities).

1410

See, e.g., Morningstar Comment Letter (noting that the XML format will reduce the amount of
defective reporting currently possible in Form N-SAR); see also XBRL US Comment Letter (while
specifically recommending an XBRL structured format, noting that checking the validity of data may
still be required but, with structured data, the process can be automated, thereby reducing costs and at
the same time increasing the consistency of the data produced).

405

authorized participants and creation unit requirements.1411 We believe that the additional
information on ETFs will allow the Commission to better understand and assess the ETF market
and also inform the public about certain characteristics of the ETF primary markets.1412
Additionally, Form N-CEN, like Form N-SAR, has particular sections for closed-end funds,
SBICs, and UITs in order to obtain information about the particular characteristics of these
entities to assist our staff in monitoring the activities of these funds and preparing for
examinations.
Form N-CEN also adds new requirements for information relating to a management
company’s securities lending activities, including information concerning the management
company’s securities lending agents and cash collateral managers.1413 We are also requiring the
monthly average value of securities on loan, the net income from securities lending, and the
monthly average net assets in the fund.1414 Together with the requirements on securities lending
activities in Form N-PORT and in fund Statements of Additional Information,1415 this
information will benefit the Commission’s oversight abilities and, potentially, future
policymaking concerning securities lending. Moreover, we believe that this information could

The monthly average value of securities on loan and the net income from securities lending are being
moved from Form S-X to Form N-CEN, while the monthly average net assets is a newly reported
value, and while not specifically related to securities lending activity, it will facilitate the use of the
monthly average value of securities on loan.

inform investors and other interested parties about the use of and potential risks associated with a
management company’s securities lending activities.1416
We expect funds will also benefit from replacing Form N-SAR with Form N-CEN
through reduced expenses. First, we estimate that Form N-CEN has a lower cost per filing than
Form N-SAR, as a result of filing in an XML format, as opposed to the outdated format of Form
N-SAR, and the elimination of certain items on Form N-SAR that funds will not report on Form
N-CEN. Second, funds that are management companies will experience a decrease in
paperwork-related expenses from the decrease in the reporting frequency of census information
from semi-annual to annual.1417 As discussed in detail below, we estimate that paperwork
expenses associated with reporting on Form N-CEN will be, in the aggregate, about $14.6
million each year.1418 By contrast, we estimate that paperwork expenses associated with

1416

Some commenters expressed general support for reporting securities lending information on Form
N-CEN; some commenters expressed certain concerns about particular proposed requirements and we
have modified the securities lending requirements in certain respects after consideration of
commenters’ views. See supra section II.D.4.c.iii.

1417

See supra notes 768–769 and accompanying text for a discussion of commenters’ views on the filing
frequency. See also ICI Comment Letter (stating that reporting this data on an annual, rather than a
semi-annual basis, would significantly lessen reporting burdens for funds).

1418

Below, we estimate that 3,113 funds will file reports on Form N-CEN each year. See infra footnote
1532. Below, we estimate that funds will, on average, incur 12.37 burden hours per fund per year to
comply with the reporting requirements of Form N-CEN. See infra footnote 1532 and accompanying
text. Therefore, in the aggregate, we estimate that such funds would incur about 38,508 burden hours
to comply with these requirements. This estimate is based on the following calculation: 3,113 funds
× 12.37 hours per fund per year = 38,508 hours per year. The Commission estimates the wage rate
associated with these burden hours based on salary information for the securities industry compiled
by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. The estimated wage figure is based on
published rates for senior programmers and compliance attorneys, modified to account for an 1,800hour work year; multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and
overhead; and adjusted to account for the effects of inflation, yielding effective hourly rates of $308
and $340, respectively. See Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Report on
Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013. We estimate that senior
programmers and compliance attorneys would divide their time equally, yielding an estimated hourly
wage of $324. ($308 per hour for senior programmers + $340 per hour for compliance attorneys) ÷ 2
= $324 per hour. Based on the Commission’s estimate of 38,508 burden hours per year and the

407

reporting on Form N-SAR are about $25.5 million each year.1419 Accordingly, we estimate, on
net, annual paperwork expense savings to funds associated with the adoption of Form N-CEN
and rescission of Form N-SAR will be about $10.9 million.1420 We recognize that these ongoing
annual expense savings will be partially offset by one-time expenses in the first year to file
reports on Form N-CEN. We estimate that these expenses would be, in the aggregate, about
$20.2 million.1421 As indicated by commenters, the 75-day period to file Form N-CEN will also

estimated wage rate of $324 per hour, the total annual paperwork expenses for funds associated with
the internal hour burden imposed by the reporting requirements of Form N-CEN are about
$12,476,592. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: 38,508 hours per year × $324 per
hour = $12,476,592. Below, we also estimate that funds will incur aggregate annual external costs of
$2,088,176 to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN. See infra footnote 1538 and
accompanying text. Thus the total estimated annual paperwork expenses associated with the
reporting requirements of Form N-CEN are $14,564,768. This estimate is based upon the following
calculation: $12,476,592 associated with internal burden + $2,088,176 external cost burden =
$14,564,768.
1419

Below, we estimate that, in the aggregate, funds currently incur about 78,561 burden hours to comply
with the requirements of Form N-SAR. See infra footnote 1541 and accompanying text. The
Commission estimates the wage rate associated with these burden hours based on salary information
for the securities industry compiled by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
The estimated wage figure is based on published rates for senior programmers and compliance
attorneys, modified to account for an 1,800-hour work year; multiplied by 5.35 to account for
bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead; and adjusted to account for the effects of
inflation, yielding effective hourly rates of $308 and $340, respectively. See Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association, Report on Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities
Industry 2013. We estimate that senior programmers and compliance attorneys would divide their
time equally, yielding an estimated hourly wage of $324. ($308 per hour for senior programmers +
$340 per hour for compliance attorneys) ÷ 2 = $324 per hour. Based on the Commission’s estimate
of 78,561 burden hours and the estimated wage rate of $324 per hour, the total annual paperwork
expenses for funds associated with the internal hour burden imposed by the reporting requirements of
Form N-SAR are about $25,453,764. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: 78,561
hours per year × $324 per hour = $25,453,764.

1420

This estimate is based upon the following calculation: $25,453,764 in annual paperwork expenses
associated with Form N-SAR - $14,564,768 in annual paperwork expenses associated with Form
N-CEN = $10,888,996 in annual paperwork expenses.

1421

Below, we estimate that 3,113 funds will file reports on Form N-CEN each year. See infra footnote
1532. Below, we estimate that funds will, on average, incur 20 additional one-time burden hours per
fund in the first year to comply with the reporting requirements of Form N-CEN. See infra footnote
1528 and accompanying text. Therefore, in the aggregate, we estimate that such funds would incur
about 62,160 one-time burden hours to comply with these requirements. This estimate is based on the
following calculation: 3,113 funds × 20 one-time burden hours per fund = 62,260 one-time hours.

408

benefit funds by staggering the reports that funds file with the Commission at the end of each
fiscal year.1422
The rescission of Form N-SAR and the introduction of Form N-CEN, to the extent
relevant, could provide benefits to investors, to third-party information providers, and to other
potential users from an update to the census information that investment companies report and
from an update to its structured data format. Similar to Form N-PORT, we expect that
institutional investors and other market participants could use the information from Form N-CEN
more so than individual investors. However, individual investors may indirectly benefit from the
increase in information to the extent that it becomes available through third-party information
providers, as these information providers will likely have the capabilities to efficiently collect the
data from Form N-CEN and present it for investors in user-friendly format. For certain investors
and other potential users that would obtain and use the information that funds report in Form NCEN directly, the update to the structure of the information should improve their ability to
efficiently aggregate the information across all investment companies given the difficulty

The Commission estimates the wage rate associated with these burden hours based on salary
information for the securities industry compiled by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association. The estimated wage figure is based on published rates for senior programmers and
compliance attorneys, modified to account for an 1,800-hour work year; multiplied by 5.35 to account
for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead; and adjusted to account for the effects of
inflation, yielding effective hourly rates of $308 and $340, respectively. See Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association, Report on Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities
Industry 2013. We estimate that senior programmers and compliance attorneys would divide their
time equally, yielding an estimated hourly wage of $324. ($308 per hour for senior programmers +
$340 per hour for compliance attorneys) ÷ 2 = $324 per hour. Based on the Commission’s estimate
of 62,260 one-time burden hours and the estimated wage rate of $324 per hour, the total one-time
paperwork expenses for funds associated with the internal hour burden imposed by the reporting
requirements of Form N-CEN are about $20,172,240. This estimate is based on the following
calculation: 60,260 one-time hours × $324 per hour = $20,172,240 one-time expenses.

associated with extracting information from reports on Form N-SAR, due to its idiosyncratic
reporting format.1423
The changes to the reporting of census information, including the reporting of the
information in a modern structured data format, could improve the ability of investors to
differentiate investment companies and could therefore lead to an increase in competition among
funds for investor capital. In addition, these changes could enhance the ability of investors to
understand the investment risks and practices (for example, securities lending activities) of
investment companies, and therefore could improve the ability of investors to efficiently allocate
capital. Consequently, the reporting changes could promote capital formation.
3.

Costs

As discussed above, we expect the new Form N-CEN will be less costly to file than Form
N-SAR has been, because Form N-CEN will be filed annually while Form N-SAR is filed semiannually.1424 ETFs and closed-end funds, however, may have higher expenses in filing reports
on Form N-CEN relative to other investment companies, as they will generally be required to
provide more information than previously reported.1425 There could also be costs as a result of
the change in the frequency of disclosure of census information. For example, the Commission
will receive census information on an annual instead of semi-annual basis, and therefore to the
extent that the information changes intra-annually the information will be more dated than if the

See, e.g., Morningstar Comment Letter (noting that the XML format will provide more accessible
data to the public).

1424

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter (noting that the rescission of Form N-SAR and Form N-Q and
replacement with Form N-CEN would result in a net reduction of 504 filings annually for the
company).

1425

See supra section II.D.4.e for a discussion of the ETF requirements.

410

information was reported to the Commission on a semi-annual basis.1426 As discussed above, we
believe that the costs related to reducing the frequency of the information received on Form NSAR are not significant as this information is unlikely to change frequently. Also, funds’
reporting costs may be reduced by the elimination, in Form N-CEN, of certain items from Form
N-SAR that are no longer needed by Commission staff or are outdated in their current form.1427
In addition, as discussed above, we are moving the change in independent public accountant
attachment proposed on Form N-CEN to Form N-CSR so that an accountant’s letter regarding a
change in accountant will become available to the public semi-annually rather than annually,1428
which we expect will affect reporting and other costs only minimally. Additionally, we
recognize that we are adding some additional information items from the proposal, such as
average net assets and CRD numbers for directors, which will result in minor increases in
reporting costs relative to the proposal.
As discussed above, some commenters objected to the inclusion of the requirement for
each ETF to report the dollar value of the ETF shares that each authorized participant purchased
and redeemed from the ETF during the reporting period, expressing concerns that reporting
authorized participant activities on Form N-CEN could discourage authorized participants from
participating in the ETF market, leading to further concentration in the authorized participant
community or authorized participants moving their ETF-related trading activities to banks or

1426

However, as discussed supra footnote 770, this cost is mitigated, in part, by the fact that certain items
from Form N-SAR that the Commission staff has deemed necessary on a more frequent basis are
included instead in reports on Form N-PORT.

1427

See discussion supra section II.D.5. One commenter did, however, suggest we reconsider the
exclusion of several of these items. Comment Letter of Morningstar, Inc. (July 20, 2015).

1428

See supra section II.D.4.b.

411

“clearing” authorized participants.1429 We expect that any effects of these reporting requirements
on authorized participant participation in the ETF primary market will be minimal. We continue
to believe, moreover, that collection of this additional information may allow the Commission
staff to monitor how ETF purchase and redemption activity is distributed across authorized
participants and, for example, the extent to which a particular ETF—or ETFs as a group—may
be reliant on one or more particular authorized participants, and we believe that adopting the new
reporting requirements is appropriate in light of these benefits notwithstanding the possibility
that public availability of the information might affect the ETF primary markets in the manner
those commenters suggest.
Form N-CEN could impose costs on investors and other potential users of the
information to obtain the information from a new or additional source, including the information
that will not be included on Form N-CEN but would be available through other filings. The
information that will not be included on Form N-CEN and that will not be available elsewhere
will impose costs on investors and other potential users from a loss of information to the extent
that the information is found to be useful.1430 One commenter expressed concern that obtaining
this information from various sources would reduce its availability to investors and other
interested parties, but could be available through third-party information providers.1431 We have
attempted to mitigate the potential cost relating to the loss of information by eliminating only

1429

See supra footnote 1072 and accompanying text.

1430

Some of the information that funds will no longer report on a census-form, such as loads paid to
captive or unaffiliated brokers, has been found by interested third-parties, including researchers, to be
important in their analysis of the fund industry. See, e.g., Susan E. K. Christoffersen, Richard Evans
& David K. Musto, What do Consumers’ Fund Flows Maximize? Evidence from Their Brokers’
Incentives, 68 J. OF FIN. 201 (2013). See discussion supra section II.D.5.

1431

See, e.g., Morningstar Comment Letter.

412

those items which are either available elsewhere, not frequently used by Commission staff, or
provide minimal benefit relative to the burdens of reporting such information.
4.

Alternatives

Similar to Form N-PORT, the Commission has explored other ways to modernize and
improve the utility and the quality of the census information that funds provide to the
Commission and to investors. Commission staff examined how census information reported to
the Commission could be improved to assist the Commission in its oversight activities, as well as
how the information could benefit investors and other potential users of the information.
Alternatives to the filing of Form N-CEN and the reporting of census information relate to the
timing and frequency of the reports, the public disclosure of the information, the information that
Form N-PORT would request, and the rescission of Form N-SAR.
Unlike Form N-SAR, on which management companies file reports on a semi-annual
basis, management companies will report information on Form N-CEN on an annual basis. An
alternative to the annual reporting of census information in Form N-CEN is a semi-annual
reporting of the information similar to Form N-SAR. However, as we discussed above, the
census-type nature of the information that we will collect from funds in Form N-CEN should not
change as frequently as, for example, portfolio holdings information.1432 Requiring management
companies to report census information semi-annually would therefore place a burden on funds
without a commensurate increase in the value of the information received by the Commission.
We also considered alternatives to extend or shorten the filing period of Form N-CEN
from 75 days. While a shorter filing period, such as 60 days (similar to the proposal) would
1432

Unlike Form N-SAR, Form N-CEN will not require funds report information relating to fee and
expense information. Morningstar Comment Letter suggested semi-annual reporting of Form N-CEN
should fee and expense information be required on Form N-CEN.

413

provide more timely information to the Commission, 1433 it would also place a burden on funds
that need time to collect, verify, and report the required information to the Commission. Several
commenters supported extending the filing period to at least a 75-day period, arguing, among
other things, that a longer time period would help stagger the filing deadline from other end-ofmonth filing requirements, ensure that all accounting-related questions could be addressed more
completely, and allow the appropriate time needed to update systems to report information in an
XML format.1434 As discussed above, we have been persuaded by commenters to adopt a filing
period of 75 days after the fiscal year-end (for management companies) and calendar year-end
(for UITs). We believe that the 75-day filing period for Form N-CEN would appropriately
balance the staff’s need for timely information against the appropriate amount of time for funds
to collect, verify, and report information to the Commission.
Funds will have 18 months after the effective date to comply with the new reporting
requirements for Form N-CEN. An alternative would be to tier the compliance period, similar to
the compliance period for Form N-PORT, dependent on entity size. However, as discussed
above, we believe that it is less likely that smaller entities would need additional time to file
Form N-CEN because the requirement to file Form N-CEN is similar to the current requirement
to file Form N-SAR, and we expect that filers will prefer the updated, more efficient filing

1433

Several commenters supported the 60-day filing period (Carol Singer Comment Letter and State
Street), other commenters supported a longer filing period (MFS Comment Letter; CAI Comment
Letter; T. Rowe Price Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; and ICI Comment Letter). One
justification for a longer filing period provided by commenters is the time needed to update systems
to report information in an XML format (MFS Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; and ICI
Comment Letter).

format of Form N-CEN.1435 An additional alternative would be to extend the compliance period.
Some commenters suggested that the compliance period be extended to the later of 30 months
after adoption of Form N-CEN, or 18 months after the effective date of amendments requiring
funds to report liquidity information on Form N-CEN.1436 Given that much of the information
that will be reported on Form N-CEN is currently already reported by funds on Form N-SAR,
funds should already have processes and procedures in place to reduce the risk of inadvertent
errors. In addition, filings on Form N-CEN are not expected to be as technically complex nor
present comparable challenges in terms of reporting and data validation as filings on Form
N-PORT. As such, we expect that eighteen months will provide an adequate period of time for
funds, intermediaries, and other service providers to conduct the requisite operational changes to
their systems and to establish internal processes to prepare, validate, and file reports on Form
N-CEN with the Commission.
Funds will be required to report to the Commission information in Form N-CEN that will
provide staff an ability to identify investment risks and engage in further outreach as necessary.
Not requiring the information would substantially reduce the ability of the Commission to
oversee the fund industry. In addition, the information reported on Form N-CEN could be
important to investors to differentiate investment companies. An alternative to adopting Form
N-CEN would be to revise Form N-SAR. The Commission believes, however, that the outdated
technology associated with Form N-SAR requires the introduction of a new form in order to
1435

No commenters expressed an opinion specifically related to the filing format of N-CEN versus
N-SAR.

1436

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (suggesting a compliance date of 30 months after the adoption of
Form N-CEN); MFS Comment Letter (same); CAI Comment Letter (same); IDC Comment Letter
(same); ICI Comment Letter (suggesting the later of 30 months after the adoption of Form N-CEN or
18 months after the adoption of amendments requiring funds to report liquidity information on Form
N-CEN).

415

increase the benefits from the changes made to the reporting of census information. In addition,
there were no commenters who explicitly stated that Form N-SAR should not be replaced by
Form N-CEN.
The information that funds report on Form N-CEN will be made publicly available.
Additional alternatives include making some or all of the census information reported on the
form nonpublic. Specific information that could be made nonpublic includes securities lending
information,1437 service provider information,1438 and ETF authorized participant information.1439
Making more information reported on Form N-CEN nonpublic would reduce the amount of
information available to investors and therefore reduce the ability of investors to differentiate
investment companies. For example, one commenter recommended that details concerning
indemnification protection should be made nonpublic.1440 Nonetheless, we continue to believe
that public reporting is a necessary part of improving transparency regarding a fund’s securities
lending activities. Specifically, we believe that the information regarding indemnification
provisions is relevant to investors evaluating the risks associated with securities lending and
comparing those risks across funds.

1437

Some commenters suggested that certain securities lending information be kept non-public, including
information describing third-party lending arrangements (Fidelity Comment Letter).

1438

Some commenters suggested that certain service provider information be kept non-public, including
the identities of the pricing services used (Interactive Data Comment Letter) and the compensation
and other fee and expense arrangements (IDC Comment Letter).

1439

Some commenters suggested that disclosure of information on authorized participants could
discourage APs from participating in the ETF market (Invesco Comment Letter and BlackRock
Comment Letter), while others suggested that disclosure of the creation and redemption activity of
each AP is not helpful and is confusing to investors (BlackRock Comment Letter). See supra
footnote 1429 and accompanying text.

1440

See Fidelity Comment Letter.

416

One set of alternatives is to require funds to report additional information on Form
N-CEN, including additional new information that is not currently reported on Form N-SAR.1441
Another set of alternatives is to require funds to report less information on Form N-CEN. For
example, commenters expressed concern about providing new information related to securities
lending, service providers, and ETF authorized participants, and one alternative is to not require
this information to be provided.1442 One commenter, however, expressed concern about the
exclusion from Form N-CEN of particular items on Form N-SAR.1443 As discussed above, the
adoption of Form N-CEN and the rescission of Form N-SAR will improve the quality and utility
of the information investment companies report to the Commission. Although additional
information could further increase the benefits of Form N-CEN to Commission staff, investors,
and other interested parties, the benefits may not justify the initial and ongoing costs for
investment companies to report the information because the Commission believes that the
information we are requesting strikes an appropriate balance between the current information
needs of Commission staff as well as the developments in the fund industry and the reduction of
reporting burdens for registrants, particularly where information may be similarly disclosed or
reported elsewhere.1444

1441

Morningstar Comment Letter expressed concern that some of the information that would have been
eliminated under the proposal would decrease the availability of the information for investors and
other interested parties.

1442

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter; Interactive Data Comment Letter; and BlackRock Comment
Letter; supra footnote 1429 and accompanying text.

1443

Morningstar Comment Letter expressed concern that the exclusion of several Form N-SAR items
would then require a manual aggregation of information that would put comprehensive analysis of the
information out of reach for investors and fund boards unless they were using services from thirdparty providers that could aggregate such data.

1444

E.

Amendments to Forms Regarding Securities Lending Activities

1.

Introduction and Economic Baseline

We are also adopting amendments to Forms N-1A and N-3 to require certain disclosures
in fund Statements of Additional Information regarding securities lending activities, as well as
amendments to Form N-CSR to require the same information from closed-end funds.1445 We
proposed that similar requirements be included in fund financial statements as part of the
proposed amendments to Regulation S-X in order to allow investors to better understand the
income generated from, as well as the expenses associated with, a fund’s securities lending
activities.1446 Some commenters stated that some of the proposed requirements would yield
estimates that may be costly to audit, and that lengthy disclosure concerning securities lending
activity in a fund’s financial statements could detract from other financial statement
disclosures.1447 After consideration of these issues raised by commenters, we are adopting these
disclosure requirements as amendments to the fund registration forms (viz., Forms N-1A and

1445

See Item 19(i) of Form N-1A; Item 21(j) of Form N-3; Item 12 of Form N-CSR; see also supra
section II.F.

1446

The proposed requirements would have included disclosure in the fund’s financial statements of (1)
the gross income from securities lending, including income from cash collateral reinvestment; (2) the
dollar amount of all fees and/or compensation paid by the fund for securities lending activities and
related services, including borrower rebates and cash collateral management services; (3) the net
income from securities lending activities; (4) the terms governing the compensation of the securities
lending agent, including any revenue sharing split, with the related percentage split between the fund
and the securities lending agent, and/or any fee-for-service, and a description of services included; (5)
the details of any other fees paid directly or indirectly, including any fees paid directly by the fund for
cash collateral management and any management fee deducted from a pooled investment vehicle in
which cash collateral is invested; and (6) the monthly average of the value of portfolio securities on
loan. See proposed rule 6-03(m) of Regulation S-X; Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33624.

418

N-3) or, in the case of closed-end funds, as amendments to Form N-CSR, rather than as
amendments to Regulation S-X.1448
The final rules will require funds to disclose gross and net income from securities lending
activities, fees and compensation in total and broken out by enumerated types, and a description
of the services provided to the fund by the securities lending agent. The quantitative disclosure
requirements are discussed above in section II.F and also illustrated in Table 2 below.

Modifications from the proposed rule include, for example, replacing the proposed requirement

including any revenue split—with a requirement to report actual fees paid during the fund’s prior
fiscal year,1449 because commenters persuaded us that backward-looking dollar-based

Compare proposed rule 6-03(m)(4) of Regulation S-X with Item 19(i)(1)(ii) of Form N-1A; Item
21(j)(i)(B) of Form N-3 (same); Item 12(a)(1) of Form N-CSR.

419

requirements would yield clearer disclosure than would the proposed requirements and may also
enhance disclosure comparability across funds for investors and reduce preparation complexity
for funds. Additionally, as discussed above, while the proposed requirements would have
included disclosure of all fees and/or compensation paid for securities lending and related
services, we have determined that it is appropriate to clarify in the final rules the specific
categories of fees and/or compensation that are required to be disclosed.1450
The current set of fund registration statement and reporting requirements under Forms
N-1A, N-3, and N-CSR (for closed-end funds) is the baseline from which we discuss the
economic effects of today’s amendments. The parties that could be affected by these
amendments include funds that file or will file or update registration statements with the
Commission (and closed-end funds that file or will file reports on Form N-CSR), the
Commission itself, current and future investors of investment companies, and other market
participants that could be affected by the increase in the disclosure of fund securities lending
activity information.
We expect that many of the economic effects from the amendments to Forms N-1A, N-3,
and N-CSR will largely result from an increase in investor ability to make investment decisions
dependent on the more transparent disclosure in fund Statements of Additional Information (or in
Form N-CSR for closed-end funds), and the extent to which this transparency enhances the
ability of the Commission to utilize the updated disclosures. As discussed above, the economic
effects will depend on the extent to which the securities lending practices of all investment
companies become more transparent, and the ability of investors—and, in particular, individual

1450

Compare proposed rule 6-03(m)(2) with Item 19(i)(1)(ii) of Form N-1A; Item 21(j)(i)(B) of Form
N-3; and Item 12(a)(1) of Form N-CSR.

420

investors—to utilize Statements of Additional Information (and reports on Form N-CSR for
closed-end funds) to compare funds and to make investment decisions. As a result of these
factors, some of which are unquantifiable, the discussion below is largely qualitative.
2.

Benefits

The amendments to Forms N-1A, and N-3, and N-CSR will benefit investors by
enhancing the information funds disclose in the Statements of Additional Information (and
reports on Form N-CSR for closed-end funds). We continue to believe that because net earnings
from securities lending can contribute to the investment performance of a fund, the Commission,
investors and others would benefit from the additional transparency of securities lending fees on
the income from these activities. We further believe that the benefits of this additional
transparency justify the potential unintended consequences, highlighted by commenters and
discussed above, of public disclosure of certain information.1451
We have made modifications from the proposed requirements designed to, among other
things, enhance comparability of the disclosed information and potentially ameliorate some
concerns commenters expressed about the proposed required public disclosure of the terms
governing compensation of the securities lending agent. A commenter suggested that we could
facilitate comparability by specifying the fees for particular services that must be disclosed,1452
and we agree. We believe that these clarifications will enhance comparability of the disclosed
fees and compensation across funds, and indirectly benefit investors to the extent that other
entities, including investment advisers and broker-dealers, utilize the information to help
investors make more informed investment decisions.

1451

See supra footnotes 1212–1219 and accompanying text.

1452

See Fidelity Comment Letter.

421

The comparability of the disclosed fee and expense information may also depend on the
nature of the services provided to a particular fund in connection with its securities lending
activities. Accordingly, to further enhance the comparability of the disclosed information and
allow users to better assess fee and expense information, we have determined to specify that this
information should be provided on the basis of the services actually provided to the fund in its
most recent fiscal year and the discussion above provides some examples of the types of services
that could be enumerated to illustrate such services.1453
As mentioned above, we are persuaded that backward-looking dollar-based requirements
would yield clearer disclosure than would the proposed requirements and may also enhance
disclosure comparability across funds for investors and reduce preparation complexity for funds.
This change from the proposal allows investors and others to derive the informational benefit
from the disclosure without any potentially sensitive negotiated contractual terms being made
public.

Costs

We believe that registrants on average will likely incur minimal costs from our
amendments to Forms N-1A and N-3, including certain paperwork and other expenses discussed
below.1454

1453

Item 19(i)(2) of Form N-1A (requiring disclosure of the services provided to the fund by the
securities lending agent (for example and as applicable, locating borrowers, monitoring daily the
value of the loaned securities and collateral, requiring additional collateral as necessary, cash
collateral management, qualified dividend management, negotiation of loan terms, selection of
securities to be loaned, recordkeeping and account servicing, monitoring dividend activity and
material proxy votes relating to loaned securities, and arranging for return of loaned securities to the
fund at loan termination)); Item 21(j)(ii) of Form N-3 (same); Item 12(b) of Form N-CSR (same).

1454

See infra footnotes 1460–1461 and accompanying text. See also supra section III.B.3 for related cost
analysis associated with amendments to Form N-CSR.

422

Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed disclosure requirements could
yield information that would suggest, inaptly, that fees and expenses related to securities lending
activities among funds are readily compared and contrasted.1455 While there is the potential for
investor confusion with any disclosure, we believe we have mitigated these concerns through
changes that we are making from the proposal, such as switching from terms of compensation to
backward-looking dollar based requirements and providing clarification in the final rules as to
the types of fees and/or compensation that must be enumerated.
Another commenter expressed concerns that the proposed fee and expense information
could be used to evaluate the terms of a fund’s lending arrangements and could, without access
to additional information, result in potentially inappropriate conclusions that a fund negotiated its
arrangements poorly or was otherwise disadvantaged in its negotiations.1456 That commenter
noted that the revenue split can depend on numerous factors, including the range, amount, and
attractiveness of the securities a fund complex as a whole may make available for loan.1457 We
believe that the modifications we have made from the proposal, discussed above in Section
II.F.2, help ameliorate these concerns.
Commenters also expressed concerns with the proposed requirements based on the
currently nonpublic character of some of the information that would be required to be disclosed
publicly, particularly the proposed requirement to disclose the terms governing compensation of

requirement); see also RMA Comment Letter (concerning borrower rebates).

the securities lending agent.1458 Commenters argued that some funds currently enjoy privately
negotiated competitive advantages with securities lending services or counterparties that could
be jeopardized should their arrangements with their securities lending agents be made public.1459
First, we note that, as discussed herein, we have modified the rule from the proposal and are no
longer requiring certain pieces of information be disclosed—specifically, the terms of the
revenue split and the terms governing the compensation of the securities lending agent more
generally. We acknowledge, as these commenters have asserted, that enhanced transparency into
securities lending arrangements could put funds at a competitive disadvantage by affecting the
relative negotiating posture of funds that procure securities lending services, or dissuade
counterparties from engaging in securities lending altogether, which could drive up the costs of
lending services for funds. We believe, however, that the modifications to the proposed
requirements that we are making today eliminate the disclosures from the proposed requirements
that some commenters indicated could be the most sensitive while retaining the required
information that we think will be most useful to investors in understanding the expenses
associated with fund securities lending activities. This dollar-based requirement would also
eliminate the requirement that potentially sensitive negotiated contractual terms be disclosed.
As mentioned above, we are persuaded that backward-looking dollar-based requirements
would yield clearer disclosure than would the proposed requirements, thus mitigating potential

costs related to misinterpretation or a false sense of precision by investors. In addition, this
switch from terms of compensation to backward-looking dollar-based requirements could yield a
cost savings for filers by possibly reducing preparation complexity relative to the proposal.
We expect that funds would incur certain paperwork and other expenses in connection
with the new requirements. For funds that file registration statements on Forms N-1A and N-3,
as discussed in detail below, we estimate that these paperwork expenses would be, in the
aggregate, about $1.3 million each year.1460 Funds would also incur initial one-time costs
associated with establishing systems and procedures for compliance. We estimate that these
expenses would be, in the aggregate, about $3.9 million.1461 For closed-end funds that file

1460

Below, we estimate that 9,502 and 16 funds per year could file registration statements on Forms
N-1A and N-3, respectively. See infra text following footnote 1591. Below, we estimate that funds
will, on average, incur 0.5 burden hours per fund per year to comply with the new registration
statement requirements. See id. Therefore, in the aggregate, we estimate that such funds would incur
about 5,038 burden hours to comply with these requirements. (9,502 funds + 16 funds) × 0.5 burden
hours per fund per year = 4,759 burden hours per year. The Commission estimates the wage rate
associated with these burden hours based on salary information for the securities industry compiled
by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. The estimated wage figure is based on
published rates for intermediate accountants and attorneys, modified to account for an 1,800-hour
work year; multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead; and
adjusted to account for the effects of inflation, yielding effective hourly rates of $160 and $386,
respectively. See Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Report on Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013. We estimate that intermediate accountants and
attorneys would divide their time equally, yielding an estimated hourly wage of $273 per hour. ($160
per hour for intermediate accountants + $386 per hour for attorneys) ÷ 2 = $273 per hour. Based on
the Commission’s estimate of 4,759 burden hours per year and the estimated wage rate of $273 per
hour, the total annual paperwork expenses for funds associated with the new registration statement
requirements are approximately $1,299,207. 4,759 hours per year × $273 per hour = $1,299,207 per
year.

1461

Below, we estimate that funds will, on average, incur 1.5 one-time burden hours in the first year to
comply with the new registration statement requirements. See infra text following footnote 1591.
Therefore, in the aggregate, we estimate that such funds will incur about 15,114 one-time burden
hours to comply with these requirements. (9,502 funds + 16 funds) × 1.5 one-time burden hours =
14,277 one-time burden hours. Based on the Commission’s estimate of 14,277 one-time burden
hours and the estimated wage rate of $273 per hour, the total one-time paperwork expenses for funds
associated with the new registration statement requirements are approximately $3,897,621. 14,277
one-time burden hours × $273 per hour = $3,897,621.

425

annual reports on Form N-CSR, we estimate that the new requirements will increase the hour
burden associated with the paperwork costs of Form N-CSR for closed-end funds by an
additional 2 burden hours with an additional internal cost burden of $648 per fund in the first
year,1462 and an additional 0.5 hours with an additional internal cost burden of $162 per fund for
filings in subsequent years.1463
4.

Alternatives

The Commission has also explored other ways to modernize and improve the utility,
quality, and consistency of the information that funds report to the Commission and to investors
in the financial statements required in shareholder reports and other registration statements.
Commission staff examined how the information funds provide to the Commission and to
investors could be made more informative and more consistent across funds. Alternatives to the
amendments to Forms N-1A, N-3, and N-CSR to require certain disclosures relate to information
that funds report and the location in which the information is reported.
One alternative would be simply to not adopt any new securities lending disclosure
amendments. We believe, however, that information regarding securities lending activities can
provide investors with insights into fund activities, foster comparability across funds, and
contribute to investors making informed investment decisions.
We are adopting amendments to Forms N-1A, N-3, and Form N-CSR to require certain
disclosures regarding securities lending activities. Alternatively, we could require these
disclosures to be made in the financial statements, in Form N-PORT, or in Form N-CEN. Given
that our objective was to make this information available to investors and other users of the data,

1462

See infra footnote 1610 and accompanying text; see also infra section IV.D.7.

1463

See infra footnote 1611 and accompanying text; see also infra section IV.D.7.

426

after consideration of comments we have decided that the Statement of Additional Information
(and, with respect to closed-end funds, reports on Form N-CSR) is an appropriate place for funds
to be required to disclose this information.
Finally, we could adopt different reporting requirements. For example, we could, as
proposed, have required funds to disclose the terms of compensation in securities lending
agreements rather than the backward-looking, dollar-based values. However, as discussed
previously, commenters suggested, that doing so could result in the loss of privately negotiated
competitive advantages or a decrease in the number of counterparties willing to participate in the
securities lending market, and we believe that the requirements, as adopted eliminate the
disclosures from the proposed requirements that commenters indicated could be the most
sensitive while retaining the required information that we think will be most useful to investors
in understanding the expenses associated with fund securities lending activities. Hence, we have
decided against such an alternative.
F.

Other Alternatives to the Reporting Requirements

The Commission has explored additional ways to modernize and improve the utility and
the quality of the information that funds provide to the Commission and to investors. The
Commission has considered many alternatives to the individual elements contained in new Form
N-PORT, amendments to Regulation S-X, and new Form N-CEN; alternatives specific to each of
the new reporting requirements are discussed above. The following discussion addresses other
significant alternatives which involve aspects of fund reporting that pertain to more than one of
the new reporting requirements.
The Commission considered the information that will be required on Form N-PORT as
compared to the information on Form N-CEN. Commission staff considered the benefits to
having the information more frequently updated as well as the cost to funds to report the
427

information. Although the reporting of information on a more frequent basis imposes additional
costs on funds, Commission staff believes the information that will be reported more frequently
on Form N-PORT, relative to the annual reporting on Form N-CEN, is necessary for the
Commission’s oversight activities and could be important to other interested third-parties.
Commission staff also considered the benefits of identification information to link information
between forms and with other sources of information, with the costs to funds to obtain and report
the identification information on the new forms.
The Commission is requiring that investment companies file Form N-PORT and Form NCEN in an XML structured data format. One alternative is to not structure the information. As
discussed, the ability of Commission staff, investors, third-party information providers, and other
potential users to utilize the information is dependent on the efficiency with which the
information investment companies provide can be compiled and aggregated. Commission staff
believes that the affected parties would experience substantially less benefit from the reporting of
investment company information if the information is not structured because of the time it would
take to parse the information and the potential for errors in data due to the fact that unstructured
data cannot be validated during the filing process. In addition, based on the Commission’s
understanding of current practices, it is likely that many investment companies and third party
service providers have systems in place to accommodate the use of XML. Furthermore, based
on our experiences with Forms N-MFP and PF, both of which require filers to report information
in an XML format, we continue to believe that requiring funds to report information on Forms
N-PORT and N-CEN in an XML format will provide the information that we seek in a timely
and cost-effective manner. Therefore, requiring information in a format such as XML should
impose minimal costs. The Commission will require funds to file certain attachments to their

428

reports on Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN, and these attachments would not be required in a
structured data format. The Commission believes that only marginal benefits would result from
requiring funds to file these attachments in a structured, XML format due to the narrative format
of the information provided.
The technology used to structure the data could affect the benefits and costs associated
with the adopted rules, and we have therefore considered alternative formats for structuring the
data.1464 Some commenters suggested XBRL, a tagged system that is based on XML and was
created specifically for the purpose of reporting financial and business information,1465 so as to
leverage existing data definitions and reduce implementation costs.1466 However, as noted earlier
we believe that requiring funds to report information on Form N-PORT in XML will be both
efficient and cost-effective for funds. Sending a data file from a sender to a recipient requires
many conditions to be satisfied, and among those of crucial importance to regulatory data
collection are compact transmission and efficient validation. XML Schema provides a widely
used validation framework for XML, and is supported in all modern programming languages.
The nature of the information we are collecting also lends itself to XML schema for almost all

1464

One commenter suggested a pre-formatted web portal or web form as well as the further development
of inline structured data to ease reporting burdens (Schnase Comment Letter). We believe, however,
that the volume of data for a fund to report on Form N-PORT would not lend itself to a manual entry
approach, although we are considering the possibility of providing an online form for filers to use at
their option for filing Form N-CEN, as we have with some other Commission Forms, such as Form
13F.

1465

See, e.g., XBRL US Comment Letter; Deloitte Comment Letter; but see Morningstar Comment Letter
(“Extensible Business Reporting Language has had very limited success, and certain aspects of the
standard are too lenient for regular data validation.”).

1466

For example, public companies currently use XBRL taxonomies to file reports with the SEC,
including investment companies that voluntarily file structured data on Form N-CSR.

429

validation,1467 and the arithmetic validations not supported natively in XML Schema are
straightforwardly expressible in any number of languages. For this data set, the additional
flexibility offered by a broader XML based framework such as XBRL incurs data volume and
processing overhead with little incremental benefit; for example, the information funds will
report will be as of a single reporting date, the units of measurement are predetermined or are
constrained by the data type, and there is little value in customizing the content or presentation.
Finally, one commenter stated that we should not require funds to directly report
information on their own behalf, but instead require other entities such as transfer agents and
custodians to report information on behalf of funds.1468 Given our expertise and experience in
regulating, examining, and overseeing funds, including fund reporting, recordkeeping, and
compliance, we continue to believe that obtaining such information directly from funds is
appropriate.
IV.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
New forms Form N-CEN and Form N-PORT contain “collections of information” within

the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”).1469 In addition, the amendments
to Articles 6 and 12 of Regulation S-X will impact the collections of information under rules
30e-1 and 30e-2 of the Investment Company Act,1470 and the amendments to Forms N-1A, N-2,

1467

Some commenters discussed the additional benefits from the types of validation that can be
conducted with XBRL (XBRL US Comment Letter and AICPA Comment Letter).

1468

See Federated Comment Letter (“It would also reduce the reporting burden on funds for the
Commission to acquire information directly from custodians and transfer agents, which are proficient
in maintaining and reporting portfolio holdings and other information.”).

1469

44 U.S.C. §§ 3501 through 3521.

1470

The paperwork burden from Regulation S-X is imposed by the rules and forms that relate to
Regulation S-X and, thus, is reflected in the analysis of those rules and forms. To avoid a PRA
inventory reflecting duplicative burdens and for administrative convenience, we have previously
assigned a one-hour burden to Regulation S-X.

430

N-3, N-4, N-6, and N-CSR under the Investment Company Act and Securities Act will impact
the collections of information under those forms. Furthermore, implementation of new Forms
N-PORT and N-CEN will coincide with rescission of Forms N-Q and N-SAR, thus eliminating
the collections of information associated with those forms and impacting the collections of
information under Form N-CSR.
The titles for the existing collections of information are: “Form N-Q – Quarterly
Schedule of Portfolio Holdings of Registered Management Investment Company” (OMB Control
No. 3235-0578);1471 “Form N-SAR under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Semi-Annual
Report for Registered Investment Companies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0330); Rule 30e-1 under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, Reports to Stockholders of Management Companies”
(OMB Control No. 3235-0025); “Rule 30e-2 pursuant to Section 30(e) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940. Reports to Shareholders of Unit Investment Trusts” (OMB Control No.
3235-0494); “Form N-CSR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, Certified Shareholder Report of Registered Management Investment
Companies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0570); “Form N-1A under the Securities Act of 1933 and
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Registration Statement of Open-End Management
Investment Companies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0307); “Form N-2 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and Securities Act of 1933, Registration Statement of Closed-End
Management Investment Companies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0026); “Form N-3 Under the

Currently, there is a collection of information associated with rule 30b1-5 under the Investment
Company Act. See rule 30b1-5, ‘Quarterly Report’ Originally submitted and approved as Proposed
Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, ‘Quarterly Report’” (OMB Control No.
3235-0577). Rule 30b1-5 is the rule that requires certain funds to file Form N-Q. Among other
things, we are rescinding Form N-Q and requiring certain funds to file Form N-PORT pursuant to
new rule 30b1-9. With this in mind, we are discontinuing the information collection for rule 30b1-5.

274.11c) Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Registration Statement of Separate

Company Act of 1940, Registration Statement of Separate Accounts Organized as Unit
Investment Trusts that Offer Variable Life Insurance Policies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0503).
The titles for the new collections of information are: “Form N-CEN Under the Investment
Company Act, Annual Report for Registered Investment Companies” (OMB Control No. 32350729 for N-CEN) and “Form N-PORT Under the Investment Company Act, Monthly Portfolio
Investments Report” (OMB Control No. 3235-0730).
We published notice soliciting comments on the collection of information requirements
in the Proposing Release and submitted the proposed collections of information to the Office of
Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR
1320.11. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number.
The Commission is adopting new forms Form N-CEN and Form N-PORT and
amendments to Regulation S-X and the relevant registration forms, as well as the rescission of
Forms N-Q and Form N-SAR, as part of a set of reporting and disclosure reforms. These
reforms are designed to harness the benefits of advanced technology and to modernize the fund
reporting regime in order to help investors and other market participants better assess different

432

fund products and to assist the Commission in carrying out our regulatory functions. We discuss
below the collection of information burdens associated with these reforms.
A.

Portfolio Reporting

1.

Form N-PORT

Certain funds will be required to file an electronic monthly report on Form N-PORT
within thirty days after the end of each month. Form N-PORT is intended to improve
transparency of information about funds’ portfolio holdings and facilitate oversight of funds.
The information required by Form N-PORT will be data-tagged in XML format. The
respondents to Form N-PORT will be management investment companies (other than money
market funds and small business investment companies) and UITs that operate as ETFs.
Compliance with Form N-PORT will be mandatory for all such funds. Responses to the
reporting requirements will be kept confidential for reports filed with respect to the first two
months of each quarter; the third month of the quarter will not be kept confidential, but made
public sixty days after the quarter end.
In the Proposing Release, we estimated that 10,710 funds1472 would be required to file, on
a monthly basis, a complete report on proposed Form N-PORT reporting certain information
regarding the fund and its portfolio holdings. Based on our experience with other structured data
filings, we estimated that funds would prepare and file their reports on proposed Form N-PORT
by either (1) licensing a software solution and preparing and filing the reports in house, or (2)
retaining a service provider to provide data aggregation, validation and/or filing services as part
of the preparation and filing of reports on proposed Form N-PORT on behalf of the fund. We
1472

This estimate includes 8,731 mutual funds (excluding money market funds), 1,411 ETFs and 568
closed-end funds and is based on ICI statistics as of December 31, 2014, available at
http://www.ici.org/research/stats.

433

estimated that 35% of funds (3,749 funds) would license a software solution and file reports on
proposed Form N-PORT in house.1473 We further estimated that each fund that files reports on
proposed Form N-PORT in house would require an average of approximately 44 burden hours to
compile (including review of the information), tag, and electronically file a report on proposed
Form N-PORT for the first time1474 and an average of approximately 14 burden hours for
subsequent filings.1475 Therefore, we estimated the per fund average annual hour burden
associated with proposed Form N-PORT for 3,749 fund filers would be 198 hours for the first

1473

See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra footnote 33, at 47945 (adopting amendments to
Form N-MFP and noting that approximately 35% of money market funds that report information on
Form N-MFP license a software solution from a third party that is used to assist the funds to prepare
and file the required information).

1474

We anticipated that these funds would use the same software that was used to generate reports on
Form N-Q and that the software vendor offering the Form N-Q software would likely offer an update
to that software to handle reports on Form N-PORT. Accordingly, we estimated the burden
associated with information that is currently filed on Form N-Q and that would also be filed on Form
N-PORT to generally be the same – 10.5 hours per filing. With respect to new data that would be
required by Form N-PORT that was not required by Form N-Q, we generally estimated that it would
initially take up to 10 hours to connect the software to the new data points. However, because we
understand risk metrics data may be located on a different system than portfolio holdings data and
because current reporting requirements do not require funds to have a process in place for these two
systems to work together, with respect to the new risk metrics data that would be required by Form NPORT, we estimated that it would initially take up to 15 hours to connect the risk metrics data to the
software and that, once connected, it would take 5 hours to program the risk metrics software to
output the required data to the Form N-PORT software. Additionally, we added another 3.5 hours to
our estimated initial burden to account for the increased amount of information that would be required
to be reported on Form N-PORT, but that is not currently required by Form N-Q. See infra footnote
1475 (discussing the additional 30% burden added to the current Form N-Q estimate). We also noted
that funds that are part of a larger fund complex may realize certain economies of scale when
preparing and filing reports on proposed Form N-PORT. For purposes of our analysis, however, we
took a conservative approach and did not account for such potential economies of scale.

1475

We anticipated that most of the burden associated with licensing a software solution, as discussed
above, would be a one-time burden. Accordingly, we estimated approximately 14 hours per fund for
subsequent filings. This estimate is based on the 10.5 hours currently estimated for filings on Form
N-Q, plus 30% to account for the amount of additional information that would be required to be filed
on Form N-PORT. Additionally, because we believe that the required information is generally
maintained by funds pursuant to other regulatory requirements or in the ordinary course of business,
for the purposes of our analysis, we did not ascribed any time to collecting the required information.
See also supra footnote 1474 (noting that our estimates do not account for economies of scale).

434

year1476 and 168 hours for each subsequent year.1477 Amortized over three years, the average
aggregate annual hour burden would be 178 hours per fund.1478
In the Proposing Release, we further estimated that 65% of funds (6,962 funds) would
retain the services of a third party to provide data aggregation, validation and/or filing services as
part of the preparation and filing of reports on proposed Form N-PORT on the fund’s behalf.1479
Because reports on Form N-PORT would be filed in a structured format and more frequently
than current portfolio holdings reports (i.e., Form N-CSR and Form N-Q), we anticipated that
funds and their third-party service providers would move to automate the aggregation and
validation process to the extent they do not already use an automated process for portfolio
holdings reports. For these funds, we estimated that each fund would require an average of
approximately 60 burden hours to compile and review the information with the service provider
prior to electronically filing the report for the first time1480 and an average of approximately 9

1476

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 44 hours) + (11 filings x 14 hours) =
198 burden hours in the first year.

1477

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 14 hours = 168 burden hours in each
subsequent year.

1478

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (198 + (168 x 2)) / 3 = 178.

1479

See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra footnote 33, at 47945 (adopting amendments to
Form N-MFP and noting that approximately 65% of money market funds that report information on
Form N-MFP retain the services of a third party to provide data aggregation and validation services as
part of the preparation and filing of reports on Form N-MFP).

1480

In order to be able to automate the process of communicating data to a third-party service provider so
that it can be reported on Form N-PORT, we estimated that it would initially take a fund 60 hours to
either procure software and integrate it into its systems or, alternatively, to write its own software.
For those funds that already have an automated portfolio reporting process in place, we estimated that
they would initially incur the same burden as those funds that license a software solution and file
reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house. For these latter funds, however, we used the higher
burden hours estimated for using a third party service provider in order to be conservative in our
estimates because we lacked data on the number of funds that currently have an automated portfolio
reporting process in place. See supra footnote 1474 (discussing the burdens associated with licensing
a software solution and filing reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house); see also supra footnote
1474 (noting that our estimates did not account for economies of scale).

435

burden hours for subsequent filings.1481 Therefore, we estimated the per fund average annual
hour burden associated with proposed Form N-PORT for 6,962 funds would be 159 hours for the
first year1482 and 108 hours for each subsequent year.1483 Amortized over three years, the
average aggregate annual hour burden would be 125 hours per fund.1484
In sum, we estimated that filing reports on proposed Form N-PORT would impose an
average total annual hour burden of 1,537,572 on applicable funds. 1485
In the Proposing Release, we noted that in addition to the costs associated with the hour
burdens discussed above, funds would also incur other external costs in connection with reports
on proposed Form N-PORT. Based on our experience with other structured data filings, we
estimated that funds that would file reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house would license a
third-party software solution to assist in filing their reports at an average cost of $4,805 per fund
per year.1486 In addition, we estimated that funds that would use a service provider to prepare

1481

We anticipated that most of the burden associated with third-party aggregation and validation would
be the result of creating an automated process, as discussed above, and thus would be a one-time
burden. Accordingly, we estimated approximately 9 hours per fund for subsequent filings. This
estimate was based on the 10.5 hours currently estimated for filings on Form N-Q, plus 30% to
account for the amount of additional information that would be required to be filed on Form N-PORT,
and subtracting 5 hours in recognition of the use of a third-party service provider to assist in the
preparation and filing of reports on the form. Additionally, because we believe that the required
information is generally maintained by funds pursuant to other regulatory requirements or in the
ordinary course of business, for the purposes of our analysis, we did not ascribe any time to collecting
the required information. See also supra footnote 1474 (noting that our estimates did not account for
economies of scale).

1482

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 60 hours) + (11 filings x 9 hours) =
159 burden hours per year.

1483

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 9 hours = 108.

1484

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (159 + (108 x 2)) / 3 = 125.

1485

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (3,749 x 178 hours) + (6,962 x 125 hours) =
1,537,572.

1486

We estimated that money market funds that file reports on Form N-MFP in house license a third-party
software solution for approximately $3,696 per fund per year. Due to the increased volume and
complexity of the information that will be filed in reports pursuant to proposed Form N-PORT, we

436

and file reports on proposed Form N-PORT would pay an average fee of $11,440 per fund per
year for the services of that third-party provider.1487 In sum, we estimated that all applicable
funds would incur on average, in the aggregate, external annual costs of $97,674,221.1488
We received two comments on proposed Form N-PORT’s estimated hour and costs
burdens. One commenter, who submitted a comment letter on behalf of certain asset
management firms focused on alternative investment strategies, stated that the proposed
estimates of hours and costs were not realistic.1489 The commenter stated that, based on its
outreach, several firms were currently spending more than 198 hours per year on investment
company quarterly reporting. 1490 This commenter additionally noted that Form N-PORT
requires more information than current quarterly reports, particularly for funds that implement
“alternative” strategies, and must be filed monthly. The commenter also indicated that at least
one firm they reached out to anticipated hiring one or more full-time equivalents to handle the
reporting requirements. We do not agree with the commenter’s suggestion that the burden
increased our external cost estimate for funds filing in house on proposed Form N-PORT by 30% (or
$1,109).
1487

We estimated that money market funds that file reports on Form N-MFP through a third-party service
provider pay approximately $8,800 per fund per year. Due to the increased volume and complexity
of the information that will be filed in reports pursuant to proposed Form N-PORT, we increased our
estimate for funds filing through a third-party service provider on proposed Form N-PORT by 30%
(or $2,640).

1488

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (3,749 funds that will file reports on proposed
Form N-PORT in house x $4,809 per fund, per year) + (6,962 funds that will file reports on proposed
Form N-PORT using a third-party service provider x $11,440 per fund, per year) = $97,674,221.

1489

See Simpson Thacher Comment Letter.

1490

See id. The commenter noted that in the Proposing Release that we estimated 198 burden hours in the
first year, and 168 hours thereafter “for each investment company.” As noted in the proposing
release, 168 hours was the Commission’s “per fund” burden hour estimate for the first year for funds
preparing and filing the reports in house, where “fund” is a registered management investment
company and any separate series thereof. It is not clear from the comment letter whether firms that
provided estimates to the commenter were providing estimated burdens for quarterly reporting per
fund series, per investment company, or per fund complex. For purposes of the PRA, however, we
conservatively assume it is per fund series.

437

estimates it compiled based on outreach to firms regarding their current time spent on quarterly
reporting is necessarily inconsistent with the burden estimates we proposed. We understand that
the burden will vary across funds depending on the size of the fund, the size of the fund complex,
and the complexity of the portfolio, among other factors. The burden for some funds will exceed
our estimate, and the burden for others will be less due to the nature of the fund. Also, while it is
true that Form N-PORT will require more frequent reporting and information not currently
required for quarterly reporting, not all requirements for quarterly reporting, such as reporting on
a T+0 basis, will be required on Form N-PORT. Thus, the commenter’s estimates, which
revolved around alternative strategy funds, appear to be within, but on the high end of the
Commission’s estimates.
Another commenter suggested that complying with Form N-PORT reporting
requirements could cost $800,000 to $1,500,000 for the fund complex (of approximately 250
funds).1491 The commenter specified that the initial burden associated with the proposed
requirements would be over 6000 hours in total to conduct analysis, develop and test newly
created interfaces between the reporting solution and internal and external data sources in an
attempt to automate the collection, aggregation, and validation of data reported on Form NPORT. The commenter further asserted that ongoing reporting requirements on Form N-PORT
may require a support team of up to 10-15 members. The commenter’s estimates of initial
burden hours are therefore approximately 24 hours, based on a complex of 250 funds, lower than
our proposed estimated initial filing burden of 44 hours per fund for fund filers filing in-house,
and 60 hours per fund for fund filers retaining a third party service provider. Assuming the
support team was 15 members (i.e., the high end of the range set forth by the commenter), and a
1491

See Invesco Comment Letter.

438

2,000 hours work year, the commenter’s annual estimated burden to file reports on Form NPORT would be approximately 120 hours per fund.1492 This is in the range of our proposed
annual estimate of 168 hours per year for fund filers filing in house and 108 hours per year for
fund filers retaining a third-party service provider. Finally, assuming that the dollar estimates
that the commenter cited of between $800,000 to $1,500,000 were additional external costs of
reporting on Form N-PORT, the commenter’s estimated external costs would be between $3,200
and $6,000 per fund. These are in the range of our estimated external costs per fund (not
including monetization of internal burden hours) of $4,805 per year for fund filers filing in
house, and $11,440 per year for fund filers using a service provider.
As discussed above, our adoption includes some modifications from the proposal that
address concerns raised by commenters and that are intended, in part, to decrease reporting and
implementation burdens relative to the proposal.1493 We believe that our modifications from the
proposal will reduce the estimated initial burden hours associated with implementation of Form
N-PORT reporting requirements, relative to the proposal, particularly for funds that will be
required to report risk metrics or custom derivatives transactions but will not affect external costs
or ongoing burden hours. Based on our review of funds and the new reporting requirements, we
believe that, on average, the initial burden to file reports on Form N-PORT will decrease by 0.5
hours, resulting in an initial burden of 43.5 hours per fund for the 35% of funds that choose to
file reports on Form N-PORT in-house, and 59.5 hours for the 65% of funds that choose to retain
a third-party service provider.1494

1492

15 members x 2000 hours = 30,000 hours. 30,000 hours / 250 funds = 120 hours.

We have revised our estimate of the number of funds that will file Form N-PORT upward
from 10,710 funds to 11,382 funds to reflect updates to the industry data figures that were
utilized in the Proposing Release.1495 We continue to estimate that 35% of funds (3,984 funds,
updated from 3,749 in our proposal) will license a software solution and file reports on Form NPORT in house, and 65% of funds (7,398 funds, updated from 6,962 funds in our proposal) will
retain the services of a third party to provide data aggregation, validation and/or filing services as
part of the preparation and filing of reports on Form N-PORT.1496 The Commission estimates
that, on an annual basis, funds generally will incur in the aggregate 1,959,423 burden hours in
the first year and an additional 1,468,296 burden hours for filings in subsequent years in order to
comply with Form N-PORT filing requirements.1497 Amortized over three years, the total annual
hour burden of filing reports on Form N-PORT will be 1,632,005 hours, with an average annual
hour burden of 143 hours per fund.1498

initial burden of 60 hours per fund in the Proposing Release for the 65% of funds that choose to retain
a third-party service provider).
1495

This estimate of 11,382 funds includes 9,039 mutual funds (excluding money market funds), 1,594
ETFs (including eight ETFs organized as UITs and 1,586 ETFs that are management investment
companies), and 749 closed-end funds (excluding SBICs). Based on data obtained from the ICI and
reports filed by registrants on Form N-SAR. See supra footnote 1259 and accompanying and
following text; see also 2016 ICI Fact Book, supra footnote 2, at 22, 176.

1496

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 3,749 funds = 11,382 funds x 0.35. 7,398
funds = 11,382 funds x 0.65.

1497

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 1,959,423 hours in the first year = (3,984
funds x 43.5 hours for the first filing for funds filing in-house) + (3,984 funds x 14 hours for each
subsequent filing x 11 filings) + (7,398 funds x 59.5 hours for the first filing for funds retaining a
third-party service provider) + (7,398 funds x 9 hours for each subsequent filing x 11 filings).
1,468,296 hours in subsequent years = (3,984 funds filing in-house x 14 hours x 12 filings) + (7,398
funds retaining a third-party service provider x 9 hours x 12 filings).

1498

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 1,632,005 hours amortized over three years
= (1,959,423 hours + (1,468,296 hours x 2)) / 3. 143 hours per fund = 1,632,005 hours / 11,382 funds.

We further estimate the total annual external cost burden of compliance with the
information collection requirements of Form N-PORT will be $103,787,680, or $9,118 per
fund.1499
2.

Rescission of Form N-Q

In connection with our adoption of Form N-PORT, and as proposed, our reforms will
rescind Form N-Q in order to eliminate unnecessarily duplicative reporting requirements. The
rescission of Form N-Q will affect all management investment companies required to file reports
on the form.
In our proposal, we estimated that each fund requires an average of approximately 21
hours per year to prepare and file two reports on Form N-Q annually, for a total estimated annual
burden of 219,513 hours.1500 We received no comments on this estimate.
We have revised our estimate of the number of funds that would file Form N-Q upward
from 10,453 funds to 11,863 funds to reflect updates to the industry data figures that were
utilized in the Proposing Release.1501 Accordingly, we estimate that, in the aggregate, our
rescission would eliminate 249,123 annual burden hours that would be associated with filing

1499

These estimates are based on the following calculations: $103,776,240 = (3,984 funds x $4,805) +
7,398 funds x $11,440). $9,118 per fund = $103,787,680 / 11,382 funds.

1500

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 219,513 hours per year = 10,453 funds x 10.5
hours x 2 filings per year. Management investment companies currently are required to file a
quarterly report on Form N-Q after the close of the first and third quarters of each fiscal year.

1501

This estimate of 11,863 funds includes 9,520 mutual funds (including money market funds), 1,594
ETFs, and 749 closed-end funds (excluding SBICs). Based on data obtained from the ICI and reports
filed by registrants on Form N-SAR. See supra footnote 1259 and accompanying and following text;

certification requirement or with preparation of reports on Form N-Q in general.
B.

Census Reporting

1.

Form N-CEN

As amended, rule 30a-1 will require all funds to file reports on Form N-CEN with the
Commission on an annual basis.1503 Similar to current Form N-SAR, Form N-CEN requires
reporting with the Commission of certain census-type information. However, unlike Form
N-SAR, which requires semi-annual reporting for all management investment companies, Form
N-CEN requires annual reporting.1504 Form N-CEN will be a collection of information under the
PRA and is designed to facilitate the Commission’s oversight of funds and its ability to monitor
trends and risks. This new collection of information will be mandatory for all funds, and
responses will not be kept confidential.
In the Proposing Release, we estimated that the Commission would receive an average of
3,146 reports per year, based on the number of existing Form N-SAR filers.1505 We estimated
that management investment companies would each spend as much as 13.35 hours annually,
preparing and filing reports on proposed Form N-CEN.1506 The Commission further estimated
that UITs, including separate account UITs, would each spend as much as 9.11 hours annually,

1502

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 249,123 hours per year = 11,863 funds x 10.5
hours x 2 filings per year.

1503

For purposes of the PRA analysis, the burdens associated with amended rule 30a-1 are included in the
collection of information estimates of Form N-CEN.

1504

UITs are only required to file Form N-SAR on an annual basis. See rule 30a-1.

1505

This estimate was based on 2,419 management companies and 727 UITs filing reports on Form
N-SAR as of December 31, 2014.

1506

Our estimate included the hourly burden associated with registering/maintaining LEIs for the
registrant/funds, which would be required to be included in reports on Form N-CEN.

442

preparing and filing reports on proposed Form N-CEN, since a UIT would be required to respond
to fewer items.1507
As discussed below, we estimated that management investment companies each spend as
much as 15.35 hours preparing and filing each report on Form N-SAR. We noted that we
generally sought with proposed Form N-CEN, where appropriate, to simplify and decrease the
census-type reporting burdens placed on registrants by current Form N-SAR. For example, we
noted that proposed Form N-CEN would reduce the number of attachments that may need to be
filed with the reports and largely eliminate financial statement-type information from the reports.
Additionally, we noted our belief that reports in XML on proposed Form N-CEN would be less
burdensome to produce than the reports on Form N-SAR currently required to be filed using
outdated technology. Accordingly, for management investment companies we believe the
estimated hour burden for filing reports on proposed Form N-CEN should be a reduced burden
from the hour burden associated with Form N-SAR.1508 As such, we estimated that the annual
hour burden for management companies would be 13.35 per report on proposed Form N-CEN,
down from 15.35 hours per report for Form N-SAR.
In the Proposing Release, we also noted that UITs may, however, experience an increase
in the hour burden associated with census-type reporting if proposed Form N-CEN were adopted
because UITs would be required to respond to more items in the form than they are currently

1507

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33675.

1508

We note that reports on Form N-CEN would be filed annually, rather than semi-annually as in the
case of reports on Form N-SAR. Thus, while we estimated that the burden associated with each
report on Form N-CEN for management companies would be two hours less than the burden
associated with each report on Form N-SAR, we estimated that the annual Form N-CEN burden for
management companies would actually be 17.35 hours less than that associated with Form N-SAR.
This estimate is based on the following calculation: 15.35 Form N-SAR burden hours × 2 reports) –
13.35 Form N-CEN burden hours = 17.35 hours.

443

required to respond to under Form N-SAR. For example, UITs would be required to provide
certain background information and attachments in their reports on proposed Form N-CEN,
which they are not currently required to provide in their reports on Form N-SAR. As a result, we
increased the estimated annual hour burden for each UIT from 7.11 hours in the currently
approved collection for Form N-SAR to 9.11 hours for proposed Form N-CEN.
We also noted our belief that, in the first year reports on the form are filed, funds may
require additional time to prepare and file reports. We estimated that, for the first year, each
fund would each require 20 additional hours.1509 Accordingly, we estimated that management
investment companies would each require 33.35 annual burden hours in the first year1510 and
13.35 annual burden hours in each subsequent year for preparing and filing reports on proposed
Form N-CEN. Additionally, we estimated that UITs would each require 29.11 annual burden
hours in the first year1511 and 9.11 annual burden hours in each subsequent year for preparing and
filing reports on proposed Form N-CEN.
In the Proposing Release, we further estimated that the average annual hour burden per
response for proposed Form N-CEN for the first year would be 32.37 hours1512 and 12.37 hours
in subsequent years.1513 Amortizing the burden over three years, we estimated that the average

1509

This additional time may be attributable to, among other things, reviewing and collecting new or
revised data pursuant to the Form N-CEN requirements or changing the software currently used to
generate reports on Form N-SAR in order to output similar data in a different format.

1510

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 13.35 hours for each filing + 20 additional hours
for the first filing = 33.35 hours.

1511

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 9.11 hours for each filing + 20 additional hours
for the first filing = 29.11 hours.

1512

This estimate was based on the following calculation: ((2,419 management investment companies ×
33.35 hours) + (727 UITs × 29.11 hours)) ÷ 3,146 total funds = 32.37 hours.

1513

This estimate was based on the following calculation: ((2,419 management investment companies ×
13.35 hours) + (727 UITs × 9.11 hours)) ÷ 3,146 total funds = 12.37 hours.

444

annual hour burden per fund per year would be 19.041514 and the total aggregate annual hour
burden would be 59,900.1515
With respect to the initial filing of a report on Form N-CEN, we estimated an external
cost of $220 per fund and, with respect to subsequent filings, we estimated an annual external
cost of $120 per fund.1516 We estimated the amortized annual external cost per fund would be
$153.1517 We also estimated that no external cost burden was associated with Form N-SAR.
External costs include the cost of goods and services, which with respect to reports on Form
N-CEN, would include the costs of registering and maintaining an LEI for the registrant/
funds.1518 In sum, we estimated that all applicable funds would incur, in the aggregate, external
annual costs of $1,748,637.1519
One commenter expressed the general belief that requiring census-type data on Form
N-CEN on an annual basis, rather than on a semi-annual basis on Form N-SAR, would
significantly lessen reporting burdens for funds and lower costs for fund shareholders when
compared to the status quo.1520 We agree and continue to believe the estimated hour and cost
burdens associated with Form N-CEN estimated in the Proposing Release reflect this reduction
1514

This estimate was based on the following calculation: (32.37 hours per management company in first
year + (12.37 in each year thereafter × 2 years)) ÷ 3 years = 19.04 hours per year.

1515

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 3,146 funds × 19.04 hours per fund per year =
59,900 hours per year.

1516

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at n.766 (discussing the costs associated with registering
and maintaining an LEI).

1517

This estimate was based on the following calculation: ($220 in first year + (2 years × $120 each
subsequent year)) ÷ 3 years = $153 per year.

1518

See Item B.1.d and Item C.1.c of Form N-CEN (requiring LEI for the registrant and each series of a
management company).

1519

This estimate was based on the following calculation: $153 per year per fund × 11,429 funds =
$1,748,637 per year.

in burdens and costs. With the exception of this comment, we did not receive comments on the
estimated hour and costs burdens discussed above associated with reporting census-type
information on Form N-CEN.
As discussed above, our adoption of Form N-CEN includes a number of modifications or
clarifications from the proposal that address concerns raised by commenters and that are
intended, in part, to decrease reporting and implementation burdens relative to the proposal. For
example, we have extended the filing period for Form N-CEN from 60 days, as proposed, to 75
days to, in part, respond to commenters’ concerns that 60 days would not provide funds the time
necessary to collect, verify, and report information on Form N-CEN.1521 We also have modified
the proposal by moving the management’s statement regarding a change in independent public
accountant originally filed on Form N-SAR from an attachment to Form N-CEN, as proposed, to
an exhibit to Form N-CSR, thereby shifting burden associated with this exhibit filing from Form
N-CEN to Form N-CSR. However, we recognize a few reporting items and sub-items have been
added to the form that were not contemplated in the burden hours and costs we estimated in the
Proposing Release. For example, we are adopting a requirement that a fund (other than a money
market fund) provide its monthly average net assets during the reporting period,1522 and we are
also requiring the reporting of CRD numbers for directors.1523
We believe that certain of the modifications from and clarifications to the proposal that
we are adopting today will generally reduce the estimated burden hours and costs associated with
implementation of Form N-CEN reporting requirements relative to the proposal, while a few

446

others will increase those estimates. For these reasons, we believe that the net effect of such
modifications from the proposal will not have a net impact on the estimated burden hours and
costs stated in the Proposing Release. Accordingly, we are not estimating a change to the
proposed per-fund estimates as a result of the modifications we have made to the proposed
requirements. The Commission, however, has modified the estimated increase in aggregate
annual burden hours and external costs that will result from reporting requirements on Form
N-CEN in light of updated data regarding the number of management investment companies and
UITs.
We have revised our estimate of the number of reports on Form N-CEN per year
downward from 3,146 reports to 3,113 reports to reflect updates to the industry data figures that
were utilized in the Proposing Release.1524 We continue to estimate that management investment
companies will each spend as much as 13.35 hours annually, preparing and filing reports on
Form N-CEN.1525 The Commission also continues to estimate that UITs, including separate
account UITs, will each spend as much as 9.11 hours annually, preparing and filing reports on
Form N-CEN, since a UIT will be required to respond to fewer reporting items.1526
We continue to estimate that management investment companies currently spend as much
as 15.35 hours preparing and filing each report on Form N-SAR, and note that we generally have
sought to simplify and decrease the census-type reporting burdens placed on registrants by
current Form N-SAR in adopting Form N-CEN. For example, Form N-CEN, as adopted, will

reduce the number of attachments that may need to be filed with the reports and largely eliminate
financial statement-type information from the reports. Additionally, we continue to believe that
reports in XML on Form N-CEN will be less burdensome to produce than the reports on Form
N-SAR currently required to be filed using outdated technology. Accordingly, for management
investment companies we continue to believe that the estimated hour burden for filing reports on
Form N-CEN should be a reduced burden from the hour burden associated with Form
N-SAR.1527 As such, we continue to estimate that the annual hour burden for management
companies will be 13.35 per report on Form N-CEN, down from 15.35 hours per report for Form
N-SAR.
We continue to believe that UITs may, however, experience an increase in the hour
burden associated with census-type reporting on Form N-CEN because UITs will be required to
respond to more items in the form than they are currently required to respond to under Form
N-SAR. For example, UITs will be required to provide certain background information and
attachments in their reports on Form N-CEN, which they are not currently required to provide in
their reports on Form N-SAR. As a result, we continue to estimate an increase in the annual hour
burden for UITs from 7.11 hours in the currently approved collection for Form N-SAR to 9.11
hours for Form N-CEN.
In addition, we continue to believe that, in the first year reports on the form are filed,
funds may require additional time to prepare and file reports. Therefore, we continue to estimate
1527

We note that reports on Form N-CEN will be filed annually, rather than semi-annually as in the case
of reports on Form N-SAR. Thus, while we estimate that the burden associated with each report on
Form N-CEN for management companies will be two hours less than the burden associated with each
report on Form N-SAR, we estimate that the annual Form N-CEN burden for management companies
will actually be 17.35 hours less than that associated with Form N-SAR. This estimate is based on
the following calculation: (15.35 Form N-SAR burden hours per report × 2 reports per year) – 13.35
Form N-CEN burden hours per year = 17.35 hours per year.

448

that, for the first year, each fund will require 20 additional hours.1528 Accordingly, we estimate
that each management investment company will require 33.35 annual burden hours in the first
year1529 and 13.35 annual burden hours in each subsequent year for preparing and filing reports
on Form N-CEN. Furthermore, we estimate that each UIT will require 29.11 annual burden
hours in the first year1530 and 9.11 annual burden hours in each subsequent year for preparing and
filing reports on Form N-CEN.
We also continue to estimate (after rounding to the nearest hundredth of an hour) that the
average annual hour burden per response for Form N-CEN for the first year will be 32.37
hours1531 and 12.37 hours in subsequent years.1532 Amortizing the burden over three years, we
estimate that the average annual hour burden per fund per year will be 19.04 hours1533 and the
total aggregate annual hour burden will be 59,272 hours.1534
External costs include the cost of goods and services, which with respect to reports on
Form N-CEN, will include the costs of registering and maintaining an LEI for the

1528

This additional time may be attributable to, among other things, reviewing and collecting new or
revised data pursuant to the Form N-CEN requirements or changing the software currently used to
generate reports on Form N-SAR in order to output similar data in a different format.

1529

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 13.35 hours for filings + 20 additional hours for
the first filing = 33.35 hours.

1530

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 9.11 hours for filings + 20 additional hours for
the first filing = 29.11 hours.

1531

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ((2,392 management investment companies ×
33.35 hours per management investment company in the first year) + (721 UITs × 29.11 hours per
UIT in the first year)) ÷ 3,113 total funds = 32.37 hours in the first year.

1532

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ((2,392 management investment companies ×
13.35 hours per subsequent year) + (721 UITs × 9.11 hours per subsequent year)) ÷ 3,113 total funds
= 12.37 hours per subsequent year.

1533

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (32.37 hours in first year + (12.37 per subsequent
year × 2 years)) ÷ 3 years = 19.04 hours per year.

1534

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 3,113 funds × 19.04 hours per year = 59,272
hours per year.

registrant/funds.1535 We estimate an external cost of $219, rather than $220 per fund with respect
to the initial filing of a report on Form N-CEN, and we estimate an annual external cost of $119,
rather than $120 per fund with respect to subsequent filings, reflecting updates to the industry
data figures that were utilized in the Proposing Release.1536 Accordingly, we estimate the
amortized annual external cost per registrants and fund will be $152 per year, rather than $153
per year as proposed.1537 In sum, we estimate that all applicable funds will incur, in the
aggregate, external annual costs of $2,088,176, rather than $1,748,637, reflecting updates to the
industry data figures that were utilized in the Proposing Release.1538
2.

Rescission of Form N-SAR

In connection with our adoption of new Form N-CEN, we are rescinding Form N-SAR in
order to eliminate unnecessarily duplicative reporting requirements. This rescission will affect
all management investment companies and UITs.
We received no comments on the estimates put forward in our proposal. Thus, as
proposed, we estimate that the average annual hour burden per response for Form N-SAR is
15.35 hours for a management investment company and 7.11 hours for a UIT, since a UIT is
required to answer fewer items.1539 We have revised our estimate of the weighted average

1535

See Item B.1.d and Item C.1.c of Form N-CEN (requiring LEI for the registrant and each
management company).

1536

See supra footnote 63 (discussing the costs associated with registering and maintaining an LEI).

1537

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ($219 in the first year + ($119 per subsequent
year × 2 years)) ÷ 3 years = $152 per year.

1538

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $152 per registrant or fund per year × (3,113
investment company registrants + 9,039 mutual funds (which reflects the number of mutual fund
series, but excludes money market funds, which would have already obtained LEIs pursuant to the
requirements of Form N-MFP) + 1,586 ETFs (excluding 8 UITs that are not ETFs)) = $152 per fund
per year × 13,738 registrants and funds = $2,088,176 per year.

1539

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at n.724.

450

annual burden per response to about 14.27 hours to reflect updates to the industry data figures
that were utilized in the Proposing Release.1540 We therefore estimate an aggregate annual hour
burden of about 78,561 hours.1541
Accordingly, we estimate that, in the aggregate, the rescission will eliminate the 78,561
annual burden hours that would be associated with filing Form N-SAR. Additionally, we
estimate that there are no external costs associated with preparation of reports on Form N-SAR.
C.

Amendments to Regulation S-X

As discussed above, we are adopting certain amendments to Articles 6 and 12 of
Regulation S-X. As outlined in section II.C. above, the amendments would: (1) require new,
standardized disclosures regarding fund holdings in open futures contracts, open forward foreign
currency contracts, and open swap contracts, and additional disclosures regarding fund holdings
of written and purchased options contracts; (2) update the disclosures for other investments and
investments in and advances to affiliates, as well as reorganize the order in which some
investments are presented; and (3) amend the rules regarding the general form and content of
fund financial statements.1542

1540

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (15.35 hours per management investment
company per response × 2,392 management investment companies × 2 responses per year + 7.11
hours per UIT per response × 721 UITs) ÷ (2,392 management companies × 2 responses per
management company per year + 721 UITs × 1 response per management company per year) =
78,561 hours ÷ 5,505 responses per year = ~14.27 hours per response. The numbers of management
investment companies and UITs are based on data obtained from the ICI and reports filed by
registrants on Form N-SAR. See supra footnotes 2 and 1259 and accompanying and following text;
see also 2016 ICI Fact Book, supra footnote 2, at 22, 176.

1541

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ~14.27 hours per response × (2,392 management
companies × 2 responses per management company per year + 721 UITs × 1 response per
management company per year) = ~14.27 hours per response × 5,505 responses per year = ~78,561
hours per year.

1542

Our amendments would also require prominent placement of disclosures regarding investments in
derivatives in a fund’s financial statements, rather than allowing such schedules to be placed in the
notes to the financial statements. See supra section II.C.

Rule 30e-1

Section 30(e) of the Investment Company Act requires every registered investment
company to transmit to its stockholders, at least semiannually, reports containing such
information and financial statements or their equivalent, as of a reasonably current date, as the
Commission may prescribe by rules and regulations.1543 Rule 30e-1 generally requires
management investment companies to transmit to their shareholders, at least semi-annually,
reports containing the information that is required to be included in such reports by the fund’s
registration statement form under the Investment Company Act.1544 Pursuant to this rule and
Forms N-1A and N-2, management investment companies are required to include the financial
statements required by Regulation S-X in their shareholder reports.1545
Rule 30e-1 also permits, under certain conditions, delivery of a single shareholder report
to investors who share an address (“householding”).1546 Specifically, rule 30e-1 permits
householding of annual and semi-annual reports by management companies to satisfy the
transmission requirements of rule 30e-1 if, in addition to the other conditions set forth in the rule,
the management company has obtained from each applicable investor written or implied consent
to the householding of shareholder reports at such address. The rule requires management
companies that wish to household shareholder reports with implied consent to send a notice to
each applicable investor stating, among other things, that the investors in the household will
receive one report in the future unless the investors provide contrary instructions. In addition, at

1543

Rule 30e-1.

1545

See Item 27 of Form N-1A; and Item 24 of Form N-2.

1546

See rule 30e-1(f).

452

least once a year, management companies relying on the householding provision must explain to
investors who have provided written or implied consent how they can revoke their consent.
Compliance with the disclosure requirements of rule 30e-1 is mandatory. Responses to
the disclosure requirements are not kept confidential.
Based on staff conversations with fund representatives, we previously estimated that it
takes approximately 84 hours per fund to comply with the collection of information associated
with rule 30e-1, including the householding requirements. This time is spent, for example,
preparing, reviewing, and certifying the reports. The previously total estimated annual hour
burden of responding to rule 30e-1 was approximately 898,968 hours.1547
In the Proposing Release, we estimated that 11,230 management companies would have
to comply with these amendments.1548 In addition, we estimated that the amendments would
likely increase the time spent preparing, reviewing and certifying reports, if adopted. The extent
to which a fund’s burden would increase as a result of the proposed amendments would depend
on the extent to which the fund invests in the instruments covered by many of the amendments.
We estimated that, on an annual basis, funds generally would incur an additional 9 burden hours
in the first year1549 and an additional 3 burden hours for filings in subsequent years in order to

1547

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 84 hours per fund x 10,702 funds (the estimated
number of portfolios the last time the rule’s information collections were submitted for PRA renewal
in 2015) = 898,968 hours.

1548

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at n. 777. As noted in the Proposing Release, this estimate
included 9,259 mutual funds (including money market funds), 1,403 ETFs (1,411 ETFs – 8 UIT
ETFs) and 568 closed-end funds.

1549

With respect to the amendments to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we estimated that each fund would
spend an average of 5 hours to initially comply with the amendments. For example, amendments to
Article 6-07.1 would likely require funds to identify non-cash income and put a process in place to
capture it in the financial statements. In addition, some funds would also likely move their schedules
from financial statement notes to the financial statements themselves. With respect to the
amendments requiring disclosure of the components of a custom basket/index, some funds voluntarily

453

comply with the proposed amendments.1550 Amortized over three years, we estimated that the
average annual hour burden associated with the amendments for Regulation S-X would be 5
hours per fund.1551 Accordingly, we estimated a total annual average hour burden associated
with the amendments would be 56,150.1552
We also estimated an annual external cost burden of compliance with the information
collection requirements of rule 30e-1, which is currently $31,061 per fund, would not change as
a result of the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X.1553 We further estimated that the total
annual external cost burden for rule 30e-1 would be $348,815,030.1554 External costs included,
for example, the costs for funds to prepare, print, and mail the reports.

provide this disclosure now, but others do not; we recognized that funds would be affected by this
requirement differently depending on their investments.
With respect to the amendments to Article 12 of Regulation S-X, we estimated each fund would
spend an average of four hours to initially comply with the amendments. For example, while
accounting guidance already requires funds to identify the level of each security (such as Level 3
securities), we estimated there will be an increased burden in adding another note to the financial
statements. This increased burden would vary depending on the information already reported by
funds in their financial statements. Likewise, while many funds voluntarily identify illiquid securities
in their schedule of investments, the funds that do not make this disclosure would bear an initial
burden to comply with these amendments.
1550

With respect to the amendments to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we estimated each fund would
require two hours to comply with the requirements in each subsequent year. We likewise estimated
that each fund would require one hour to comply with the requirements of the proposed amendments
to Article 12 in each subsequent year.

1551

Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at n. 780. The estimate was based on the following calculation:
(9 hours + (3 hours x 2)) / 3 = 5.

1552

See id., at n. 781. The estimate was based on the following calculation: 5 hours x 11,230
management investment companies = 56,150.

1553

Because the proposed amendments would largely reorganize information currently reported by funds
in their financial statements, either voluntarily or because it is required, we did not believe the
external costs, such as printing and mailing costs, would increase as a result of the amendments.

1554

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at n. 783. This estimate was based on the following
calculation: 11,230 funds x $31,061 = $348,815,030. The total annual cost burden of rule 30e-1 was
$333,905,750, which reflected the higher estimated number of funds subject to rule 30e-1 at the time
of the last renewal for the rule.

454

We did not receive any comments on the estimated hour and costs burdens relating to our
proposed amendments to Regulation S-X. As discussed above, our adoption includes numerous
modifications or clarifications from the proposal that address concerns raised by commenters and
that are intended, in part, to decrease reporting and implementation burdens relative to the
proposal. For example, we are limiting the requirement for nonpublic indexes to require funds to
only report the top 50 components of the index or custom basket and any components that
represent more than one percent of the notional value of the index or custom basket.1555 In order
to eliminate the unnecessary disclosure of immaterial amounts of non-cash income, we adopted a
5 percent de minimis reporting threshold for reporting non-cash income, such as payment-inkind interest.1556 We also eliminated our proposed securities lending disclosures in fund
financial statements in favor of disclosures that would be made in a fund’s Statement of
Additional Information (or, for closed-end funds, reports on Form N-CSR) and in Form NCEN.1557 In Article 12 of Regulation S-X, in response to commenter concerns, and as more fully
discussed above in section II.C.4, we eliminated proposed disclosure requirements relating to the
liquidity of securities and federal income tax basis.1558 We also eliminated a proposal to require
funds to categorize the schedule of securities by type of investment, the related industry, and the
related country, or geographic region.1559

However, for variable rate securities, we are now requiring funds to provide disclosure of
both a description of reference rate and spread and the end of period interest rate, rather than just
the reference rate that we proposed, which may add additional burdens on funds.1560
For these and other reasons, we believe that our modifications from and clarifications to
the proposal will, on a net basis, generally reduce the burden hours and costs associated with
implementation of Regulations-X’s reporting requirements relative to the proposal. However,
although we did not receive any comments specifically addressing the burden estimates for our
proposed amendments to Regulation S-X, we recognize that several commenters, although they
did not provide quantitative estimates, suggested that implementation of the proposed new
reporting requirements, generally would be costly.1561 Based, in part, on the shifting of the
securities lending disclosures to the Statement of Additional Information (or, for closed-end
funds, reports on Form N-CSR) and Form N-CEN, as well as the other modification discussed
above, we estimate that funds will incur a reduction of 2 burden hours in the first year and a
reduction of .5 hours for filings in subsequent years from our proposed estimates.
The Commission has also modified the estimated increase in annual burden hours and
total time costs that will result from the amendments based on updated industry data. We have
revised our estimate of the number of management companies that will have to comply with the
amendments to Regulation S-X upward from 11,230 management companies to 11,859
management companies to reflect updates to the industry data figures that were utilized in the

1560

See id.

1561

See, e.g., Simpson Thacher Comment Letter; and Fidelity Comment Letter.

456

Proposing Release.1562 The Commission now estimates that, on an annual basis, funds generally
will incur an additional 7 burden hours in the first year and an additional 2.5 burden hours for
filings in subsequent years in order to comply with the proposed amendments. Amortized over
three years, the average aggregate annual hour burden associated with the amendments for
Regulation S-X will be 4 hours per fund.1563 We therefore estimate an average total annual hour
burden associated with the amendments of 47,436.1564
We continue to estimate an annual external cost burden of compliance with the
information collection requirements of rule 30e-1, which is currently $31,061 per fund, will not
change as a result of the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X.1565 We further estimate that
the total annual external cost burden for rule 30e-1 will be $368,352,399.1566
2.

Rule 30e-2

Rule 30e-2 requires registered UITs that invest substantially all of their assets in shares of
a management investment company to send their unitholders annual and semiannual reports
containing financial information on the underlying company.1567 Specifically, rule 30e-2
requires that the report contain all the applicable information and financial statements or their
equivalent, required by rule 30e-1 under the Investment Company Act to be included in reports

1562

This estimate included 9,520 mutual funds (including money market funds), 1,589 ETFs (1,594, ETFs
– 5 UIT ETFs) and 750 closed-end funds and was based on internal SEC data as well as ICI statistics
as of December 31, 2015, available at http://www.ici.org/research/stats.

1563

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (7 hours + (2.5 hours x 2)) / 3 = 4.

1564

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 4 hours x 11,859 management investment
companies = 47,436

1565

We continue to believe that amendments will largely reorganize information currently reported by
funds in their financial statements, either voluntarily or because it is required and will therefore not
result in an increase of external costs, such as printing and mailing costs.

1566

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 11,859 funds x $31,061 = $368,352,399.

1567

Rule 30e-2.

457

of the underlying fund for the same fiscal period.1568 Rule 30e-2 also permits UITs to rely on the
householding provision in rule 30e-1 to transmit a single shareholder report to investors who
share an address.1569
Compliance with the disclosure requirements of rule 30e-2 is mandatory. Responses to
the disclosure requirements are not kept confidential.
As noted in the Proposing Release, the Commission previously estimates that the annual
burden associated with rule 30e-2, including the householding requirements, was 121 hours per
respondent. The Commission further estimated the total annual hour burden was approximately
91,960 hours.1570
As discussed above, we are adopting certain amendments to Articles 6 and 12 of
Regulation S-X that will increase the time spent preparing, reviewing and certifying reports.1571
The extent to which a UIT’s burden increases as a result of the adopted amendments will depend
on the extent to which an underlying fund invests in the instruments covered by many of the
amendments.

1568

As discussed above, rule 30e-1 (together with Forms N-1A and N-2) essentially requires management
investment companies to transmit to their shareholders, at least semi-annually, reports containing the
financial statements required by Regulation S-X.

1569

See rule 30e-2(b); see also supra footnote 1546 and accompanying text.

1570

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 700 UITs (the estimated number of UITs the
last time the rule’s information collections were submitted for PRA renewal in 2015) x 121 hours per
UIT = 84,700.

1571

As discussed above, the amendments will: (1) require new, standardized disclosures regarding fund
holdings in open futures contracts, open forward foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts,
and additional disclosures regarding fund holdings of written and purchased options contracts; (2)
update the disclosures for other investments and investments in and advances to affiliates, as well as
reorganize the order in which some investments are presented; and (3) amend the rules regarding the
general form and content of fund financial statements. In addition, our amendments will also require
prominent placement of disclosures regarding investments in derivatives in a fund’s financial
statements, rather than allowing such schedules to be placed in the notes to the financial statements.

458

In the Proposing Release, we estimated that there were 727 UITs that may be subject to
the proposed amendments.1572 We also estimated that, on an annual basis, UITs generally would
incur an additional 9 burden hours in the first year and an additional 3 burden hours for filings in
subsequent years in order to comply with the proposed amendments. Amortized over three
years, we estimated that the average annual hour burden associated with the proposed
amendments would be 5 hours per fund. 1573 Accordingly, we estimated that the total average
annual hour burden associated with the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X would be 3,635
hours.1574
In addition, we estimated that the annual external cost burden of compliance with the
information collection requirements of rule 30e-2, which are currently $20,000 per respondent,
would not change as a result of the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X.1575 We further
estimated that the total annual external cost burden for rule 30e-2 would be $14,540,000.1576
External costs include, for example, the costs for the funds to prepare, print, and mail the reports.
We did not receive any comments on the estimated hour and costs burdens. For the
reasons discussed above, we now estimate that funds will incur a reduction of 2 burden hours in
the first year and a reduction of .5 hours for filings in subsequent years from our proposed costs.
The Commission has also modified the estimated increase in annual burden hours and total time
costs that will result from the amendments based on updated industry data. We have revised our
1572

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at n. 789. This estimate was based on the number of UITs
that filed Form N-SAR with the Commission as of December 31, 2014.

1573

The estimate was based on the following calculation: (9 hours + (3 hours x 2)) / 3 = 5.

1574

The estimate was based on the following calculation: 5 hours x 727 UITs = 3,635.

1575

See supra footnote 1553.

1576

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 727 UITs x $20,000 = $14,540,000. The current
total annual cost burden of rule 30e-2 is $15,200,000, which reflects the higher estimated number of
UITs at the time of the last renewal for the rule. See supra footnote 1570.

estimate of the number of UITs that will have to comply with the amendments to Regulation S-X
downward from 727 UITs to 721 UITs to reflect updates to the industry data figures that were
utilized in the Proposing.1577 For the reasons discussed above, we now estimate that, on an
annual basis, UITs generally will incur an additional 7 burden hours in the first year1578 and an
additional 2.5 burden hours for filings in subsequent years in order to comply with the
amendments to Regulation S-X.1579 Amortized over three years, we now estimate that the
average annual hour burden associated with the amendments will be 4 hours per fund. 1580 We
therefore estimate a total average annual hour burden associated with the amendments to
Regulation S-X will be 2,884 hours.1581
In addition, we estimate that the annual external cost burden of compliance with the
information collection requirements of rule 30e-2, which are currently $20,000 per respondent,
will not change as a result of the amendments to Regulation S-X.1582 We further estimate that
the total annual external cost burden for rule 30e-2 will be $14,420,000.1583

1577

This estimate is based on the number of UITs that filed Form N-SAR with the Commission as of
December 31, 2015.

1578

See supra footnotes 1562-1563 and accompanying text.

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (7 hours + (2.5 hours x 2)) / 3 = 4.

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 4 hours x 721 UITs = 2,884.

1582

See supra footnote 1553.

1583

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 721 UITs x $20,000 = $14,420,000. The current
total annual cost burden of rule 30e-2 is $15,200,000, which reflects the higher estimated number of
UITs at the time of the last renewal for the rule.

Amendments to Registration Statement Forms

As discussed above, we are amending Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6.1584 We are
adopting amendments to Forms N-1A and N-3 to require certain disclosures in fund Statements
of Additional Information regarding securities lending activities.1585 We are also amending
Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6 to exempt funds from those forms’ respective books and
records disclosure requirements if the information is provided in a fund’s most recent report on
Form N-CEN.1586
Form N-1A is the form used by open-end management investment companies to register
under the Investment Company Act and/or register their securities under the Securities Act.
Form N-2 is the form used by closed-end management investment companies to register under
the Investment Company act and register their securities under the Securities Act. Form N-3 is
the form used by separate accounts offering variable annuity contracts which are organized as
management investment companies to register under the Investment Company Act and/or
register their securities under the Securities Act. Form N-4 is the form used by insurance
company separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts that offer variable annuity
contracts to register under the Investment Company Act and/or register their securities under the
Securities Act. Form N-6 is the form used by insurance company separate accounts organized as
unit investment trusts that offer variable life insurance policies to register under the Investment
Company Act and/or register their securities under the Securities Act. Compliance with the

See Item 19(i) of Form N-1A; Item 21(j) of Form N-3; see also supra section II.F. We proposed
similar requirements be included in fund financial statements as part of the proposed amendments to
Regulation S-X. See proposed rule 6-03(m) of Regulation S-X; Proposing Release, supra footnote 7,

In the Proposing Release, we estimated that 11,957 funds would have to comply with the
proposed amendments to Regulation S-X, including, among other things, the proposed new
disclosure in the notes to financial statements relating to a fund’s securities lending activities.1587
In the Proposing Release, we estimated that the total hour burden for each respective form would
not change as a result of the proposed amendments concerning books and records disclosures.1588
We estimated, however, that the amendments to Regulation S-X—including the new required
disclosures in the notes to the financial statements concerning the fund’s securities lending
activities, but also a number of other amendments—would result in funds incurring an additional
9 burden hours in the first year and an additional 3 burden hours for filings in subsequent
years.1589 Amortized over three years, the average additional annual hour burden was estimated

1587

We estimated in the Proposing Release that 11,230 management companies would be required to
comply with the amendments. Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33676. We also estimated that
727 UITs may be subject to the proposed amendments. Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at
33677. 11,230 management companies + 727 UITs = 11,957.

associated with the amendments would be 59,785 hours.1591 We did not receive any comments
on the estimated hour burden.
We continue to estimate no change in burden hours as a result of the books and records
disclosures. However, we now estimate that those forms—viz., Forms N-1A and N-3—that
include the new disclosure requirements concerning securities lending activities would impose
part, but not all, of the additional hour burden previously estimated for Regulation S-X as funds
may need to collect, collate, tabulate, present, and review the information in order to prepare the
required Statement of Additional Information disclosures. We estimate that 9,502 and 16 funds
per year could file registration statements or amendments to registration statements on Forms
N-1A and N-3, respectively. We estimate that funds will incur an additional 2 burden hours in
the first year and an additional 0.5 hours for filings in subsequent years. Amortized over three
years, the average additional annual hour burden will therefore be 1 hour per fund.1592
Accordingly, we estimate that the total annual average hour burden associated with the
amendments to Forms N-1A and N-3 is, respectively, 9,504,1593 and 16 hours.1594 For Forms N-4
and N-6, to which the securities lending activity disclosure requirement amendments do not
apply, we continue to estimate total annual hour burden of 343,117 hours and 85,269 hours,
respectively.

1590

9 hours in first year + (3 hours per year thereafter × 2 years) = 9 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours total. 15
hours total ÷ 3 years = 5 hours per year.

1591

11,957 funds × 5 hours per fund = 59,785.

1592

2 hours in first year + (0.5 hours per year thereafter × 2 years) = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours total. 3
hours total ÷ 3 years = 1 hour per year.

1593

1 hour per fund × 9,504 funds per year = 9,504 hours per year.

1594

1 hour per fund × 16 funds per year = 16 hours per year.

463

In the Proposing Release, for both the books and records amendments and the Regulation
S-X requirement, of which the securities lending requirements were a part, we estimated that
there would be no changes to the annual external cost burden per fund as a result of the
amendments, and accordingly estimated no change to the current estimated total external cost
burden associated with the forms.1595 We did not receive any comments on the estimated
external cost burden. We therefore continue to estimate no change to the external cost burden as
a result of the amendments, and so we continue to estimate the total cost burden for each of the
respective forms as follows:

Amendments to Form N-CSR

As previously discussed above, we are adopting, as proposed, the rescission of Form NQ.1596 In connection with the rescission of Form N-Q, we also are adopting, as proposed,
amendments to Form N-CSR, the reporting form used by management companies to file certified
shareholder reports under the Investment Company Act and the Exchange Act.1597 Form N-Q
currently requires principal executive and financial officers of the fund to make certifications for
the first and third fiscal quarters relating to (1) the accuracy of information reported to the

1595

Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at 33677, 33681.

1596

See supra section III.B.

1597

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 7, at section V.E.

464

Commission, and (2) disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting.1598 The rescission of Form N-Q adopted today eliminates these certifications.
Form N-CSR requires similar certification with respect to the fund’s second and fourth
fiscal quarters. As a result of the rescission of Form N-Q adopted today, we are also adopting
amendments to the form of certification in Form N-CSR to require each certifying officer to state
that he or she has disclosed in the report any change in the registrant’s internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal half-year, rather than the
registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter as currently required by the form.1599 Lengthening the
look-back of this certification to six months, so that the certifications on Form N-CSR for the
semi-annual and annual reports will cover the first and second fiscal quarters and third and fourth
fiscal quarters, respectively, will fill the gap in certification coverage that would otherwise occur
once the rescission of Form N-Q is effective. As proposed, compliance with the amended
certification requirements will be mandatory and responses are not kept confidential.
In addition, as discussed above, we are moving the change in independent public
accountant attachment proposed on Form N-CEN to Form N-CSR so that an accountant’s letter
regarding a change in accountant will become available to the public semi-annually rather than
annually.1600 We are also adopting amendments to require closed-end funds to report on Form
N-CSR certain disclosures regarding securities lending activities.1601

1598

See supra footnote 521 and accompanying text.

1599

See Item 11(b) of Form N-CSR; paragraph 5(b) of certification exhibit of Item 11(a)(2) of Form NCSR.

See supra section II.D.4.b.

1601

See Item 12 of Form N-CSR; see also supra footnote 1181 and accompanying text.

465

In the Proposing Release, we estimated that the current annual burden associated with
Form N-CSR is 14.42 hours per fund1602 and that the current total annual time burden for Form
N-CSR is 177,799 hours.1603 We noted that the amount and content of the information contained
in the reports filed on Form N-CSR would not change as the result of the proposed amendments
to the certification requirements of Form N-CSR and that funds likely already have policies and
procedures in place to assist officers in their certifications of this information. Accordingly, we
estimated that the proposed amendments to the certification requirements of Form N-CSR would
not change the annual hour burden associated with Form N-CSR and, thus, we continued to
estimate the annual hour burden associated with Form N-CSR to be 14.42 hours per fund. With
respect to the total annual hour burden, however, we estimated 161,937 hours.1604 We noted that
this decrease in the current total annual hour burden was a result of the decrease in the number of
funds estimated to file Form N-CSR.
In addition, in the Proposing Release, we also estimated that the current annual cost of
outside services associated with Form N-CSR is approximately $129 per fund. 1605 We noted our
belief that external costs would include the cost of goods and services purchased to prepare and
update filings on Form N-CSR. We also expressed our belief that those costs would not change

1602

This estimate accounted for two filings per year. In addition, we noted that the estimate did not
separately account for the certifications on Form N-CSR.

1603

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 14.42 hours x 12,330 funds (the estimated
number of funds the last time the rule’s information collections were submitted for PRA renewal in
2013)).

1604

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 11,230 funds x 14.42 hours = 161,937. See
supra footnote 1548 (calculating the estimate for 11,230 funds).

1605

We estimated that the external costs associated with Form N-CSR would not include the external
costs associated with the shareholder report. The external costs associated with the shareholder report
are accounted for under the collections of information related to rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 under the
Investment Company Act.

466

as a result of the proposed amendments to the certification requirements of Form N-CSR and,
thus, continued to estimate a current external cost burden of $129 per fund to file Form N-CSR.
In the Proposing Release, we further estimated that the total annual external cost burden for
Form N-CSR would be $2,897,340.1606
We did not receive any comments on the estimated hour and cost burdens associated with
our proposed amendments to the certification requirements of Form N-CSR. As discussed
above, we are adopting amendments to modify Form N-CSR so that an accountant’s letter
regarding a change in accountant will become available to the public semi-annually pursuant to
an exhibit filing on Form N-CSR rather than annually as an attachment to Form N-CEN, as
proposed.1607 We believe that this modification from the proposal will increase the hour burden
associated with Form N-CSR by one-tenth of an hour1608 with an additional internal cost burden
of $32.40 per fund.1609 In addition, as noted above, we are adopting an amendment to require
closed-end funds include in their annual reports on Form N-CSR information concerning
securities lending activities. We estimate that this amendment will increase the hour burden
associated with Form N-CSR for closed-end funds by an additional 2 burden hours with an

1606

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 11,230 funds x $129 = $1,448,670; $1,448,670
x 2 times per year = $2,897,340. We noted that the current total annual cost burden of Form N-CSR
at the time of the Proposing Release was $3,189,771, which reflected the higher estimated number of
filers for Form N-CSR at the time of the last renewal for the form. See supra footnote 1603.

1607

See supra section III.B.3.

1608

Paralleling this modification, we believe that the modification to move the change in independent
public accountant exhibit from Form N-CEN as proposed to Form N-CSR will also reduce the hour
burden requirement associated with Form N-CEN by one-tenth of an hour. See supra section IV.B.1.

1609

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 0.10 hour x $324 (blended hourly rate for
compliance attorney ($340) and senior programmer ($308) = $32.40.

467

additional internal cost burden of $648 per fund in the first year,1610 and an additional 0.5 hours
with an additional internal cost burden of $162 per fund for filings in subsequent years.1611 We
have modified the estimated increase in annual burden hours and total time costs that will result
from amendments to Form N-CSR adopted today in light of these modifications and updated
data on industry earnings estimates.
For purposes of the PRA analysis, we estimate that the annual burden associated with
Form N-CSR is 14.52 hours per fund.1612 For closed-end funds, we estimate that the annual
burden associated with Form N-CSR is 16.52 hours per fund in the first year and 15.02 for
filings in subsequent years.1613 Amortized over three years, the average additional annual hour
burden will therefore be 1 hour per closed-end fund.1614 Accordingly, we estimate that, for
closed-end funds, the total annual average hour burden associated with the amendments to Form
N-CSR related to securities lending activities is 750 hours.1615 We have revised our estimate of
the total annual hour burden downward from 177,799 hours to 172,899 hours to reflect updates
to the industry data figures that were utilized in the Proposing Release as well as the increase in

1610

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2 hours x $324 (blended hourly rate for
compliance attorney ($340) and senior programmer ($308) = $648.

1611

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 0.5 hour x $324 (blended hourly rate for
compliance attorney ($340) and senior programmer ($308) = $162.

1612

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 14.52 = 14.42 + 0.10. This estimate accounts for
two filings per year. We note that this estimate does not separately account for the certifications on
Form N-CSR or the securities lending activities information annual reporting requirement for closedend funds on Form N-CSR.

1613

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 16.52 = 14.52 + 2. 15.02 = 14.52 + 0.5.

1614

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2 hours in first year + (0.5 hours per year
thereafter × 2 years) = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours total. 3 hours total ÷ 3 years = 1 hour per year.

1615

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 hour per fund × 750 closed-end funds per year
= 750 hours per year.

468

the hour burdens resulting from the amendments.1616 This decrease in the total annual hour
burden is a result of the decrease in the number of funds estimated to file Form N-CSR, from our
estimate of 12,330 funds in the Proposing Release to our current estimate of 11,856 funds.
In addition, as stated in the Proposing Release, we continue to estimate that the annual
cost of outside services associated with Form N-CSR is approximately $129 per fund. 1617 Based
on updated statistics regarding the number of funds, we estimate that the total annual external
cost burden for Form N-CSR will be $3,058,848, rather than $2,897,340 as we estimated in the
Proposing Release.1618
V.

FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
This Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“FRFA”) has been prepared in accordance

with section 4(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”).1619 It relates to new Form N-PORT
and new Form N-CEN and amendments to Form N-CSR, amendments to Regulation S-X, the
rescission of Forms N-Q and N-SAR, and amendments to Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6.
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) was prepared in accordance with the RFA
and included in the Proposing Release.1620

1616

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 172,899 = (750 hours (closed-end funds)) +
(172,149 hours (14.52 hours x (1,594 exchange-traded funds – eight organized as UITs + 750 closedend funds + 481 money market funds + 9,039 other mutual funds))). See supra footnote 1259 and
accompanying and following text.

1617

We estimate that the external costs associated with Form N-CSR will not include the external costs
associated with the shareholder report. The external costs associated with the shareholder report are
accounted for under the collections of information related to rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 under the
Investment Company Act.

1618

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 11,856 funds x $129 = $1,529,424; $1,529,424 x
2 times per year = $3,058,848. See supra footnote 1603.

A.

Need for and Objectives of the Forms and Form Amendments and Rules and
Rule Amendments

The Commission collects certain information about the funds that it regulates. The
Commission is adopting new rules, rule amendments, and new forms and form amendments that
will improve the quality of information that funds report to the Commission, benefitting the
Commission’s risk monitoring and oversight, examination, and enforcement programs.
We believe that these new rules, rule amendments, and new forms and form amendments
will improve the information that funds report to their shareholders and the Commission. In
addition, the new forms will require reports be filed in a structured data format (XML) to allow
for easier collection and analysis of data by Commission staff and the public. This is the format
used by Form N-MFP, Form 13F, and Form D, which greatly improves the ability of
Commission staff and other potential users to aggregate and analyze the data reported.
The Commission’s objective is to gain more timely and useful information about funds’
operations and portfolio holdings. The Commission also believes that its risk monitoring and
oversight, examination, and enforcement programs will be improved by requiring enhanced
information from funds.
B.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments

In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on every aspect of the IRFA, including
the number of small entities that would be affected by the proposed amendments, the existence
or nature of the potential impact of the proposals on small entities discussed in the analysis and
how to quantify the impact of the proposed rules.

470

One commenter noted that the rulemaking will place an “undue work and financial
burden” on small closed-end funds.1621 The commenter also noted that a closed-end fund that is
not listed on an exchange, a small number of assets under management, and limited holdings
should be required to file reports on Form N-PORT quarterly, as opposed to monthly.1622
Commenters also generally noted the high cost of the rulemaking.1623 Other commenters
generally requested more time in order to comply with the new forms, rules, and rule
amendments.1624
As we noted above,1625 we believe that, in order to ensure that the Commission and its
staff receive timely information, it is appropriate to require that funds file reports on Form NPORT within 30 days of month-end. Although reports on Form N-MFP are required to be filed
within 5 days of month end, we recognize that preparing reports on Form N-PORT will initially
require a significant effort by funds.1626 Therefore, we have determined to require a 30-day
filing period for reports on Form N-PORT in order to balance the Commission’s need for timely
information with the operational burdens of reporting. Moreover, lag times of more than 30 days
would make monthly reporting impractical, as reports would overlap with preparation time.1627

1621

See Carol Singer Comment Letter.

1622

Id.; see also Schnase Comment Letter (noting that monthly reporting on Form N-PORT would be
particularly burdensome on smaller funds).

1623

See, e.g., Schnase Comment Letter (“I am not convinced this is a cost better or more efficiently borne
by the fund rather than the data users and sellers, particularly for smaller funds already struggling to
meet costly filing requirements.”); Wahh Comment Letter; Carol Singer Comment Letter.

1624

See, e.g., Simpson Thacher Comment Letter (“With respect to the Commission’s proposed
compliance dates for the new reporting requirements, we are concerned that the timeline outlined in
the Release is too aggressive for smaller investment company complexes.”).

1625

See supra section II.A.3.

1626

See supra section III.B.3.

1627

Dreyfus Comment Letter (advocating for bi-monthly or quarterly reporting, with 45-60 days to file
reports on Form N-PORT).

471

We also note that several commenters noted that reporting on the same basis used to calculate
NAV (generally a T+1 basis), which the Form now explicitly requires, as opposed to a T+0 basis,
which is used for financial reporting, will reduce the estimated time to gather the information.1628
As a result, we are adopting our requirement for reports on Form N-PORT to be filed with the
Commission within 30 days of month-end.1629 Moreover, given the nature and frequency of
filings on Form N-PORT, we are adopting a delayed compliance period for small entities that
will file reports on Form N-PORT.1630 Specifically, for smaller entities (i.e., funds that together
with other investment companies in the same “group of related investment companies” have net
assets of less than $1 billion as of the end of the most recent fiscal year), we are providing for an
extra 12 months (or 30 months after the effective date) to comply with the new reporting
requirements.
Apart from commenter concerns discussed above regarding the costs and financial
burdens associated with the overall rulemaking, commenters did not raise specific concerns
about the impact of new Form N-CEN or the rescission of Form N-SAR on small entities. One
commenter expressed the belief that annual filings on Form N-CEN would be appropriate but
that some of the requested information on the form probably would not be applicable to small
closed-end funds with certain characteristics.1631 As discussed above, Form N-CEN reporting

1628

See Schwab Comment Letter (reporting that converting from T+1 to T+0 accounting would add
approximately 6-10 days to the process of compiling data for Form N-PORT). While commenters
acknowledged that reporting holdings on a T+1 basis would save time vis a vis compiling data for
month-end reporting, they still noted that they would need more than 30 days after month-end to file
reports on Form N-PORT. See Invesco Comment Letter; but see SIFMA Comment Letter I
(requesting that funds be given the option to report on either a T+0 or T+1 basis).

1629

See General Instruction A of proposed Form N-PORT.

1630

See supra section II.H.1.

1631

See Carol Singer Comment Letter.

472

requirements depend on the type of registrant filing the report.1632 For example, all funds,
including small entities, will be required to complete Parts A, B, and G of the form (as
applicable), and all management companies, except for SBICs, will be required to complete Part
C. On the other hand, only closed-end funds and SBICs will be required to complete Part D and
only ETFs and UITs will be required to complete Parts E and F, respectively. Thus, certain
reporting requirements on Form N-CEN may or may not be applicable to small entities
depending on the type of registrant.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Rule

An investment company is a small entity if, together with other investment companies in
the same group of related investment companies, it has net assets of $50 million or less as of the
end of its most recent fiscal year.1633 Commission staff estimates that, as of December 2015,
approximately 129 registered investment companies, including 117 open and closed-end funds
(including one SBIC) and 12 UITs are small entities. The Commission staff further estimates
that, as of December 2015, approximately 34 BDCs are small entities. Since the new forms and
form amendments and new rules and rule amendments, pertain to all registered funds (subject to
the limitations discussed in section V.D, below), all entities, including small entities, will be
subject to the adopted rules. Specific reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance
requirements, in addition to the estimated number of small entities subject to the form and form
amendments and rule and rule amendments, are discussed below.

1632

See supra section II.D.2.

1633

17 CFR 270.0-10(a).

473

D.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements

The amendments would create, amend, or eliminate current reporting requirements for
small entities.
1.

Form N-PORT

Funds currently report portfolio holdings information quarterly on Form N-Q (first and
third fiscal quarters) and Form N-CSR (second and fourth fiscal quarters). The Commission is
adopting new Form N-PORT on which funds, other than MMFs, UITs, and SBICs, will be
required to report portfolio holdings information and information related to liquidity, derivatives,
securities lending, purchases and redemptions, and counterparty exposure each month. Funds
will be required to file reports on Form N-PORT within 30 days after the end of the monthly
period using a structured format. Only information reported for the third month of each quarter
will be available to the public and such information would not be made public until 60 days after
the end of the third month of the fund’s fiscal quarter. For smaller funds and fund groups (i.e.,
funds that together with other investment companies in the same “group of related investment
companies” have net assets of less than $1 billion as of the end of the most recent fiscal year),
which will include small entities, we are providing an extra 12 months (or 30 months after the
effective date) to comply with the new Form N-PORT reporting requirements.
We received no comments on the IRFA analysis of new Form N-PORT or the estimated
costs discussed above in sections III.B.3 and IV.A.1. Therefore, based on our experience with
other structured data filings, we estimate that funds will prepare and file their reports on
proposed Form N-PORT by either (1) licensing a software solution and preparing and filing the
reports in house, or (2) retaining a service provider to provide data aggregation and validation
services as part of the preparation and filing of reports on Form N-PORT on behalf of the fund.
We estimate that approximately 117 open and closed-end funds (other than money market funds
474

and SBICs), are small entities that will file, on a monthly basis, a complete report on Form NPORT reporting certain information regarding the fund and its portfolio holdings. As discussed
above, we estimate, for funds that choose to license a software solution to file reports on Form
N-PORT, that completing, reviewing, and filing Form N-PORT will cost $56,682 for each fund,
including small entities, in its first year of reporting and $47,465 per year for each subsequent
year.1634 We further estimate, for funds that choose to retain a third-party service provider to
provide data aggregation and validation services as part of the preparation and filing of reports
on Form N-PORT, that completing, reviewing, and filing Form N-PORT will cost $55,492 for
each fund, including small entities, in its first year of reporting, and $39,214 per year for each
subsequent year.1635 We received no comments on the IRFA analysis of Form N-PORT, but
discuss in detail comments received on our cost estimates in sections III.B.3 and IV.A.1 above.
2.

Rescission of Form N-Q

Our proposal will rescind Form N-Q in order to eliminate unnecessarily duplicative
reporting requirements. The rescission of Form N-Q will affect all management investment
companies required to file reports on the form. We expect that approximately 117 open and
closed-end funds are small entities that will be affected by the rescission of Form N-Q.
We received no comments on the IRFA analysis of the rescission of Form N-Q or the
projected costs savings from rescinding Form N-Q. As discussed above, we estimate that the
rescission of Form N-Q will save $6,804 per year for each fund, including small entities.1636

1634

See supra footnotes 1300-1301 and accompanying text.

1635

See supra footnotes 1302-1303 and accompanying text.

1636

The estimated cost is based upon the following calculations: ($6,804= 21 hours/fund x $324/hour
compensation for professionals commonly used in preparation of Form N-Q filings.) $324 = $308
per hour for Senior Programmers + $340 per hour for compliance attorneys / 2), as we believe these
employees would commonly be responsible for completing reports on Form N-Q.

475

3.

Form N-CEN

Funds currently report census type information relating to the fund’s organization, service
providers, fees and expenses, portfolio strategies and investments, portfolio transactions, and
share transactions on Form N-SAR. Funds file this form semi-annually with the Commission,
except for UITs, which must file such reports annually.1637 The utility of the information
reported on Form N-SAR has been limited for two reasons. First, the data items funds are
required to report on Form N-SAR have not been updated to reflect current Commission staff
needs. Second, the technology by which funds file reports on Form N-SAR has not been updated
and limits the Commission staff’s ability to extract and analyze reported data.
Because of these limitations, the Commission is replacing Form N-SAR with new Form
N-CEN. This new form will streamline and update the required data items to reflect current
Commission staff needs. Where possible, we have endeavored to exclude items from Form
N-CEN that are disclosed or reported pursuant to other Commission forms, or are otherwise
available; however, in some limited cases, we are collecting information on Form N-CEN that
may be similarly disclosed or reported elsewhere because we believe it will be useful to have
such information in a structured format to facilitate comparisons across funds. We also believe
this format will allow for easier data analysis and use in the Commission’s rulemaking,
inspection, and risk monitoring functions and reduce burdens on filers. Finally, the Commission
is requiring that funds file reports on Form N-CEN annually, opposed to semi-annually, which is
currently required for Form N-SAR (except UITs, which currently must file reports annually).
We received no comments on the IRFA analysis of Form N-CEN, but discuss in detail
comments received on our cost estimates in sections III.D.2, III.D.3, and IV.B.1, above.
1637

See rule 30b1-1 and rule 30a-1.

476

Therefore, we estimate that approximately 129 registered investment companies, including 117
open and closed-end funds (including one SBIC) and 12 UITs, are small entities that will be
required to file a complete report on Form N-CEN. Although UITs are required to complete
fewer items on Form N-CEN than other registered investment companies, the burden on UITs
will increase because UITs will be required to respond to more items in Form N-CEN than they
are currently required to respond to under Form N-SAR.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that Form N-CEN filers, including small
entities, would incur additional costs of $14.6 million each year and $20.2 million in one-time
costs as a result of the form’s reporting requirements.1638
4.

Rescission of Form N-SAR

Our proposal will rescind Form N-SAR in order to eliminate unnecessarily duplicative
reporting requirements. We estimate that approximately 129 registered investment companies
that are small entities, including 117 open and closed-end funds (including one SBIC) and 12
UITs would be affected by the rescission of Form N-SAR.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that rescinding Form N-SAR will save
current Form N-SAR filers, including small entities, about $25.5 million per year.1639 We
received no comments on the IRFA analysis of the rescission of Form N-SAR or the projected
expense savings from rescinding Form N-SAR.

1638

See supra section III.D.2. However, as discussed below, the annual costs of reporting on Form
N-CEN would be offset by the rescission of Form N-SAR. See id.

1639

See supra section III.D.2. However, as discussed above, the annual savings from the rescission of
Form N-SAR would be partially offset by the reporting requirements of Form N-CEN. See id.

477

5.

Regulation S-X Amendments

The Commission is also amending Regulation S-X to require new, standardized
disclosures regarding fund holdings in open futures contracts, open forward foreign currency
contracts, and open swap contracts, and additional disclosures regarding fund holdings of written
and purchased options, update the disclosures for other investments with conforming
amendments, and amend the rules regarding the form and content of fund financial statements.
We believe that the amendments we are adopting today are generally consistent with how many
funds are currently reporting investments (including derivatives), and other information
according to current industry practices. The Commission believes investors will benefit from our
amendments because increased disclosure and standardization of fund holdings will improve
comparability among funds including transparency for investors regarding a fund’s use of
derivatives and the liquidity of certain investments. The Commission also believes that greater
clarity will benefit the industry, while any additional burdens will be reduced since similar
disclosures will be required on Form N-PORT.
We received no comments on the IRFA analysis of the Regulation S-X amendments,
which included the proposed securities lending activity disclosures, or on the estimated costs
discussed above in section III.C.3
We therefore expect that approximately 129 registered investment companies, including
117 open and closed-end funds (including one SBIC) and 12 UITs and, approximately 34 BDCs,
are small entities that will be affected by the amendments to Regulation S-X. As discussed
above, we estimate that amending Regulation S-X will cost $1,911 for each fund, including

478

small entities, in its first year of reporting, and $683 per year for each subsequent year.1640 As
discussed above, we further estimate that amending Regulation S-X will cost $1,911 for each
UIT, including small entities, in its first year of reporting, and $683 per year for each subsequent
year.1641
6.

Amendments to Registration Statement Forms

We are amending Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6 to exempt funds from those
forms’ respective books and records disclosures if the information is provided in a fund’s most
recent report on Form N-CEN.1642 The books and records disclosures required by these
registration statement forms are not provided in a structured format. We believe that having this
information in a structured format will increase our efficiency in preparing for exams as well as
our ability to identify current industry trends and practices and, therefore, are requiring that it be
reported on Form N-CEN. We are also adopting amendments to Forms N-1A and N-3 to require
certain disclosures in fund Statements of Additional Information regarding securities lending
activities.1643 We believe that investors and others will benefit from the additional transparency
into the economic effects of fund securities lending activities that these requirements will yield.
As discussed above, in sections III.E and IV.D, we did not receive any comments on the
estimated hour and cost burdens or quantitatively estimated economic benefits or costs
associated with our amendments to fund registration statement forms, or on their IRFA analysis
or our IRFA analysis of securities lending disclosures. We expect that approximately 90
registered investment companies, including 78 open-end funds and 12 UITs, and approximately
1640

1642

1643

See supra section II.F.

479

34 BDCs, are small entities that would be required to file registration statements on the amended
forms. As discussed above, the Commission estimates that Form N-1A and N-3 filers, including
small entities, would incur additional costs of $1.3 million each year and $3.9 million in onetime costs as a result of the amendments to those forms.1644
7.

Amendments to Form N-CSR

Form N-Q and Form N-CSR currently require a quarterly SOX certification relating to
the accuracy of information reported to the Commission and disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting. To facilitate the elimination of Form N-Q, we are
expanding the SOX certification for Form N-CSR to six months to maintain coverage for the
entire fiscal year. As discussed above, in section IV.E, we did not receive any comments on the
estimated hour and cost burdens associated with our proposed amendments to the certification
requirements of Form N-CSR. In addition, we also are moving the change in independent public
accountant attachment proposed on Form N-CEN to Form N-CSR so that an accountant’s letter
regarding a change in accountant will become available to the public semi-annually rather than
annually.1645
As discussed above, in sections III.B.3 and IV.E, we did not receive any comments on the
estimated hour and cost burdens associated with our amendments to Form N-CSR or its IRFA
analysis.
Therefore, we expect that approximately 129 registered investment companies, including
78 open-end funds, 39 closed-end funds (including one SBIC) and 12 UITs, are small entities
that will be affected by the amendments to Form N-CSR. As discussed above, the Commission

1644

See supra section III.E.3.

1645

See supra section II.D.4.b.

480

does not believe that the costs associated with reporting on Form N-CSR will change for funds,
including small entities, as a result of the amendments to the certification requirements
associated with Form N-CSR adopted today.1646 We do estimate that the annual burden
associated with filing reports on Form N-CSR will increase from 14.42 to 14.52 per registrant in
light of moving the change in independent public accountant attachment proposed on Form NCEN to Form N-CSR.1647 In addition, we estimate that the amendment to require closed-end
funds to report on Form N-CSR certain disclosures regarding securities lending activities will
increase the hour burden associated with Form N-CSR for closed-end funds by an additional 2
burden hours in the first year and an addition 0.5 hours for filings in subsequent years.1648
E.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would
accomplish our stated objective, while minimizing any significant economic impact on small
entities. The Commission considered the following alternatives for small entities in relation our
forms and form amendments and rules and rule amendments: (i) establishing different reporting
requirements or frequency to account for resources available to small entities; (ii) using
performance rather than design standards; and (iii) exempting small entities from all or part of
the proposal.
Small entities currently follow the same requirements that large entities do when filing
reports on Form N-SAR, Form N-CSR, and Form N-Q. The Commission believes that
establishing different reporting requirements or frequency for small entities would not be

1646

See supra section III.B.3.

1647

See supra footnote 1612 and accompanying text.

1648

See supra footnote section IV.E.

481

consistent with the Commission’s goal of industry oversight and investor protection. However,
as discussed above, we are adopting a delayed compliance period for small entities that will file
reports on Form N-PORT.

Sections 210.6-01 to 210.6-10 shall be applicable to financial statements filed for
registered investment companies and business development companies.
5.

Revise §210.6-03 to read as follows:

§210.6-03 Special rules of general application to registered investment companies and
business development companies.
The financial statements filed for persons to which §§210.6-01 to 210.6-10 are applicable
shall be prepared in accordance with the following special rules in addition to the general rules in
§§210.1-01 to 210.4-10 (Articles 1, 2, 3, and 4). Where the requirements of a special rule differ
from those prescribed in a general rule, the requirements of the special rule shall be met.

accordance with the requirements of this part (Regulation S-X) notwithstanding any provision of
the articles of incorporation, trust indenture or other governing legal instruments specifying
certain accounting procedures inconsistent with those required in §§210.6-01 to 210.6-10.

484

(b) Audited financial statements. Where, under Article 3 of this part, financial statements

Provided, however, That a consolidating statement need not be filed if all included subsidiaries
are totally held; and
(iii) Consolidated or combined statements filed for subsidiaries not consolidated with the
registrant shall not include any investment companies unless accompanied by consolidating or
combining statements which set forth the individual statements of each included investment
company which is a significant subsidiary.
(2) If consolidating or combining statements are filed, the amounts included under each
caption in which financial data pertaining to affiliates is required to be furnished shall be
subdivided to show separately the amounts:
(i) Eliminated in consolidation; and
(ii) Not eliminated in consolidation.

485

(d) Valuation of investments. The balance sheets of registered investment companies,
other than issuers of face-amount certificates, and business development companies, shall reflect
all investments at value, with the aggregate cost of each category of investment reported under
§§210.6-04.1, 6-04.2, 6-04.3 and 6-04.9 or the aggregate cost of each category of investment
reported under §210.6-05.1 shown parenthetically. State in a note the methods used in
determining value of investments. As required by section 28(b) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-28(b)), qualified assets of face-amount certificate companies shall be
valued in accordance with certain provisions of the Code of the District of Columbia. For
guidance as to valuation of securities, see §§404.03 to 404.05 of the Codification of Financial
Reporting Policies.
(e) Qualified assets. State in a note the nature of any investments and other assets
maintained or required to be maintained, by applicable legal instruments, in respect of
outstanding face-amount certificates. If the nature of the qualifying assets and amount thereof are
not subject to the provisions of section 28 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C.
80a-28), a statement to that effect shall be made.
(f) Restricted securities. State in a note unless disclosed elsewhere the following
information as to investment securities which cannot be offered for public sale without first
being registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) (restricted securities):
(1) The policy of the person with regard to acquisition of restricted securities.
(2) The policy of the person with regard to valuation of restricted securities. Specific
comments shall be given as to the valuation of an investment in one or more issues of securities
of a company or group of affiliated companies if any part of such investment is restricted and the
aggregate value of the investment in all issues of such company or affiliated group exceeds five

486

percent of the value of total assets. (As used in this paragraph, the term affiliated shall have the
meaning given in §210.6-02(a).)
(3) A description of the person's rights with regard to demanding registration of any
restricted securities held at the date of the latest balance sheet.
(g) Income recognition. Dividends shall be included in income on the ex-dividend date;
interest shall be accrued on a daily basis. Dividends declared on short positions existing on the
record date shall be recorded on the ex-dividend date and included as an expense of the period.
(h) Federal income taxes. (1) The company's status as a regulated investment company as
defined in subtitle A, chapter 1, subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, shall
be stated in a note referred to in the appropriate statements. Such note shall also indicate briefly
the principal assumptions on which the company relied in making or not making provisions for
income taxes. However, a company which retains realized capital gains and designates such
gains as a distribution to shareholders in accordance with section 852(b)(3)(D) of the Internal
Revenue Code shall, on the last day of its taxable year (and not earlier), make provision for taxes
on such undistributed capital gains realized during such year. (2) State the following amounts
based on cost for Federal income tax purposes: (a) Aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for
all investments in which there is an excess of value over tax cost, (b) the aggregate gross
unrealized depreciation for all investments in which there is an excess of tax cost over value, (c)
the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, and (d) the aggregate cost of investments for
Federal income tax purposes.
(i) Issuance and repurchase by a registered investment company or business development
company of its own securities. Disclose for each class of the company's securities:

487

(1) The number of shares, units, or principal amount of bonds sold during the period of
report, the amount received therefor, and, in the case of shares sold by closed-end management
investment companies, the difference, if any, between the amount received and the net asset
value or preference in involuntary liquidation (whichever is appropriate) of securities of the same
class prior to such sale; and
(2) The number of shares, units, or principal amount of bonds repurchased during the
period of report and the cost thereof. Closed-end management investment companies shall
furnish the following additional information as to securities repurchased during the period of
report:
(i) As to bonds and preferred shares, the aggregate difference between cost and the face
amount or preference in involuntary liquidation and, if applicable net assets taken at value as of
the date of repurchase were less than such face amount or preference, the aggregate difference
between cost and such net asset value;
(ii) As to common shares, the weighted average discount per share, expressed as a
percentage, between cost of repurchase and the net asset value applicable to such shares at the
date of repurchases.
Note to paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii): The information required by paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of
this section may be based on reasonable estimates if it is impracticable to determine the exact
amounts involved.
(j) Series companies. (1) The information required by this part shall, in the case of a
person which in essence is comprised of more than one separate investment company, be given
as if each class or series of such investment company were a separate investment company; this
shall not prevent the inclusion, at the option of such person, of information applicable to other

488

classes or series of such person on a comparative basis, except as to footnotes which need not be
comparative.
(2) If the particular class or series for which information is provided may be affected by
other classes or series of such investment company, such as by the offset of realized gains in one
series with realized losses in another, or through contingent liabilities, such situation shall be
disclosed.
(k) Certificate reserves. (1) For companies issuing face-amount certificates subsequent to
December 31, 1940 under the provisions of section 28 of the Investment Company Act of 1940
(15 U.S.C. 80a-28), balance sheets shall reflect reserves for outstanding certificates computed in
accordance with the provisions of section 28(a) of the Act.
(2) For other companies, balance sheets shall reflect reserves for outstanding certificates
determined as follows:
(i) For certificates of the installment type, such amount which, together with the lesser of
future payments by certificate holders as and when accumulated at a rate not to exceed 3 ⁄ per
1

2

centum per annum (or such other rate as may be appropriate under the circumstances of a
particular case) compounded annually, shall provide the minimum maturity or face amount of the
certificate when due.
(ii) For certificates of the fully-paid type, such amount which, as and when accumulated
at a rate not to exceed 31⁄2 per centum per annum (or such other rate as may be appropriate under
the circumstances of a particular case) compounded annually, shall provide the amount or
amounts payable when due.
(iii) Such amount or accrual therefor, as shall have been credited to the account of any
certificate holder in the form of any credit, or any dividend, or any interest in addition to the

489

minimum maturity or face amount specified in the certificate, plus any accumulations on any
amount so credited or accrued at rates required under the terms of the certificate.
(iv) An amount equal to all advance payments made by certificate holders, plus any
accumulations thereon at rates required under the terms of the certificate.
(v) Amounts for other appropriate contingency reserves, for death and disability benefits
or for reinstatement rights on any certificate providing for such benefits or rights.
(l) Inapplicable captions. Attention is directed to the provisions of §§210.4-02 and 210.403 which permit the omission of separate captions in financial statements as to which the items
and conditions are not present, or the amounts involved not significant. However, amounts
involving directors, officers, and affiliates shall nevertheless be separately set forth except as
otherwise specifically permitted under a particular caption.

§210.6-04 Balance sheets.
This section is applicable to balance sheets filed by registered investment companies and
business development companies except for persons who substitute a statement of net assets in
accordance with the requirements specified in §210.6-05, and issuers of face-amount certificates

Revise §210.6-07 to read as follows:

§210.6-07 Statements of operations.
Statements of operations filed by registered investment companies, other than issuers of
face-amount certificates, subject to the special provisions of §210.6-08, and business
development companies, shall comply with the following provisions:
S TATEMENTS OF O PERATIONS
1. Investment income. State separately income from: (a) dividends; (b) interest on
securities; and (c) other income. Any other category of income which exceeds five percent of
the total shown under this caption (e.g. income from non-cash dividends, income from paymentin-kind interest) shall be stated separately. If income from investments in or indebtedness of
affiliates is included hereunder, such income shall be segregated under an appropriate caption
subdivided to show separately income from: (1) Controlled companies; and (2) other affiliates. If
494

income from non-cash dividends or payment in kind interest are included in income, the bases of

of investments. Amounts of expenses incurred from transactions with affiliated persons shall be
disclosed together with the identity of and related amount applicable to each such person
accounting for five percent or more of the total expenses shown under this caption together with

amount and a description of any fee reductions or reimbursements representing: (1) Expense
limitation agreements or commitments; and (2) offsets received from broker-dealers showing
separately for each amount received or due from (i) unaffiliated persons; and (ii) affiliated

(d) If any expenses were paid otherwise than in cash, state the details in a note.
(e) State in a note to the financial statements the amount of brokerage commissions
(including dealer markups) paid to affiliated broker-dealers in connection with purchase and sale

provided the securities so listed are not restricted, have been held for not more than one year
prior to the date of the related balance sheet, and have not previously been reported by name to
the shareholders of the person for which the schedule is filed or to any exchange, or set forth in
any registration statement, application, or annual report or otherwise made available to the
public. If any securities are listed as “Miscellaneous securities,” briefly explain in a footnote
what the term represents.

Categorize the schedule by (i) the type of investment (such as common stocks, preferred

stocks, convertible securities, fixed income securities, government securities, options purchased,

502

warrants, loan participations and assignments, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances,
certificates of deposit, short-term securities, repurchase agreements, other investment companies,
and so forth); and (ii) the related industry, country, or geographic region of the investment.
Short-term debt instruments (i.e., debt instruments whose maturities or expiration dates at the
time of acquisition are one year or less) of the same issuer may be aggregated, in which case the
range of interest rates and maturity dates shall be indicated. For issuers of periodic payment plan
certificates and unit investment trusts, list separately: (i) Trust shares in trusts created or serviced
by the depositor or sponsor of this trust; (ii) trust shares in other trusts; and (iii) securities of
other investment companies. Restricted securities shall not be combined with unrestricted
securities of the same issuer. Repurchase agreements shall be stated separately showing for each
the name of the party or parties to the agreement, the date of the agreement, the total amount to
be received upon repurchase, the repurchase date and description of securities subject to the
repurchase agreements.
3

For options purchased, all information required by §210.12-13 for options contracts

written should be shown. Options on underlying investments where the underlying investment
would otherwise be presented in accordance with §§210.12-12, 12-13A, 12-13B, 12-13C, or 1213D should include the description of the underlying investment as would be required by

producing if, on the respective last interest payment date or date for the declaration of dividends
prior to the date of the related balance sheet, there was only a partial payment of interest or a
declaration of only a partial amount of the dividends payable; in such case, however, each such
issue shall be indicated by an appropriate symbol referring to a note to the effect that, on the last
interest or dividend date, only partial interest was paid or partial dividends declared. If, on such
respective last interest or dividend date, no interest was paid or no cash or in kind dividends
declared, the issue shall not be deemed to be income producing. Common shares shall not be
deemed to be income producing unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related
balance sheet, there was at least one dividend paid upon such common shares.
8

Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of restricted securities. State the following

in a footnote: (a) As to each such issue: (1) Acquisition date, (2) carrying value per unit of

Except as provided in note 6, list separately the 50 largest issues and any other issue the

value of which exceeded one percent of net asset value of the registrant as of the close of the
period. For purposes of the list (including, in the case of short-term debt instruments, the first
sentence of note 4), aggregate and treat as a single issue, respectively, (a) short-term debt
instruments (i.e., debt instruments whose maturities or expiration dates at the time of acquisition
are one year or less) of the same issuer (indicating the range of interest rates and maturity dates);
and (b) fully collateralized repurchase agreements (indicate in a footnote the range of dates of the
repurchase agreements, the total purchase price of the securities, the total amount to be received
upon repurchase, the range of repurchase dates, and description of securities subject to the
repurchase agreements). Restricted and unrestricted securities of the same issue should be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the issue is among the 50 largest issues, but
should not be combined in the schedule. For purposes of determining whether the value of an
issue exceeds one percent of net asset value, aggregate and treat as a single issue all securities of
any one issuer, except that all fully collateralized repurchase agreements shall be aggregated and
treated as a single issue. The U.S. Treasury and each agency, instrumentality, or corporation,
including each government-sponsored entity, that issues U.S. government securities is a separate
issuer.

507

5

For options purchased, all information required by §210.12-13 for options contracts

written should be shown. Options on underlying investments where the underlying investment
would otherwise be presented in accordance with §§210.12-12, 12-13A, 12-13B, 12-13C, or 1213D should include the description of the underlying investment as would be required by
§§210.12-12, 12-13A, 12-13B, 12-13C, or 12-13D as part of the description of the option.
6

If multiple securities of an issuer aggregate to greater than one percent of net asset value,

list each issue of the issuer separately (including separate listing of restricted and unrestricted
securities of the same issue) except that the following may be aggregated and listed as a single
issue: (a) Fixed-income securities of the same issuer which are not among the 50 largest issues
and whose value does not exceed one percent of net asset value of the registrant as of the close of
the period (indicating the range of interest rates and maturity dates); and (b) U.S. government
securities of a single agency, instrumentality, or corporation, which are not among the 50 largest
issues and whose value does not exceed one percent of net asset value of the registrant as of the
close of the period (indicating the range of interest rates and maturity dates). For each category
identified pursuant to note 1, group all issues that are neither separately listed nor included in a
group of securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue in a sub-category labeled
“Other securities,” and provide the information for Columns C and D.
7

Any securities that would be required to be listed separately or included in a group of

securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue may be listed in one amount as
“Miscellaneous securities,” provided the securities so listed are eligible to be, and are,
categorized as “Miscellaneous securities” in the registrant's Schedule of Investments in
Securities of Unaffiliated Issuers required under §210.12-12. However, if any security that is
included in “Miscellaneous securities” would otherwise be required to be included in a group of

508

securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue, the remaining securities of that group
must nonetheless be listed as required by notes 4 and 5 even if the remaining securities alone
would not otherwise be required to be listed in this manner (e.g., because the combined value of
the security listed in “Miscellaneous securities” and the remaining securities of the same issuer
exceeds one percent of net asset value, but the value of the remaining securities alone does not
exceed one percent of net asset value).
8

If any securities are listed as “Miscellaneous securities” pursuant to note 6 or “Other

securities” pursuant to note 5, briefly explain in a footnote what those terms represent.
9

Total Column C. The total of Column C should equal the total shown on the related

balance sheet for investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers.
10

Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities which is non-income

producing. Evidences of indebtedness and preferred shares may be deemed to be income
producing if, on the respective last interest payment date or date for the declaration of dividends
prior to the date of the related balance sheet, there was only a partial payment of interest or a
declaration of only a partial amount of the dividends payable; in such case, however, each such
issue shall be indicated by an appropriate symbol referring to a note to the effect that, on the last
interest or dividend date, only partial interest was paid or partial dividends declared. If, on such
respective last interest or dividend date, no interest was paid or no cash or in kind dividends
declared, the issue shall not be deemed to be income producing. Common shares shall not be
deemed to be income producing unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related
balance sheet, there was at least one dividend paid upon such common shares.
11

Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of restricted securities. State the following

in a footnote: (a) as to each such issue: (1) Acquisition date, (2) carrying value per unit of

509

investment at date of related balance sheet, e.g., a percentage of current market value of
unrestricted securities of the same issuer, etc., and (3) the cost of such securities; (b) as to each
issue acquired during the year preceding the date of the related balance sheet, the carrying value
per unit of investment of unrestricted securities of the same issuer at: (1) The day the purchase
price was agreed to; and (2) the day on which an enforceable right to acquire such securities was
obtained; and (c) the aggregate value of all restricted securities and the percentage which the
aggregate value bears to net assets.

FORM N-CEN

Form N-CEN is to be used by all registered investment companies, other than faceamount certificate companies, to file annual reports with the Commission. Such reports
should be filed not later than 75 days after the close of the fiscal year for which the report is
being prepared, except that unit investment trusts shall file such reports not later than 75
days after the close of the calendar year for which the report is being prepared, pursuant to
rule 30a-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Act”) (17 CFR 270.30a-1). Faceamount certificate companies should continue to file periodic reports pursuant to section 13
or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). The Commission may
use the information provided on Form N-CEN in its regulatory, enforcement, examination,
disclosure review, inspection, and policymaking roles.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
A.

Rule as to Use of Form N-CEN

Form N-CEN is the reporting form that is to be used for annual reports filed pursuant to
rule 30a-1 under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-1) by registered investment companies, other
than face-amount certificate companies, under section 30(a) of the Act and, in the case of
small business investment companies and registered unit investment trusts, under section 13
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, if applicable.
Registrants must respond to all items in the relevant Parts of Form N-CEN, as listed
below in this General Instruction A. If an item within a required Part is inapplicable, the
Registrant should respond “N/A” to that item. Registrants are not, however, required to
respond to items in Parts of Form N-CEN that they are not required by this General
Instruction A to respond to.
Management investment companies: Management investment companies other than small
business investment companies must complete Parts A, B, C, and G of this Form.
Management investment companies that offer multiple series must complete Part C as to
each series separately, even if some information is the same for two or more series. Closedend management investment companies also must complete Part D of this Form. Small
business investment companies must complete Parts A, B, D, and G of this Form.
Management investment companies that are registered on Form N-3 also must complete
certain items in Part F of this Form as directed by Item B.6.c.i.
Exchange-traded funds or exchange-traded managed funds: Funds that are exchange-traded
funds or exchange-traded managed funds, as defined by this Form, must complete Part E of
this Form in addition to any other required Parts.
Unit investment trusts: Unit investment trusts must complete Parts A, B, F, and G of
this Form.

535

B.

Application of General Rules and Regulations

The General Rules and Regulations under the Act contain certain general requirements
that are applicable to reporting on any form under the Act. These general requirements
should be carefully read and observed in the preparation and filing of reports on this Form,
except that any provision in the Form or in these instructions shall be controlling.
C.

Filing of Report

1.

All registered investment companies with shares outstanding (other than shares
issued in connection with an initial investment to satisfy section 14(a) of the Act)
must file a report on Form N-CEN at least annually. Management investment
companies offering multiple series with different fiscal year ends must file a report
as of each fiscal year end that responds to (i) Parts A, B, and G, and (ii) Part C
and, if applicable, Part E as to only those series with the fiscal year end covered
by the report.
If a Registrant changes its fiscal year, a report filed on Form N-CEN may cover a
period shorter than 12 months, but in no event may a report filed on Form NCEN cover a period longer than 12 months or a period that overlaps with a
period covered by a previously filed report. For example, if in 2017 a Registrant
with a September 30 fiscal year end changes its fiscal year end to December 31,
the Registrant could file a report on this Form for the fiscal period ending
September 30, 2017 and a report for the period ending December 31, 2017. A
Registrant could not, however, only file a report for the fiscal period ending
December 31, 2017 if its last report was filed for the fiscal period ending
September 30, 2016.
An extension of time of up to 15 days for filing the form may be obtained by
following the procedures specified in rule l2b-25 under the Exchange Act (17
CFR 240.12b-25).

2.

A registrant may file an amendment to a previously filed report at any time,
including an amendment to correct a mistake or error in a previously filed report.
A registrant that files an amendment to a previously filed report must provide
information in response to all required items of Form N-CEN, regardless of why
the amendment is filed.

3.

Reports must be filed electronically using the Commission’s Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system in accordance with
Regulation S-T. Consult the EDGAR Filer Manual and Appendices for
EDGAR filing instructions.

D.

Paperwork Reduction Act Information

A registrant is required to disclose the information specified by Form N-CEN, and the
Commission will make this information public, except for information reported in response
536

to Item B.9.h. A registrant is not required to respond to the collection of information
contained in Form N-CEN unless the form displays a currently valid Office of Management
and Budget (“OMB”) control number. Please direct comments concerning the accuracy of
the information collection burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing the burden to
the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549. The OMB
has reviewed this collection of information under the clearance requirements of 44 U.S.C.
3507.
E.

be used:
1.

If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies
the amount of the commission to be paid by the Registrant, the transaction should be
considered an agency transaction and included in determining the answers to Item
C.16.

2.

If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation specifies
only the net amount to be paid or received by the Registrant and such net amount is
equal to the market value of the security at the time of the transaction, the transaction
should be considered a principal transaction and included in determining the amounts

should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17

receiving from the issuer.

If a security is sold by the Registrant in a tender offer, the sale should be considered a
principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17 even though the Registrant
has knowledge of the amount the offeror is paying to soliciting brokers or dealers.

5.

If a security is purchased directly from the issuer (such as a bank CD), the purchase
should be considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item C.17.

6.

The value of called or maturing securities should not be counted in either agency or
principal transactions and should not be included in determining the amounts shown
in Item C.16 and Item C.17. This means that the acquisition of a security may be
included, but it is possible that its disposition may not be included. Disposition of a
repurchase agreement at its expiration date should not be included.

7.

The purchase or sales of securities in transactions not described in paragraphs (1)
through (6) above should be evaluated by the Fund based upon the guidelines
established in those paragraphs and classified accordingly. The agents considered in

under this item; however, the limitation on civil, criminal, and administrative actions under

item.

FORM N-PORT
MONTHLY PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS REPORT
Form N-PORT is to be used by a registered management investment company, or an
exchange-traded fund organized as a unit investment trust, or series thereof (“Fund”), other
than a Fund that is regulated as a money market fund (“money market fund”) under rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a] (“Act”) (17 CFR
270.2a-7) or a small business investment company (“SBIC”) registered on Form N-5 (17
CFR 239.24 and 274.5), to file monthly portfolio holdings reports pursuant to rule 30b1-9
under the Act (17 CFR 270.30b1-9). The Commission may use the information provided on
Form N-PORT in its regulatory, enforcement, examination, disclosure review, inspection,
and policymaking roles.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
A.

Rule as to Use of Form N-PORT

Form N-PORT is the reporting form that is to be used for monthly reports of Funds
other than money market funds and SBICs under section 30(b) of the Act, as required by
rule 30b1-9 under the Act (17 CFR 270.30b1-9). Funds must report information about their
portfolios and each of their portfolio holdings as of the last business day, or last calendar
day, of the month. A registered investment company that has filed a registration statement
with the Commission registering its securities for the first time under the Securities Act of
1933 is relieved of this reporting obligation with respect to any reporting period or portion
thereof prior to the date on which that registration statement becomes effective or is
withdrawn.
If the due date falls on a weekend or holiday, the filing deadline will be the next business
day. Reports on Form N-PORT must disclose portfolio information as calculated by the
fund for the reporting period’s ending net asset value (commonly, and as permitted by rule
2a-4, the first business day following the trade date). Reports on Form N-PORT must be
filed with the Commission no later than 30 days after the end of each month. Each Fund is
required to file a separate report.
A Fund may file an amendment to a previously filed report at any time, including an
amendment to correct a mistake or error in a previously filed report. A Fund that files an
amendment to a previously filed report must provide information in response to all items of
Form N-PORT, regardless of why the amendment is filed.
B.

Application of General Rules and Regulations

The General Rules and Regulations under the Act contain certain general requirements
that are applicable to reporting on any form under the Act. These general requirements shall
be carefully read and observed in the preparation and filing of reports on this Form, except
that any provision in the Form or in these instructions shall be controlling.

582

C.

Filing of Reports

Reports must be filed electronically using the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system in accordance with Regulation S-T. Consult
the EDGAR Filer Manual and Appendices for EDGAR filing instructions.
D.

Paperwork Reduction Act Information

A Fund is not required to respond to the collection of information contained in Form NPORT unless the form displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget
(“OMB”) control number. Please direct comments concerning the accuracy of the
information collection burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing the burden to the
Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549. OMB has
reviewed this collection of information under the clearance requirements of 44 U.S.C. 3507.
E.

Definitions

References to sections and rules in this Form N-PORT are to the Act, unless otherwise
indicated. Terms used in this Form N-PORT have the same meanings as in the Act or
related rules, unless otherwise indicated.
As used in this Form N-PORT, the terms set out below have the following meanings:
“Class” means a class of shares issued by a Fund that has more than one class that
represents interests in the same portfolio of securities under rule 18f-3 [17 CFR 270.18f-3] or

80a-18].
“Controlled Foreign Corporation” has the meaning provided in section 957 of the
Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 957].
“Exchange-Traded Fund” means an open-end management investment company (or

and operates under an exemptive order under the Act granted by the Commission or in
reliance on an exemptive rule under the Act adopted by the Commission.
“Fund” means the Registrant or a separate Series of the Registrant. When an item of
Form N-PORT specifically applies to a Registrant or a Series, those terms will be used.
“ISIN” means, with respect to any security, the “international securities identification
number” assigned by a national numbering agency, partner, or substitute agency that is
coordinated by the Association of National Numbering Agencies.
“LEI” means, with respect to any company, the “legal entity identifier” as assigned by a
utility endorsed by the Global LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee or accredited by the
Global LEI Foundation. In the case of a financial institution, if a “legal entity identifier”

583

has not been assigned, then provide the RSSD ID, if any, assigned by the National
Information Center of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
“Multiple Class Fund” means a Fund that has more than one Class.
“Registrant” means a management investment company, or an Exchange-Traded Fund
organized as a unit investment trust, registered under the Act.
“Restricted Security” has the meaning defined in rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act
of 1933 [17 CFR 230.144(a)(3)].

F.

Public Availability

Information reported on Form N-PORT for the third month of each Fund’s fiscal
quarter will be made publicly available 60 days after the end of the Fund’s fiscal quarter.
The SEC does not intend to make public the information reported on Form N-PORT for
the first and second months of each Fund’s fiscal quarter that is identifiable to any particular
fund or adviser, or any information reported with regards to country of risk and economic
exposure (Item C.5.b of this Form), delta (Items C.9.f.5, C.11.c.vii, or C.11.g.iv), or
miscellaneous securities (Part D of this Form), or explanatory notes related to any of those
topics (Part E) that is identifiable to any particular fund or adviser. However, the SEC may
use information reported on this Form in its regulatory programs, including examinations,
investigations, and enforcement actions.
G.

Responses to Questions

In responding to the items on this Form, the following guidelines apply unless otherwise
specifically indicated:


Funds may respond to this Form using their own internal methodologies and the
conventions of their service providers, provided the information is consistent with
information that they report internally and to current and prospective investors.
However, the methodologies and conventions must be consistently applied and the
Fund’s responses must be consistent with any instructions or other guidance relating to
this Form. A Fund may explain any of its methodologies, including related assumptions,
in Part E.



A Fund is not required to respond to an item that is wholly inapplicable (for example, no
response would be required for Item C.11 when reporting information about an
584

investment that is not a derivative). If a sub-item requests information that is not
applicable (for example, an LEI for a counterparty that does not have an LEI), respond
N/A;


If an item requests the name of an entity, provide the full name to the extent known, and
do not use abbreviations (other than abbreviations that are part of the full name);



If an item requests information expressed as a percentage, enter the response as a
percentage (not a decimal), (e.g., 5.27%);



For currencies other than U.S. dollars, also report the applicable three-letter alphabetic
currency code pursuant to the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”)
4217 standard;



If an item requests a unique identifier, such an identifier may be internally generated by
the Fund or provided by a third party, but should be consistently used across the Fund’s
filings for reporting that investment so that the Commission, investors, and other users
of the information can track the investment from report to report;



If an item requests a date, provide information in yyyy/mm/dd format; and



If an item requests information regarding a “holding” or “investment,” separately report
information as to each holding or investment that is recorded in the Fund’s books as part
of a larger transaction. For example, two or more partially offsetting legs of a
transaction entered into with the same counterparty under a common master agreement
shall each be separately reported.
