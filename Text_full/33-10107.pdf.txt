AMENDMENTS TO SMALLER REPORTING COMPANY DEFINITION
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rules.
SUMMARY: We are proposing amendments to the definition of “smaller reporting company”
as used in our rules and regulations. The proposed amendments, which would expand the
number of registrants that qualify as smaller reporting companies, are intended to promote
capital formation and reduce compliance costs for smaller registrants, while maintaining investor
protections. Registrants with less than $250 million in public float would qualify, as would
registrants with zero public float if their revenues were below $100 million in the previous year.

Introduction
Over the years, the Commission has sought to promote capital formation and reduce

compliance costs for smaller registrants while maintaining investor protections. 7 Our disclosure
system provides accommodations in the form of scaled disclosure requirements for certain
categories of smaller registrants in an attempt to further these goals.
Smaller reporting companies are one category of registrants eligible for scaled
disclosure. 8 The Commission established the smaller reporting company category of registrants in
2007 in an effort to provide general regulatory relief for smaller registrants. 9 The smaller reporting
company definition replaced the “small business issuer” definition in former Regulation S-B. The
Commission created Regulation S-B, a small business integrated registration and reporting system,
in 1992 as part of a larger effort to facilitate small business capital formation and reduce the
compliance burdens placed on small registrants by the federal securities laws. 10 Regulation S-B

7

See, e.g., Simplified Registration and Reporting Requirements for Small Issuers, Release No. 33-6049 (Apr. 3,
1979) [44 FR 21562 (Apr. 10, 1979)] (Form S-18 Release); Small Business Initiatives, Release No. 33-6924
(Mar. 11, 1992) [57 FR 9768 (Mar. 20, 1992)].

8

In 2012, Title I of the JOBS Act created a new category of registrant called an “emerging growth company.”
Pub. L. No. 112-106, Secs. 102-104, 126 Stat. 306 (2012). Emerging growth companies (EGCs) also are eligible
for a variety of accommodations, including certain of the scaled disclosure accommodations available to smaller
reporting companies, such as the scaled executive compensation disclosures under Item 402(l) through (r) of
Regulation S-K. In addition, EGCs are exempt from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestation
of internal control over financial reporting. For a discussion of scaled disclosure accommodations available to
EGCs, see Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation S-K, Release No. 33-10064 (Apr. 13,
2016) [81 FR 23915 (April 22, 2016)] (Regulation S-K Concept Release).
A registrant qualifies as an EGC if it did not complete its first registered sale of common equity securities on or
before December 8, 2011 and has total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently
completed fiscal year.

Smaller Reporting Company Regulatory Relief and Simplification, Release No. 33-8876 (Dec. 19, 2007) [73 FR
934 (Jan. 4, 2008)] (Smaller Reporting Company Adopting Release).

10

Small Business Initiatives, Release No. 33-6949 (July 30, 1992) [57 FR 36442 (Aug. 13, 1992)]. The
Commission rescinded Regulation S-B when it established the smaller reporting company definition. Regulation
S-B was modeled after former Form S-18, which allowed issuers that were not subject to the Commission’s
reporting requirements to raise limited amounts of capital without immediately incurring the full range of
disclosure and reporting obligations required of other issuers. See Form S-18 Release. While Form S-18 was

6

was specifically tailored to small business issuers, which were issuers with both annual revenues
and public floats of less than $25 million.
Smaller reporting company is defined in Securities Act Rule 405, Exchange Act Rule
12b-2 and Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K. Substantively, the three definitions are identical.
Smaller reporting companies generally11 are registrants with:
•

less than $75 million in public float as of the last business day of their most recently
completed second fiscal quarter; 12 or

•

zero public float 13 and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most
recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.

Smaller reporting companies may comply selectively with the scaled disclosures available to
them on an item-by-item basis.14 The following table summarizes the scaled disclosure

intended to facilitate small business access to public capital markets, eligibility to use the form was based on
offering size, not issuer size. The Commission rescinded Form S-18 when it adopted Regulation S-B.
11

The smaller reporting company definition specifically excludes investment companies, asset-backed issuers (as
defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1101]) and majority-owned subsidiaries of a parent that is
not a smaller reporting company. Lower public float and revenue thresholds apply to registrants that determined
that they did not qualify as smaller reporting companies in the prior year, but are eligible to transition to smaller
reporting company status. Specifically, these registrants would qualify as smaller reporting companies if their
public float was less than $50 million as of the last business day of their most recently completed second fiscal
quarter or they had zero public float as of such date and revenues of less than $40 million during the previous
fiscal year.

12

Public float is computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of a registrant’s voting and
non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the
average of the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common equity. A
registrant filing its initial registration statement under the Securities Act or Exchange Act calculates its public
float by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held
by non-affiliates before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act registration statement, the number of
such shares included in the registration statement by the estimated public offering price of the shares. In
contrast, market capitalization reflects the value of a registrant’s voting and non-voting common equity held by
all holders, whether affiliates or non-affiliates.

13

A registrant may have zero public float because it has no public equity outstanding or no market price for its
equity exists. Based on data compiled by the Commission’s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA),
in calendar year 2015, approximately 18 percent of smaller reporting companies had no public float.

14

See Smaller Reporting Company Adopting Release. Where a disclosure requirement applicable to smaller
reporting companies is more stringent than the corresponding requirement for non-smaller reporting companies,
however, smaller reporting companies must comply with the more stringent standard. The Smaller Reporting

II.

Proposed Amendments
A.

Rationale for Proposed Amendments

The Commission seeks to promote capital formation and reduce compliance costs for
smaller registrants while maintaining investor protections. 17 Raising the financial thresholds in
the smaller reporting company definition attempts to further these goals by expanding the
number of smaller registrants that are eligible to deliver scaled disclosure to their investors.
Doing so also would address several recommendations made to us multiple times by our
Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies (ACSEC) 18 and the SEC GovernmentBusiness Forum on Small Business Capital Formation (Small Business Forum), 19 as well as
comments from small registrants, Congress and others. 20
Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies. In September 2015 and March
2013, the ACSEC recommended revising the smaller reporting company definition to include
17

See note 7.

18

The Commission established the ACSEC in 2011 with the objective of providing the Commission with advice on
its rules, regulations and policies with regard to its mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly and
efficient markets and facilitating capital formation, as they relate to: (1) capital raising by emerging privatelyheld small businesses (emerging companies) and publicly traded companies with less than $250 million in public
market capitalization (smaller public companies) through securities offerings, including private and limited
offerings and initial and other public offerings; (2) trading in the securities of emerging companies and smaller
public companies; and (3) public reporting and corporate governance requirements of emerging companies and
smaller public companies. See Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies Charter (Sept. 24,
2015); Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies, Release No. 33-9258 (Sept. 12, 2011) [76 FR
57769 (Sept. 16, 2011)]. The Commission’s Investor Advisory Committee has not provided the Commission
with a recommendation regarding the smaller reporting company definition.

19

The Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980 directed the Commission to conduct an annual
government-business forum to undertake an ongoing review of the financing problems of small businesses.
15 U.S.C. 80c-1. The Small Business Forum has met annually since 1982 to provide a platform to highlight
perceived unnecessary impediments to small business capital formation and address whether they can be
eliminated or reduced. Each forum seeks to develop recommendations for government and private action to
improve the environment for small business capital formation, consistent with other public policy goals,
including investor protection. Information about the Small Business Forum is available at
http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/sbforum.shtml.

registrants with a public float of up to $250 million. 21 The 2013 ACSEC Recommendations also
included a recommendation to revise the smaller reporting company definition for registrants that
are unable to calculate their public float to include registrants with less than $100 million in
annual revenues.
Small Business Forum. The 2015 Small Business Forum recommended that the smaller
reporting company definition be revised to include registrants with a public float of less than
$250 million or registrants with a public float of less than $700 million and annual revenues of
less than $100 million.22
Regulation S-K Study. Section 108 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS
Act) 23 required the Commission to conduct a review of Regulation S-K and to transmit to
Congress a report of the review. In December 2013, the Commission published a staff report on
the review of the disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K (S-K Study). 24 The S-K Study

available at https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec/acsec-recommendation-032113-smaller-public-co-ltr.pdf.
Both of these recommendations also included a recommendation that the Commission revise the “accelerated
filer” definition to include companies with a public float of $250 million or more, but less than $700 million.
The accelerated filer definition currently includes companies with a public float of $75 million or more, but less
than $700 million. Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. If these recommendations were implemented, non-EGC
registrants with public floats between $75 million and $250 million would not be required to provide an auditor
attestation report under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-204, 1116 Stat. 745
(2002) (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)). See Section II.C for a discussion of the accelerated filer definition.

recommended consideration of the criteria used to determine eligibility for scaling of disclosure
requirements, including the definitional thresholds for smaller reporting companies.
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative Comments. The Commission staff currently is
undertaking a broad-based review of our disclosure requirements, known as the Disclosure
Effectiveness Initiative. 25 As part of the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative, the staff requested
public input generally on how our disclosure system could be improved and, while the staff did
not ask specifically for comment on smaller reporting companies, it received some comments on
the smaller reporting company definition and scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller
reporting companies. 26 Only three commenters addressed the smaller reporting company
definition or the general concept of scaling disclosure requirements for smaller reporting
companies. 27 One of these commenters generally supported scaled disclosure requirements,
noting that smaller companies face challenges when preparing annual reports. 28 Another of these
commenters suggested that overreliance on public float to define smaller reporting companies
creates a compliance burden for registrants with high valuations that otherwise would be
considered small. 29 This commenter recommended revising the smaller reporting company
definition to include registrants with a public float below $250 million or annual revenues below
$100 million regardless of public float to avoid grouping “highly valued” registrants with little or
no revenue with larger registrants. The third commenter expressed concerns with a differential

Comment letters related to this request are available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/disclosureeffectiveness/disclosureeffectiveness.shtml.

Other commenters commented on the placement of scaled disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K and on the
scaled disclosure requirements available to EGCs. For a discussion of these comments, see Section IV.H of the
S-K Concept Release. For purposes of this proposal, we focus on comments relevant to the smaller reporting
company definition.

disclosure regime for different sized entities, stating that “investors will factor the differences
(i.e., they will price the lack of transparency, clarity and comparability in what may be perceived
to be lower-quality requirements) into their price determinations.” 30
FAST Act. The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act of 2015 31 requires
the Commission to revise Regulation S–K to further scale or eliminate disclosure requirements to
reduce the burden on a variety of smaller registrants, including smaller reporting companies,
while still providing all material information to investors. 32 Because a number of Regulation S-K
items already provide scaled disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies, raising the
financial thresholds in the smaller reporting company definition would be responsive to the
FAST Act because it would reduce the burden on smaller registrants by increasing the number of
registrants eligible for scaled disclosure.
Although the proposed amendments would permit a broader group of registrants to make
scaled disclosure to their investors, we do not believe that the scaled disclosure would
significantly alter the total mix of information available about these registrants. We believe the
existing scaled disclosure requirements benefit the current pool of smaller reporting companies,
but we are requesting comment on how an extension of scaled disclosure requirements to a
proposed broader pool of registrants could affect investors’ access to material information about
registrants. We further believe that the Commission should periodically re-evaluate whether the

31

Pub. L. No. 114-94, 129 Stat. 1312 (2015).

32

Specifically, FAST Act § 72002 requires the Commission within 180 days of enactment “to take all such actions
to revise [R]egulation S-K…to further scale or eliminate requirements of [R]egulation S-K, in order to reduce
the burden on emerging growth companies, accelerated filers, smaller reporting companies, and other smaller
issuers, while still providing all material information to investors.” The FAST Act also requires the Commission
to carry out a study to determine how best to modernize and simplify the disclosure requirements in Regulation
S-K in consultation with the Investor Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging
Companies, to issue a report of findings and recommendations to Congress, and to propose revisions to those
requirements. Pub. L. No. 114-94, Sec. 72003, 129 Stat. 1312 (2015).

13

definition of smaller reporting company remains appropriate. Under our proposed amendments,
the additional registrants that would qualify for scaled disclosure would remain subject to
liability for their disclosures and, in addition to the information expressly required to be included
by the rules, would be required to provide such further material information, if any, as may be
necessary to make any required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. 33 In addition, their disclosure would be subject to the same review that
they currently receive as part of the Division of Corporation Finance’s review process. These
measures of investor protection would remain unchanged under the proposed amendments.
Although the proposed amendments would not affect the existing scaled disclosure
requirements in Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X, we are considering our approach to scaled
disclosure generally in connection with the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. To that end, in
April 2016, we issued the Regulation S-K Concept Release in which we considered and sought
comment on other aspects of our scaled disclosure system, including categories of registrants
eligible for scaled disclosure, whether we should exclude certain types of registrants from the use
of scaled disclosure, and whether and how we should scale our disclosure requirements.
Comments received on the Regulation S-K Concept Release will help to inform any further
consideration of changes to the scaled disclosure system or other changes in connection with the
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative.
B.

Proposed Amendments to Smaller Reporting Company Definition

We are proposing amendments to the smaller reporting company definition to expand the
number of registrants that qualify as smaller reporting companies and thereby benefit from
scaled disclosure requirements. In addition, we are proposing amendments to the “accelerated
33

See Securities Act Rule 408 [17 CFR 230.408] and Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 [17 CFR 240.12b-20].

14

filer” and “large accelerated filer” definitions in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 to preserve the
application of the current thresholds contained in those definitions. 34
When considering potential new thresholds for the public float and revenue calculations,
we determined that solely adjusting those thresholds for inflation would not meaningfully reduce
the burdens on smaller registrants because it would have a small impact on the number of
additional registrants that would qualify as smaller reporting companies. If adjusted for
inflation, the $75 million public float threshold set in 2007 would be equivalent to $85.7 million,
and the $50 million revenue threshold set in 2007 would be equivalent to $57.2 million.35
We also considered that EGCs, many of which have larger public floats and revenues
than smaller reporting companies, are eligible for a variety of accommodations, including certain
scaled disclosure accommodations. The EGC accommodations, however, are time-limited for
equity issuers, as they phase out generally by the fifth anniversary of the first registered sale of
common equity securities of the registrant. 36 Because smaller reporting company status is not

34

The definitions of accelerated filer and large accelerated filer are based on public float, but contain a provision
excluding registrants that are eligible to use the smaller reporting company requirements in Regulation S-K for
their annual and quarterly reports. As a result, raising the smaller reporting company public float threshold
without eliminating that provision effectively would raise the accelerated filer public float threshold. See
Section II.C for a discussion of the proposed amendments to the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer
definitions.

35

The inflation adjustment was performed using the CPI calculator of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl). For further discussion of the impact of adjusting the thresholds solely for
inflation, including the number of additional registrants that would be eligible for smaller reporting company
status, see note 99 and related text.

36

A registrant retains EGC status until the earliest of: (1) the last day of its fiscal year during which its total annual
gross revenues are $1 billion or more; (2) the date it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the
Commission’s rules; (3) the date on which it has issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the
previous three years; or (4) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first registered
sale of common equity securities of the registrant. Pub. L. No. 112-106, Sec. 101, 126 Stat. 306 (2012); 15
U.S.C. 77b(a)(19); 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80). In addition, the FAST Act amended Securities Act Section 6(e)(1) [15
U.S.C. 77 f(e)(1)] to provide a grace period for EGCs at risk of losing such status after the initial filing or
confidential submission of their initial public offering (IPO) registration statement but before the IPO is
completed. Such registrants shall continue to be treated as an EGC through the earlier of the consummation of
the IPO or one year after they would otherwise cease to be an EGC. See Pub. L. No. 114-94, Sec. 71002, 129
Stat. 1312 (2015).

time-limited and could extend indefinitely depending on the company’s growth, we believe that
the new smaller reporting company thresholds should be lower than the thresholds to qualify as
an EGC, which this proposal would maintain.
The smaller reporting company thresholds we are proposing today are consistent with
those recommended by the ACSEC and the Small Business Forum, although they would be more
limited in some respects. 37 These amendments use the same criteria of public float and revenues
to determine smaller reporting company status that the Commission adopted in 2007. We are,
however, seeking comment on whether we should use other criteria and, if so, what criteria we
should consider. 38
Under the proposed definition, registrants 39 with a public float of less than $250 million
would qualify as smaller reporting companies. 40 Consistent with the current definition, a
reporting company would determine whether it qualifies as a smaller reporting company by
calculating its public float as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal
quarter. 41 Similarly, as with the current definition, a registrant filing its initial registration
statement under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act would calculate its public float as of a
date within 30 days of filing the registration statement. 42 A registrant whose public float was

million during its most recently completed fiscal year. 43
Under the proposed definition, a registrant that determines that it does not qualify as a
smaller reporting company will remain unqualified unless and until it determines that its public
float was less than $200 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second
fiscal quarter. 44 If such a registrant’s public float was zero, it would remain unqualified unless
and until it had annual revenues of less than $80 million during its previous fiscal year. 45

company definition.

Empirical analysis conducted by the Commission’s Division of Economic and Risk
Analysis (DERA) suggests that scaled disclosures may generate a modest, but statistically
significant, amount of cost savings in terms of the reduction in compliance costs for most of the
newly eligible smaller reporting companies under the proposed amendments, a modest, but
statistically significant, deterioration in some of the proxies used to assess the overall quality of
information environment, and a muted effect on the growth of the registrant’s capital
investments, investments in research and development (R&D) and assets. 46
1.

Public Float Thresholds

In 2015, approximately 32% of registrants had less than $75 million in public float, 47
compared to approximately 42% of registrants when the smaller reporting company was
established. 48 The decrease in the size of the pool of registrants that qualify as smaller reporting
companies has limited the benefits of scaled reporting to a smaller percentage of registrants than
under the original definition. If adopted as proposed, increasing the public float threshold to
$250 million would result in approximately 42% of registrants qualifying as smaller reporting
companies based on their public float. 49 As is the case with the current definition, we believe

46

For a discussion of DERA’s empirical analysis, see Section III.B.

47

Based on public float values disclosed by registrants in their Form 10-K filings, 2,408, or 31.8%, of the 7,557
registrants that filed a Form 10-K in 2015 reported having a public float of less than $75 million.

48

Approximately 4,976, or 41.8%, of the 11,898 registrants that filed Exchange Act annual reports in 2006 had a
public float of less than $75 million. See Smaller Reporting Company Regulatory Relief and Simplification,
Release No. 33-8819 (July 5, 2007) [72 FR 39670 (July 19, 2007)]. The release cites data from the
Commission’s EDGAR filing system and Thomson Financial (Datastream). The Datastream data included all
registered public firms trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq, the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets and excluded closed end funds, exchange traded funds,
American depositary receipts and direct foreign listings.

Based on public float values disclosed by registrants in their Form 10-K filings, 3,159, or 41.8%, of the 7,557

that once a registrant determines that it does not qualify as a smaller reporting company, 50 it
should not qualify until its public float falls below another, lower threshold. This definitional
structure helps to avoid situations in which registrants enter and exit smaller reporting company
status due to small fluctuations in their public float. Therefore, we propose increasing the public
float threshold from $50 million to $200 million for registrants that determined that they did not
qualify as smaller reporting companies and subsequently seek to qualify.
2.

Revenue Thresholds

In 2015, approximately 10% of registrants qualified as smaller reporting companies by
having zero public float and less than $50 million in annual revenues. 51 The number of
registrants that would qualify as smaller reporting companies would increase by 31, or less than
1%, if the annual revenue threshold were adopted as proposed and increased to $100 million. 52
The threshold is consistent with thresholds recommended by the ACSEC and the Small Business
Forum. 53
Under the current definition, once a registrant determines that it does not qualify as a
smaller reporting company, 54 it cannot qualify based on revenues until its revenues fall below
$40 million. As discussed above with respect to the public float thresholds, we believe having a
separate, lower revenue threshold for these registrants helps to avoid situations in which
50

annual determination in the case of reporting registrants.

51

775, or 10.3%, of the 7,557 registrants that filed a Form 10-K in 2015 reported having zero public float and less
than $50 million in annual revenues, based on public float values and revenues disclosed by registrants in their
Form 10-K filings.

52

Based on public float values and revenues disclosed by registrants in their Form 10-K filings, 31 of the 7,557
registrants that filed a Form 10-K in 2015 had zero public float and between $50 million and $100 million in
annual revenues.

54

Either upon an initial determination in the case of registrants filing an initial registration statement, or as of an
annual determination in the case of reporting registrants.

registrants enter and exit smaller reporting company status due to small fluctuations in their
revenues. Increasing the annual revenue threshold from $40 million to $80 million for
registrants with zero public float that determined that they did not qualify as smaller reporting
companies but subsequently seek to qualify would maintain the ratio that exists between the $50
million and $40 million thresholds in the current definition.
We are not proposing, as recommended by one commenter on the Disclosure
Effectiveness Initiative, 55 to eliminate the public float criteria for registrants that meet these
proposed revenue thresholds or any other revenue thresholds. When the Commission proposed
the smaller reporting company definition, it specifically solicited comment on a revenue-only
test. In adopting the smaller reporting company definition, the Commission noted that the
majority of commenters supported the proposal to use a public float standard in most cases,
agreeing that the Commission should use a revenue test only if a registrant is unable to calculate
its public float. 56 By eliminating the revenue test for most registrants, the Commission stated that
the new definition of smaller reporting company would simplify and streamline the definition
while expanding the number of companies eligible to qualify. The amendments to the smaller
reporting company definition we are now proposing retain this approach because we believe that
the public float test has worked well in practice and has streamlined the definition, 57 as the
Commission intended when it adopted the current test. 58 We do, however, request comment

See BIO Letter.

See Smaller Reporting Company Adopting Release. The small business issuer definition, which the smaller
reporting company definition replaced, was based on both public float and annual revenue.

company definition.

smaller reporting company definition.
C.

Proposed Amendments to Accelerated Filer and Large Accelerated Filer
Definitions

We are not proposing to amend the public float thresholds for when a registrant would
qualify as an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer. 59 We are proposing amendments to those
definitions, however, to eliminate the provision in each that specifically excludes registrants that
are eligible to use the smaller reporting company requirements under Regulation S-K for their
annual and quarterly reports. 60 As a result, the proposed amendments would preserve the
application of the current thresholds contained in the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer
definitions.
Because the public float thresholds for exiting smaller reporting company status and
entering accelerated filer status currently are both $75 million, and the determinations are both
made as of the last business day of a registrant’s second fiscal quarter, the smaller reporting
company provision in the accelerated filer definition does not currently exclude from the
accelerated filer definition any registrants that would not otherwise be excluded. If we raised the
smaller reporting company public float threshold to $250 million without eliminating the smaller
reporting company provision from the accelerated filer definition, however, those registrants

59

Accelerated filer and large accelerated filer are defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. Being an accelerated filer
or a large accelerated filer triggers the requirement contained in Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that a
non-EGC registrant’s registered public accounting firm provide, for inclusion in the registrant’s annual report, an
attestation report on internal control over financial reporting. Accelerated and large accelerated filers also must
provide their internet address and disclosure regarding the availability of their filings required by Items 101(e)(3)
and (4) of Regulation S-K, as well as disclosure required by Item 1B of Form 10-K about unresolved staff
comments on their periodic or current reports. In addition, accelerated and large accelerated filers are subject to
accelerated periodic report filing deadlines.

with public floats of up to $250 million would be excluded from the accelerated filer
requirements because they would be eligible under the proposed amendments to use the smaller
reporting company requirements under Regulation S-K. In effect, we would be raising the
accelerated filer public float threshold indirectly. Eliminating the smaller reporting company
provision in the accelerated filer definition, therefore, would maintain the status quo regarding
the size of registrants that are subject to the accelerated filer disclosure and filing requirements.
The public float threshold for entering large accelerated filer status currently is $700
million, so the smaller reporting company provision in the large accelerated filer definition does
not currently exclude from the large accelerated filer definition any registrants that would not
otherwise be excluded. If the proposed amendments were adopted and the smaller reporting
company public float threshold became $250 million, the smaller reporting company provision in
the large accelerated filer definition still would not exclude any registrants that would not
otherwise be excluded. Nevertheless, we are proposing to eliminate this provision because it
currently does not capture any registrants, would not capture any registrants if the proposed
amendments were adopted, and could lead to confusion if retained.
In September 2015, the ACSEC recommended that the Commission revise the
accelerated filer definition to include registrants with a public float threshold of $250 million or
more, but less than $700 million.61 If we implemented this recommendation, in addition to
having a longer period to file their annual and quarterly reports, non-EGCs with public floats
between $75 million and $250 million would no longer be required to provide, and investors in

those registrants would no longer receive the benefits of, auditor attestation reports required by
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 62
In April 2011, the staff conducted a study (Staff Section 404(b) Study) 63 mandated by the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act) 64 to determine
how the Commission could reduce the burden of complying with Section 404(b) of the SarbanesOxley Act for registrants with market capitalizations between $75 million and $250 million. 65
The staff’s analysis, in part, found no specific evidence that any potential savings from
exempting registrants with public floats between $75 million and $250 million from the auditor
attestation provisions of Section 404(b) would justify the loss of investor protections and benefits
to registrants from such an exemption. 66 Rather, the staff found that accelerated filers (including
those with a public float between $75 million and $250 million) that were subject to the Section
404(b) auditor attestation requirements generally had a lower restatement rate than registrants
that were not subject to the requirements. Moreover, the staff found that the population of
62

As a general matter, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that the management of certain registrants assess the
effectiveness of the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting, while Section 404(b) specifically
requires a registrant’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment.

See Dodd-Frank Act § 989G(b). That section also provided that the study shall “consider whether any such
methods of reducing the compliance burden or a complete exemption for such companies from compliance with
such section would encourage companies to list on exchanges in the United States in their initial public
offerings.”

66

In 2007, the Commission issued interpretive guidance for management regarding its evaluation of internal
controls and disclosure requirements, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board adopted Auditing
Standard No. 5 regarding Audits of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (AS 5) in an effort to reduce the
compliance burden and improve the implementation of Section 404, including the requirements of Section
404(b). See Commission Guidance Regarding Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Release No. 33-8810 (June 20,
2007) [72 FR 35324 (June 27, 2007)]. However, one stakeholder representative has raised concerns about
whether, in response to PCAOB inspection results, some auditors more recently have started to take approaches
to evaluating internal control over financial reporting that are inconsistent with attaining goals for reduced
compliance costs in this area. See letter from Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (May 29, 2015).

23

registrants with public floats between $75 million and $250 million did not have sufficiently
unique characteristics that would justify differentiating this population of registrants from other
accelerated filers with respect to the Section 404 auditor attestation requirements. 67 Ultimately,
the study recommended that the Section 404(b) requirements be maintained for accelerated
filers, including those with a public float between $75 million and $250 million. 68
Since the staff’s study was concluded, academic research has resulted in mixed
findings. 69 In light of these mixed findings, we are not proposing to raise the accelerated filer
public float threshold or to modify the Section 404(b) requirements for registrants with a public
float between $75 million and $250 million. However, we are requesting comment below on
whether we should consider raising the public float threshold in the accelerated filer definition.
D.

Request for Comment

1.

Should the thresholds for smaller reporting company status be raised? Why or
why not? Should the current thresholds be kept at their current levels but adjusted
for inflation? Why or why not?

2.

Does raising the thresholds for smaller reporting company status as proposed
appropriately consider the objectives of capital formation and investor protection?
Why or why not? Is there a better way to accomplish these objectives?

67

See Staff Section 404(b) Study at 107. At the same time, the staff’s study recognized that registrants at the lower
end of the studied range of $75 million and $250 million could be more likely to have characteristics more
similar to non-accelerated filers (i.e., registrants that are just under or just over the $75 million threshold are
likely to have similar characteristics to one another). See id. at 4. The staff’s study did not specifically assess
whether registrants at the lower end of the group, such as those with a public float between $75 million and $125
million, might differ in relative benefits than registrants at the higher end.

68

See Staff Section 404(b) Study at 112. Title I of the JOBS Act exempts EGCs from the Section 404(b) auditor
attestation requirements, but EGC status is a temporary accommodation by Congress to lessen the burdens on
new companies entering the public markets. Pub. L. No. 112-106, Sec. 103, 126 Stat. 306 (2012) (amending
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act [Pub. L. 107-204, Sec. 404(b) 116 Stat. 745 (2002)]). Smaller
reporting company status, however, is not time-limited.

3.

Would raising the thresholds promote capital formation or liquidity for smaller
registrants? Could raising the thresholds result in a loss of material information
about registrants that would qualify as smaller reporting companies under the
higher thresholds? Does scaled disclosure impact the ability of investors to make
informed investment decisions? Does scaled disclosure lead to a greater
incidence of fraud?

4.

As proposed, should the smaller reporting company definition continue to be
based primarily on public float and, in the absence of public float, revenue? Why
or why not? If so, should the public float threshold be $250 million? Should the
revenue threshold be $100 million for registrants without a public float? Should
the public float threshold be $200 million for registrants that determined in a prior
year that they did not qualify as smaller reporting companies and seek to
transition to smaller reporting company status? Should the revenue threshold be
$80 million for registrants without a public float that determined in a prior year
that they did not qualify as smaller reporting companies and seek to transition to
smaller reporting company status? Should any of the proposed thresholds be
higher or lower? Why or why not?

5.

Should the smaller reporting company definition be based on both public float and
revenue? Why or why not? If so, what should the public float and revenue
thresholds be? If we required both thresholds, should the registrant maintain its
smaller reporting company status until it exceeds both the public float and
revenue thresholds or until it exceeds either threshold?

25

6.

Should the definition be based on whether a registrant meets either a public float
threshold or a revenue threshold? Why or why not?

7.

Should the definition contain only a public float test, regardless of the registrant’s
revenues, rather than the current definition? Why or why not? If so, what should
the threshold be?

8.

Should we eliminate the public float test and instead apply only a revenue test?
Why or why not? If so, what should the threshold be? Should we allow a
revenue-only test as an alternative to the public float test and permit a registrant to
choose which test to apply? Why or why not? If so, what should the thresholds
be for each test?

9.

Should we revise the method of calculating public float in our current rules? If
so, how?

10.

Should the smaller reporting company definition be based on market
capitalization rather than public float? If so, what market capitalization should we
use? How should we determine any new market capitalization thresholds? What
would be the advantages or disadvantages of this approach?

11.

Are there other criteria or measures for defining smaller reporting companies that
we should consider? If so, what are they and what, if any, thresholds would be
appropriate?

12.

Should any thresholds in the smaller reporting company definition be indexed to
adjust for inflation? If so, to what indicator should the thresholds be indexed and
how frequently should they be adjusted?

26

13.

If the thresholds are raised in the manner proposed, should the Commission revisit the thresholds on a periodic basis to assess whether the thresholds are
contributing to capital formation, liquidity and investor protection? If so, what
criteria would be useful for assessing the efficacy of the thresholds and how
frequently should re-assessments occur?

14.

If the thresholds are raised, should larger registrants be limited in their ability to
avail themselves of some of the scaled disclosure accommodations? Should any
of the scaled disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X not be
available for registrants at the higher end of the range in terms of public float or
revenue? If so, which disclosure requirements and why? If so, would differences
among the types of scaled disclosure accommodations adversely impact
comparability across the larger group of registrants that would qualify as a smaller
reporting company? Why or why not?

15.

If we increase the thresholds in the smaller reporting company definition, should
we eliminate the provision in the accelerated and large accelerated filer
definitions that specifically excludes registrants that are eligible to use the smaller
reporting company requirements under Regulation S-K for their annual or
quarterly reports, as proposed? Why or why not?

16.

If we increase the public float threshold in the smaller reporting company
definition as proposed, should we also increase the public float threshold in the
accelerated filer definition? Why or why not?

27

17.

If we increase the public float and revenue thresholds in the smaller reporting
company definition as proposed, should we also increase the thresholds in
Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1(a)(7)? 70 Why or why not?

18.

If we increase the revenue threshold in the smaller reporting company definition
as proposed, should we also increase the threshold in Rule 3-05 of Regulation SX? 71 Why or why not?

III.

Economic Analysis
As discussed above, we are proposing amendments to the definition of “smaller reporting

company” as used in our rules and regulations. The proposed amendments are intended to
promote capital formation and reduce compliance costs for smaller registrants by expanding the
number of smaller registrants that are eligible to deliver scaled disclosure to their investors,
while maintaining investor protections.
Registrants with less than $250 million (vs. currently $75 million) in public float would
qualify, as would registrants with zero public float if their revenues were below $100 million (vs.
currently $50 million) in the previous year. We are sensitive to the costs and benefits of the
proposed amendments. In this economic analysis, we examine the existing baseline, which
consists of the current regulatory framework and market practices, and discuss the potential
benefits and costs of the proposed amendments, relative to this baseline, and their potential

70

Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1(a)(7) [17 CFR 240.12g5-1(a)(7)] provides issuers of securities in Tier 2
Regulation A offerings with an exemption from the mandatory registration requirements of Exchange Act
Section 12(g) provided certain conditions are met, including a requirement that the issuer have a public float of
less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed semiannual period, or, in the
absence of a public float, annual revenues of less than $50 million as of its most recently completed fiscal year.

71

Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X provides the requirements for financial statements of businesses acquired or to be
acquired. Paragraph (b)(2)(iv) allows registrants to omit such financial statements for the earliest of three fiscal
years required if the net revenues of the business to be acquired are less than $50 million. The $50 million
threshold is based on the revenue threshold in the smaller reporting company definition. See Smaller Reporting
Company Adopting Release.

effects on efficiency, competition and capital formation. 72 We also consider the potential costs
and benefits of reasonable alternatives to the proposed amendments. Where practicable, we
attempt to quantify the economic effects of the proposed amendments; however, in certain cases,
we are unable to do so because either we lack the necessary data or the economic effects are not
quantifiable. In these cases, we provide a qualitative assessment of the likely economic effects.
A.

Baseline and Potential Affected Parties

In calendar year 2015, of the 7,557 registrants that filed a Form 10-K with the
Commission, 3,183 (42.1% of all registrants) were eligible to claim smaller reporting company
status. Of those, 2,900 (38.4% of all registrants) claimed smaller reporting company status.
Under the current definition, a registrant may qualify as a smaller reporting company under
either a public float threshold or an annual revenue threshold if the public float is zero. Of the
2,900 smaller reporting companies, 2,241 companies (29.7% of all registrants) qualified under
the $75 million public float threshold and 659 companies (8.7% of all registrants) qualified under
the $50 million revenue threshold. 73 Of the 2,900 smaller reporting companies, 490 (6.5% of all
registrants) also claimed EGC status. 74

72

Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires us, when adopting rules, to consider the impact that any new rule
would have on competition. In addition, Section 2(b) of the Securities Act and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act
direct us, when engaging in rulemaking that requires us to consider or determine whether an action is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will
promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.

73

Based on analysis by DERA. Staff obtained the smaller reporting company status and public float data from
corporate financial reports filed with the Commission using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL),
available at: http://www.sec.gov/dera/data/financial-statement-data-sets.html. Staff also extracted the smaller
reporting company status and public float directly from Forms 10-K using a computer program. For robustness,
staff compared the smaller reporting company status and public float information between the two sources and
corrected discrepancies. Staff extracted annual revenue data from the Compustat database and XBRL filings.
Registrants transitioning out of smaller reporting company status that reported either public float greater than $75
million or zero public float but revenue greater than $50 million were not counted as smaller reporting
companies.

74

Staff determined whether a registrant claimed EGC status by parsing several types of filings (for example,
Forms S-1, S-1/A, 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, 20-F/40-F, and 6-K) filed by that registrant.

By increasing the public float threshold from $75 million to $250 million and the annual
revenue threshold from $50 million to $100 million in the smaller reporting company definition,
the proposed amendments would permit more registrants to qualify as smaller reporting
companies. To estimate the number of additional registrants that could be potentially affected by
the proposed amendments, we use the public float data from Form 10-K filings and revenue data
from Compustat to determine the number of existing registrants that could qualify as a smaller
reporting company under the proposed new thresholds. Under the proposed amendments, we
estimate that 782 additional registrants could be eligible for smaller reporting company status,
751 of which have a public float between $75 million and $250 million and 31 of which have
zero public float and annual revenues between $50 million and $100 million.
The 782 additional registrants have an average public float of $149 million (median $144
million), an average market value of $257 million (median $195 million), and average revenues
of $248 million (median $80 million). Of the 782 potentially eligible registrants, 153 currently
are EGCs and are eligible for certain scaled disclosure under Title I of the JOBS Act, including
the scaled executive compensation disclosures available to smaller reporting companies under
32

Item 402 of Regulation S-K. The 782 additional registrants tend to be concentrated in the
following industries: “Banking” (17.4%), “Pharmaceutical Products” (13.4%), “Financial
Trading” (9.0%), “Business Services” (6.1%) and “Electric Equipment” (4.9%). If all 782
registrants were to claim smaller reporting company status, the proposed amendments would
lead to a noticeable increase in the presence of “Banking” and “Pharmaceutical Products”
registrants in the pool of smaller reporting companies.
We estimate that the proposed amendments would lead to an expansion of the smaller
reporting company pool. Under the proposed rules, 41.8% of the total registrants would qualify
using a public float threshold of less than $250 million, while currently 31.9% of the total
registrants reported having a public float of less than $75 million. In addition, 10.7% of the total
registrants would qualify using a revenue threshold of $100 million, while currently 10.3% of the
total registrants reported having less than $50 million in revenues. 78 The 41.8% of registrants
qualifying under the public float threshold would be in line with the 42% of registrants that
qualified under the public float threshold when the Commission first established the definition of
smaller reporting company. Raising the percentage of registrants qualifying under the public
float threshold to the 2007 level would reflect the real growth in the stock market as well as
inflation in nominal prices in the past decade. We do not have sufficient data to be able to
compare the percentage of registrants qualifying under the revenue threshold when the
Commission first established the definition of smaller reporting company to the 10.7% that
78

Using 2015 data, we estimated that, of 7,557 total registrants that filed 10-Ks, 3,965 registrants would potentially
qualify as smaller reporting companies under the proposed thresholds. In particular, we estimated that 3,159
registrants reported public float below $250 million in 2015, resulting in a percentage of 41.8% (3,159/7,557) of
registrants potentially qualifying as smaller reporting companies under the proposed public float threshold, and
2,408 registrants reported a public float below $75 million in 2015, resulting in a percentage of 31.9%
(2,408/7,557). Also, we estimated that 806 registrants reported annual revenues below $100 million in 2015,
resulting in a percentage of 10.7% (806/7,557) of registrants potentially qualifying as smaller reporting
companies under the proposed revenue threshold, and 775 registrants reported annual revenues below $50
million in 2015, resulting in a percentage of 10.3% (775/7,557).

The primary benefit stemming from the proposed amendments would be a reduction in
compliance costs for those registrants that would newly qualify for smaller reporting company
status. If the compliance costs have a fixed cost component, which typically burdens smaller
registrants disproportionately, the cost savings may be particularly helpful for these registrants.
As a secondary effect of the proposed amendments, a lower disclosure burden could spur
growth in smaller registrants to the extent that the compliance cost savings and other resources
(e.g., managerial effort) devoted to disclosure and compliance are productively deployed in
alternative ways. It also could encourage capital formation because companies that may have

The percentages in Table 4 are generally in line with the percentages in 2006 prior to the adoption of the current
smaller reporting company definition. Because public float information in 2006 was not easily available, we use
the free float values from Thomson Reuter’s Datastream database instead, which excludes from a company’s
total market value all insider ownership and 5% institutional ownership. We estimate that in 2006 the total
number of registrants with free float less than $75 million accounted for 0.37% of the aggregate free float, 1.81%
of the aggregate market value, and 1.92% of the aggregate revenue.

been hesitant to go public may choose to do so if they face reduced disclosure requirements. 80
With respect to costs, the proposed amendments would reduce the amount of information
available to investors, thereby potentially reducing investor protection. A decrease in the amount
of disclosure could increase the information asymmetry between investors and company insiders,
leading to lower liquidity and higher costs of capital for the affected registrants. For example, an
academic study81 finds that during the three-month period following the establishment of the
smaller reporting company definition, registrants with public floats between $25 million and $75
million that claimed smaller reporting company status experienced a significant reduction in
liquidity relative to comparable companies. Also, under the proposed amendments, the newly
eligible smaller reporting companies would not be required to provide certain executive
compensation disclosure requirements, potentially lowering corporate governance transparency
of these registrants. 82
It is important to note that the smaller reporting company thresholds establish eligibility

for but do not mandate reliance on any of the scaled disclosure accommodations. 83 If the
proposed amendments were adopted, we expect that the newly eligible registrants would weigh
the costs and benefits of scaled disclosure for themselves and decide whether to take advantage
of any of the scaled disclosure accommodations. To the extent that there may be agency
concerns, expanding smaller reporting company eligibility may provide opportunities for adverse
selection in a greater number of registrants, that is, registrants whose outside investors would
have benefited from more disclosure may choose the lower disclosure requirement once
becoming eligible. The net benefit for the newly eligible registrants would ultimately depend on
the specific facts and circumstances.
2.

Estimation of Potential Costs and Benefits

In this section, we estimate the incremental costs and benefits associated with smaller
reporting company-related scaled disclosures, using a multivariate empirical analysis. The
challenge is to isolate the economic effects of scaled disclosures from the effect of other
significant accommodations, such as the exemption from Section 404(b) that is currently
available to all smaller reporting companies. For this reason, we cannot isolate the costs and
benefits associated with scaled disclosures using data from current smaller reporting
companies. 84 Under the proposed amendments, the newly eligible smaller reporting companies
would be able to provide scaled disclosures but would continue to be subject to Section 404(b) as

83

If a disclosure requirement applicable to smaller reporting companies is more stringent than for non-smaller
reporting companies, however, smaller reporting companies must comply with the more stringent standard. Item
404 is the only Regulation S-K disclosure requirement that could be more stringent.

84

Although there exists a clear threshold for eligibility, we cannot use the well-known empirical method of
Regression Discontinuity Design to assess the treatment effect of scaled disclosures for smaller reporting
companies. This method requires that the assignment of the treatment among registrants is “as good as random”
around the threshold. Under this assumption, the registrants that receive the treatment of scaled disclosure (i.e.,
smaller reporting companies) should be comparable to those registrants that do not receive the treatment because
their public float is just above the $75 million threshold. Given the exemption from Section 404(b) available to
current smaller reporting companies with public float below $75 million, this assumption does not hold.

36

accelerated filers.
It is possible, however, to isolate the effects of scaled disclosures using 2006−2009 data.
This is because, as a result of the rules that established the smaller reporting company category
in 2007, registrants with public float between $25 million and $75 million experienced no
change in the Section 404(b) exemption but became eligible for the smaller reporting company
scaled disclosures. Our empirical methodology is a difference-in-difference estimation between
a treatment group and a comparison group. 85 In particular, the treatment group (Treatment
Group) consists of registrants with public float between $25 million and $75 million that claimed
smaller reporting company status in 2008. Two natural comparison groups exist. The first
comparison group (Control Group 1) consists of registrants that did not qualify for smaller
reporting company status because they had public float just above $75 million (between $75
million and $125 million). 86 The second comparison group (Control Group 2) consists of
registrants with public float and revenues below $25 million that were already eligible for scaled
disclosures at that time and thus not affected by the Commission’s 2007 rules. 87
To analyze the economic effects of eligibility for scaled disclosures resulting from the
Commission’s 2007 rules, we compare the Treatment Group with Control Group 1 and Control
Group 2 in the following areas: cost savings, information environment, liquidity and growth.
85

Difference-in-difference is a technique used to calculate the effect of a variable on a treatment group versus a
control group. In particular, in the analysis below, the average change over time in the outcome of a variable for
the treatment group is compared to the average change over time in the outcome of that variable for the control
group.

86

This would allow for a $50 million bandwidth similar to that used in the Commission’s 2007 rules, which raised
the threshold for relief from $25 million to $75 million.

87

The comparison groups help control for confounding factors that may also independently affect the economic
effects associated with scaled disclosures. While we determine Treatment Group and Control Group 1 based on
public float alone, we use both public float and revenues to determine Control Group 2, because, prior to the
Commission’s 2007 rules, registrants with public float below $25 million were not eligible for scaled disclosures
if their revenues exceeded $25 million.

37

We then use the analysis to extrapolate the likely effects of the expansion of eligibility for
smaller reporting company status under the proposed amendments. In extrapolating the likely
effects, we place particular emphasis on the comparison between the Treatment Group and
Control Group 1, which represents a closer group in size to the newly eligible smaller reporting
companies under the proposed amendments.
i.

Potential Cost Savings: Estimates based on Changes in Audit Fees

The cost savings from scaled disclosures could include savings of resources that would
be used for the relevant parts of disclosures, for example, managerial and employee time, other
internal resources, and audit fees related to certain disclosures. Among these potential savings,
changes in audit fees are readily quantifiable. To the extent that the scaled disclosure
accommodations impact information that must be audited, scaled disclosures of the audited
portions of the filings should lead to a reduction in audit expenses. Because many of the scaled
disclosures available to smaller reporting companies relate to governance and compensation
disclosures that are not subject to audit, we acknowledge that a reduction in audit fees is likely a
small part of the total cost savings associated with scaled disclosures. However, quantifying the
change in audit fees can potentially help us estimate the entire cost savings.
To estimate the cost savings from the proposed amendments, we first examine changes in
the audit fees of registrants that were newly eligible to use scaled disclosures as a result of the
2007 rules relative to those in the comparison groups between the pre-rule 2006−2007 period and
the post-rule 2008−2009 period. Audit fee data come from the Audit Analytics database. We
include only registrants that had both pre-rule and post-rule audit fee data in the analysis.
Table 5 reports the main results.

For smaller reporting companies with public floats between $25 million and $75 million,
in 2008−2009, average audit fees declined by $43,853. In contrast, both Control Group 1, which
just missed eligibility for claiming smaller reporting company status, and Control Group 2,
which already was subject to scaled disclosures, experienced a much smaller decline in average
audit fees after the adoption of the Commission’s 2007 rules: $21,731 and $11,903, respectively.
Thus, the difference-in-difference estimate of the savings in audit fees associated with scaled
disclosures is between $22,122 and $31,950 per smaller reporting company. Both estimated
differences differ significantly from zero. Although two different control groups are used to
control for all other factors that may have caused the changes in audit fees in smaller registrants
during the 2006−2009 period, 88 the effect of the 2008 financial crisis may not be completely
ruled out and could make the estimated savings in audit fees appear larger than they actually
were.
We can also estimate the savings in audit fees in terms of a percentage reduction, instead
88

For example, among other factors, we note that the Commission approved Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 5 regarding Audits of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (AS 5).
Among other things, AS 5 was intended to reduce unnecessary costs by making the audit scalable to fit the size
and complexity of company. AS 5 became effective in November 2007 and registrants with fiscal years ending
between July and November were allowed to avail themselves of the provision earlier. The adoption and
implementation of AS 5 in 2007 could have had an impact on the audit fees of all companies subject to
Section 404(b). Given that in our analysis both Treatment Group and Control Group 1 were affected by AS 5,
however, the difference-in-difference methodology should control for the potential effects of AS 5 on audit fees.
In addition, based on companies’ fiscal year end, we have no reason to believe that early adopters were more or
less concentrated in Treatment Group than Control Group 1.

39

of a dollar value. 89 The audit fees for the Treatment Group declined by 14.1% in the 2008−2009
period relative to the 2006−2007 period, but only by 3.2% for Control Group 1 and 10.5% for
Control Group 2. Thus, the difference-in-difference estimate of the treatment effect in terms of a
percentage reduction is a 3.6% to 10.9% reduction of the audit fees.
For the 782 newly eligible registrants that we estimate would be potentially affected by
the proposed amendments, the average audit fees were $683,607 in fiscal year 2014. Thus, if we
use the dollar value estimates of the audit fee savings, then the estimated reduction in audit fees
would be between $24,353 and $35,172 for this group, which are the inflation-adjusted values of
the audit fee savings estimates in 2008 and 2009. 90 This estimate for savings on audit fees for the
newly eligible registrants would be about 3.6% (=$24,353/$683,607) to 5.1%
(=$35,172/$683,607) of the audit fees. If we use the percentage reduction estimates, then the
estimated reduction in the audit fees would range from $24,610 (=$683,607×3.6%) to $74,513
(=$683,607×10.9%) for the Treatment Group.
We recognize that our analysis is subject to a number of assumptions, some of which may
not be fully applicable when estimating the possible current change in audit expenses as a result
of the proposed amendments. 91 In addition, we recognize that audit expenses are only one
component of costs for registrants and that changes in audit fees do not capture the full range of

89

If there is a fixed (dollar value) component in audit expenses that apply to registrants of all sizes, then the
estimates under this alternative approach can be viewed as the upper bound of the potential audit fee savings.

90

The inflation adjustment was performed using the CPI calculator of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl).

91

Estimates based on data from 2006 to 2009 may not be directly applicable to newly eligible registrants under the
proposed amendments. On the one hand, because auditors may charge larger registrants more for auditing the
same disclosure items, our estimate could be viewed as a conservative estimate on the potential savings of audit
fees for the newly eligible smaller reporting companies. On the other hand, if there were any increased
competition in the auditing industry since 2009, then it could have led to lower audit expenses for the same
disclosure items. Thus, our estimate could be higher or lower than the actual savings on audit fees for smaller
reporting companies in 2008 and 2009.

40

potential cost savings stemming from scaled disclosures. There are cost savings apart from the
audit, such as cost savings resulting from a smaller reporting company not being required to
prepare compensation discussion and analysis (CD&A) and from other scaled disclosures in
Item 402 of Regulation S-K. These cost savings likely will include both internal cost savings
(such as employee and managerial time and resources) and external cost savings from fees for
other outside professionals such as attorneys. Given the nature of scaled disclosures available to
smaller reporting companies, we expect these other cost savings to be much larger than the cost
savings in audit fees. Accordingly, we assume that 25% of the total cost savings from scaled
disclosure comes from savings in audit fees and 75% of the savings comes from reduction in
other expenses. Given this assumption, we estimate total annual cost savings per newly eligible
registrant to be between $98,439 (=$24,610×4) and $298,052 (=$74,513×4), which is 0.04%
(=$98,439/$246.9 million) to 0.12% (=$298,052/$246.9 million) of the average revenue of the
newly eligible registrants.
ii.

Information Environment, Liquidity and Growth

A registrant’s information environment can be measured by the amount of useful
information available to investors and the quality of information. To gauge the potential effects
on the degree of external information production about the registrant that could benefit investors,
we determine a registrant’s percentage of institutional ownership, total 5% block institutional
ownership, and analyst coverage (i.e., whether a registrant is covered by at least one analyst and
the number of analysts).
To measure disclosure quality, we use four discretionary accrual measures commonly
used in the accounting literature as proxies for earnings management and the incidence of
material restatements (based on when the restatement happened – beginning year – and when the

41

restatement was reported – filing year). Scaled disclosure may contribute to lowering the overall
quality of the information environment, which is proxied here by the propensity for earnings
management and the incidence of material restatements. 92 The data on restatements are from the
Audit Analytics database. A material restatement is defined as a restatement that is reported
under Item 4.02 of Form 8-K.
To examine the potential effects on liquidity, we focus on the share turnover ratio, which
is calculated by dividing the total number of shares traded over a period by the number of shares
outstanding. To assess the effects of scaled disclosures on growth, we examine a registrant’s
capital investment, which is measured by the capital expenditures to assets ratio, as a proxy for
real growth. Because there is a high concentration of smaller reporting companies in industries
for which R&D investment is important (e.g., pharmaceutical products and electronic
equipment), we also examine a registrant’s investment in R&D. Finally, we examine asset
growth, which is the growth rate in book assets, which could capture a registrant’s growth
through both capital investment and acquisition.
Table 6 reports the estimated treatment effect. The number in the Treatment Group vs.
Control Group 1 column reflects the difference between: (1) the average change in the metric for

In using these proxies, we do not mean to suggest that scaled disclosure would be expected to directly cause an
increase in earnings management or an increased incidence of material restatements, as there is little direct

affected by a restatement.

Table 6: Effect of Scaled Disclosures on Information Environment, Liquidity and Growth
This table shows the scaled disclosure effect for smaller reporting companies (SRCs) on information environment,
liquidity, and growth. Treatment Group consists of SRCs with public float between $25 million and $75 million in
fiscal year 2008. Control Group 1 consists of non-SRCs with public float between $75 million and $125 million.
Control Group 2 consists of small business issuers with public float and revenues below $25 million. Institutional

The results in Table 6 suggest that the scaled disclosures had a negative effect on
institutional ownership. The Treatment Group, which became eligible for scaled disclosures,
experienced a 5.2% greater decrease in average institutional ownership from period to period
than the companies in Control Group 1, which remained ineligible for scaled disclosures, and a
2.2% greater decrease in average institutional ownership from period to period than the
companies in Control Group 2, which were eligible for scaled disclosures throughout both
periods.
The results reflect a positive effect on material restatements measured based on when
such restatement was triggered (material restatement by beginning year) in smaller reporting
companies, while the effect on analyst coverage is inconclusive. Smaller reporting companies
tend to lose analyst coverage relative to comparable companies that just missed eligibility, but
they gain coverage relative to even smaller companies that already enjoyed scaled disclosures.
There is no statistically significant effect on earnings quality as captured by discretionary
accruals measures or the incidence of material restatement by filing year. Overall, the evidence
suggests a modest, but statistically significant, negative effect of scaled disclosure on smaller
reporting companies’ overall information environment.
The effect of scaled disclosures on share turnover ratio is negative but statistically
44

insignificant, suggesting no significant effect of scaled disclosures on smaller reporting
companies’ liquidity. 95 Because the newly eligible registrants are larger in market capitalization
and have more institutional ownership and analyst coverage than the current smaller reporting
companies, we do not expect the proposed amendments to have a significantly negative impact
on their liquidity.
The results in Table 6 indicate no clear difference between smaller reporting companies
and comparable registrants in terms of changes in capital investment and R&D investment. The
effect on asset growth rate is mixed. There is no significant difference between the Treatment
Group companies and Control Group 1, but compared to Control Group 2, Treatment Group
companies had deterioration in asset growth rate after the 2007 rules. Overall, our empirical
analysis suggests that scaled disclosures have only a minimal effect on growth in current smaller
reporting companies relative to comparable companies. Thus, we also do not expect any
significant effect of the scaled disclosures on the growth of the newly eligible registrants under
the proposed amendments.
iii.

Conclusion

Taken together, our empirical analysis suggests that, for most of the newly eligible
smaller reporting companies under the proposed amendments, scaled disclosures may generate a
modest, but statistically significant, amount of cost savings in terms of the reduction in
compliance costs, a modest, but statistically significant, deterioration in some of the proxies used

95

In contrast, Chang et al. (2013) did find a negative and significant effect of the Commission’s 2007 rules on
smaller reporting companies’ liquidity. The difference in the results could stem from the use of a different
empirical methodology, different sample and sample period. Chang et al. (2013) excluded financial companies.
While the authors examined a pre-rule period of April to June of 2007, we included the entire 2006 and 2007
periods. Also, while the authors examined a post-rule period of February to August of 2008, we included the
entire 2008 and 2009 periods. In addition, the authors focus on a set of illiquidity measures, while we focus on
the share turnover ratio, a commonly used liquidity measure.

registrant’s capital investments, investments in R&D and assets.
3.

Affiliated Ownership and Adverse Selection

In general, holding market value constant, the use of public float to define eligibility
favors registrants with more affiliated ownership. If we consider two registrants with the same
market value but different affiliated ownership, the one with greater affiliated ownership will
have a lower public float, which is the value of non-affiliated ownership, and thus will be more
likely to qualify for smaller reporting company status based on the public float threshold. This
could be problematic if the adverse selection problem creates a conflict of interest between
affiliated owners—who are often the decision makers—and non-affiliated owners—who are
often the uninformed minority shareholders on whom reduced disclosure would have a greater
impact. We examine whether the effects of scaled disclosure on registrants’ information
environment, liquidity, and growth depend on the percentage of affiliated ownership, which is
the market value of affiliated equity shares divided by the registrant’s total market value of
equity. The average affiliated ownership is 43% for smaller reporting companies in the
treatment group in years 2008 and 2009 (median 42%).
The results are reported in Table 7. The number in the Treatment Group vs. Control
Group 1 column reflects the difference between: (1) the difference between the average metric
of registrants in the Treatment Group with affiliated ownership that is higher than the group
median and that of the registrants in the Treatment Group with affiliated ownership that is lower
than the group median and (2) the difference between the average metric of registrants in Control
Group 1 with affiliated ownership that is higher than the group median and that of the registrants
in Control Group 1 with affiliated ownership that is lower than the group median. Similarly, the

46

number in the Treatment Group vs. Control Group 2 column reflects the difference between: (1)
the difference between the average metric for the higher-than-median affiliated ownership
registrants and that of the lower-than-median affiliated ownership registrants in the Treatment
Group and (2) the difference between the average metrics for the same sectors of Control
Group 2. 96
Table 7: Affiliated Ownership and Adverse Selection
This table shows the estimated difference in the scaled disclosure effect on smaller reporting companies with high
affiliated ownership and those with low affiliated ownership. Affiliated ownership is the percentage of a registrant’s
market value of equity that is owned by affiliated parties (i.e., corporate insiders and 10% block owners).
Companies with high (low) affiliated ownership include companies with affiliated ownership above (below) the
sample median. A negative and significant estimate means that scaled disclosures have a more negative effect on
smaller reporting companies with high affiliated ownership than on those with low affiliated ownership. ***, **, and
* indicate significance at 1%, 5%, and 10% confidence levels, respectively.

following the start of the treatment. See also note 93.

Our analysis suggests that affiliated ownership may exacerbate the potential negative
effects of scaled disclosure on external information production by professionals such as
institutional investors. There is also some evidence that larger affiliated ownership may
exacerbate the adverse effect of scaled disclosure on material restatements measured based on
when such restatement was triggered in smaller reporting companies (relative to Control
Group 1). At the same time, scaled disclosures tend to have a more positive effect on smaller
reporting companies’ capital investment when affiliated ownership is higher. Overall, there is
inconclusive evidence that affiliated ownership is associated with adverse selection in current
smaller reporting companies. For the 782 newly eligible registrants that would potentially be
affected by the proposed amendments, the average affiliated ownership is 34.5% of market
capitalization, lower than for the current smaller reporting companies (47.6% in 2015). Thus,
any agency concerns arising from affiliated ownership should have a lower impact for the newly
eligible registrants than for the current smaller reporting companies.
4.

Effects on Efficiency, Competition and Capital Formation

The proposed amendments may have competitive effects. On one hand, the proposed
amendments may reduce the potential disadvantage that the newly eligible registrants have
relative to the current smaller reporting companies that already use the scaled disclosure
requirements. The proposed amendments may also increase the competitive advantage of the
newly eligible registrants relative to unregistered companies that compete with them in the
product market. However, because there is no clear evidence that scaled disclosures have a
significant effect on the growth of current smaller reporting companies, we expect these

48

potentially positive competitive effects to be modest. On the other hand, setting any eligibility
threshold may create a competitive disadvantage for those registrants that miss eligibility
because their public float is just above the specified threshold, relative to the newly eligible
registrants. However, our economic analysis suggests that this potentially negative effect would
be modest.
As discussed above, our empirical analysis suggests that scaled disclosures related to
smaller reporting companies are unlikely to have a significantly negative effect on the overall
information environment of smaller reporting companies. Thus, we do not expect that the
proposed amendments would have a significant negative effect on the information efficiency of
affected parties. Finally, it is difficult to quantify the effect of scaled disclosures on capital
formation because the Commission’s 2007 rules coincided with the 2008 financial crisis and its
aftermath, which led to extremely thin capital market activities. However, given that both the
potential cost savings and the potential negative consequences of scaled disclosure are modest, as
shown in Tables 5 and 6, we do not expect the proposed amendments to have a significant
impact on capital formation for the newly eligible registrants.
C.

Possible Alternatives

In this section, we present several alternatives to the proposed amendments and discuss
their relative costs and benefits.
As a first alternative, we could use a different registrant size metric in the smaller
reporting company definition. While public float has the advantage of capturing the value held
by non-affiliated investors who may be more affected by informational asymmetries, the
disadvantage of public float is twofold. First, reported public float numbers are not easily
verifiable. Second, using public float to define eligibility may increase adverse selection due to

49

conflicts of interest between affiliated and non-affiliated owners. We considered equity market
value as an alternative size metric to public float. Equity market value is more accessible and
more easily verifiable than public float. It does not differentiate registrants based on the degree
of informational asymmetry concerns, but it also does not favor registrants with more affiliated
ownership. If we define registrants as smaller reporting companies when they have less than
$250 million in equity market value or zero equity market value but revenue below $100 million,
3,604 or 47.7% of the registrants that filed Forms 10-K in 2015 would qualify as smaller
reporting companies (3,084 based on equity market value and 520 based on revenue). 97
As a second alternative, we could revise the smaller reporting company definition to
capture registrants that meet either a public float threshold or a revenue threshold. For example,
one commenter suggested defining a smaller reporting company as any registrant with either
public float below $250 million or revenue below $100 million.98 This alternative would lead to
1,266 additional eligible registrants relative to the current definition, and 201 relative to the
proposed amendments. Among the 201 additional registrants, 41.5% are in “Pharmaceutical
Products” and 18% are in “Financial Trading.” Expanding the pool of eligible registrants would
lead to increased cost savings for registrants while also increasing the potential for informational
asymmetries and other costs associated with scaled disclosures. In addition, relative to the
current smaller reporting companies or those newly eligible under the proposed amendments, the
201 additional qualifying registrants may have different characteristics that could affect the
appropriateness of scaled disclosure. For example, the 201 additional registrants are
substantially larger than those eligible under the current definition or the proposed amendments.
97

This alternative would lead to a slightly smaller pool of registrants eligible for smaller reporting company status
than under the proposed amendments.

98

See BIO Letter.

50

The average public float of the 201 additional registrants is $769 million, while it is $17 million
under the current definition and $50 million under the proposed amendments. The size of these
registrants implies that any cost savings from scaled disclosures would generate a much smaller
impact on their firm value and may not justify the potential loss of informational transparency.
While neither public float nor revenue data show a natural breakpoint, as a third
alternative to the proposed amendments, we could have revised the smaller reporting company
definition using different thresholds. For example, we could take inflation since 2007 into
account, raising the public float threshold from $75 million to $85.7 million and the revenue
threshold from $50 million to $57.2 million. The inflation adjustment of the current thresholds
would expand the pool of eligible smaller reporting companies by 88 registrants, 82 of which
reported public float between $75 million and $85.7 million in their 2015 Form 10-Ks and six of
which had zero public float and revenue between $50 million and $57.2 million. 99 Alternatively,
instead of $250 million public float, we could use $700 million public float, which is the
threshold in the “large accelerated filer” definition. For registrants with zero public float, we
could use $1 billion in revenue instead of $100 million in revenue, which is the threshold in the
EGC definition. A $1 billion revenue threshold would make scaled disclosure accommodations
for smaller reporting companies and EGCs uniform for the subset of smaller registrants that have
zero public float. Using 2015 data, we estimate that if we were to use these alternative
thresholds in combination, there would be 899 newly eligible registrants for smaller reporting
company status (746 newly eligible registrants based on public float and 153 newly eligible
registrants based on revenues), in addition to the 782 newly eligible registrants under the

99

The inflation adjustment was performed using the CPI calculator of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl).

51

proposed amendments. Expanding the pool of registrants eligible for smaller reporting company
status using the latter two alternative thresholds would further reduce overall compliance costs
for registrants but also potentially increase the informational asymmetries and other adverse
effects associated with scaled disclosures. Relative to the current smaller reporting companies or
the newly eligible smaller reporting companies under the proposed amendments, these additional
qualifying registrants also may have different characteristics that could affect the appropriateness
of scaled disclosure. For example, the 899 additional registrants under this alternative are much
larger, implying that any cost savings from scaled disclosures would generate a much smaller
impact on the registrants’ firm value, and may not justify the potential loss of informational
transparency.
As a fourth alternative, we could consider expanding the number of registrants eligible
for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) exemption. The newly eligible smaller reporting
companies under the proposed amendments would remain subject to Section 404(b). This would
create two tiers among smaller reporting companies: registrants with public floats below $75
million would be eligible for the scaled disclosures and exempt from Section 404(b) and
registrants with public floats between $75 million and $250 million would be eligible only for
the scaled disclosures. Thus, one alternative would be to extend the Section 404(b) exemption to
all registrants that are eligible for and claim smaller reporting company status.
The advantage of this alternative would be twofold. First, it would provide a uniform
exemption from the auditor attestation about the effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting for all smaller reporting companies, which could potentially simplify the regulatory
framework. Second, it could lead to greater cost savings for the newly eligible registrants.
Although there is debate on whether the direct cost of Section 404(b) is substantial for the

52

majority of registrants, there are academic studies suggesting that the cost was non-trivial for
smaller registrants when Section 404(b) was first implemented in 2004, 100 and that expenses
related to Section 404(b) compliance have decreased over time as companies and their auditors
gained more experience with the requirements and as a result of steps taken by both the
Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 101 There also may be
indirect costs associated with Section 404(b), such as, among other things, increasing smaller
registrants’ propensity to go private or decreasing their propensity to go public or altering their
incentives to grow by undertaking less investment. 102 Extending the exemption also could lead to
a reduction of these indirect costs, although this reduction is difficult to quantify.
Under this alternative, however, investors of the affected registrants would lose the
benefits of Section 404(b). Existing surveys of corporate leaders as well as academic studies
suggest that Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) has led to improvements in the quality of
registrants’ information environment and financial reporting, registrants’ ability to prevent and
detect fraud, and investor confidence in U.S. registrants. 103 Moreover, an academic study found

compliance with Section 404(b) is associated with significant reductions in both the cost of equity and the cost of
debt in the first year of voluntary compliance. However, we note that the registrants that voluntarily comply
with Section 404(b) may be fundamentally different from other non-accelerated filers. Thus, the economic
effects of voluntary compliance with Section 404(b) may not necessarily apply to other firms.

“Form S-11” (OMB Control No. 3235-0067).

We adopted the existing rules, regulations, and forms pursuant to the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act. These rules, regulations, and forms set forth the disclosure requirements for
annual and quarterly reports, proxy and information statements, and registration statements that
are prepared by registrants to provide investors information to make informed investment and
voting decisions. Our proposed amendments are intended to make scaled disclosure
accommodations available to a larger number of registrants. The proposed amendments should
decrease the disclosure requirements for some registrants. The proposed amendments do not
affect any disclosure requirements for any registrant with a calculable public float of $250
million or more.
The hours and costs associated with preparing disclosure, filing information required by
forms, and retaining records constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by collection of
information requirements. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required
to respond to, a collection of information requirement unless it displays a currently valid control
number. Compliance with the information collections listed above is mandatory to the extent

57

applicable to each registrant. 109 Responses to the information collections are not kept
confidential and there is no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed.
B.

Summary of Information Collections

The proposed amendments, which would amend the definition of smaller reporting
company to capture a greater number of registrants, may decrease existing collection of
information total burden estimates, or not affect them at all, for some reports on Form 10-K and
Form 10-Q, some proxy statements on Schedule 14A, some information statements on Schedule
14C, and some registration statements on Form 10, Form S-1, Form S-3, Form S-4, and Form S11, filed by registrants that meet the definition of smaller reporting company as we propose to
revise it.
The proposed amendments would not change the amount of information required to be
included in Exchange Act reports by any registrant because of its status as an accelerated filer or
a large accelerated filer.
C.

Burden and Cost Estimates

For purposes of the PRA, we believe that if the proposed amendments were adopted the
total decrease in burden hours for Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Schedule 14A, Schedule 14C, Form
10, Form S-1, Form S-3. Form S-4, and Form S-11 would be approximately 220,357 burden
hours and the total decrease in external costs would be approximately $35,691,649.
Our burden hour and cost estimates presented below represent the average burdens for all
registrants, both large and small. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens likely
would vary among individual registrants based on a number of factors, including the size and

109

As noted above, registrants claiming smaller reporting company status have the option to selectively comply
with the scaled disclosures available to them on an item-by-item basis.

58

complexity of their business. We believe that some registrants would experience costs in excess
of this average and some registrants would experience less than the average costs. In addition,
for quarterly and annual reports and for proxy and information statements, we estimate that 75%
of the burden of preparation is carried by the registrant internally and that 25% of the burden is
carried by outside professionals retained by the registrant at an average cost of $400 per hour. 110
For registration statements, we estimate that 25% of the burden of preparation is carried by the
registrant internally and that 75% of the burden is carried by outside professionals retained by
the registrant at an average cost of $400 per hour.
For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that over a three-year period, 111 the annual
aggregate decreased burden 112 resulting from the proposed amendments would average:
•

142,068 hours and $18,943,168 of external costs for Form 10-K;

•

71,938 hours and $9,594,202 of external costs for Form 10-Q;

•

432 hours and $57,600 of external costs for Schedule 14A;

•

7 hours and $880 of external costs for Schedule 14C;

•

9 hours and $11,100 of external costs for Form 10;

•

3,477 hours and $4,172,314 of external costs for Form S-1;

•

37 hours and $43,920 of external costs for Form S-3;

110

We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending on the nature of the
professional services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that such costs would be an average of
$400 per hour. This is the rate we typically estimate for outside legal services used in connection with public
company reporting.

111

We calculated an annual average over a three-year period because OMB approval of PRA submissions covers a
three-year period.

112

Our decreased burden estimates take into account, and are net of, any increased burden that may result from
smaller reporting companies providing expanded disclosures under disclosure requirements that are more
stringent for smaller reporting companies than for non-smaller reporting companies, such as Item 404 of
Regulation S-K.

59

•

2,140 hours and $2,567,578 of external costs for Form S-4; and

•

251 hours and $300,888 of external costs for Form S-11.

These estimates were based on the following assumptions:
1.

Form 10-K

We estimate that approximately 782 registrants would become newly eligible to use
scaled disclosure for smaller reporting companies or have a new opportunity to assess whether to
avail themselves of scaled disclosure for their annual reports and could experience burden and
cost savings if these proposed amendments are adopted. 113 We estimate that if these registrants
use all of the scaled disclosure requirements, 114 they would save 177,584 burden hours and an
aggregate cost of $23,678,960. 115
While we are unsure of the extent to which these newly eligible smaller reporting
companies would realize the full savings from the scaled disclosure requirements, for purposes
of this analysis, we estimate that eligible registrants would realize approximately 80% of these

113

We estimate that 782 additional registrants would be eligible under the proposed amendments to use the scaled
disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies for their annual and quarterly reports in the
first year. We base this estimate on the number of additional registrants that would have been eligible to use
scaled disclosure for their annual and quarterly reports in 2015, based on data collected by DERA from annual
reports on Form 10-K filed in 2015. This data shows that 751 registrants had a public float greater than $75
million but less than $250 million, and 31 registrants with a public float of zero had annual revenues greater than
$50 million but less than $100 million.

114

A smaller reporting company generally may choose to comply with some, all, or none of the scaled disclosure
requirements available for smaller reporting companies under our rules.

115

Consistent with our analysis in the Smaller Reporting Company Adopting Release, we estimate the compliance
burden for a Form 10-K for a smaller reporting company using all scaled disclosure available to be the same as
the last available PRA inventory for completing a Form 10-KSB, which was 1,272 burden hours and a cost of
$169,600 (424 professional hours x $400/hour) per report.
Accordingly, we estimate that it would decrease the compliance burden of Form 10-K by up to 177,584.38 hours
(1,499.09 internal hours per filing using standard Regulation S-K disclosure minus 1,272 internal hours per filing
using scaled disclosure = 227.09 internal hours saved per filing x 782 filings) and decrease the cost by up to
$23,678,960 (499.70 professional hours per filing using standard Regulation S-K disclosure minus 424
professional hours per filing using scaled disclosure = 75.70 external hours saved per filing x $400 per hour =
$30,280 external cost savings per filing x 782 filings).

60

savings. 116 As a result, we estimate that the aggregate decrease in burden for Form 10-K would
be 142,068 internal burden hours and costs of $18,943,168. 117
2.

Form 10-Q

We assume that the same approximately 782 registrants would become newly eligible to
use scaled disclosure for purposes of their quarterly reports. We estimate that if these registrants
use all of the scaled smaller reporting company requirements, they would save 89,922 burden
hours and an aggregate cost of $11,992,752. 118

116

This estimated realization rate reflects the percentage of registrants eligible to claim smaller reporting company
status in 2015 that claimed such status. Based on data collected by DERA, 2,900, or approximately 91.1%, of
the estimated 3,183 eligible registrants claimed smaller reporting company status. Specifically, 2,241, or
approximately 93.1%, of the estimated 2,408 registrants that would qualify under the public float threshold and
659, or approximately 85.0%, of the estimated 775 registrants that would qualify under the annual revenue
threshold, claimed smaller reporting company status.
In addition, this estimated realization rate is further reduced to reflect that a portion of newly eligible smaller
reporting companies may already qualify as EGCs, which are eligible to rely on certain scaled disclosure
requirements for a limited period, including some of the scaled requirements available to smaller reporting
companies. Based on data collected by DERA, 153, or approximately 19.6%, of the 782 newly eligible
registrants were EGCs and therefore eligible to rely on some scaled disclosure accommodations and already
benefitting from a portion of these estimated savings.

117

This estimated decrease in the compliance burden for Form 10-K is based on 80% x 177,584.38 internal hours
saved = 142,067.50 internal hours saved and 80% x $23,678,960 external cost savings = $18,943,168 external
cost savings.

118

Similar to our approach to estimating the reduced compliance burden for a Form 10-K using scaled disclosure,
we base our estimates of the reduced compliance burden for smaller reporting companies using all scaled
disclosure available for certain other filings on the last available PRA inventory for completing the most
comparable form under Regulation SB. We estimate the compliance burden for a Form 10-Q for a smaller
reporting company using all scaled disclosure available to be the same as the last available PRA inventory for
completing a Form 10-QSB, which was 102.24 burden hours and a cost of $13,362 (34.08 professional hours x
$400/hour) per report.
Accordingly, we estimate that it would decrease the compliance burden of Form 10-Q by up to 89,922.18 hours
(140.57 internal hours per filing using standard Regulation S-K disclosure minus 102.24 internal hours per filing
using scaled disclosure = 38.33 internal hours saved per filing x 782 registrants x 3 filings per year) and decrease
the cost by up to $11,992,752 (46.86 professional hours per filing using standard Regulation S-K disclosure
minus 34.08 professional hours per filing using scaled disclosure = 12.78 external hours saved per filing x $400
per hour = $5,112 external cost savings per filing x 782 registrants x 3 filings per year).

61

Assuming that newly eligible registrants realize approximately 80% of these savings, we
estimate that the aggregate decrease in burden for Form 10-Q would be 71,938 internal burden
hours and costs of $9,594,202. 119
3.

Schedule 14A

We estimate that registrants newly eligible to use scaled disclosure would file
approximately 720 definitive proxy statements on Schedule 14A. 120 We estimate that if these
registrants use all of the scaled smaller reporting company requirements, they would save 540
burden hours and an aggregate cost of $72,000. 121
Assuming that newly eligible registrants realize approximately 80% of these savings, we
estimate that the aggregate decrease in burden for Schedule 14A would be 432 internal burden
hours and costs of $57,600. 122
4.

Schedule 14C

We estimate that registrants newly eligible to use scaled disclosure would file
approximately 11 definitive information statements on Schedule 14C. 123 We estimate that if

119

This estimated decrease in the compliance burden for Form 10-Q is based on 80% x 89,922.18 internal hours
saved = 71,937.74 internal hours saved and 80% x $11,992,752.00 external cost savings = $9,594,201.60
external cost savings.

120

We base this estimate on the number of definitive proxy statements on Schedule 14A filed in 2015 by registrants
that would have been newly eligible to use scaled disclosure under the proposed amendments. Based on data
collected by DERA, registrants with a public float greater than $75 million but less than $250 million filed 697
definitive proxy statements on Schedule 14A, and registrants with a public float of zero and annual revenues
greater than $50 million but less than $100 million filed 23 definitive proxy statements on Schedule 14A.

121

We base our estimate of the reduced compliance burden for Schedule 14A for a smaller reporting company using
all scaled disclosure available on our estimate of the compliance burden for Item 407(d)(5), (e)(4) and (e)(5) of
Regulation S-K, with which smaller reporting companies are not required to comply. We estimate this burden to
be 0.75 burden hours and a cost of $100 (0.25 professional hours x $400/hour) per report.
Accordingly, we estimate that it would decrease the compliance burden of Schedule 14A by up to 540 hours
(0.75 internal hours saved per filing x 720 filings) and decrease the cost by up to $72,000 (0.25 professional
hours saved per filing x $400 per hour = $100 external cost savings per filing x 720 filings).

122

This estimated decrease in the compliance burden for Schedule 14A is based on 80% x 540 internal hours saved
= 432 internal hours saved and 80% x $72,000.00 external cost savings = $57,600.00 external cost savings.

62

these registrants use all of the scaled smaller reporting company requirements, they would save
eight burden hours and an aggregate cost of $1,100. 124
Assuming that newly eligible registrants realize approximately 80% of these savings, we
estimate that the aggregate decrease in burden for Schedule 14C would be seven internal burden
hours and costs of $880. 125
5.

Form 10

We estimate that registrants newly eligible to use scaled disclosure would file one
registration statement on Form 10. 126 We estimate that if this registrant uses all of the scaled
smaller reporting company requirements, it would save nine burden hours and an aggregate cost
of $11,100. 127 Due to the low number of Form 10 filers, the reduced number of scaled disclosure

123

We base this estimate on the number of definitive information statements on Schedule 14C filed in 2015 by
registrants that would have been newly eligible to use scaled disclosure under the proposed amendments. Based
on data collected by DERA, registrants with a public float greater than $75 million but less than $250 million
filed 11 definitive information statements on Schedule 14C, and registrants with a public float of zero and annual
revenues greater than $50 million but less than $100 million filed no definitive information statements on
Schedule 14C.

124

Similar to Schedule 14A, we base our estimate of the decrease in the compliance burden for Schedule 14C for a
smaller reporting company using all scaled disclosure available on our estimate of the compliance burden for
Item 407(d)(5), (e)(4) and (e)(5) of Regulation S-K, which is 0.75 burden hours and a cost of $100 (0.25
professional hours x $400/hour) per report.
Accordingly, we estimate that it would decrease the compliance burden of Schedule 14C by up to 8.25 hours
(0.75 internal hours saved per filing x 11 filings) and decrease the cost by up to $1,100 (0.25 professional hours
saved per filing x $400 per hour = $100 external cost savings per filing x 11 filings).

125

This estimated decrease in the compliance burden for Schedule 14C is based on 80% x 8.25 internal hours saved
= 6.6 internal hours saved and 80% x $1,100.00 external cost savings = $880.00 external cost savings.

126

We base our estimated number of each type of registration statement filed on the average number of that type of
registration statement filed in each of the calendar years 2013 through 2015 by registrants that would have been
newly eligible to use scaled disclosure under the proposed amendments. Based on data collected by DERA,
during 2013 through 2015, registrants with a public float greater than $75 million but less than $250 million filed
one registration statement on Form 10 during the period 2013 through 2015, and registrants with a public float of
zero and revenues greater than $50 million but less than $100 million filed an average of one registration
statement on Form 10 each year.

127

We estimate the compliance burden for a Form 10 for a smaller reporting company using all scaled disclosure
available to be the same as the last available PRA inventory for completing a Form 10-SB, which was 44.50
burden hours and a cost of $53,400 (133.50 professional hours x $400/hour) per report.

63

accommodations available to EGCs for purposes of Form 10, and rounding considerations, we
assume that any newly eligible registrant would realize the full extent of these savings.
6.

Form S-1

We estimate that registrants newly eligible to use scaled disclosure would file
approximately 52 registration statements on Form S-1. 128 We estimate that if these registrants
use all of the scaled smaller reporting company requirements, they would save 4,346 burden
hours and an aggregate cost of $5,215,392. 129
Assuming that newly eligible registrants realize approximately 80% of these savings, we
estimate that the aggregate decrease in burden for Form S-1 would be 3,477 internal burden
hours and costs of $4,172,314. 130

Accordingly, we estimate that it would decrease the compliance burden of Form 10 by up to 9.25 hours (53.75
internal hours per filing using standard Regulation S-K disclosure minus 44.50 internal hours per filing using
scaled disclosure = 9.25 internal hours saved per filing x 1 filing) and decrease the cost by up to $11,100 (161.25
professional hours per filing using standard Regulation S-K disclosure minus 133.50 professional hours per
filing using scaled disclosure = 27.75 external hours saved per filing x $400 per hour = $11,100 external cost
savings per filing x 1 filing).
128

Based on data collected by DERA, during 2013 through 2015, registrants with a public float greater than $75
million but less than $250 million filed an average of approximately 26 registration statements on Form S-1 each
year, and registrants with a public float of zero and revenues greater than $50 million but less than $100 million
filed an average of approximately 26 registration statements on Form S-1 each year.

129

We estimate the compliance burden for a Form S-1 for a smaller reporting company using all scaled disclosure
available to be the same as the last available PRA inventory for completing a Form SB-2, which was 159.50
burden hours and a cost of $191,400 (478.50 professional hours x $400/hour) per report.
Accordingly, we estimate that it would decrease the compliance burden of Form S-1 by up to 4,346.16 hours
(243.08 internal hours per filing using standard Regulation S-K disclosure minus 159.50 internal hours per filing
using scaled disclosure = 83.58 internal hours saved per filing x 52 filings) and decrease the cost by up to
$5,215,392 (729.24 professional hours per filing using standard Regulation S-K disclosure minus 478.50
professional hours per filing using scaled disclosure = 250.74 external hours saved per filing x $400 per hour =
$100,296 external cost savings per filing x 52 filings).

130

This estimated decrease in the compliance burden for Form S-1 is based on 80% x 4,346.16 internal hours saved
= 3,476.93 internal hours saved and 80% x $5,215,392.00 external cost savings = $4,172,313.60 external cost
savings.

64

7.

Form S-3

We estimate that registrants newly eligible to use scaled disclosure would file
approximately 183 registration statements on Form S-3. 131 We estimate that if these registrants
use all of the scaled smaller reporting company requirements, they would save 46 burden hours
and an aggregate cost of $54,900. 132
Assuming that newly eligible registrants realize approximately 80% of these savings, we
estimate that the aggregate decrease in burden for Form S-3 would be 37 internal burden hours
and costs of $43,920. 133
8.

Form S-4

We estimate that registrants newly eligible to use scaled disclosure would file
approximately 32 registration statements on Form S-4. 134 We estimate that if these registrants

131

Based on data collected by DERA, during 2013 through 2015, registrants with a public float greater than $75
million but less than $250 million filed an average of approximately 181 registration statements on Form S-3
each year, and registrants with a public float of zero and revenues greater than $50 million but less than $100
million filed an average of approximately two registration statements on Form S-3.

132

We base our estimate of the reduced compliance burden for Form S-3 for a smaller reporting company using all
scaled disclosure available on our estimate of the average compliance burden for Items 503(d) and 504 of
Regulation S-K, which requirements are scaled for smaller reporting companies. We estimate the decrease in
compliance burden for a registration statement on Form S-3 for a smaller reporting company using all scaled
disclosure available to be 0.25 burden hours and a cost of $300 (0.75 professional hours x $400/hour) per filing.
Accordingly, we estimate that it would decrease the compliance burden of Form S-3 by up to 45.75 hours (0.25
internal hours saved per filing x 183 filings) and decrease the cost by up to $54,900 ($300 external cost savings
per filing x 183 filings).

133

This estimated decrease in the compliance burden for Form S-3 is based on 80% x 45.75 internal hours saved =
36.60 internal hours saved and 80% x $54,900.00 external cost savings = $43,920.00 external cost savings.

134

Based on data collected by DERA, during 2013 through 2015, registrants with a public float greater than $75
million but less than $250 million filed an average of approximately 29 registration statements on Form S-4 each
year, and registrants with a public float of zero and revenues greater than $50 million but less than $100 million
filed an average of approximately three registration statements on Form S-4.

65

use all of the scaled smaller reporting company requirements, they would save 2,675 burden
hours and an aggregate cost of $3,209,472. 135
Assuming that newly eligible registrants realize approximately 80% of these savings, we
estimate that the aggregate decrease in burden for Form S-4 would be 2,140 internal burden
hours and costs of $2,567,578. 136
9.

Form S-11

We estimate that registrants newly eligible to use scaled disclosure would file
approximately three registration statements on Form S-11. 137 We estimate that if these
registrants use all of the scaled smaller reporting company requirements, they would save 251
burden hours and an aggregate cost of $300,888. 138 Due to the low number of Form S-11 filers
and rounding considerations, we assume that the newly eligible registrants would realize the full
extent of these savings.

135

We estimate the reduction in the compliance burden for Form S-4 for a smaller reporting company using all
scaled disclosure available to be the same as the reduction in the compliance burden for a Form S-1 for a smaller
reporting company using all scaled disclosure available as compared to standard Regulation S-K disclosure,
which was 83.58 burden hours and a cost of $100,296 (250.74 professional hours x $400/hour) per report.
Accordingly, we estimate that it would decrease the compliance burden of Form S-4 by up to 2,674.56 hours
(83.58 internal hours saved per filing x 32 filings) and decrease the annual cost by up to $3,209,472 ($100,296
external cost savings per filing x 32 filings).

136

This estimated decrease in the compliance burden for Form S-4 is based on 80% x 2,674.56 internal hours saved
= 2,139.65 internal hours saved and 80% x $3,209,472.00 external cost savings = $2,567,577.60 external cost
savings.

137

Based on data collected by DERA, during 2013 through 2015, registrants with a public float greater than $75
million but less than $250 million filed an average of approximately two registration statements on Form S-11
each year, and registrants with a public float of zero and revenues greater than $50 million but less than $100
million filed an average of approximately one registration statement on Form S-11.

138

We estimate the reduction in the compliance burden for Form S-11 for a smaller reporting company using all
scaled disclosure available to be the same as reduction in the compliance burden for Form S-1 for a smaller
reporting company using all scaled disclosure available as compared to standard Regulation S-K disclosure,
which was 83.58 burden hours and a cost of $100,296 (250.74 professional hours x $400/hour) per report.
Accordingly, we estimate that it would decrease the compliance burden of Form S-11 by up to 250.74 hours
(83.58 internal hours saved per filing x 3 filings) and decrease the annual cost by up to $300,888.00 ($100,296
external cost savings per filing x 3 filings).

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 140 requires us, in promulgating rules under Section

553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 141 to consider the impact of those rules on small
entities. We have prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) in accordance
with Section 603 of the RFA. 142 This IRFA relates to the proposed amendments to the smaller
reporting company definition as used in our rules.
A.

Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Action

Small businesses, the ACSEC, the Small Business Forum, Congress and others have
raised concerns about the burden of our disclosure rules on smaller registrants. The primary
reason for, and objective of, the proposed amendments to the smaller reporting company
definition is to reduce the disclosure burdens on smaller registrants by expanding the number of
registrants that qualify as smaller reporting companies. The primary reason for, and objective of,
the proposed amendments to the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer definitions is to
maintain the status quo regarding the category of registrants that are subject to accelerated and
large accelerated filer disclosure and filing requirements.

140

5 USC 601 et seq.

141

5 USC 553.

142

5 USC 603.

68

The ACSEC and the Small Business Forum have recommended that we revise the
smaller reporting company definition to include registrants with a public float of up to $250
million. The proposed amendments are responsive to those recommendations.
The FAST Act requires us to revise Regulation S-K to further scale or eliminate
disclosure requirements to reduce the burden on a variety of smaller registrants, including
smaller reporting companies, while still providing all material information to investors. A
number of existing Regulation S-K disclosure requirements provide smaller reporting companies
with the opportunity to provide scaled disclosures in their Commission filings. Raising the
financial thresholds in the smaller reporting company definition would be responsive to the
FAST Act because it would reduce the burden on smaller registrants by increasing the number of
registrants eligible to provide scaled disclosures.
B.

Legal Basis

We are proposing the amendments pursuant to Sections 7, 10 and 19 of the Securities
Act, Sections 3(b), 12, 13, 15(d) and 23(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 72002 of the FAST
Act.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Amendments

For purposes of the RFA, under Securities Act Rule 157 143 an issuer, other than an
investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization” if it had total assets of $5
million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage
in an offering of securities not exceeding $5 million. Under Exchange Act Rule 0-10(a), 144 an
issuer, other than an investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization” if it had

143

17 CFR 230.157.

144

17 CFR 240.0-10(a).

69

total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year. For purposes of the
RFA, under our rules an investment company is a small entity if it, together with other
investment companies in the same group of related investment companies, has net assets of $50
million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year. 145
The proposed amendments would increase the financial thresholds in the smaller
reporting company definition. We estimate that there are currently 837 entities that qualify as
“small” under the definitions set forth above. 146 We believe it is likely that virtually all small
businesses or small organizations, as defined in our rules described above, are already
encompassed within the current smaller reporting company definition and would continue to be
encompassed within the definition if the proposed amendments were adopted. To the extent any
small business or small organization, as defined for RFA purposes, is not already encompassed
within the current smaller reporting company definition, we believe it is likely that the proposed
amendments would capture those entities.
D.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements

The proposed amendments to the smaller reporting company definition would increase
the number of registrants eligible to provide scaled disclosures in response to Regulation S-K
and Regulation S-X disclosure requirements. The proposed amendments do not revise the scaled
disclosure requirements themselves.
If the proposed amendments were adopted, registrants with public floats in excess of $75
million and less than $250 million would become eligible to provide scaled disclosures.
Registrants with zero public float and revenues in excess of $50 million and less than $100
145

17 CFR 270.0-10(a).

146

Staff estimate based on review of Form 10-K filings with fiscal periods ending between January 31, 2015 and
January 31, 2016.

70

million in the most recent fiscal year also would become eligible to provide scaled disclosures.
Registrants with less than $75 million of public float and registrants with zero public float and
less than $50 million in annual revenues would not be impacted by the proposed amendments
because they already are eligible to provide scaled disclosures.
The proposed amendments would not increase the overall disclosure requirements for
small entities and could decrease substantially the disclosures required for registrants with public
floats between $75 million and $250 million and registrants with zero public float and annual
revenues between $50 million and $100 million.
Item 404 is the only disclosure item in Regulation S-K that may require more extensive
information for smaller reporting companies than for non-smaller reporting companies. Item
404(d)(1) requires disclosure of transactions with related persons that exceed the lesser of
$120,000 or 1% of the average of the smaller reporting company’s total assets at year end for the
last two completed fiscal years. This requirement may be more burdensome to a smaller
reporting company if 1% of its average total assets is less than $120,000, which is the disclosure
threshold for non-smaller reporting companies. This disclosure requirement would affect only
smaller reporting companies with related person transactions. Item 404 also requires disclosure,
only by smaller reporting companies, about parents and underwriting discounts and commissions
where a related person is a principal underwriter or a controlling person or member of a firm that
was or is going to be a principal underwriter. In addition, for filings other than registration
statements, Item 404 requires smaller reporting companies to provide information covering an
additional year.

71

E.

Overlapping or Conflicting Federal Rules

We do not believe any current federal rules duplicate, overlap or conflict with the
proposed amendments.
F.

Significant Alternatives

The RFA directs us to consider significant alternatives that would accomplish the stated
objectives of our proposed amendments, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on
small entities. Accordingly, we considered the following alternatives:
•

establishing different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into
account the resources available to small entities;

•

clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements for small
entities under our rules as revised by the proposed amendments;

•

using performance rather than design standards; and

•

exempting small entities from coverage of all or part of the proposed amendments.
The proposed amendments generally do not create any new compliance or reporting

requirements. Instead, they would expand the number of companies eligible for the different
compliance and reporting requirements available to smaller reporting companies. 147 As a result,
we do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to exempt small entities in connection with this
rulemaking. The proposed amendments are intended to increase the number of registrants
eligible to provide scaled disclosures under Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X. We believe
that some of the registrants that would become eligible to provide scaled disclosures if the
proposed amendments are adopted may be smaller entities. Therefore, we believe that the

147

As discussed in Section V.D, Item 404 is the only disclosure item in Regulation S-K that may require more
extensive information for smaller reporting companies than for non-smaller reporting companies.

72

proposed amendments may simplify compliance and reporting requirements for small entities.
With respect to the use of performance rather than design standards, because the proposed
amendments are not expected to have any significant adverse effect on small entities (and may,
in fact, relieve burdens for some such entities), we do not believe it is necessary to use
performance standards in connection with this rulemaking.
In Section III, above, we discuss additional alternatives that we have considered. We
note that those alternatives, such as using a different threshold or different standard for
determining smaller reporting company status, are unlikely to have a significant effect on smaller
entities because, as noted above, we believe virtually all small entities are already eligible for
smaller reporting company status. Similarly, with respect to the alternative of not amending the
accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions, we believe there are very few small entities
that would be considered accelerated filers under the current definitions, and, therefore, this
alternative would not significantly affect small entities.
G.

General Request for Comment

We encourage comments with respect to any aspect of this IRFA. In particular, we
request comments on:
•

The number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed amendments;

•

The existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposals on small entities
discussed in the analysis; and

•

How to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments.

Commenters should describe the nature of any impact and provide empirical data
supporting the extent of the impact. Any comments we receive will be considered in the
preparation of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, if the proposed amendments are

73

adopted, and will be placed in the same public file as comments on the proposed amendments
themselves.
VI.

Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996

(SBREFA), 148 the Commission must advise the OMB as to whether a proposed regulation
constitutes a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it
results or is likely to result in:
•

an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more (either in the form of an
increase or a decrease);

•

a major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or

•

significant adverse effects on competition, investment or innovation.

If a rule is “major,” its effectiveness will generally be delayed for 60 days pending Congressional
review.
We request comment on whether our proposed amendments would be a “major rule” for
purposes of SBREFA. We solicit comment and empirical data on:
•

the potential effect on the U.S. economy on an annual basis;

•

any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; and

•

any potential effect on competition, investment or innovation.

We request those submitting comments to provide empirical data and other factual support for
their views to the extent possible.

(1)

Definition of smaller reporting company. As used in this part, the term smaller

reporting company means an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer (as
defined in § 229.1101), or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not a smaller reporting
company and that:
(i)

Had a public float of less than $250 million as of the last business day of its most

recently completed second fiscal quarter, computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide
number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price
at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of common
equity, in the principal market for the common equity; or
(ii)

In the case of an initial registration statement under the Securities Act or Exchange

Act for shares of its common equity, had a public float of less than $250 million as of a date
within 30 days of the date of the filing of the registration statement, computed by multiplying the
aggregate worldwide number of such shares held by non-affiliates before the registration plus, in
the case of a Securities Act registration statement, the number of such shares included in the
registration statement by the estimated public offering price of the shares; or
(iii)

In the case of an issuer whose public float as calculated under paragraph (i) or (ii)

of this definition was zero, had annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most
recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.
(2)

Determination. Whether or not an issuer is a smaller reporting company is

determined on an annual basis.
(i)

For issuers that are required to file reports under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the

Exchange Act, the determination is based on whether the issuer came within the definition of
smaller reporting company, using the amounts specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) or (f)(1)(iii) of this

76

Item, as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of the issuer’s previous fiscal year.
An issuer in this category must reflect this determination in the information it provides in its
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of the next year, indicating on the cover
page of that filing, and in subsequent filings for that fiscal year, whether or not it is a smaller
reporting company, except that, if a determination based on public float indicates that the issuer is
newly eligible to be a smaller reporting company, the issuer may choose to reflect this
determination beginning with its first quarterly report on Form 10-Q following the determination,
rather than waiting until the first fiscal quarter of the next year.
(ii)

For determinations based on an initial Securities Act or Exchange Act registration

statement under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this Item, the issuer must reflect the determination in the
information it provides in the registration statement and must appropriately indicate on the cover
page of the filing, and subsequent filings for the fiscal year in which the filing is made, whether or
not it is a smaller reporting company. The issuer must redetermine its status at the end of its
second fiscal quarter and then reflect any change in status as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of
this Item. In the case of a determination based on an initial Securities Act registration statement,
an issuer that was not determined to be a smaller reporting company has the option to redetermine
its status at the conclusion of the offering covered by the registration statement based on the
actual offering price and number of shares sold.
(iii)

Once an issuer determines that it does not qualify for smaller reporting company

status, it will remain unqualified unless it determines that its public float, as calculated in
accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this Item, was less than $200 million as of the last business
day of its second fiscal quarter or, if that calculation results in zero because the issuer had no

77

public equity outstanding or no market price for its equity existed, if the issuer had annual
revenues of less than $80 million during its previous fiscal year.
