I.

proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents
to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
1.
This matter involves trading by Frank S. Barucci and Frank P. Barucci (“Frank P.”)
in advance of the May 6, 2015 announcement that Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Alexion”)
would submit a tender offer to acquire the outstanding shares of Synageva BioPharma Corp.
(“Synageva”) in a deal valued at $8.4 billion net of cash (the “Transaction”). In March 2015,
Frank S. learned material nonpublic information concerning the Transaction from Individual A,
who at the time was an Alexion employee. Frank S. obtained this information in confidence and
knew that he should neither trade on the information nor disclose it. Frank S. misappropriated the
information by both trading Synageva securities and tipping his father, Frank P., before the public
announcement of the Transaction. Frank S. generated ill-gotten gains of $40,355.85 and Frank P.
generated ill-gotten gains of $31,330.50 By engaging in this conduct, Frank S. and Frank P.
violated Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not

Background
7.
On February 18, 2015, Alexion’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of its
Board of Directors contacted the Chairman of Synageva’s Board of Directors and communicated
Alexion’s interest in acquiring Synageva for $175 per share. On March 5, 2015, Synageva
informed Alexion it was not interested in pursuing a transaction as outlined in the February 18,
2015 communications.
8.
Alexion continued to pursue the transaction, however, and on March 9, 2015,
Alexion and Synageva entered into a confidentiality agreement. Thereafter, Synageva shared
certain information with Alexion, and Alexion responded by increasing its offer to $195 a share on
March 17, 2015. Synageva rejected this offer on March 18, 2015, and Alexion responded by
increasing its offer to $212 per share on March 24, 2015.
9.
Although Synageva did not find the $212 per share offer sufficiently compelling to
enter into a transaction, Synageva did believe that it warranted furnishing additional information to
Alexion, and on March 26, 2015, Synageva so informed Alexion. As a result, Synageva opened a
virtual data room so that Alexion could review certain confidential information, and also arranged
an in-person meeting between senior Alexion and Synageva management, which took place on
March 30, 2015.
10.
On April 16, 2015, Alexion communicated its interest in acquiring Synageva for
$230 per share, an offer that Synageva ultimately accepted.
11.
During the course of her employment at Alexion, Individual A became aware of
material nonpublic information concerning the Transaction. Following Synageva’s positive
response to Alexion’s proposed deal terms on Thursday, March 26, 2015, Individual A was
involved in the expedited planning of a meeting that was to occur between senior Alexion and
Synageva management the following Monday, March 30, 2015, at a hotel in Newton,
Massachusetts. The Alexion team and their investment bankers were scheduled to arrive in
Massachusetts on Sunday, March 29, 2015, for a planning meeting prior to the following day’s
events. From Friday, March 27, 2015 to Monday, March 30, 2015, Individual A was responsible
for arranging hotel rooms, transportation, meeting space, dining arrangements, and other logistics.
This last minute event planning required that Individual A work over the weekend. Frank S.
learned of the Transaction due to his close personal relationship with Individual A and understood
that the information was material and nonpublic.
12.
Frank S. and Individual A have had a multi-year close personal relationship and
have a history, pattern, and practice of sharing confidences with each other.
13.
After learning the information relating to the Transaction, Frank S. tipped his
father, Frank P., regarding the Transaction. Frank S. knew or was reckless in not knowing that the
tipping was in breach of a duty of trust or confidence that he owed to Individual A.

3

14.
On March 30, 2015, Frank P. instructed his broker to buy 300 shares of Synageva
stock with a purchase price of approximately $30,000 while knowingly possessing material
nonpublic information concerning the Transaction. The purchase was uncharacteristic for Frank P.
in that he had no history of trading Synageva securities, no recent investments in pharmaceutical
companies, no recent individual equity purchases, and no other recent account activity of any kind.
In fact, for more than two years prior to the Synageva trade, his account only held diversified
mutual funds and cash. Additionally, the Synageva stock was purchased using margin, yet no
other securities in the account were held on margin prior to the Synageva purchase.
15.
Frank P. knew Individual A, knew that Individual A was an Alexion employee, and
knew that his son, Frank S., had a close personal relationship with Individual A. Frank P. knew
that the recommendation to buy Synageva securities was based on material nonpublic information
concerning the Transaction, knew or had reason to know that the information was provided to him
in breach of a duty of trust or confidence, and bought Synageva stock while knowingly possessing
the information.
16.
From April 13, 2015 to May 1, 2015, Frank S. accumulated 385 Synageva shares
with a cumulative purchase price of over $38,000. During that same period of time, Frank S. made
four deposits into his brokerage account. Before he became aware of the material nonpublic
information, Frank S. had no recent deposits, no recent securities transactions, and his account
value was under $7,000.
17.
On May 1, 2015, Frank S. spoke with a representative at his brokerage firm.
Although he had deposited $50,000 that day, not all of the funds were immediately available for
investment. Frank S. called his brokerage firm to determine whether it was possible to trade
immediately using the held funds, stating “I need the 23 [thousand dollars] available right now.”
Frank S.’s account activity and sense of urgency was a marked departure from his normal course of
conduct.
18.
Frank S. and Frank P. have a close father-son relationship that includes spending
time together on a regular basis as well as speaking by phone. Additionally, Frank S. and Frank P.
have a family owned plumbing business where they both have financial interests. In providing the
information concerning the Transaction to Frank P., Frank S. intended to benefit him.
19.
Before the market opened on May 6, 2015, Alexion and Synageva issued a joint
press release announcing the merger agreement and plan to file a tender offer statement whereby
Alexion would acquire Synageva’s shares for $115 in cash and .6581 Alexion shares for each
Synageva share, implying a total per Synageva share value of $230. Synageva's previous day
closing price, on May 5, 2015, was $95.87, thus the Transaction price represented a 139.9%
premium over the prior day’s closing price. Based on the news, Synageva stock opened at $215.08
on May 6, 2015 and closed at $203.39, a one-day increase of 112.15% based on the closing price.
20.

Frank S. earned a profit of $40,355.85 from his Synageva trading described above.

21.

Frank P. earned a profit of $31,330.50 from his Synageva trading described above.

22.
As a result of the conduct described above, Frank S. and Frank P. violated Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct in
connection with the purchase or sale of securities, and Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14e-3 thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct in connection with a tender offer.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Frank S.’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Frank S. cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of
the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.
B.
Respondent shall pay disgorgement of $40,355.85, prejudgment interest of
$1,155.64 and civil penalties of $56,021.10 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for
transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section
21F(g)(3). Payment shall be made in the following installments:
(1)

$29,259.78 within 10 days of the entry of the Order;
$22,757.61 within 120 days of the entry of the Order;
$22,757.60 within 240 days of the entry of the Order; and
$22,757.60 plus interest on the payments described in Section IV.B(1)-(4)
pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and/or 31 U.S.C. § 3717 within 365
days of the entry of this Order.

If any payment is not made by the date the payment is required by this Order, the entire
outstanding balance of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, plus any additional
interest accrued pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and/or pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, shall be
due and payable immediately, without further application.
Payment must be made in one of the following ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Frank S. as the Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy
of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Jay A. Scoggins, Division of
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, Denver Regional Office, 1961 Stout Street,
Suite 1700, Denver, CO 80294-1961.
C.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, he shall not argue that he is entitled to, nor shall he benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that he shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

By the Commission.
