ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-DESIST
PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION
21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER

In the Matter of
Joseph R. Allred, CPA,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Joseph R. Allred (“Respondent” or “Allred”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents
to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
SUMMARY
1.
This proceeding concerns failures by Magnum Hunter Resources Corporation
(“MHR” or “the Company”) and its management to properly implement, maintain, and evaluate
internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2011 and
to maintain ICFR sufficient to keep pace with MHR’s growth from at least the fiscal year-ended
December 31, 2011 through the quarter-ended September 30, 2013. MHR’s failures resulted in
part from Ronald D. Ormand (“Ormand”) and David S. Krueger (“Krueger”) improperly
evaluating the severity of identified control deficiencies.
2.
This proceeding also concerns Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) consulting
services provided by Allred. Allred advised MHR management that MHR did not have material
weaknesses in its ICFR. Allred did not have an adequate basis for this assessment. This, at least in
part, caused the violations by MHR, Ormand, and Krueger.

FACTS
i.

Statutory requirements regarding ICFR

8.
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act makes public companies responsible for
devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP. See 15 U.S.C. §78m(b)(2)(B).
9.
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(a) requires issuers, including MHR, to maintain ICFR.2
See 17 C.F.R. 240.13a-15(a). Rule 13a-15(f) defines ICFR as:
[A] process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
and effected by the issuer’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles[.] 17 C.F.R. 240.13a-15(f).
10.
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c) requires management—together with the
participation of principal executive and principal financial officers (or persons performing similar
functions)—to evaluate the effectiveness of ICFR as of the end of each fiscal year. See 17 C.F.R.
240.13a-15(c). Under Rule 13a-15(c), management may satisfy its obligations by conducting an
evaluation in accordance with interpretive guidance issued by the Commission in Release
No. 34-55929, Commission Guidance Regarding Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting Under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the
“2007 Guidance”).
11.
Item 308 of Regulation S-K requires management to provide an annual report that
contains its assessment of the effectiveness of ICFR and any material weakness in ICFR. Under
Item 308, “[m]anagement is not permitted to conclude that the registrant’s [ICFR] is effective if
there are one or more material weaknesses in the registrant’s [ICFR].” 17 C.F.R. 229.308.

2

Rule 13a-15(c) applies to issuers whose securities are registered under Section 12 of the
Exchange Act and who are required either to file annual reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act for the prior fiscal year or filed an annual report for the prior fiscal year.
3

12.
Item 308 of Regulation S-K further instructs that the registrant “must maintain
evidential matter, including documentation, to provide reasonable support for management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant’s [ICFR].” The 2007 Guidance similarly states
that “[m]anagement is responsible for maintaining evidential matter, including documentation to
provide reasonable support for its assessment.”
13.
Rule 1-02(a)(4) of Regulation S-X defines categories of ICFR deficiencies based
on the severity, as follows:


A “material weakness” is a “deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in [ICFR]
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.” See 17 C.F.R. 210.1-02(a)(4) (emphasis added). A misstatement is reasonably
possible if the chance of a misstatement is more than remote but less than likely. See
2007 Guidance at 34-35, n. 47 (citing Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies3).



A “significant deficiency” is a “deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in [ICFR]
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by
those responsible for oversight of the registrant’s financial reporting.” Id.

14.
The “severity of a deficiency in ICFR does not depend on whether a misstatement
actually has occurred but rather on whether there is a reasonable possibility that the company’s
ICFR will fail to prevent or detect a misstatement on a timely basis.”4 See 2007 Guidance at 35
(emphasis added).
15.
Item 308(a)(3) of Regulation S-K requires public companies such as MHR to
annually provide a report of management that discloses material weaknesses that have been
identified by management. They are not required to publicly disclose significant deficiencies.
16.
Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 requires that every Form 10-Q and 10-K include
certifications signed by each principal executive and principal financial officer (or persons
performing similar functions). See 17 C.F.R. 240.13a-14. The certifying officers must confirm
that the Form 10-Q or 10-K does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state

FASB Statement No. 5 is available at

occurring is more than remote but less than likely.” FASB No. 5 at 4. It defines “remote” as:
“The chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.” Id.

a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
such statements were made, not misleading. Id. Ormand certified MHR’s 2011 Form 10-K and
March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012 Forms 10-Q.
17.
As detailed further below, MHR engaged Allred's firm to assist its management
with the documentation, testing, and evaluation of the company’s ICFR in 2010, 2011, and 2012.
Notwithstanding MHR’s reliance on the firm's services, MHR’s management—including Ormand
and Krueger—were ultimately responsible for its conclusions about the effectiveness of MHR’s
ICFR.
ii.

MHR’s Rapid Growth and Strained Accounting Resources

18.
MHR’s rapid growth strained its accounting resources. For example, MHR grew
from $6 million in revenues in 2009 to $23 million in 2010, largely as the result of an $82 million
acquisition in February 2010. In connection with the issuance of the external auditor’s report on
MHR’s 2010 year-end audit results, Gray informed Ormand, Krueger, and MHR’s Audit
Committee in February 2011 that MHR’s accounting department was experiencing “manpower
issues” and lacked sufficient personnel to complete all required tasks on a timely basis.
19.
Between December 2010 and April 2011, MHR acquired another $70 million in oil
and gas properties and leasehold mineral interests. MHR also completed two other acquisitions in
April and May 2011 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $565 million. In 2011,
MHR booked over $100 million in revenues—largely as a result of these acquisitions. This rapid
growth created a significant burden on MHR’s accounting department. For example, beginning in
November 2011 MHR failed to complete its standard monthly close process and began formally
closing its books on a quarterly basis with only sporadic monthly closes in 2012.
iii.

MHR’s ICFR assessment as of December 31, 2011
a. Allred identified MHR’s insufficient accounting staffing as a control deficiency
as of December 31, 2011.

20.
Allred led consulting engagements to document and test MHR’s ICFR. In February
2012, his firm issued a written report on MHR’s ICFR to certain MHR managers—including
Ormand and Krueger—and MHR’s Audit Committee. The report identified problems in MHR’s
accounting department, including that the “accounting and financial reporting team has
experienced significant delays in preparing financial statements and reports.” As a result, Allred's
team could not complete its testing activities within the time period originally scheduled. The
report further stated that two balance sheet account reconciliations for the month ending October
2011 were not reviewed and approved in a timely manner and that management review of the
consolidated October 2011 financial statements had not been formally documented.
21.
As of December 31, 2011, the report identified control deficiencies within MHR’s
accounting function, including: (a) instances in which reconciliations were not prepared, reviewed,
or approved on a timely basis; (b) failures to document the completion of required monthly
management reviews; and (c) significant delays in preparing financial statements and reports due
to “inadequate and inappropriately aligned staffing.” The report stated:
5

[T]he potential for error in such a compressed work environment presents
substantial risk. With complex financial and reporting structures there are few
individuals within the team with the capacity to perform many tasks and there is
little time for senior reporting personnel to review, analyze, and evaluate because
they are performing transaction level reporting tasks. (emphasis added)
22.
The report concluded, without explanation, that MHR’s staffing deficiency
represented only a significant deficiency—rather than a material weakness. The report did not
explain how a deficiency that created a “substantial risk” of a financial statement error did not rise
to the level of a material weakness, defined as a deficiency in ICFR that creates a reasonable
possibility of a material misstatement not being prevented or detected on a timely basis.
23.
Krueger and Ormand accepted the assessment that MHR’s insufficient accounting
staffing represented a significant deficiency. Both Krueger and Ormand also relied on the absence
of an actual identified material error in MHR’s financial statements as evidence that a material
weakness did not exist as of December 31, 2011. Neither Krueger nor Ormand prepared any
documentary evidence to supplement the documentation created by Allred's team. Consequently,
the only documentation that supports MHR management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
MHR’s ICFR as of December 31, 2011 is the documentation created by Allred's team and
provided to MHR management.
24.
Because MHR management concluded that the control deficiency only rose to the
level of a significant deficiency, rather than a material weakness, MHR did not publicly disclose
the deficiency but instead stated that its ICFR was effective.
b. Gray Misapplied the Applicable Standard When Determining the Severity of
MHR’s Control Deficiency as of December 31, 2011.
25.
Gray failed to conduct the 2011 audit of MHR’s ICFR in accordance with PCAOB
Auditing Standards No. 3, Audit Documentation (“AS3”), and No. 5, An Audit of Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated with An Audit of Financial Statements (“AS5”) and
improperly approved the issuance of the external auditor’s audit report containing an unqualified
opinion on MHR’s ICFR as of December 31, 2011.
26.
In February 2012, a year after first raising concerns over MHR’s accounting
“manpower issues,” Gray reported to MHR’s Audit Committee a “[d]elay in closing the books due
to [the] Company manpower shortage relative to [the] volume of financial activity.” This resulted
in “[n]umerous top-side adjustments” creating significant audit inefficiencies.
27.

Gray, as engagement partner, further reported that:

We believe there is not adequate internal control over financial reporting due to
inadequate and inappropriately aligned staffing. This factor increases the
possibility of a material error occurring and being undetected and reduces the
Company’s ability to file its 10-K on time.
6

28.
Despite assessing that there was “not adequate internal control over financial
reporting due to inadequate and inappropriately aligned staffing,” Gray concluded that this control
deficiency rose to the level of a significant deficiency—rather than a material weakness. The audit
work papers failed to adequately document the basis for this conclusion. They also failed to
explain how the fact that MHR did “not [have] adequate internal control over financial reporting”
was not indicative of a material weakness, defined as weakness that creates a reasonable possibility
(i.e., “more than remote but less than likely”) of a material error not being detected or corrected on
a timely basis.
29.
When reporting audit results on the effectiveness of MHR’s ICFR as of
December 31, 2011 to MHR’s Audit Committee, Gray identified MHR’s “inadequate and
inappropriately aligned staffing” as a significant deficiency rather than as a material
weakness.
30.
Gray determined that MHR’s inadequate and inappropriately aligned accounting
staff did not constitute a material weakness because, among other things: (i) the audit work did not
identify material errors for the reporting period, and (ii) he understood that MHR had recently
hired additional accounting staff and that the existing staff, while overworked, was competent.
31.
However, this was a misapplication of the applicable standards. As the engagement
partner who led the audit of the effectiveness of MHR’s ICFR, Gray improperly applied the
definitions of “material weakness” and “significant deficiency” codified in Rule 1-02(a)(4) of
Regulation S-X and Appendix A of AS 5. The severity of a deficiency does not depend on
whether an error actually occurred. AS 5, ¶ 64.
32.
Notwithstanding the systemic importance of an entity-level control, the written
analysis was deficient for two reasons. First, it failed to apply the appropriate standard for defining
a material weakness. Second, it failed to evaluate the severity of MHR’s control deficiency in
accordance with AS 5 because it did not adequately consider: (a) the misstatement that might result
from having insufficient accounting staff; (b) MHR’s ability to prepare accurate financial
statements based on the possible future consequences of the deficiency; (c) the amounts and
transactions exposed to the deficiency; or (d) the volume of activity exposed to the deficiency that
occurred in the current period or that is expected in future periods. AS 5, ¶¶ 62-70.
33.
Gray also failed to adequately document the basis for his conclusion. Under AS 3,
“[a]udit documentation should be prepared in sufficient detail to provide a clear understanding of
its purpose, source, and the conclusions reached.” AS 3, ¶ 4. “The auditor must document the
procedures performed, evidence obtained, and conclusions reached with respect to relevant
financial statement assertions.” AS 3, ¶ 6. “Audit documentation must clearly demonstrate that the
work was in fact performed.” AS 3, ¶ 6.
34.
The only written audit documentation assessing the severity of MHR’s accounting
staffing deficiency was a summary spreadsheet purportedly identifying all MHR control
deficiencies for the 2011 reporting period. It documented the conclusion that MHR’s control
deficiency did not rise above a significant deficiency for three main reasons: (i) MHR hired a
controller and several senior level accountants during the latter part of 2011; (ii) MHR was in the
7

process of integrating two major acquisitions completed in the second quarter of 2011 and the
delay in the close process was mostly due to integration across entities; and (iii) individual analysis
of two identified audit adjustments did not support a conclusion of a more severe control
deficiency.
35.
In doing so, Gray failed to evaluate MHR’s deficiencies in accordance with AS 5.
Auditors “must evaluate the severity of each control deficiency that comes to his or her attention to
determine whether the deficiencies, individually or in combination, are material weaknesses as of
the date of management’s assessment.” AS 5, ¶ 62 (emphasis in original).
c. MHR’s Management Retained Ultimate Responsibility for Evaluating the
Severity of Any Control Deficiencies.
36.

MHR disclosed in its 2011 Form 10-K that:

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness
of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered
by this report based on the framework in “Internal Control – Integrated
Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting
were effective as of December 31, 2011 to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.
See MHR Fiscal Year 2011 Form 10-K at p. F-53.
37.
When determining whether a deficiency constitutes a material weakness,
management should consider all relevant information,5 including information provided by outside
parties. While MHR management retained ultimate responsibility for assessing MHR’s ICFR,
including evaluating the severity of any deficiencies in ICFR,6 the information provided by Allred
and Gray was relevant to its assessment. In addition, MHR’s management was responsible for
maintaining documentation to support its assessment.7
38.
Ormand and Krueger had knowledge of the stress placed on MHR’s accounting
department as a result of its rapid growth. Nonetheless, they did not sufficiently consider Allred’s
or Gray’s findings in analyzing the severity of the control deficiencies, or the appropriateness of
Allred’s and Gray’s conclusions in light of all other information which they were aware.

Instruction No. 2 to Item 308 of Regulation S-K.

Additionally, as discussed further below, MHR failed to maintain required evidential matter—
including documentation—providing reasonable support for its assessment.
d. MHR’s Documentation Indicated That Krueger Failed to Review MHR’s Q3
2011 Form 10-Q on a Timely Basis.
39.
One of the consequences of MHR’s staffing deficiency resulted in Krueger signing
off on MHR’s third quarter 2011 Form 10-Q five days after the Form 10-Q was filed with the
Commission. Because Krueger was the CAO—and highest ranking officer with an accounting
background—responsible for reviewing MHR’s periodic reports prior to filing them with the
Commission, MHR had no compensating control8 in its ICFR.
e. MHR Failed to Adequately Document its Assessment of ICFR.
40.
Item 308 of Regulation S-K requires and the 2007 Guidance states that
management must maintain documentation to provide reasonable support for its assessment of the
effectiveness of the company’s ICFR.
41.
However, in its year-end 2011 assessment, MHR failed to generate or maintain
documentation supporting its basis for determining the severity of its accounting staff deficiency.
It thus did not adequately document its basis for concluding that the deficiency was a significant
deficiency—rather than a material weakness. This was true even though MHR management, and
Ormand and Krueger specifically, had been informed that: (a) there was a “substantial risk” of an
error (by Allred); and (b) “there is not adequate internal control over financial reporting” (by
Gray).
42.
The control deficiency caused by MHR’s inadequate accounting staffing was
particularly important because it was an entity-level control. Because it was an important control
that could affect other controls throughout the company, it needed to be fully understood and
defined in order to determine the nature, extent, and severity of the deficiencies.
f. MHR Management Misapplied the Appropriate Definition When Determining
the Severity of MHR’s Control Deficiency as of December 31, 2011.
43.
Ormand and Krueger failed to apply the appropriate standard when determining the
severity of MHR’s internal control deficiency. As detailed above, while actual errors may inform
assessments of control deficiencies, the presence of an actual error is not a prerequisite to
concluding that a material weakness exists. Rather, management is to consider whether there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement will not be timely detected or prevented. In
addition, the effectiveness of a company’s ICFR is assessed at a specific point in time—as of the
end of the fiscal reporting period. Planned or anticipated remedial efforts are irrelevant to the
analysis.
“Compensating controls are controls that serve to accomplish the objective of another control
that did not function properly, helping to reduce risk to an acceptable level.” 2007 Guidance at
n. 49.
9
8

44.
Ormand and Krueger improperly assessed the severity of the control deficiency
caused by MHR’s “inadequate and inappropriately aligned staffing” as of December 31, 2011.
MHR management should have assessed whether a reasonable possibility existed that a material
misstatement of the company’s financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.
iv.

MHR’s Disclosure of the Existence of Material Weaknesses
a. MHR Restates its June 30, 2012 Form 10-Q and Discloses Material
Weaknesses.

45.
On November 14, 2012, MHR filed an amended Form 10-Q restating its June 30,
2012 financial statements to correct a material error related to stock-based compensation and
certain other errors. MHR disclosed that management concluded that material weaknesses existed
as of June 30, 2012 related to (i) a lack of sufficient, qualified personnel to design and manage an
effective control environment; (ii) MHR’s period-end financial reporting process; and (iii) controls
over calculation and review of share-based compensation expense. MHR also disclosed
management’s plans to remediate and improve the company’s ICFR and disclosure controls and
procedures.
46.
Before restating, MHR’s Audit Committee met on October 19, 2012 to understand
how the company had materially understated option based compensation expense in the second
quarter. Ormand reported that the person responsible for reviewing the calculation signed off
without reviewing it. Also at that meeting, Gray “restated that the root cause [of the error] was
inadequate and inappropriately aligned staffing of the accounting department.”
b. MHR’s Disclosed Material Weaknesses in its September 30, 2012 Form 10-Q.
47.
On November 13, 2012, MHR’s Audit Committee met and approved the
company’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter-ended September 30, 2012. That filing disclosed the
same three material weaknesses existed at September 30, 2012 that had been disclosed in MHR’s
amended June 30, 2012 Form 10-Q.
c. MHR Delinquently Files its 2012 Form 10-K and Discloses Material
Weaknesses.
48.
MHR delinquently filed its 2012 Form 10-K on June 14, 2013. In it, MHR
disclosed fourteen material weaknesses as of December 31, 2012, including that “[i]n certain areas
the Company did not have sufficient personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience
and training commensurate with the growth of the Company's corporate structure and financial
reporting requirements” and not upgrading “resources around internal audit, tax, financial reporting
and certain accounting areas.”
49.
MHR’s internal analysis of the material weaknesses posed by its understaffed
accounting department, as disclosed in its 2012 Form 10-K, recognized that the “significant
deficiency identified at year-end 2011 does not appear[] to be remediated. Personnel do not appear
to have the competence and training necessary for their assigned level of responsibility.”
10

v.

MHR Remediates Inadequate and Inappropriately Aligned Staffing in the
Third Quarter 2013

50.
On November 8, 2013, MHR filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended September
30, 2013. While concluding that the Company’s ICFR was not effective as of September 30, 2013,
management concluded that the material weakness that existed at quarter-end concerning
accounting staff inadequacies had subsequently been remediated.
D.

VIOLATIONS
i.

Allred Caused Ormand’s and Krueger’s Violations of Rule 13a-15(c) of the
Exchange Act.

51.
As a result of the conduct described above, Allred caused Ormand and Krueger
to violate Rule 13a-15(c) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer’s management to evaluate,

C.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, he shall not argue that he is entitled to, nor shall he benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that he shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by

12

Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
