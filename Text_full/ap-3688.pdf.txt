ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AS TO
ONE RESPONDENT
AND RESCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On February 12, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings.
On March 4, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing, in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), that: China Rongxin Chemical
Holding Group, Inc., was served with the OIP on March 3, 2016; and Ves Ventures & Holdings,
Inc. (a/k/a Helios Energia, Inc., a/k/a Accelerated Acquisitions XXI, Inc.), was served with the
OIP on February 19, 2016. Therefore, China Rongxin’s answer is due March 16 and Ves
Ventures’s answer was due March 3. To date, Ves Ventures has not filed an answer. See OIP at
3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b).
Accordingly, I ORDER Ves Ventures to SHOW CAUSE by March 21, 2016, why the
registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or
otherwise defend this proceeding. If Ves Ventures fails to respond to this order, it will be
deemed in default and the registration of its securities will be revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
Further, the prehearing conference currently scheduled for March 18, 2016, is
RESCHEDULED for 11:30 a.m. EDT on March 28, 2016.
