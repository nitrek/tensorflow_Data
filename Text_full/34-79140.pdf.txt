SECURITIES PURSUANT TO SECTION

Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors to accept the Offer of Settlement submitted by All
Energy Corp. (“All Energy” or “Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 240(a) of the Rules of Practice of
the Commission, 17 C.F.R. § 201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement of these proceedings
initiated against Respondent on September 16, 2016, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order
Making Findings and Revoking Registration of Securities Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to All Energy Corp. (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
1.
All Energy (CIK No. 1103384) is a void Delaware corporation located in
Johnston, Iowa. At all times relevant to this proceeding, the securities of All Energy have
been registered under Exchange Act Section 12(g). As of September 8, 2016, the
company’s stock (symbol “AFSE”) was quoted on OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”)
operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Link”), had five market makers, and was
eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
2.
All Energy failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules
13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder because it has not filed any periodic reports with the
Commission since the period ended September 30, 2014.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), registration of each class of Respondent’s
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be, and hereby is, revoked.2
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
