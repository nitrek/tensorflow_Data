For Review of Disciplinary Action Taken by
FINRA

OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
REGISTERED SECURITIES ASSOCIATION—REVIEW OF DISCIPLINARY
PROCEEDINGS
Failure to timely disclose material information on Form U4
Associated person of member firm of registered securities association failed to timely
disclose material information concerning bankruptcy and tax liens on Form U4. Held,
association’s findings of violation and imposition of sanctions are sustained.
APPEARANCES:
Michael Earl McCune, pro se.
Alan Lawhead, Andrew Love, and Colleen Durbin, for the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc.
Appeal filed: August 25, 2015
Last brief received: December 7, 2015

2

Michael Earl McCune (“McCune”) seeks review of a FINRA disciplinary action. FINRA
found that McCune, in violation of NASD Rule 2110 and Interpretive Material-1000-1 (“IM
1000-1”) and FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010, willfully failed to timely amend his Uniform
Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (“Form U4”) to disclose a
bankruptcy, three federal tax liens, and one state tax lien.1 FINRA suspended McCune in all
capacities for six months and imposed a $5,000 fine. McCune concedes he failed to timely
amend his Form U4, but argues, among other things, that he did not act willfully, and that the
six-month suspension is inappropriate because it is essentially the equivalent of “a lifetime ban
from the industry.”2 We sustain FINRA’s findings of violation and the sanctions imposed based
on our independent review of the record.
I.

Facts

The facts in this case are undisputed.3 From December 1996 until May 2011, McCune
was associated with Royal Alliance Associates, Inc. (“Royal Alliance”), a FINRA member firm.
He is currently employed as a registered representative by National Planning Corporation.
A. McCune’s 1989 bankruptcy
In February 1989, McCune filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter
13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and
McCune’s debts were discharged in October 1990. McCune amended his Form U4 to disclose
this bankruptcy in December 1996, when he joined Royal Alliance. McCune explained in the
Disclosure Reporting Pages of his Form U4 that he had mistakenly omitted the bankruptcy from
the earlier iterations of his Form U4. The December 1996 Form U4 McCune signed included a
representation by McCune that he would update his Form U4 by filing timely amendments
whenever changes occurred to previously reported information.4

1

McCune’s violations occurred between 2005 and 2011 and we therefore apply the NASD
and FINRA Rules as relevant. NASD IM1000-1 was replaced by FINRA Rule 1122 with some
modifications on August 17, 2009. FINRA Regulatory Notice 09-33, 2009 WL 1701937, at *3
(June 15, 2009). None of those modifications are at issue in this proceeding, and the substance
of the provision’s prohibitions remained the same in all relevant respects. On December 15,
2008, NASD Rule 2110 was adopted as FINRA Rule 2010 without material change. FINRA
Regulatory Notice 08-57, 2008 WL 4685588, at *7 (Oct. 16, 2008).
2

McCune does not challenge FINRA’s order that he pay hearing costs of $1,522.94, which
we sustain.
3

In June 2013, McCune and FINRA’s Department of Enforcement reached an agreement
to stipulate to most of the facts at issue in this case.
4

McCune’s failure to timely disclose his 1989 bankruptcy on his Form U4 was not
charged by FINRA as a violation, but, as explained below, we find his failure relevant to a
determination of whether McCune was aware of his disclosure obligations.

3

B. McCune’s awareness of his disclosure obligations
Royal Alliance required all of its registered representatives, including McCune, to
complete an annual compliance questionnaire. McCune testified that he completed the
questionnaires during each year of his employment with Royal Alliance. The questionnaire
included specific reminders about the need for registered representatives to update their Form U4
and to include information about disclosure events such as bankruptcy filings. Beginning in
2008, the questionnaires also contained specific reminders about the need to disclose liens.
McCune stated during his on-the-record testimony that he received a copy of Royal
Alliance’s Sales Practices Manual when he joined the firm. Royal Alliance’s Sales Practices
Manual, dated January 1999, stated:
Failure to amend Form U-4 when there is a change in the
information required is considered by the NASD to be a material
omission and may result in severe sanctions. The RR must
disclose on a new Form U-4, or amend the old U-4, when there are
affirmative responses to the questions in Item 22 regarding past or
pending legal or regulatory proceedings.
Subsequent versions of Royal Alliance’s Sales Practices Manual contained similar warnings
about the potential consequences for registered representatives who fail to timely amend their
Form U4. The Sales Practices Manual dated September 25, 2009, also stated that registered
representatives should review their Form U4 on at least an annual basis to ensure its accuracy.
C. McCune’s second and third bankruptcy petitions and four tax liens
In October 2002, McCune filed a second voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter
13. On October 23, 2003, while the petition was pending, McCune signed an amendment to his
Form U4 that was submitted to FINRA by Royal Alliance. In the amendment, McCune
responded “no” when asked whether he had filed a bankruptcy petition within the past ten years.
McCune’s second voluntary bankruptcy petition was dismissed by the bankruptcy court in 2005
without a discharge.5
McCune filed a third voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in May 2005,
three months after the dismissal of his 2002 bankruptcy petition. The bankruptcy was converted
from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, and McCune’s debts were discharged in May 2006. McCune
failed to amend his Form U4 to disclose the 2005 bankruptcy to FINRA until April 7, 2011.

5

McCune’s failure to disclose his second voluntary bankruptcy petition on his Form U4
was not charged by FINRA as a violation.

4

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the state of Kansas filed a series of tax liens
against McCune beginning in 2009, which McCune also failed to timely disclose to Royal
Alliance and to FINRA in an amended Form U4:





Federal tax lien for $157,685 filed by the IRS on March 10, 2009;
State tax lien for $1,872 filed in the District Court for Johnson County,
Kansas on March 31, 2009;
Federal tax lien for $258 filed by the IRS on May 3, 2010; and
Federal tax lien for $2,559 filed by the IRS on March 4, 2011.

McCune had knowledge and notice of each of these liens and failed to amend his Form U4 to
disclose them to FINRA until April 7, 2011.
D. Royal Alliance discovered McCune’s failures to disclose
In preparing for an audit scheduled for the end of March 2011, Royal Alliance’s
independent auditor discovered a possible problem with McCune’s Form U4 disclosures and
informed McCune’s supervisor. Royal Alliance then performed a credit check that revealed
McCune’s bankruptcies and liens. McCune’s supervisor brought McCune’s failures to make
required disclosures on his Form U4 to his attention. McCune made the disclosures on April 7,
2011, in an amended Form U4, and was permitted to resign in May 2011.
E. Procedural history
On January 13, 2013, FINRA’s Department of Enforcement filed a complaint alleging
that McCune willfully failed to amend his Form U4 to disclose his 2005 bankruptcy petition and
the four tax lien filings.6 A hearing was held on July 23, 2013. On April 23, 2014, a FINRA
hearing panel issued a decision finding that McCune had engaged in the alleged violations and
suspended McCune in all capacities for six months, fined him $5,000, and imposed hearing costs
of $1,522.94. The hearing panel also determined that McCune was subject to statutory
disqualification. McCune appealed the decision to the National Adjudicatory Council ("NAC"),
which affirmed the hearing panel’s findings of violation and sanctions. This appeal followed.
II.

Analysis
A. Standard of Review

We base our findings on an independent review of the record and apply the
preponderance of the evidence standard for self-regulatory organization ("SRO") disciplinary
6

FINRA’s complaint initially contained a second cause of action for McCune’s false
completion of Royal Alliance’s annual compliance questionnaire, but FINRA withdrew this
claim prior to the hearing.

5

actions.7 Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 19(e)(1), in reviewing an SRO disciplinary action,
we determine whether the aggrieved person engaged in the conduct found by the SRO, whether
such conduct violated the SRO’s rules, and whether such SRO rules are, and were applied in a
manner, consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act.8
B. McCune engaged in the conduct found by FINRA.
McCune does not dispute that he engaged in the conduct found by FINRA. As described
above, for six years he failed to amend his Form U4 to reflect his 2005 bankruptcy filing; for two
years he failed to amend his Form U4 to reflect the March 2009 federal and state tax liens; for 11
months he failed to amend his Form U4 to reflect the May 2010 federal tax lien; and for more
than a month he failed to amend his Form U4 to reflect the March 2011 federal tax lien. Based
on our independent review of the record, we find that McCune engaged in the conduct found by
FINRA.
C. McCune violated FINRA and NASD rules by failing to disclose his
bankruptcy and liens.
We find that McCune’s failures to amend his Form U4 to reflect his 2005 bankruptcy and
four tax liens violated IM 1000-1, NASD Rule 2110, and FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010.
IM 1000-1 requires FINRA members and their associated persons to file, in connection
with membership or registration as a registered representative, complete and accurate
information.9 FINRA Rule 1122 provides that “[n]o member or person associated with a
member shall file with FINRA information with respect to membership or registration which is
incomplete or so inaccurate so as to be misleading, or which could in any way tend to mislead, or
fail to correct such filing after notice thereof.” These rules apply to a Form U4, which FINRA
uses to screen applicants and monitor their fitness for registration within the securities industry.10
The information contained in Form U4 is important to the investing public and FINRA firms that
are evaluating potential hires.11

A registered representative has a continuing obligation to timely update information
required by Form U4 as changes occur.12 Article V, Section 2(c) of FINRA By-Laws requires
member firms and associated persons to report certain events on Forms U4 and to keep the form
updated and accurate. The By-Laws further require that these events be reported accurately no
later than 30 days after learning of the facts or circumstances giving rise to a reportable event.
The duty to provide accurate information on a Form U4 and to amend Form U4 to provide
current information assures regulatory organizations, employers, and members of the public that
they have all of the material, current information about the registered representative with whom
they are dealing.13 Failing to timely amend a Form U4 when required violates IM 1000-1 and
FINRA Rule 1122 and the high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles
of trade to which FINRA holds its members and their associated persons under NASD Rule 2110
and FINRA Rule 2010.14
D. McCune is subject to statutory disqualification.
We sustain FINRA’s finding that McCune is subject to statutory disqualification because
his failure to disclose the bankruptcy and tax liens was willful and constituted material omissions
from an application to associate with a member firm. A person is subject to a statutory
disqualification under Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act if, among other things, “such person
. . . has willfully made . . . in any application for membership or participation in, or to become
associated with a member of, a self-regulatory organization, . . . any statement which was at the
time, and in light of the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or has omitted to state in any such . . . report . . . any material fact which is
required to be stated therein.”15 As described below, we agree with FINRA’s analysis that
(. . .continued)
financial obligations had a bearing on their confidence in him”), aff’d, 671 F.3d 210 (2d Cir.
2012).

previously reported." Further, he represented that, "to the extent any information previously

McCune acted willfully when he failed to disclose the bankruptcy and tax liens, and that the
information concerning the bankruptcy and tax liens was material.
1. McCune’s conduct was willful.
The preponderance of the evidence supports FINRA’s finding that McCune’s conduct
was willful. A willful violation of the securities laws means “intentionally committing the act
which constitutes the violation.”16 The laws do not require that the actor “also be aware that he
is violating one of the Rules or Acts.”17 If McCune voluntarily committed the acts that
constituted the violation, then he acted willfully.
McCune knew about the bankruptcy and liens but failed to amend his Form U4, despite
representing on earlier occasions that he would update the Form by filing timely amendments.
As early as 1996, when McCune joined Royal Alliance and amended his Form U4 to disclose his
1989 bankruptcy, he was aware of his obligation to disclose bankruptcy petitions on Form U4.
In the 1996 amendment to his Form U4, McCune explained that he had omitted the 1989
bankruptcy from his previous Form U4 by mistake. Yet McCune failed to amend his Form U4 to
disclose his 2005 bankruptcy until this failure was brought to his attention by his supervisor six
years later. 18
McCune’s responses on Royal Alliance’s annual compliance questionnaires during his
employment with the firm are further evidence that he acted willfully in failing to amend his
Form U4.19 For each year from 2003 through 2010, Royal Alliance’s annual compliance
(. . .continued)
submitted is not amended, the information provided in this form is currently accurate and
complete." See also Mathis, 671 F.3d at 219-20 (finding that a failure to amend Form U4 to
disclose tax liens constituted a willful violation under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)).

Wonsover, 205 F.3d at 414 (citing Gearheart & Otis, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798 (D.C.
Cir. 1965)).
18

McCune was also reminded of his obligation to disclose bankruptcies on his Form U4
when he filed an amendment to his Form U4 in October 2003. It is unclear from the record why
McCune filed this amendment; however, in the amendment, McCune was asked whether he had
filed a bankruptcy petition within the past ten years. McCune responded “No.”
19

See Mathis, 671 F.3d at 219 (finding that respondent’s failure to disclose liens despite the
specific reference to “any liens . . . entered against [him], which were not previously disclosed on
Form U-4” in his firm’s annual compliance certification “serves only to corroborate the SEC’s
conclusion that [respondent’s] failure to amend [his ] Form U-4 was intentional”).

8

questionnaire included a reminder about a registered representative’s duty to report information
about bankruptcies. After McCune filed for bankruptcy in May 2005, he completed annual
compliance questionnaires in September 2005 and July 2006 in which he answered “Yes” when
asked whether he understood that registered representatives have a continuing obligation to
update their Form U4 as changes occur, including information regarding bankruptcies. McCune
also answered “Yes” when asked whether he had reviewed his Form U4 in the last twelve
months to ensure its accuracy and when asked whether his Form U4 was current to date.
Beginning in 2008, Royal Alliance’s annual compliance questionnaires contained a
specific reminder about a registered representative’s responsibility to report any liens. McCune
completed an annual compliance questionnaire in July 2008 – less than a year before the IRS
filed a tax lien against him in March 2009 – in which he answered “Yes” when asked whether he
understood that he had a continuing obligation to update information contained in his Form U4
as changes occur, including information regarding liens. In the 2009 and 2010 annual
compliance questionnaires, McCune answered “Yes” when asked whether he understood his
responsibility to immediately report any liens. McCune clearly was aware of the requirement to
amend his Form U4 to disclose bankruptcies and liens. McCune therefore acted willfully
because he intended to commit the acts that constituted the violation – failing to amend his Form
U4 for a period ranging from more than a month to six years to disclose his bankruptcy and
liens.20
McCune argues that his actions were not willful, and that he did not have “intent to
commit the act that constitutes the violation.” He says he does not understand how his actions
can be willful “without intent to commit the act he is accused of committing” and without a
finding that he “was aware of the rule he violated or that he acted with a culpable state of mind.”
McCune need not have acted with a culpable state of mind or even been aware that he was
violating a rule. Acting willfully, i.e., intending to commit an act, is different from acting with
scienter, i.e., intending to deceive.21 A determination of willfulness does not require a finding
that the respondent acted with scienter or that the respondent was aware he was violating the

20

See, e.g., id. at 218-19 (finding that failure to amend Form U4 to reflect tax liens was
willful where Mathis knew about the liens and Form U4 that Mathis signed before the entry of
the liens had warned him of his continuing obligation to disclose changes to previously reported
answers).

law.22 This distinction has governed the securities laws for half a century.23 McCune has not
pointed to any authority supporting his argument that willfulness, as applied in this context,
requires more than intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation.24
2. The bankruptcy and liens McCune failed to disclose were
material.
We sustain FINRA’s finding that the bankruptcy and liens McCune failed to disclose
were material. In the context of Form U4 disclosures, a fact is material if there is a substantial
likelihood that a reasonable regulator, employer, or customer would have viewed it as
significantly altering the total mix of information made available.25 McCune’s employer, his
22

See, e.g., Robert D. Tucker, Exchange Act Release No. 68210, 2012 WL 5462896, at *11
(Nov. 9, 2012) (finding that Respondent acted willfully where his false answers on Form U4
were neither involuntary nor inadvertent).
In addition, the Commission has repeatedly ruled that a person acts willfully when
committing violations that had no scienter or negligence requirement, as is true of the rules
McCune violated. See Maria T. Giesige, Exchange Act Release No. 60000, 2009 WL 1507584,
at *6 n.10 (May 29, 2009) (applying Wonsover standard to find willfulness with regard to
Securities Act Section 5 non-scienter violations); Robert G. Weeks, Exchange Act Release No.
48684, 2004 WL 828, at *12-13, *16 (Oct. 23, 2003) (same).
23

See Wonsover, 205 F.3d at 414-15 (quoting Gearhart & Otis v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803
(D.C. Cir. 1965)); Tager, 344 F.2d at 8. Although Wonsover, Gearhart, and Tager each
interpreted the meaning of willfulness in the context of Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, the
Commission has uniformly applied the same meaning to Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(F)’s
willfulness requirement. See, e.g., Neaton, 2011 WL 5001956, at *7. The Second Circuit Court
of Appeals has done the same. See Mathis, 671 F.3d at 217-18 (“Given the parallel language and
common purpose of the provisions located in both [Section] 3 and [Section] 15 of the Exchange
Act, Tager’s formulation of ‘willfulness’ naturally extends to willful violations under Section 3
involving Forms U-4.”).
24

McCune also argues that since he was not aware that FINRA’s BrokerCheck program
existed until a few weeks before he separated from Royal Alliance in 2011, he did not intend to
“defraud the system.” He asserts that “it is totally implausible” that the “Exchange Act could
have even remotely anticipated the Internet and the Broker Check system.” As explained above,
this argument is inapposite because intent to defraud is not an element of a violation of the
FINRA Rules at issue here nor is it a prerequisite to a finding of willfulness. Moreover, as a
registered representative, McCune was responsible for his compliance with FINRA’s rules and
his attempts to obfuscate his responsibility because of his lack of appreciation of the
BrokerCheck program are not persuasive. See Neaton, 2011 WL 5001956, at *7.

Mathis, 671 F.3d at 219 (holding that "[t]he SEC employed the proper and familiar test
for materiality set forth in TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc.," 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976), and
finding "no difficulty in affirming the SEC's conclusion that the tax liens were material" given

regulators, and his customers all would have viewed McCune’s bankruptcy and tax liens as
significantly altering the total mix of information made available because the information would
have: 1) alerted his firm to the outside financial pressures he was facing; 2) allowed customers
to assess whether the bankruptcy and liens had a bearing on his ability to provide them with
appropriate financial advice; and 3) provided his regulators with early notice about his financial
difficulties and ability to manage his financial obligations.26 The significance of McCune’s
bankruptcy and tax liens is even more apparent when viewed in light of the number and total
amount of the tax liens (four liens for a total of $162,374 owed), the fact that McCune had filed
for bankruptcy before, and the lengthy period of time during which the information was not
disclosed. We therefore agree with FINRA that McCune’s bankruptcy filing and tax liens
constituted material information.
McCune argues that FINRA erred by failing to take into consideration “the actual
experience of [his] actual clients” and points out that “the required disclosures have been made
for over four years and yet nearly all of these clients have chosen to remain as clients.” But
whether McCune’s clients subjectively viewed the bankruptcy and tax liens as material is not
relevant. Materiality is an objective standard "involving the significance of an omitted or
misrepresented fact ."27
E. FINRA and NASD rules are, and were applied in a manner, consistent with
the purposes of the Exchange Act.
We find that the FINRA and NASD rules requiring associated persons to file complete
and accurate information on Forms U4 are consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act.
Form U4 “is critical to the effectiveness of the screening process used to determine who may
enter (and remain in) the industry” because it enables regulators and the public to determine and
monitor the fitness of securities professionals.28 Thus, the form “ultimately serves as a means of
(. . .continued)
the Commission's determination that the registered representative's failure to disclose the liens on
Form U4 "significantly altered the total mix of information available to [FINRA], other
regulators, employers, and investors.'").
26

See Mathis, 2009 WL 4611423 at *9 (citing TSC Indus., Inc., 426 U.S. at 449) (finding
respondent’s undisclosed tax liens to be material); Tucker, 2012 WL 5462896, at *11 (finding
that respondent’s judgments, bankruptcies, and liens were significant because they cast doubt on
respondent’s ability to manage his personal financial affairs and provide investors with
appropriate financial advice).

behavior. Id. at 449.

protecting the investing public.”29 IM 1000-1 and FINRA Rule 1122 are designed to facilitate
such protection by requiring members and associated persons to file accurate and complete
Forms U4.
We also find that FINRA applied IM 1000-1 and FINRA Rule 1122 here in a manner
consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act. The bankruptcy and tax liens were specific
disclosure items on McCune’s Form U4 and they cast doubt on his ability to manage his personal
financial affairs and provide appropriate financial advice to investors.30
We further find that NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 are consistent with the
purposes of the Exchange Act. These rules reflect the mandate of Exchange Act Section
15A(b)(6), which requires, among other things, that FINRA design its rules to “promote just and
equitable principles of trade.”31 As we have stated, “[t]his general ethical standard . . . is broader
and provides more flexibility than prescriptive regulations and legal requirements. NASD Rule
2110 [and FINRA Rule 2010] protect[] investors and the securities industry from dishonest
practices that are unfair to investors or hinder the functioning of a free and open market, even
though those practices may not be illegal or violate a specific rule or regulation. NASD Rule
2110 [and FINRA Rule 2010] ha[ve] proven effective through nearly 70 years of regulatory

We agree with FINRA’s determination that McCune engaged in conduct inconsistent
with just and equitable principles of trade by failing to timely amend his Form U4. We therefore

Sanctions
A. Standard of Review

Exchange Act Section 19(e)(2) directs us to sustain FINRA’s sanctions unless we find,
having due regard for the public interest and the protection of investors, that the sanctions are
excessive or oppressive or impose an unnecessary or inappropriate burden on competition.34 As
part of this review, we must consider any aggravating or mitigating factors35 and whether the
sanctions imposed by FINRA are remedial in nature and not punitive.36 As discussed below, we
find the sanctions imposed on McCune are consistent with the statutory requirements and sustain
them.
B. The sanctions imposed by FINRA are neither excessive nor oppressive and
are necessary for the protection of investors.
For his violations, FINRA fined McCune $5,000 and suspended him for six months.
Although the Commission is not bound by FINRA’s Sanction Guidelines, we use them as a
benchmark in conducting our review under Exchange Act Section 19(e)(2).37 For misconduct
involving the late filing of amendments to Form U4, the Sanction Guidelines recommend a fine

33

McCune cites a report by the Government Accountability Office, which recommended
retroactive reviews of FINRA’s rules to “systematically assess whether its rules are achieving
their intended purpose and take appropriate action, such as maintaining rules that are effective
and modifying or repealing rules that are ineffective or burdensome.” See Securities Regulation:
Opportunities Exist to Improve SEC’s Oversight of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(GAO-12-625) (May 30, 2012), available at http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-625.
Nothing in the report changes our conclusion that in this case FINRA’s rules were applied in a
manner consistent with the purpose of the Exchange Act.

15 U.S.C. § 78s(e)(2). McCune does not allege, and the record does not show, that
FINRA’s sanctions imposed an undue burden on competition.

of between $2,500 and $37,000.38 For egregious cases, such as those involving repeated failures
to file, untimely filings, or false, inaccurate, or misleading filings, the guidelines recommend
considering a suspension of up to two years or a bar.39 The Sanction Guidelines also describe
several “principal considerations” in determining sanctions for the failure to timely file
amendments to Form U4, including the nature and significance of the information at issue.40
These considerations are in addition to the principal considerations set forth in the Sanctions
Guidelines that apply to every case.41
We agree with FINRA that McCune’s willful and repeated failures to timely file
amendments to his Form U4 warrant a $5,000 fine and six-month suspension. FINRA found,
and we agree, that McCune’s violations were egregious. For a lengthy period of time—ranging
from over one month to six years—McCune repeatedly failed to file timely amendments to his
Form U4 to disclose his 2005 bankruptcy petition and four tax liens.42 For the reasons discussed
above, information about McCune’s bankruptcy petition and tax liens was significant and
important to his customers, his employer, and his regulators.
We, like FINRA, are troubled by McCune’s continued attempts to minimize the
importance of his disclosure obligations and the seriousness of his violations. Specifically,
McCune testified that the compliance questionnaires and sales practice manuals are “thick”
documents, and that “nobody wants to hear” it, but “the truth” is that “nobody reads them” and
that he, too, did not read them. McCune also testified and stated in his answer to the FINRA
Enforcement Department’s complaint that at some point during his employment with Royal
Alliance he attempted to use the firm’s computerized process to update his Form U4, but he
could not figure out how to use it and did not pursue the matter further. McCune’s testimony
reflects that he failed to appreciate the importance of his responsibilities and regulatory
obligations as a registered representative.

40

FINRA found, and we agree, that McCune’s failure to timely amend his Form U4 does
not implicate the other two principal considerations applicable to Form U4 violations: whether
the failure resulted in a statutorily disqualified individual becoming or remaining associated with
the firm; and whether a firm’s misconduct resulted in harm to a registered person, another
member firm, or any person or entity. See id. at 69.
41

42

Id. at 6-7.

We agree with FINRA’s determination that the extended period of time during which
McCune failed to amend his Form U4 is an aggravating factor. See id. at 6 (Principal
Considerations in Determining Sanctions, No. 9) and 70.

14

We credit McCune’s candor in admitting that he failed to timely amend his Form U4.43
McCune testified that his failure to read Royal Alliance’s sales manual and compliance
questionnaires was not an excuse, and he admitted that in the past his attitude toward his
obligations “was not what it should have been.” Nonetheless, given the circumstances of
McCune’s past failures, his admissions do not outweigh our concern that his conduct presents a
continuing threat to investors and that a fine and a suspension from the industry is warranted.
We agree with FINRA’s determination that allowing McCune to remain in the industry
with no period of suspension would not serve the interests of his customers, or the industry as a
whole. Self-regulatory organizations, state regulators, and broker-dealers critically rely upon
Form U4 to determine whether an applicant is fit for registration as a securities professional.44
Thus, candor and forthrightness in filing and amending Form U4 is essential to the effectiveness
of the screening process.45 A suspension will allow McCune to reflect on the requirements for
securities professionals and for association with a member firm.
C. We reject McCune’s remaining arguments.
We agree with FINRA that McCune’s misconduct was not the result of a momentary
lapse of judgment or negligence which might be a mitigating factor.46 We also reject McCune’s
argument that his lack of prior compliance issues is a mitigating factor. We have repeatedly held
that a lack of a disciplinary history is not a mitigating factor because an associated person should
not be rewarded for acting in accordance with his duties as a securities professional.47
McCune’s argument that the sanctions imposed are not in the public interest because he
has taken good care of his customers is also unpersuasive. Our public interest inquiry focuses on
the welfare of investors generally, and the absence of customer harm is not a mitigating factor.48

15

Furthermore, McCune deprived his customers, his employer, FINRA, and investors generally, of
important information regarding his bankruptcy and liens.49
McCune alleges—without providing any support for the claim—that the suspension
essentially amounts to a bar from the industry because during the year in which FINRA initiated
its action against him, 95% of those suspended as a result of violations involving Form U4,
regardless of the duration, were no longer in the securities industry after the suspension.
However, the fact that McCune’s suspension may make it more difficult to find another job in
the securities industry is a collateral consequence arising from his misconduct, which we have
made clear is not mitigating. 50 Furthermore, although McCune speculates that he may not be
employed in the securities industry in the future, he is currently associated with a registered
broker-dealer, and the fine and suspension encourage McCune and others to comply with their
disclosure obligations.51
We find no merit in McCune’s argument that FINRA violated his due process rights
when it declined to consider “any policy arguments related to the fairness of McCune’s statutory
disqualification and any subsequent FINRA proceeding related to that disqualification.”52
FINRA does not subject a person to statutory disqualification as a penalty or remedial sanction.53
Instead, a person is subject to statutory disqualification by operation of Exchange Act Section
3(a)(39)(F) whenever there has been, among other things, a determination that a person willfully

See Neaton, 2011 WL 5001956, at *12 (disagreeing with Respondent’s assertion that no
one was harmed by his failure to amend his Form U4 in a timely manner).
50

See, e.g., Houston, 2014 WL 936398, at *8 (finding that any collateral consequences
suffered as a result of misconduct or the disciplinary proceeding that followed, such as impact on
reputation, career, or finances, is not a mitigating factor); Craig, 2008 WL 5328784, at *7
(rejecting the argument that the amount of time, money, and loss of work suffered as a result of
misconduct was a mitigating circumstance). In his reply brief, McCune argues that the reference
by FINRA’s Department of Enforcement to Houston and Craig was inappropriate because the
underlying misconduct in those cases was sufficiently different from his. But FINRA’s
Department of Enforcement cited Houston and Craig solely for the general principle that
collateral consequences are not mitigating.
51

As such, we reject McCune’s argument that the sanction was or would be “ineffective.”

52

Because FINRA is not a state actor and is not subject to constitutional requirements, it
could not have violated McCune’s due process rights. See, e.g., Eric J. Weiss, Exchange Act
Release No. 69177, 2013 WL 1122496, at *6 n.40 (Mar. 19, 2013).

failed to disclose material information on a Form U4.54 Considerations of “fairness” or policy
arguments do not bear upon the automatic statutory disqualification imposed upon McCune.
Finally, McCune objects to FINRA’s finding that “comparisons to sanctions in settled
cases are inappropriate because pragmatic considerations justify the acceptance of lesser
sanctions in negotiating a settlement such as the avoidance of time-and-manpower-consuming
adversary proceedings.” We have repeatedly stated that pragmatic considerations justify the
acceptance of lesser sanctions in negotiating a settlement.55 We, therefore, agree with FINRA
that in considering the sanction on McCune, any comparisons to sanctions in settled cases are
inappropriate.56

54

As explained above, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(F), a person is subject to
a statutory disqualification where, among other things, that person willfully has made a false or
misleading statement of material fact, or has omitted to state a material fact required to be
disclosed, in any application or report filed with a self-regulatory organization. 5 U.S.C. §
78c(a)(39)(F); see also Exchange Act Section 15(b)(4)(A), 5 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(4)(A).
A disqualified person cannot become or remain associated with a FINRA member unless
(i) a member firm sponsoring that person's employment files a Form MC-400 application for his
or her proposed continued association with the member notwithstanding his or her statutory
disqualification, and (ii) FINRA approves the application. See Nicholas Savva, Exchange Act
Release No. 72485, 2014 WL 2887272, at *2 (June 26, 2014) (citing FINRA By-Laws, Art. III, §
3(b), (d)) (summarizing the statutory disqualification review process); FINRA Rules 9520-9527
(setting forth eligibility procedures pursuant to which FINRA may allow a person to become or
remain associated with a member despite the existence of a statutory disqualification); see also
Exchange Act Rule 19h-1, 17 C.F.R. § 240.19h-1 (prescribing the form and content of, and
establishing the mechanism by which, the Commission reviews proposals submitted by SROs to
allow persons subject to a statutory disqualification to become or remain associated with member
firms; Provision for Notices by Self-Regulatory Organizations of Disciplinary Sanctions; Stays
of Such Actions; Appeals; and Admissions to Membership or Association of Disqualified
Persons, Exchange Act Release No. 13726 (July 8, 1977), 42 Fed. Reg. 36,411 (July 14, 1977)
(adopting Rule 19h-1); Notice by Self-Regulatory Organizations of Proposed Admission to, or
Continuance in, Membership or Participation of Certain Persons Subject to Statutory
Disqualifications, Exchange Act Release No. 18278 (Nov. 20, 1981), 46 Fed. Reg. 5654 (Dec. 3,
1981) (adopting amendments to Rule 19h-1).
55

56

See, e.g., Houston, 2014 WL 936398, at *7.

See, e.g., id.; see also FINRA Sanction Guidelines at 1 (noting that the “guidelines do not
prescribe fixed sanctions for particular violations” and acknowledging “the broadly recognized
principle that settled cases generally result in lower sanctions than fully litigated cases to provide
incentives to settle”).

17

Therefore, we conclude that the $5,000 fine and six-month suspension are neither
excessive nor oppressive and are remedial.57 By willfully failing to timely disclose material
information on his Form U4, McCune demonstrated his inability to fulfill the high standards of
conduct demanded of associated persons.58 The fine and suspension will encourage McCune to
make complete and accurate disclosures in the future and will emphasize to others the
importance of accuracy of the information in Form U4.59
An appropriate order will issue.60

McCune argues that the sanctions imposed by FINRA conflict with the Eighth and
Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution because they constitute an excessive fine and
violate due process. FINRA is a private actor and not a state actor subject to constitutional
requirements. See D.L. Cromwell Invests., Inc. v. NASD Regulation, Inc., 279 F.3d 155, 161-62
(2d Cir. 2002) (holding that NASD, FINRA’s predecessor, was not a state actor and thus was not
subject to the requirements of the Fifth Amendment); Desiderio v. Nat’l Ass’n of Sec. Dealers,
Inc., 191 F.3d 198, 206-07 (2d Cir. 1999) (rejecting plaintiff’s claim that NASD violated her
rights under the Fifth and Seventh Amendments because NASD was a private actor, not a state
actor.
