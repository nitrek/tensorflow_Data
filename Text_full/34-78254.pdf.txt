12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that1:

securities of Essential Telecommunications have been registered under Exchange Act

Essential Telecommunications has failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder because it has not filed any periodic

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), registration of each class of Respondent’s
