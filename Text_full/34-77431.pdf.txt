ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

In the Matter of
NOVARTIS AG,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted pursuant to 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against
Novartis AG (“Novartis” or “Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

1

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
1.
These proceedings arise out of violations of the books and records and internal
accounting controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the "FCPA") by
respondent Novartis AG ("Novartis") concerning its pharmaceutical operations in China.
2.
From at least 2009 to 2013, certain employees and agents of Novartis
subsidiaries conducting business in China engaged in transactions and provided things of value
to foreign officials, principally healthcare professionals ("HCPs"). These payments took varied
forms and were intended to influence the HCPs and thereby increase sales of Novartis
pharmaceutical products. Employees and managers in the involved subsidiaries attempted to
conceal the true nature of the transactions through the use of complicit third parties and by
improperly recording the relevant transactions on the books and records of the respective
subsidiaries, which were consolidated in the financial reports of Novartis. Examples include
improperly recording the payments as legitimate expenses for travel and entertainment,
conferences, lecture fees, marketing events, educational seminars, and medical studies.
Novartis also failed to devise and maintain an effective system of internal accounting controls
or an effective anti-corruption compliance program.
3.
As a result of this conduct, perpetrated by employees and agents of Novartis
subsidiaries in China, Novartis violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 ("Exchange Act") by failing to make and keep books, records and accounts, which,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of assets of
the issuer. Additionally, Novartis violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, as it
failed to maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that within the China subsidiaries: (i) transactions are executed in accordance
with management's general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements; (iii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to maintain accountability for assets; and (iv) that
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization.

Respondent
Novartis AG ("Novartis") is a corporation organized under the laws of
Switzerland. Novartis' headquarters are located in Basel, Switzerland. Novartis issued and
maintains a class of publicly traded securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the
4.

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
2

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
5.
Novartis is a global provider of pharmaceutical and over-the-counter health
products. Novartis' products are available in 180 countries and Novartis employs
approximately 120,000 employees. Novartis manages its operations by therapeutic area.
Novartis conducts business in China solely through its subsidiaries, including the two
subsidiaries identified below.

Other Relevant Entities
6.
Shanghai Novartis Trading Ltd ("Sandoz China") is headquartered in
Shanghai, China. Among other things, Sandoz China conducts the sales and marketing
activities of Novartis generic pharmaceutical products in China including Sandostatin.
Sandoz China is an indirect subsidiary of Novartis.
7.
Beijing Novartis Pharma Co, Ltd ("Novartis China") is based in Beijing,
China. Among other things, Novartis China conducts the broader operations for Novartis
AG in China including the sale and marketing of proprietary pharmaceutical products.
Novartis China is an indirect subsidiary of Novartis.

Sandoz China
Between 2009 and 2011, certain employees of Novartis' subsidiary, Sandoz
China, improperly provided things of value to HCPs in China in connection with
pharmaceutical sales and involved certain complicit managers. The things of value took
varied forms, and included gifts, travel, improper sightseeing or vacations, entertainment,
and favors for families of HCPs. These things of value were improperly recorded on the
general ledger as legitimate employee expenses, sponsorships, conferences, medical
studies, and marketing costs.
8.

Certain sales representatives of Sandoz China reported to their managers the
results of their efforts to increase the sales volume of various generic products. High
prescribing HCPs were referred to as "key" customers and the volume of their prescriptions
was reported to certain senior management at Sandoz China. In order to influence HCPs,
certain sales representatives provided HCPs with such things as cash and gifts, which were
funded through the submission of false expense reports. This practice was known to certain
members of management of Sandoz China, including certain area and district managers and
the country sales supervisor. For example, in 2011, two sales representatives submitted fake
receipts for approximately $8,100 as part of their employee expense reimbursement
requests, which were approved by a regional sales manager. The proceeds were used to
entertain and provide gifts to HCPs. In one instance, a sales representative submitted a fake
$1,154 receipt to purchase holiday gifts for 25 HCPs when the proceeds were actually used
to pay for spa and sauna sessions for HCPs. A regional sales manager approved the
purchase.
9.

3

10.
In connection with this practice, certain employees maintained projections in
spreadsheets that directly linked a certain cash value to be provided to HCPs in exchange for a
certain number of prescriptions per month. In certain instances, these planned amounts were
referred to as "investments," between several hundred and several thousand dollars annually,
and the HCPs were in some instances categorized into and tracked by different tiers,including
one tier described as "money worshippers."
11.
As part of its normal business operations, Sandoz China hired local Chinese
travel companies to arrange transportation, accommodations, and meals for HCPs in
connection with education events. However, in many instances, the actual trips did not
include an educational purpose or the scientific/educational components were minimal in
comparison to the sightseeing or recreational activities, and were instead a method of
influencing the HCPs. The related expenses were approved and paid with little or no
supporting documentation. For example:
• In 2009, Sandoz China sponsored twenty Chinese HCPs to

attend the American College of Surgeons 95th Annual Clinical
Congress in Chicago. While the Clinical Congress was
devoted to educational purposes, the HCPs were also
provided purely sightseeing or recreational activities, such as
an excursion to Niagara Falls. Sandoz China also paid for
travel to the U.S. for spouses of the HCPs, $150 in "pocket"
or "walking around" money, and cover charges at a strip club.
A senior manager of Sandoz China and other Sandoz China
employees accompanied the HCPs to Chicago.
• In 2011, a Chinese travel company submitted several invoices

totaling approximately $25,000 ostensibly in connection with
lectures by an HCP to other HCPs. The invoices were paid
and recorded as legitimate expenses despite the lack of any
confirmation: (1) that the lecture was organized by Sandoz
China and held in the venue for which an invoice was
submitted; and (2) that the lecture was attended by HCPs.
Sandoz China used other methods to provide monies to HCPs. In 2009 and
2010, Sandoz China paid HCPs to collect and analyze patient medical data for the stated
purpose of better understanding the use and reaction of a particular Novartis drug among
patients. Senior levels of the Sandoz China sales and marketing team were involved in the
design and execution of the studies.
12.

13.
In reality, the studies did not provide any legitimate medical data, but rather
were used to financially reward HCPs who had prescribed the drug. The studies were not
approved by the Novartis Global Clinical Quality Assurance group, as policy required, and the

4

studies did not collect or analyze substantive patient data regarding the drug. Despite the lack
of real scientific data, payments of approximately $88-135 per data submission were made to
the prescribing HCPs. The payments made to HCPs under these studies totaled approximately
$522,000 between 2009 and 201 0.
Novartis China
Between 2011 and 2013, employees and agents of Novartis China made
payments to government officials in China in connection with pharmaceutical sales. The
payments were made through event planning and travel companies retained by Novartis China
ostensibly to arrange transportation, accommodations and meals for HCPs in connection with
educational conferences and other business activities. Through the use of these complicit
vendors, HCPs were provided with improper inducements to prescribe or recommend Novartis
products. The subsidiary recorded these payments as legitimate selling and marketing costs in
its books.
14.

Novartis China retained numerous third-party travel and event planning
vendors to organize and manage marketing for HCPs events, both locally within China, and
outside China. The range of services varied but in some cases vendors arranged the venue,
food, entertainment, flights, hotels, and transit depending upon the location of the event and
number of participants. In the past several years, Novartis China has hosted thousands of
such events, and the pharmaceutical business unit within Novartis China was the largest
consumer of these services.
15.

Despite the widespread use of third-party travel and event planning
vendors in China, Novartis did not have s u f f i c i e n t internal a c c o u n t i n g controls or anticorruption compliance measures in connection with the use of these vendors. Among other
things, Novartis failed to conduct sufficient training of its sales staff and managers to prevent
and detect inappropriate payments made to and/or through these vendors, failed to conduct
proper due diligence in connection with these vendors and failed to ensure sufficient and
appropriate support for the selling and marketing expenses submitted by these vendors.
16.

Novartis' Cooperation and Remediation
17.
In connection with the SEC Staff s investigation and in response to media
reports concerning a competitor in August 2013, Novartis instituted an expansive review of its
relationships in China with travel and event planning vendors. Novartis’ internal review
showed that the vast majority of these vendors were retained in connection with events in which
HCPs attended. It also identified a significant percentage of events that did not comply with
existing Novartis Corporate policies and procedures. This included events for which no record
existed to verify it had occurred, events for which inconsistent records existed, and events that
could not be verified from available information. Through this mechanism of using travel
agencies and similar vendors to plan events, funds were generated that were used to provide
improper payments and other inducements to HCPs in order to increase sales of Novartis

5

products.
As a result of its internal review over relationships with local Chinese thirdparty travel and event planning vendors, Novartis identified weaknesses in its internal controls
over third party relationships at Novartis China. Novartis promptly took remedial steps to
improve its internal controls at Novartis China including overhauling its anti-corruption
policies and procedures, terminating and/or imposing other disciplinary sanctions against
culpable employees, suspending vendor relationships and payments, doubling its training
initiatives, re-organized its compliance function to include enhanced oversight by regional and
headquarter compliance personnel, and eliminated the use of vendors to support external
meetings.
18.

Legal Standards and Violations
Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a cease-anddesist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is, was,
or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act of omission the person knew or should have
known would contribute to such violation.
FCPA Violations
Under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to make and keep
books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer. [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A)].
Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to devise and maintain
a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(B)].
As described above, Novartis violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by
improperly recording the payments to health care providers as sales, marketing, and promotion
expenses. The false entries were initially recorded by Sandoz China and Novartis China which
were then consolidated and reported by Novartis in its consolidated financial statements. Novartis
violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) by failing to devise and maintain sufficient accounting controls to
detect and prevent the making of improper payments to foreign officials.

Undertakings
Respondent has undertaken to:
1. Report to the Commission staff periodically, at no less than
nine-month intervals during a two-year term, the status of its
remediation and implementation of compliance measures.
During this two-year period, should Respondent discover
credible evidence, not already reported to the Commission staff,
that questionable or corrupt payments or questionable or corrupt
transfers of value may have been offered, promised, paid, or
authorized by Respondent, or any entity or person acting on
behalf of Respondent, or that related false books and records
have been maintained, Respondent shall promptly report such
conduct to the Commission staff. During this two-year period,
Respondent shall: (1) conduct an initial review and submit an
initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two follow-up
reviews and reports, as described below:
a. Respondent shall submit to the Commission staff a
written report within 180 calendar days of the entry of this
Order s e t t i n g forth a complete description of its Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and anti-corruption related
remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably
designed to improve the policies and procedures of
Respondent for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and
other applicable anticorruption laws, and the parameters of
the subsequent reviews (the "Initial Report"). The Initial
Report shall be transmitted to Charles Cain, Deputy Unit
Chief, FCPA Unit, Division of Enforcement, United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, 1 0 0 F St NE,
Washington, DC 20549. Respondent may extend the time
period for issuance of the Initial Report with prior written
approval of the Commission staff.
b. Respondent shall undertake at least two follow-up reviews,

incorporating any comments provided by the Commission
staff on the previous report, to further monitor and assess
whether the policies and procedures of Respondent are
reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the
FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws (the
"Follow-up Reports").
c. The first Follow-up Report shall be completed by no later

7

than 270 days after the Initial Report. The second Followup Report shall be completed by no later than 450 days
after the completion of the Initial Report. Respondent may
extend the time period for issuance of the Follow-up
Reports with prior written approval of the Commission
staff.
d. The periodic reviews and reports submitted by Respondent

will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and
competitive business information. Public disclosure of the
reports could discourage cooperation, impede pending or
potential government investigations and thus undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons,
among others, the reports and the contents thereof are
intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except (a)
pursuant to court order, (b) as agreed by the parties in
writing, (c) to the extent that the Commission staff
determines in its sole discretion that disclosure would be in
furtherance of the Commission's discharge of its duties and
responsibilities, or (d) is otherwise required by law.
Certify, in writing, compliance with the undertaking(s)
set forth above. The certification shall identify the undertaking(s)
provide written evidence of compliance in the form of a
narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate
compliance. The Commission staff may make reasonable
requests for further evidence of compliance, and Respondent
agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and supporting
materials shall be submitted to Charles Cain, Deputy Unit Chief,
FCPA Unit, with a copy to the Office of the Chief Counsel of the
Enforcement Division, no later than sixty (60) days from the date
of the completion of the undertakings.
