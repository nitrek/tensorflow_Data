File Reference No. S7-15-16
Re: SEC Release Nos. 33-10110; 34-78310, Disclosure Update and Simplification
Dear Mr. Fields:
Deloitte & Touche LLP appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC” or the “Commission”) proposed rule Disclosure Update
and Simplification (the “proposing release”) as well as the Commission’s broader efforts to
improve the disclosure regime for the benefit of companies and investors.
The body of this letter contains our overall observations on the proposing release that we
believe the Commission should consider as it moves forward with its disclosure effectiveness
initiative. We have also included two appendixes that provide input on some of the specific
amendments, deletions, and potential referrals to the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) addressed in the proposing release as well as some additional requirements for
which we believe U.S. GAAP may similarly overlap with SEC disclosure requirements. In
formulating our response to the proposing release, we have drawn on our direct experiences
with a large number of companies that file with the SEC. We have also drawn on our more
general observation of public company disclosure practices.
We support the Commission’s objective of improving its disclosure requirements to facilitate
the disclosure of information to investors while simplifying compliance efforts but without
significantly altering the total mix of information provided to investors. Similar to our
previous letters on the Commission’s disclosure effectiveness initiative, 1 we support the
Commission’s consideration of ways it might update the current disclosure regime to
facilitate timely, material disclosure by companies as well as investor access to that
information. We believe the most effective disclosures are clear, concise, and focused on
matters that are both material to investors and specific to the company.
Supporting an Effective Disclosure Regime
As the proposing release notes, an important step to minimize overlap and inconsistencies
between SEC disclosure requirements and those in U.S. GAAP is the coordination between
the Commission and the FASB as the designated private-sector accounting standard setter.
We support the Commission’s efforts to work with the FASB to solicit feedback on whether
See, for example, our letter dated November 23, 2015, in response to the Commission’s Request for Comment on
the Effectiveness of Financial Disclosures About Entities Other Than the Registrant and our letter dated July 15,
2016, in response to the Commission’s Concept Release Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation
S-K.

certain incremental requirements currently in the SEC’s rules should be incorporated into
U.S. GAAP. While in some instances we question whether the incremental disclosure
requirements discussed in the proposing release continue to provide relevant information to
investors, we generally support a broader consideration of the requirements through the
FASB’s transparent and public standard-setting process.
We recognize that, as a result of the FASB’s due process, referring the incremental
disclosure requirements to the FASB will not necessarily result in the incorporation of the
requirement into U.S. GAAP or could result in enhanced disclosures beyond the specific
referred disclosure requirement. Our expectation is that the FASB would consider these
referrals under its proposed disclosure framework 2 as well as in light of feedback of all
constituents, including input on whether the benefits of the disclosure outweigh the costs. If
the FASB ultimately does not incorporate an incremental disclosure requirement into U.S.
GAAP, we would encourage the SEC to carefully consider the FASB’s deliberations and the
feedback it received in determining whether to retain the requirement within the SEC’s
regulations.
There may be instances in which the Commission may determine it should retain disclosure
requirements that are similar, but not identical, to requirements in U.S. GAAP. We generally
believe that such instances should be limited (e.g., those involving forward-looking
information), and in those instances, the disclosure objective of the Commission
requirement should be clearly distinguished from that in U.S. GAAP. A clear disclosure
objective to distinguish the SEC requirements from those in U.S. GAAP may help to ensure
the disclosures provide incremental information to investors rather than duplicative
disclosure within the filing.
We also encourage the SEC staff to coordinate with the FASB going forward to ensure that
duplicative or overlapping disclosure is avoided as new accounting standards are developed
and the SEC disclosure regime is modernized. For example, the FASB’s recently issued
revenue recognition standard 3 provides significantly enhanced presentation and disclosure
requirements which, in some instances, may supersede, be redundant, or overlap with
current Commission requirements. 4 In addition, the FASB’s proposed Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) on income tax disclosures, 5 if finalized, would create new redundancies. We
believe investors and preparers would benefit from a regular review by the Commission of
its disclosure requirements to ensure its disclosure objectives are aligned with the FASB’s
updated requirements and to avoid any unnecessary uncertainty regarding compliance for
preparers and auditors.
Promoting a Principles-Based Disclosure Framework
In general, we believe a disclosure regime that rests on a principles-based framework that
encourages disclosures to help investors understand a company’s current circumstances and

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606).
4
For example, Regulation S-X, Rule 5-02.3(c), requires disclosure about long-term contracts; Rule 5-03(b)1(a)
requires a specific approach to disaggregation of revenue; and Regulation S-K, Item 101(c)(1)(viii), requires
disclosure of the dollar amount of backlog orders. These disclosures may be considered outdated or superseded by
the disclosure requirements in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With
Customers.

future prospects will be more adaptable over time than one that addresses changing market
demands by adopting prescriptive requirements that risk becoming irrelevant or obsolete. A
principles-based framework allows for a registrant to exercise judgment in evaluating
various quantitative and qualitative factors when evaluating what disclosure would be
needed to comply with the disclosure objective. While prescriptive thresholds, such as bright
lines, may assist in the application of the disclosure, they generally do not take into account
whether a disclosure item would be material. Accordingly, we support the SEC’s proposal to
eliminate many of the bright-line disclosure requirements noted in the proposing release.
We also observe that this is consistent with the FASB’s proposed elimination of “at a
minimum provide” disclosures contained in U.S. GAAP. 6
Considering Location of Disclosures Within a Filing
The SEC is appropriately seeking feedback on whether the location of the disclosures would
affect the utility of the information provided to investors. While preparers and investors are
generally best able to address such questions, we observe that the emergence of electronic
data analysis and search tools has generally resulted in less emphasis being placed on the
sequential order of disclosures within the document.
While we do not believe the prominence of a disclosure is driven by the item or section in
which the disclosure is made, we do believe there are certain considerations relevant to
disclosures within the financial statements. For instance, when provided outside of the
financial statements, future-oriented information and other voluntary disclosure can provide
investors with additional insight into a registrant’s financial and operational activities.
However, as it relates to the notes to the financial statements, we generally believe that
future-oriented information should be limited to (1) estimates and assumptions used as
inputs to measurements and (2) existing plans and strategies related to matters under
management’s control. These limitations consider the benefits of providing future-oriented
information to investors against the costs of providing and auditing this information.
Consideration of Legal Proceedings
The discussion in the proposing release of the overlap of disclosure requirements about legal
proceedings in Item 103 of Regulation S-K and U.S. GAAP is a topic on which we believe
referral to the FASB may not be the most appropriate next step. Rather, we believe the
Commission should reconsider the disclosure objective of Item 103 to determine whether it
should make substantive changes to or eliminate its incremental disclosure requirements.
While we agree there is overlap between the requirements of Item 103 and the disclosure
provisions in ASC 450, 7 we note that the guidance within U.S. GAAP addresses loss
contingencies, of which legal proceedings are only one type, and that the disclosures in ASC
450 are based on an accounting model for when to recognize a loss contingency for which
the disclosure threshold is probable and reasonably estimable. Further, because the FASB
recently deliberated the adequacy of its disclosure requirements related to loss
contingencies, 8 we do not believe that referring the SEC’s incremental requirements to the

Whether Disclosures Are Material.

FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 450, Contingencies.
8
See FASB Proposed Accounting Standards Update Disclosure of Certain Loss Contingencies (July 10, 2010). The
FASB’s proposal would have included disclosures, for example, of the name of the court or agency in which the
proceedings are pending, the date instituted, the principal parties to the proceedings, and a description of the
factual basis alleged to underlie the proceedings. The proposal would also have required disclosure of certain
6

FASB for consideration would be fruitful. Rather, if the SEC believes there are elements of
Item 103 that are material to investors and not covered by ASC 450, it should consider
amending the guidance in Item 103 to provide a clear disclosure objective for those
requirements.
As noted in the 2013 SEC Staff Report on public company disclosure, 9 the SEC’s disclosure
requirements related to legal proceedings date back to 1935 and have remained
substantively unchanged since 1978. These requirements have not been reevaluated to
address, for instance, changes in business, economic, and legal environments or changes in
technology and access to information. In addition, some of the requirements also contain
bright lines for disclosure (e.g., $100,000 for environmental matters) that do not take into
account whether the disclosure item could be material and may obscure the disclosures with
immaterial information.
We also observe that the current ABA Statement Policy 10 and PCAOB auditing standards 11
reference the guidance in ASC 450. Therefore, if the Commission chooses to move forward
with the proposed integration of the requirements in Item 103 into ASC 450 as outlined in
the proposing release, we believe the ABA Statement Policy and PCAOB auditing standards
would need to be reevaluated and may need to be revised to incorporate the broader
spectrum of disclosures.
Overview of Appendixes
As noted above, included with this letter are two appendixes that provide input on some of
the specific amendments, deletions, and potential referrals to the FASB. Appendix A
includes our observations on the proposed amendments. Appendix B includes some
additional requirements not referenced in the proposing release that we believe overlap with
U.S. GAAP and could be considered for potential deletion or incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

Observations
We support the proposed deletion and agree that the disclosure

Further, we do not believe the disclosure requirements for
material nonrecurring reinsurance transactions should be
referred to the FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP
because nonrecurring reinsurance transactions are already
sufficiently covered by the disclosure requirements in ASC 94420-50-3. 12
We support the proposed deletion and agree that the disclosure

With respect to the status of long-term contracts and changes
in capitalization, we believe the principle outlined in the first

capture disclosure of material changes in long-term contracts
and changes in capitalization.

10. Interim Financial

We support the proposed deletion. However, we observe the
proposing release indicates that smaller reporting companies
are currently required to file pro forma financial information for
significant disposed businesses under Regulation S-X, Rule 805, on Item 9.01 of Form 8-K. We understand there may be
diversity in practice as the current text of Rule 8-05 only refers
to significant acquisitions and does not specifically refer to
dispositions. For Item 9.01 of Form 8-K to sufficiently
substitute the disclosure requirements in Rule 8-03(b)(4), Rule
8-05 could be amended to encompass significant dispositions.

12
13

In addition to the guidance in ASC 805, 13 we observe that
Article 11 requires disclosure of pro forma financial information
for a significant business combination during interim periods.
See Appendix B for our recommendation that the Commission
work with the FASB to align the pro forma requirements in U.S.
GAAP and Article 11, thereby further reducing overlapping
disclosure requirements between Regulation S-X and U.S.
GAAP.

We support the proposed deletion and agree that the disclosure

We also encourage the SEC to consider whether the
requirement in Regulation S-X, Rule 3-03(e), to provide
segment disclosures for each year an audited financial
statement is required is necessary, given that ASC 280 14
requires segment information for each period for which an

17. Equity
Compensation Plans

We generally support the proposed deletion but recommend
that the incremental disclosure of “any formula for calculating
the number of securities available for issuance under the plan”
be referred to the FASB for the potential incorporation into U.S.
GAAP. This information might be useful to investors, if
material. While ASC 718 16 does provide a “general” disclosure
objective that may imply that this information should be
disclosed, in our experience such disclosure is not likely to
occur without further clarification of how the general disclosure
objective applies to formulas for calculating the number of
securities to be awarded.

18. Ratio of Earnings to

We support the proposed deletion of the ratio of earnings to
fixed charges. However, we observe that the staff’s analysis
does not address the fact that the requirement for the pro
forma ratio would be removed. Information on a pro forma
basis may not be as readily available and, therefore, the pro
forma ratio may be more difficult for investors to independently
calculate without a specific requirement. While we question
whether the pro forma ratio is providing material information to
investors, we would suggest the staff consider feedback from
investors about the continued utility of the disclosure.

3. Discount on Shares

Observations
While we support referring the requirement to the FASB for
potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP, we question whether
such disclosure provides relevant information to investors. For
instance:
• Stock issue costs within equity do not amortize and, thus,
the ongoing relevance of such information may be limited.
• In the period of issuance, the statement of cash flows would
require separate presentation of such costs in the financing
section.
• Other discounts to par or stated value are likely captured by
other disclosure requirements (e.g., see Preferred Shares
discussion in the proposing release).

7. Income Tax
Disclosures

While we support referring the disclosure requirements to the
FASB for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP, we observe
that the FASB’s proposed income tax ASU, if finalized, would
incorporate many of the SEC’s income tax disclosures into ASC
740. 18 We encourage the Commission to work with the FASB as
it redeliberates the proposed income tax ASU to (1) understand
the feedback received and (2) evaluate whether any of the
requirements from Rule 4-08(h) not incorporated into the final
ASU continue to provide relevant information to investors.

13. Products and

We support referring the disclosure requirement to the FASB
for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.
If the FASB elects to consider the disclosure, we would
encourage the FASB to consider whether the disclosure
objective in ASC 280-10-50-40 is clear and that any
incremental disclosure requirements be consistent with the
disclosure objective. For instance, while ASC 280 requires
entities to report revenues from products and services or each
group of similar products and services, it does not provide a
framework for evaluating the level of disaggregation for such
disclosures or what would constitute “similar products and
services.”

14. Major Customers

We support referring the disclosure requirement to the FASB
for potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.
If the FASB elects to consider the disclosure requirement, we
would encourage the FASB to consider whether the disclosure
objective in ASC 280-10-50-42 could be clarified and whether
the current requirements, as well as any incremental
disclosures, are consistent with the disclosure objective. For
instance, if the disclosure objective is to provide information on
concentration risk because of the reliance on a few major
customers, this could be clarified. Clarifying the objective of
these disclosures may help the FASB to evaluate, for instance,
whether the 10 percent threshold for disclosure or the naming
of the major customer would be consistent with the disclosure
objective.

Topic
Foreign Currency —
Regulation S-X, Rule 320

Observations
In addition to the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X,
Rule 3-20, we believe the other sentences of Rule 3-20(d) are
also redundant with ASC 830 19 and could be eliminated.
• The first sentence of Rule 3-20(d) states that “the issuer
shall measure separately its own transactions” and the
transactions of its consolidated operations using the currency
of the particular economic environment in which it conducts
business. We believe this is redundant with the guidance in
ASC 830-10-45-2.
• The second sentence of Rule 3-20(d) states that (1) assets
and liabilities are translated at the current rates; (2) the
income statement is at the rate in effect when each
transaction occurs or, if appropriate, a weighted average
during the period; and (3) the effects of translation are
recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment. We
believe this sentence is also redundant with the requirements
under ASC 830-30-45-3 and ASC 830-10-55-10,
respectively.
Therefore, we recommend the SEC also consider removing the
first and second sentences of Rule 3-20(d).

Consolidation — Rule
3A-02

19

In addition to the proposed amendments to Article 3A, we
observe that Rule 3A-02(a) has been retained, which relates to
when registrants should consolidate entities. This portion of
Article 3A largely overlaps with ASC 810. We therefore
encourage the staff to consider whether the retained guidance
in Article 3A continues to be necessary in light of the guidance
provided in ASC 810.

Observations

Rule 4-08

In reviewing the proposing release, we observe that that Rule
4-08 provides requirements for General Notes to the Financial
Statements. Further, if finalized as proposed, the only
requirements that would remain in Rule 4-08 would relate to
(1) restrictions which limit the payment of dividends and (2)
summarized financial information of subsidiaries not
consolidated and 50 percent or less owned persons. As noted
above, we support the Commission’s efforts to minimize
overlap between its disclosure requirements and those in U.S.
GAAP and that U.S. GAAP broadly provides guidance on notes
to the financial statements. Therefore, we would encourage the
SEC to consider opportunities for further integration of the
remaining requirements in Rule 4-08, either within other
requirements of the SEC or be referred to the FASB for
potential incorporation into U.S. GAAP.

Additional areas of
overlap

We reiterate the following observations previously provided to
the SEC in response to its disclosure initiative efforts.
As noted in our letter dated November 23, 2015, in response to
the Commission’s Request for Comment on the Effectiveness of
Financial Disclosures About Entities Other Than the Registrant,
we encourage the Commission to work with the FASB to align
the form and content of pro forma information.
As noted in our letter dated July 15, 2016, in response to the
Commission’s Concept Release Business and Financial
Disclosure Required by Regulation S-K, we observe that the
following requirements may overlap with U.S. GAAP:
•
•
•
•
•

Item 303 — Table of Contractual Obligations.
Preferability Letters.
Item 304 — Market Risk Disclosures.
Industry Guide 3 — Statistical Disclosure by Bank
Holding Companies.
Industry Guide 6 — Disclosures Concerning Unpaid
Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses of Property
Casualty Insurance Underwriters.
