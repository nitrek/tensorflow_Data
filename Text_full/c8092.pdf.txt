Introduction

Even in today’s challenging economic conditions, innovation as a means
for organizations to create and maintain a competitive advantage remains
a strategic imperative (Mahroum 2008). Organizations that are able to continually generate innovative products and services are better able to retain
their current customer base and develop a new customer base.
Unlike the traditional view of innovation as the activity performed by the
lone R&D scientist working in isolation, today’s organizations embrace the
ideas and insights of employees at all levels of the organization. For example,
Whirlpool credits their recent successful product innovations not to a couple
of departments, such as engineering or marketing. Instead, they contribute their success to the 61,000 employees who have the ability to contribute and develop product, service, or processes innovations (Business Week
2006).

Given the new organizational context for innovation, it is important to
understand how employees at all levels of the organization can be managed
to direct and align their behaviors to achieve innovative outcomes. For example, Annalee Saxenian, in her seminal work on organizational innovation, contrasts two traditional innovation hubs of America: Silicon Valley in
California and Route 128 surrounding Boston. Her work indicates that two
management practices, organizational structures and rewards, were critical
to accounting for diﬀerences in innovation output. Silicon Valley spawned
innovation through shared capitalism and the use of teams, while innovation
in the Boston corridor was stymied by bureaucratic top-down approaches
to organizational structure and rewards.
Likewise, in their book In the Company of Owners, Blasi, Kruse, and
Bernstein (2003) examined in detail one innovation sector, the 100 largest
corporations that built, run, and sell on the Internet. They highlight the
major role that shared capitalism practices in combination with a participative culture can make in promoting organizational innovation.
Recognizing the importance of innovation for today’s organizations, this
study will examine the role shared capitalism and high performance work
policies play as a means to achieve innovation outcomes. Additionally, we
will examine a process mechanism, employee alignment, as one way in which
shared capitalism and high performance work policies impact innovation
outcomes.

Literature Review
Can Shared Capitalism Promote Innovation?

Despite the numerous studies on performance eﬀects of shared capitalism, there are only a few studies that discuss or examine the importance of
shared capitalism in achieving product, service, or process innovations.
Gamble (2000) finds reduced R&D expenditures in firms where Employee
Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) own larger blocks of stock and argues
that this reflects management entrenchment and managerial risk aversion;
in contrast, Kruse (1996) finds that R&D expenditures are a strong predictor of the use of a profit-sharing plan, and Sesil et al. (2002) find positive
eﬀects of broad-based stock options in high technology knowledge-based
industries, noting that “for firms, in which new product development is crucial for success, such as in many knowledge-based industries, broad-based
stock options can reduce the agency problem, resulting in greater output”
(276). Most recently, and supporting Sesil et al.’s perspective, Lerner and
Wulf (2006), using a sample of 300 publicly-traded R&D centralized firms,
found that the compensation of corporate R&D heads had dramatically
shifted in the 1990s, with a heaver reliance on long-term incentives such as
stock options. They find long-term incentives are positively and significantly

associated with the number of patent filings, patents’ perceived value (patent
citations), and patent generality.
While research that examines the role of shared capitalism as a means to
achieve innovation outcomes is in its infancy, social and behavior psychologists have actively examined the impact of individual rewards on creative
behavior (Amabile 1988; Amabile and Gryskiewicz 1989; Deci and Ryan
1985; Eisenberger and Selbst 1994). Thus, we briefly present empirical evidence and theoretical perspectives from the social and behavioral schools
of psychology.
Social-cognitive psychologists assert that creative behavior has defining
characteristics that make it distinguishable from other human behavior; in
particular, creative behavior is dependent on employees’ intrinsic motivation
(Amabile 1988; Deci and Ryan 1985). Thus, the aim for social-cognitive
psychologists is to uncover the conditions that enhance employee’s intrinsic motivation. According to this line of reasoning, extrinsic rewards, such
as shared capitalism, will have a detrimental eﬀect on employee’s intrinsic
motivation and ultimately their creative behavior by directing employee’s
attention toward the reward itself over the task at hand.
In contrast, behavioral psychologists argue that the eﬀort needed to complete activities is an unpleasant sensation produced by repeated or intense
performance of any behavior. Reinforcements, such as rewards, are a means
by which organizations can reduce this unpleasant sensation. If an employee
is rewarded for putting in a large amount of eﬀort in an activity or behavior (for example, through shared capitalism) it reduces the adverse impact
of such behaviors and increases this behavior in the future. In eﬀect, reinforcements work to control employee’s creative behavior by decreasing the
unpleasant sensations associated with the cognitive eﬀort needed to perform
creativity.
Empirically, an abundance of studies in the past thirty years have been
conducted to understand if and under what conditions rewards enhance or
inhibit creative behavior, with contradictory results and conclusions. Recognizing the conflicting evidence, five meta-analyses aimed to bring cohesion
to the divergent results (Rummel and Feinberg 1988; Wiersma 1992, Tang
and Hall 1995; Cameron and Pierce 1994; Eisenberger and Cameron 1996;
Deci, Koesterner, and Ryan 1999). Of the five, the strongest support for the
Cognitive Evolution Theory comes from Deci, Koestner, and Ryan (1999),
who combined 128 studies to find that all tangible and intangible rewards
undermined intrinsic motivation. However, conclusions from Eisenberger
and Cameron’s (1996) extensive review indicate that: (a) the detrimental
eﬀects of rewards tend to occur in highly restricted, easily avoidable conditions; (b) mechanisms of instrumental and classical conditions are basic for
understanding the incremental and detrimental eﬀects of rewards on task
motivation; and (c) the positive eﬀects of rewards on performance are easily
attainable using procedures derived from behavioral theory.

228

Taken together, past theory and empirical work on creativity and rewards
has failed to provide an understanding of how best, if at all, to reward
employees to achieve creative behavior. Additionally, the application of this
research to organizational setting is restricted. First, the majority of studies
in this field have been conducted outside of organizations and relied heavily
on schoolchildren, making the generalizability of these findings limited. Second, organizations are increasingly employing group/team or organizational
incentives over individual incentives as a means to encourage cooperation
and alignment (Blasi and Kruse 2006). Thus, studies examining individual
incentives provide only a limited understanding of the full range of workplace incentives. Third, the sample sizes of the aforementioned studies are
generally small. For example, of the 128 studies examined in Deci, Koestner, and Ryan’s (1999) meta-analysis the largest sample was 249 employees,
with the majority of sample sizes well under 100 employees. While significant eﬀects can often be detected with these sample sizes (depending on the
study design), a contribution of this study to the current literature is the
large sample size obtained in an organizational setting (more than 25,000
employees in hundreds of work sites) with data on several types of workplace incentives.
7.2.2

Can Employment Practices Promote Innovation?

In contrast to the limited research on organizational incentives, innovation management scholars have actively researched individual human
resource management policies that impact innovation outcomes, including
job design (Hackman and Oldham 1980), selection (Woodman, Sawyer, and
Griﬃn 1993; Iansiti 1995), training (Wheatley, Anthony, and Maddox 1991),
and performance management (Mehr and Schaver 1996). Mumford (2000)
reviews an extensive body of literature examining specific human resource
management policies that support innovation and creativity. Building on
this review, the following sections summarize the management policies that
are supportive of innovation and creativity in organizations.
Selection
The consistent development of innovative products, services, and processes requires a workforce with the necessary breadth and depth of technical skills (Amabile and Gryskiewicz 1989; Iansiti 1995), in combination
with a constant flow of new ideas and experience (Bontis, Crossan, and Hulland 2002; Jackson and Schuler 2002). Staﬃng practices work as a means
to ensure a consistent flow of technical skills, by identifying and selecting applicants who will add new ideas and experience to the organization.
Researchers have examined the employee characteristics supportive of innovation: divergent thinking (Guilford 1950), technical expertise (Amabile and
Gryskiewicz 1989; Mumford 2000), and certain personality characteristics
(Amabile 1988; King 1990).

Who Has a Better Idea?

Training and Job Rotation
Maintaining employees’ current knowledge and skills, while developing
new knowledge and skills, is essential to innovative performance (Cohen
and Leventhal 1990; Mumford 2000). Two HR policies vital to maintaining
and developing employees to achieve innovative outcomes are training and
development (Leonard-Barton 1992). A firm’s potential to be innovative and
creative is enhanced as the new knowledge and abilities are incorporated into
the organization (Jackson and Schuler 2002; Cohen and Leventhal 1990).
Thus, past research has noted the importance of sabbaticals, subtracting
assignments, self-study programs, conferences, external courses, and job
rotations as important mechanisms to enhance an organization’s ability to
innovate (Dougherty 1992; Mumford 2000; Christensen and Raynor 2003;
Amabile 1983).
Performance Management
Performance evaluations have been both negatively and positively associated with individual innovation and creativity (Amabile 1979; Shalley
1995). For instance, Amabile (1979) found that individuals who expected
their artistic task to be externally evaluated had significantly lower levels
of creativity on the task than individuals not being externally evaluated. In
contrast, Shalley (1995) conducted two studies with samples of undergraduate students; the results of both studies indicate that expecting an evaluation
is not necessarily harmful to people’s creativity. The variance in empirical
evidence may be explained by the type of performance evaluation. Performance appraisals should not have specific performance objectives or diﬃcult
production outcomes (Mumford 2000; Oldham 2003). Instead, appraisals
are most conducive to creativity when they consist of broadly defined goals
and objectives that allow employees flexibility as to what the final outcome
will be (Mumford 2000).
Rewards (Recognition)
As mentioned before, evidence for the impact of individual rewards on
creative behavior is mixed. However, for those researchers who support
the role of rewards or recognition (both intrinsic and extrinsic) for creativity, other questions remain, such as the skills, behaviors, or outcomes that
should be rewarded. For instance, Henderson and Cockburn (1994) in their
investigation of the pharmaceutical industry suggest firms that promote
researchers according to their standing in the scientific community enjoyed
higher productivity levels. Additionally, rewards should not be withheld
from employees who step out of established roles or fail to achieve desired
outcomes. Instead, a better approach is to reward employees for their eﬀort
or progress toward an innovation/creative goal or objective (Mumford 2000).
Finally, Dougherty (1992), after extensive field research on product devel-

230

Erika E. Harden, Douglas L. Kruse, and Joseph R. Blasi

opment, suggests that rewards should be provided for the development of
expertise, skills, and competencies. Thus, beyond compensation, other forms
or rewards and recognition can be used to enhance creative behavior.
Employee Involvement
Empowering employees and utilizing teams are two mechanisms through
which employee participation can enhance organizational innovation
(Mumford 2000). Christensen and Raynor (2003) in a recent book argue
that successful product innovation requires big decisions to be driven down
to the lowest level. They reason that decisions about products, services, and
processes innovations should be made on the spot, instead of waiting for
a response from further up in the organization. Additionally, Jelinek and
Schoonhoven (1990) note that employee involvement helps employees to
see their part in the innovation process while creating a shared responsibility in the outcome. Supporting this, Leonard-Barton (1992), in her study
of innovative projects groups, found that empowerment is most important
for innovative capabilities. Those project teams who were empowered felt
“exhilarated by the challenges they had created” (117).
Teamwork
The use of team-based work is a popular mechanism for enhancing innovation. Innovations involve diﬀerent types of tasks and processes, and thus
are rarely the creation of one individual or a single department. Team-based
work has been argued to increase the speed of product innovation (Hayes,
Wheelwright, and Clark 1988), the number of innovations (Dougherty 1992),
and the value of the innovation (Ven de Ven 1986). For example, Clark and
Fujimoto (1991) conducted a qualitative study where they found that the
use of cross-functional teams is central to the product development process. Additionally, eﬀective product development was not housed in solely
specialized R&D activities; instead, the most eﬀective product development
came from creating linkages between various departments within the organization. Thus, the use of teams enhances product innovation through the
diversity of knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal 1990).
Systems Perspective
While the aforementioned policies appear to be valuable for innovation,
recent work recognizes the importance of examining Human Resource
Management (HRM) policies as a bundle or system of policies as opposed to
individual policies in isolation (MacDuﬃe 1995; Huselid 1995; Ichniowski
et al. 1996; Blasi and Kruse 2006). A central tenet of the systems approach
is that organizations should create a high degree of internal consistency
among their HRM policies (Baird and Meshoulam 1988). Systems of HRM
policies that are designed to utilize the knowledge and skills of the workforce
have been labeled as “high performance,” “high involvement,” “high commitment,” “HR sophistication,” and “HR investment.”

Who Has a Better Idea?

231

Interestingly, there is wide disagreement on what policies constitute “high
performance.” A recent review by Lepak et al. (2006) highlights the disparate and at times conflicting policies making up high performance systems.
While disagreement remains over the policies represented in a “high performance” work system, it is generally agreed that a high performance work
system (HPWS) can impact various organizational outcomes. Collectively,
twenty years of cumulative research has found HPWS are strongly associated with outcomes including HRM outcomes (i.e., turnover, absenteeism,
job satisfaction); organizational outcomes (i.e., productivity, quality, service); financial accounting outcomes (i.e., ROA, profitability); and capital
market outcomes (i.e., stock price, growth, returns) (Combs et al. 2006;
Becker and Huselid 2006).1
As previously noted employee knowledge and skills are critical to achieving innovation outcomes. Thus, it is surprising that the systems approach
has had limited application to innovation outcomes. Studies of high performance workplace bundles have so far tended to focus on operational or
financial performance without measures of innovation. Given the limited
empirical evidence, our study seeks to fill this gap by examining the impact
of HPWS on innovation outcomes.
Taken together, the limited empirical work examining the eﬀects of shared
capitalism and HPWS on innovation outcomes represents a gap in the literature that needs to be addressed. Our interest is to examine the relationship
between shared capitalism, HPWS, and innovative outcomes, in addition to
the intervening mechanisms that uncover how these relationships occur. The
following theory and hypotheses development provides the rationale for why
we expect these relationships to occur.
7.3

Theory and Hypotheses

Laﬀont and Martimort (2002) describe the principal-agent problem as a
fundamental one for the firm: “Indeed, for various reasons the owner of the
firm must delegate several tasks to the members of the firm. This necessity
raises the problem of managing information flows within the firm. . . . The
starting point of incentive theory corresponds to the problem of delegating
a task to an agent with private information” (2002, 2–3). For the purposes
of this article, one can think of the problem of innovation as how to get the
members of the firm interested in working alone or together to use their
information to achieve innovation that will profit the owner of the firm.
They cite the early work of both Chester Barnard and Charles Babbage in
defining the relevance of shared capitalism for the agency problem. For example, Babbage wrote:
1. Despite these positive performance outcomes, bundles of high performance workplace
policies appear to have very low incidence among firms (Blasi and Kruse 2006). See Ichniowski
et al. (1996) regarding the barriers to adoption of high performance policies.

232

Erika E. Harden, Douglas L. Kruse, and Joseph R. Blasi

“The general principles on which the proposed system is founded, are:
1. That a considerable part of the wages received by each person should
depend on the profits made by the establishment; and 2. That every person
(our emphasis) connected with it should derive more advantage from applying any improvement he might discover than he could by any other course.”
(Laﬀont and Martimort 2002, 11 [quoting Babbage 1989, vol 8, 177])
One can readily see that Babbage is specifically addressing both shared capitalism and innovation (“any improvement”). Barnard’s views were more
explicit and more extreme when he wrote:
“An essential element of organizations is the willingness of persons to
contribute their individual eﬀorts to the cooperative system. . . . Inadequate incentives mean dissolution, or changes in organizational purpose,
or failure to cooperate. Hence in all sorts of organizations the aﬀording
of adequate incentives becomes the most definitely emphasized task in
their existence. It is probably in this aspect of executive work that failure
is most pronounced.” (Laﬀont and Martimort 2002, 12 [quoting Barnard
1938, 139])
The research on the eﬀect of individual incentives on innovation is mixed,
as previously noted, while the research on teamwork generally shows it to
be positively related to innovation eﬀorts. One of the purposes of shared
capitalism plans is to enhance teamwork by creating greater cooperation
and information sharing among co-workers, and between workers and
supervisors/managers. Based on this our first two hypotheses are:
HYPOTHESIS ONE: Shared capitalism incentives are associated with a
workplace culture that is supportive of innovation eﬀorts.
HYPOTHESIS TWO: Shared capitalism incentives are associated with a
greater willingness of employees to report innovative ideas.
In line with our interest in exploring the impact of employment culture—
specifically high performance work systems—on innovation, past theorists
have given some thought to the role of organization design as a complement
to incentives.
For example, Barnard virtually defined the high performance work system
when he wrote about what Laﬀont and Mortimort call “nonmonetary incentives” as including: “personal nonmaterial opportunities; ideal benefactions; . . . associational attractiveness; adaptation of conditions to habitual
methods and attitudes; opportunity of enlarged participation; [and] the condition of communion.” Barnard stressed that what we think of as financial
incentives had to be “reinforced by other incentives,” specifically referring to
these organizational components (Laﬀont and Martimort 2002, 12 [quoting
Barnard 1938, 142]).
In a modern economy where workers are often not manipulating physical
objects, much of work itself is inside the mind of the worker and is about

Who Has a Better Idea?

233

collecting, communicating, sharing, manipulating, and combining information in novel and innovative ways. Physical monitoring by supervisors as a
solution to the agency problem is very hard in these environments. Many of
the features of high performance work systems that theorists like Huselid
have defined as essential to innovations are based on information. A number
of these high performance policies can create conditions that favor innovation: good wages and benefits can produce high commitment and loyalty;
selective recruitment can get the most informed and curious persons into
an organization; training can upgrade their informational and cooperative
skills; teamwork and job rotation can break down “rigid silos” between
them; and employee involvement can bring them closer to the information
that both customers and management possess. This is not dissimilar from the
classic agency theory notion of the “revelation principle” in which societies
have a problem in how to get “informed agents (to) reveal private information to a planner who recommends actions” (Laﬀont and Martimort 2002,
26–7). One can conceive of a high performance work system as a workplace
mechanism to make the revelation principle work.
Based on the theory and research linking high performance work systems
to organizational performance, we expect that an HPWS will also contribute
to an innovative culture and activity, and will complement shared capitalism
plans. Our next four hypotheses are:
HYPOTHESIS THREE: High performance work systems are associated with
a workplace culture that is supportive of innovation eﬀorts.
HYPOTHESIS FOUR: High performance work systems are associated with a
greater willingness of employees to report innovative ideas.
HYPOTHESIS FIVE: Shared capitalism plans have a positive interaction with
high performance work systems in predicting a workplace culture that is supportive of innovation eﬀorts.
HYPOTHESIS SIX: Shared capitalism plans have a positive interaction with
high performance work systems in predicting willingness of employees to report
innovative ideas.
Finally, we expect that if the aforementioned eﬀects exist, they operate in
part through greater alignment of employees with the company’s strategy.
Our final two hypotheses are:
HYPOTHESIS SEVEN: Individual alignment with company strategy mediates
the relationship of shared capitalism and high performance work systems to a
workplace culture that is supportive of innovation eﬀorts.
HYPOTHESIS EIGHT: Individual alignment with company strategy mediates
the relationship of shared capitalism and high performance work systems to
the willingness of employees to report innovative ideas.

Data and Methods
Data Set

This chapter uses employee surveys from one large company in the NBER
data set (described in “Studying Shared Capitalism” in the introduction to
this volume). Unique to this company, the survey asked a series of questions
about organizational innovation. The survey was administered in 2006 via
paper and web-based administration in one firm. A total of 27,825 usable
surveys were returned for a response rate of 67.3 percent. Missing data for
one or more of the variables reduced the sample to 25,014 respondents who
had complete data for all of the variables.
7.4.2

Measures

Human Resource Management
The 5-P model (Schuler 1992) identifies the various ways in which HRM
activities can be examined: as philosophies, policies, programs, practices, or
processes. This study will examine HRM policies and practices.
Policies, as defined here, are the broadly defined HRM activities. For example, performance-based pay is a broadly defined measure of an HRM
activity, but it can be implemented through a number of diﬀerent practices. By assessing HRM policies, a researcher is able to cast a wide net in
understanding the HRM activities within the organization. However, HRM
policies limit the detailed information on what specific practices make up
a policy.
Alternatively, HRM practices are the specific HRM activities that are
employed to implement an HRM policy. For example, under the policy
of pay-for-performance there are diﬀerent HRM practices that can be
employed to achieve the pay-for-performance policy. Assessing specific
HRM practices provides a level of detail missed by HRM policies. In this
study, the primary interest is the impact of shared capitalism, and its various forms, as a means to achieve innovation outcomes. Thus, we examine
the individual shared capitalism practices and a combined shared capitalism index that can be utilized to achieve innovation outcomes, discussed in
more detail following.
We examine two systems of HRM policies. First, we analyze a high performance work system (HPWS), which includes employee participation,
training, job rotation or cross-training, selection, job security, and information sharing. The majority of questions (listed in appendix A) ask the
respondent to report if she or he is covered by this policy. Second, a high
performance work system measure was included that asked employees their
perceptions of the eﬀectiveness of each high performance policy for their
work area or team. This measure thus localizes and focuses the estimation

Who Has a Better Idea?

235

of the high performance practices within the group of workers immediately
surrounding the respondent. This is notable, since most HRM scholars do
not bring high performance work literature down to the lowest level of the
organization (notable exceptions include Allen, Shore, and Griﬃth [2003]
and Zacharatos, Barling, and Iverson [2005]). In particular, this index measures team eﬀectiveness in the following areas: selection, performance goals,
training, sharing information, meeting with customers, and rewards. This
human resource policy index is referred to as high performance work systemteam (HPWST).
Shared Capitalism
As noted previously, shared capitalism appears in a variety of forms. This
study examines profit/gain sharing, employee ownership, and stock options.
Profit sharing and gain sharing are combined here because this firm has
one program combining elements of each: bonus payments are based both
on company-wide return on net assets, and on division performance. In
addition, we examine the eﬀects of individual incentives. For each incentive
plan, the presence of the incentive (yes/no) and the extensiveness of the
incentive (as a percent of total fixed annual pay) are examined. Additionally, a thermometer-style index of shared capitalism was constructed. The
index, described in appendix B, reflects both whether workers have diﬀerent
shared capitalism programs and whether these programs represent a high
percentage of the worker’s fixed annual pay.
Workplace Outcomes
After consulting with the research literature, two comprehensive measures of innovation were designed. The first is focused on measuring aspects
of a firm’s culture for innovation. According to organizational theory on
creativity, employees’ innovative behavior can be influenced by the environment or culture an employee encounters (Amabile 1988). Thus, an important outcome to understand is a culture that supports innovative behavior.
An extensive review of the literature on cultures that support innovation
revealed consistent characteristics across cultures that support innovation.
For example, companies can promote innovation by fostering an environment that encourages employees to voice ideas or suggestions, provides the
resources to further develop ideas, and recognizes the eﬀorts of employees
who do try to innovate (Scott and Bruce 1994). Given the past literature,
our study examines the characteristics listed previously. The specific items
for the culture of innovation scale are listed in appendix A.
The second measure focuses on individual employee’s willingness to marshal their innovative ideas and do something about it. Innovative behavior is
characterized by a multistage process, with diﬀerent activities or behaviours
necessary at each stage (Scott and Bruce 1994). In this study, we examine
an employee’s ability and willingness to generate ideas, as opposed to their

236

Erika E. Harden, Douglas L. Kruse, and Joseph R. Blasi

actual innovative behavior. Specific items developed to assess employee willingness to innovate are listed in appendix A.
Finally, we examine the extent to which employees are aligned with the
goals and objectives of the organization (Huselid, Becker, and Beatty 2005).
Aligning employees with organizational goals and objectives has become an
increasingly important task; especially in organizations where employees’
knowledge and skills play a critical role in achieving strategic objectives,
such as innovation. It is through alignment that employees are aware of
how they can contribute to achieving organizational objectives. Much of
the work arguing for the importance of aligning employees behind shared
goals and objectives has been at a conceptual level (Wright and McMahan
1992; Boswell and Wright 2002). Thus, this research contributes to the current literature by going beyond the importance of aligning HRM policies to
organizational strategy (Huselid 1995). It looks deeper into the organization
for how employees, the individuals who implement strategic objectives, recognize and agree with them. Our interest is to examine if and to what extent
shared capitalism and high performance work policies are eﬀective means to
align a workforce behind organizational objectives. Our measure combines
four items representing employee understanding and agreement with the
company strategy, and employee views of whether the company provides
the resources and culture necessary to implement that strategy.2

Empirical Results
Culture for Innovation

Table 7.1 summarizes the empirical results on the relationship between
shared capitalism, high performance work policies, and employees’ perception of a culture for innovation.
Shared Capitalism
In models (1), (3), and (5) we examine the impact of the shared capitalism index on employees’ perception of a culture for innovation. The results
reveal that the shared capitalism index is positively related to employees’
perception of a culture for innovation (model [1]). The shared capitalism
index remains positively related when HPWST is added to the equation
(model [5]), but not when HPWS is added (model [3]), so there is only partial
support for hypothesis one.
When the shared capitalism practices are broken out to examine their
individual impact on employees’ perceptions of a culture for innovation
(models [2], [4], and [6]), two shared capitalism practices are consistently
related to employees’ perceptions of a culture for innovation: the percentage
2. We thank Mark Huselid for insightful comments and suggestions on developing the
employee alignment scale.

of base pay going to profit/gain sharing, and owning company stock. These
results stay strong when adding in either the HPWS or HPWST measure,
supporting hypothesis one for these two pay practices.
High Performance Work Policies
A very consistent result in models (3) through (6) is the strong positive
association between human resource management policies and employees’ perceptions of a culture for innovation. An examination of adjusted
R2 with and without the human resource practices indicates that these practices greatly increase our ability to account for what might create a culture
for innovation. These results support hypothesis three and underline the
important role high performance policies have in creating and supporting
a culture for innovation where employees are encouraged to innovate, are
rewarded for this, and are provided the resources to do so.
7.5.2

Innovative Ideas

Table 7.2 summaries the empirical results on the relationship between
shared capitalism, high performance work policies, and employees’ willingness and ability to innovate.
Shared Capitalism
In models (1), (3), and (5) we report the impact of the shared capitalism
index on employees’ willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas
to the organization. The results, consistent with those reported for a culture for innovation, find that those employees who reported higher levels
of shared capitalism also reported higher willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas to the organization. These results remained significant
after including measures of high performance work policies, supporting
hypothesis two.
When the shared capitalism policies are broken out in models (2), (4), and
(6), employee ownership is again a significant positive predictor of employees’ willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas to the organization.
Unlike the results for culture of innovation, however, profit/gain sharing as
a percent of pay is not a significant predictor, and in fact profit/gain sharing
eligibility is a negative predictor in two of the models. These latter results
contrast strikingly with the positive results for employee ownership, suggesting that profit sharing may focus workers toward short-term outcomes
and away from activities with a long-term payoﬀ, while employee ownership helps promote behavior like innovative activity that will have a longerterm payoﬀ.3 This is because profit sharing in the organization under study
3. This interpretation was supported by several company representatives at the conference
where this chapter was initially presented. One person noted that ROI, which stands for return
on investment, was sometimes referred to by employees as “repression of innovation” because
a focus on short-term profitability discourages investments in innovative activities that have a
longer-term payoﬀ.

specifically rewards employees for productivity and operational achievements (such as on-time customer delivery) of delivering current goods and
services, which the organization sees as part of its existing repertoire of
oﬀerings. Profit sharing is not, however, tied to ideas or prototypes for future
goods and services.
High Performance Work Policies
The impact of high performance work policies on employees’ willingness
and ability to contribute innovative ideas to the organization is reported in
models (3) through (6). The results, across all models, reveal a consistent and
significant positive relationship between both high performance work policy
indexes and employees’ willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas
to the organization. Given these results, support was provided for hypothesis
four. Taken together, these results can be interpreted to signify that the use of
high performance work policies is one way to increase employees’ willingness
and ability to contribute innovative ideas to an organization.
An interesting note is that in comparison to the HPWS impact on a culture for innovation, it appears that the HPWS impact is not as substantial
for willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas. We speculate that
an employee’s ability to contribute innovative ideas may be accounted for
by individual diﬀerences not captured in this study. For example, divergent
thinking (Guilford 1950), openness to new experience (Feist 1998), and
internal locus of control (Woodman and Schoenfeldt 1989) have all been
related to highly innovative or creative individuals.
7.5.3

Complementarities between Human Resource
Policies and Shared Capitalism

An important proposition of the systems perspective is that organizational outcomes will be enhanced to the extent that a firm’s human resource
management activities fit with and complement one another (Baird and
Meshoulam 1988). The underlying rationale is that the more strongly human
resources fit together, the more consistent are the signals communicated
to employees regarding the behaviors that are valued by the organization
(Becker and Huselid 1998). While fit can be tested using various statistical
techniques (Venkatraman 1989), we employ a fit-as-moderation hypothesis,
testing whether the impacts of shared capitalism on innovation outcomes are
dependent on the level of high performance work policies. Stated diﬀerently,
we expect that the impact of shared capitalism on employees’ perceptions of
a culture for innovation vary across levels of high performance work policies. To examine this, an interaction term was included in table 7.3 (models
[1] and [2]).
The results indicate that shared capitalism does interact positively and significantly with both HPWS and HPWST and provides support for hypothesis five. The fit between shared capitalism and HPWST was positively
related to employees’ perception of a culture for innovation. Likewise, the

interaction between shared capitalism and HPWS was positive and marginally significant. To further help with interpretation, the interaction results
are portrayed in figure 7.1 (using table 7.3, model [2]). As seen there, shared
capitalism has the most positive relationship to innovation culture when
HPWST is at high levels, with a mild positive relationship when HPWST is
at average levels. The relationship is negative when HPWST are at low levels,
indicating that employees may perceive the innovation culture poorly when
they are given the incentives, but not the tools, to make a diﬀerence—in
this case the shared capitalism may be perceived as primarily a shifting of
financial risk to employees.
There are very diﬀerent results, however, in predicting willingness or ability to innovate. As reported in table 7.3 (models [3] and [4]) we find that
while the base eﬀects are positive and significant, the interaction between
the shared capitalism index and high performance work practices is negative and significant for both HPWS and HPWST. These results indicate that
when employees are covered by high performance work practices, the impact
of shared capitalism policies on their willingness and ability to innovate for
the organization is reduced. Put another way, the positive base eﬀects and
negative interaction indicates that these two constructs may substitute for
each other: the base eﬀect shows that shared capitalism has a positive eﬀect
on innovative activity for those who are not covered by HPWS, but shared
capitalism has a much smaller or neutral eﬀect for those who are covered
by HPWS. An HPWS appears to provide a strong eﬀect on its own, perhaps
making unnecessary the addition of shared capitalism incentives.

242

Erika E. Harden, Douglas L. Kruse, and Joseph R. Blasi

To further help with interpretation, the interaction results are portrayed in
figure 7.2 (using table 7.3, model [4]). Shared capitalism has a strong positive
association with innovative ideas for workers with low values on HPWST,
and only a mild positive association when HPWST is at high levels. These
illustrate the point made before: high performance work policies and shared
capitalist incentives may act somewhat as substitutes here, with shared capitalism providing the strongest incentives for contributing ideas among those
who have not been encouraged to contribute ideas through high performance work policies.

Alignment

Table 7.4 summarizes the empirical results on the relationship between
shared capitalism, high performance work policies, and organizational
alignment.
Shared Capitalism
The results listed in models (1), (3), and (4) indicate that shared capitalism may play a significant and positive role in aligning employees behind
the goals and objectives of the organization. Even in the presence of high
performance work policies, shared capitalism continues to play a significant
and positive role in employee alignment. There are diﬀerent results when
interacting shared capitalism with the two HPWS measures: the base eﬀect
of shared capitalism stays strong and the interaction is insignificant in model
(3), while the opposite is true in model (6). It is therefore unclear whether
shared capitalism operates on its own or only in combination with HPWS
in aﬀecting alignment. The results of specific shared capitalism practices
on employee alignment are also not consistent between the models controlling for diﬀerent measures of HPWS. Stock option holding and profit/gain
sharing as a percent of pay are predictors when controlling for HPWS, while
profit/gain sharing eligibility and employee ownership as a percent of pay
are predictors when controlling for HPWST. It is noteworthy that individual
bonus eligibility (but not the bonus size) is a strong predictor of alignment,
possibly reflecting greater bonus eligibility among high-level managers (not
fully captured in the management level controls).
High Performance Work Policies
Consistent with the results for a culture for innovation and innovative
ideas, high performance work policies continue to have a strong impact in
models (1) to (6) of table 7.4. An interesting finding is the relative impact
of the HPWS versus the HPWST on alignment. The adjusted R-square for
the models with HPWST accounts for a greater amount of variance in the
alignment of employees. This result could indicate that the greater impact
on employee alignment is not when employees experience high performance policies (HPWS), but when they perceive these practices as eﬀective
(HPWST) in the context of their immediate local work group or team. This
finding suggests that the level of measurement of high performance work
practices is important.
Complementarities between Human Resource
Policies and Shared Capitalism
Once again, using interaction terms we examined the impact of the complementary relationship between human resource management policies
and shared capitalism on employee alignment. The only significant result is

reported in model (6). Here shared capitalism interacts with HPWST and
results in a positive eﬀect on employee alignment. This result confirms the
importance of ensuring that human resource policies and shared capitalism complement each other in order to achieve maximum benefits. Again,
it is interesting to note that the interaction with shared capitalism was only
significant with HPWST, which indicates the importance of perceived policy
eﬀectiveness in work groups over the mere presence of policies. It appears
that such practices need not only to be bundled together but need to be bundled together in a way that is seen as eﬀective within a local work group.
7.5.5

Mediating Role of Alignment

Across the results, a consistent finding is that HRM policies and shared
capitalism are related to employees’ perception of a culture for innovation
and employees’ willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas. However, it is not clear how HRM policies and shared capitalism impact these
outcomes (Becker and Gerhart 1996; Ostroﬀ and Bowen 2000). For instance,
management scholars have argued that HRM policies impact organizational
outcomes through organizational culture (Ostroﬀ and Bowen 2000), organizational commitment (Allen, Shore, and Griﬀeth 2003), and employee skills,
motivation, and opportunities (Lepak et al. 2006).
While the intervening mechanisms previously listed are plausible, our
interest is the impact HRM policies have in creating employee alignment.
To test for mediation, three models are run to test four conditions (Baron
and Kenny 1986). First, the independent variable (HRM policies or shared
capitalism index) must significantly impact innovation outcomes. Second,
the independent variable must significantly impact the mediator (alignment). Third, with the independent variable in the equation, alignment must
impact innovation outcomes. The fourth necessary condition is a decrease in
the coeﬃcient between the independent variable and innovation outcomes
as alignment is added. Using this technique it is possible to assess if the
coeﬃcient between the independent variable and the outcomes decreased
with alignment in the equation. The extent of reduction in the coeﬃcient
reveals how much of the relationship between the independent variable and
dependent is indirectly working through the mediator (alignment). Finally,
Sobel’s test is employed to ensure that the drop in the coeﬃcient is significantly diﬀerent from zero (Sobel 1982). Tables 7.5 and 7.6 report the results
of the test of mediation.
Shared Capitalism
The results in tables 7.5 and 7.6 reveal that alignment does partially mediate the relationship between shared capitalism and employee’s perception
of a culture for innovation. This is indicated by the reduction in the shared
capitalism coeﬃcient from model (4) to model (6), and a significant value
for Sobel’s test, in both tables. Combined, these results suggest that one

way in which shared capitalism impacts innovation outcomes is by aligning
the workforce behind the goals and strategic objectives of the organization. However, the shared capitalism coeﬃcient was not reduced to zero for
either outcome, implying other mechanisms are working between shared
capitalism and innovation outcomes. These findings indicate that the overall
corporate culture that binds employees together (understanding and agreeing with common goals, having the tools and involvement to advance those
goals, and believing the culture is right to achieve these goals) does play a
key role in determining how shared capitalism incentives relate to innovation, but that there still exists an independent incentive eﬀect from shared
capitalism. This is very similar to Barnard’s view concerning the need for a
package of monetary and nonmonetary incentives. The sense of common
enterprise that results from shared capitalism appears to impact the agency
problem by reinforcing a common culture among the members of the firm,
yet the pure incentive eﬀect of shared rewards themselves also appears to
focus the individual worker (similar to the findings in Freeman, Kruse, and
Blasi in chapter 2).
High Performance Work Policies
Also reported in tables 7.5 and 7.6 is the mediating role of alignment with
high performance work policies. Specifically, the analysis reveals that alignment partially mediates the relationship that HPWS (models [1] through [3])
and HPWST (Models [4] through [6]) have with employees’ perception of a
culture for innovation. A similar result is obtained in predicting and employees’ willingness and ability to contribute innovative ideas (table 7.6). These
results indicate that part of the eﬀect of high performance work policies
on innovation outcomes is through aligning the workforce behind shared
goals and objectives. However, since the high performance work system
coeﬃcients are not reduced to zero, high performance work policies also
impact the innovation outcomes through additional means.
7.6

Conclusion

The principal findings of this chapter are that shared capitalism and high
performance work policies aﬀect innovation outcomes through direct eﬀects,
interactions, and indirect eﬀects. The results of this study contribute to the
current literature on shared capitalism and human resource management
literature in a number of ways. First, empirical research on the importance
of rewards and compensation practices as a means to achieve innovation
outcomes is limited. This study adds to and extends the literature by examining multiple forms of shared capitalism and their impact on innovation
outcomes. We demonstrate these eﬀects in a population of adult workers
in a large sample of respondents in hundreds of work sites, which provides
several advantages in relation to past research. Additionally, we were able

Who Has a Better Idea?

249

to identify a possible mediating mechanism between shared capitalism and
innovation outcomes. Second, taking a systems perspective, we investigate
the impact of two systems of high performance work policies on innovation outcomes. While innovation management scholars have examined the
impact of individual human resource management practices on creativity or
innovation, a systems approach has, to our knowledge, never been published
(Harden 2006).
Organizations seeking to develop a culture of innovation could look to
this research as an answer for how this occurs. Specifically, our results reveal
that a culture for innovation can be developed and supported through the
use of shared capitalism and high performance work practices. We found
moderate support for the importance of pairing shared capitalism and high
performance work practices together to achieve the greatest impact on a culture for innovation. Additionally, shared capitalism and high performance
work practices work in part by aligning employees around the goals and
objectives of the organization.
As organizations increasingly depend on all employees to contribute innovative ideas to the organization, this research aims to address the role that
shared capitalism and high performance work policies play to achieve these
ends. The results of this study indicate that a means to promote employee
willingness and ability to contribute innovation ideas is the use of high performance work policies and shared capitalism, both of which had a strong
positive relationship with this outcome. However, an interesting finding of
this study is that the impact of shared capitalism on innovative ideas varies
by the level of high performance work policies the employee experiences in
his or her work group. And finally, the indirect eﬀect of high performance
work practices and shared capitalism on innovative ideas indicates that an
aligned employee is more willing and able to contribute innovative ideas to
the organization. Shared capitalism and high performance work practices
are one way to align an employee behind the goals and objectives of the
organization.
To the extent that innovation can be conceived as a principal-agent problem, we have demonstrated that a system of shared incentives and a shared
high performance employment culture at the lowest levels of organizations
is important to create both an innovative environment that is fertile ground
for innovative ideas, and the willingness to work on innovative ideas. Taken
together, these findings indicate that the overall corporate culture that binds
employees together does play a key role in determining how shared capitalism incentives relate to innovation, but there still exists an independent
incentive eﬀect from shared capitalism. The sense of common enterprise
that results from shared capitalism appears to impact the agency problem
by reinforcing a common culture among the members of the firm, yet the
pure incentive eﬀect of shared rewards themselves also appears to focus the
individual worker.

In summary, these findings confirm several of the main themes of agency
theory: that the principal-agent problem can be addressed by incentives,
and that agency conflicts respond to a cooperative culture between workers
that encourages mutual monitoring and opportunities to share information.
The results of this study make two unique and nuanced contributions to this
perspective: first, that it is the combination of shared incentives, cooperative
culture, and mutual monitoring that works best, and second, that high performance workplace systems help resolve agency problems when employees
work in teams at the lowest level of the organization that are rich with rigorous selection, training, information sharing, clear goals, and fair rewards.
