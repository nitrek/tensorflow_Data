SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background and Discussion
Over the years, the Commission has evaluated its disclosure regime and engaged
periodically in rulemakings designed to enhance its disclosure and registration requirements. 1

For a summary of the relevant history and background of Regulation S-K, see Business and Financial
Disclosure Required by Regulation S-K, Release No. 33-10064 (Apr. 13, 2016) [81 FR 23916 (Apr. 22,
2016)] (“Regulation S-K Concept Release”).

Most recently, the Commission published a concept release to seek public comment on
modernizing certain business and financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. 2 The
purpose of the Regulation S-K Concept Release is to assess whether the business and financial
disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K continue to provide the information that investors
need to make informed investment and voting decisions. The Regulation S-K Concept Release
focuses on the business and financial disclosures that registrants provide in their periodic reports,
which are a subset of the disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K, because many of them have
changed little since they were first adopted and are often the foundation of the disclosures
investors look to when making investment decisions. These requirements have also been
revisited by the Commission or the staff less frequently in the recent past than other disclosure
requirements in Regulation S-K, such as executive compensation and governance contained in
Subpart 400 of Regulation S-K. 3 Last year, the Commission also published a request for
comment to seek public input about the financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-X for
certain entities other than a registrant. 4

Division of Corporation Finance (Oct. 9, 2007), available at
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/execcompdisclosure.htm. As the Commission noted in the
Regulation S-K Concept Release, the scope of that release does not include certain disclosure requirements
for information other than business and financial disclosures, such as Subpart 400, which requires
disclosure about management and certain security holders as well as corporate governance matters. See
Regulation S-K Concept Release, supra note 1, at Section I, n. 4. This request for comment directly covers
those subjects.

Registrant, Release No. 33-9929 (Sept. 25, 2015) [80 FR 59083 (Oct. 1, 2015)].

These efforts, in addition to this request for comment, are part of a comprehensive
evaluation of the Commission’s disclosure requirements recommended in the staff’s Report on
Review of Disclosure Requirements in Regulation S-K (“S-K Study”), which was mandated by
Section 108 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). 5 As noted in the
Regulation S-K Concept Release, based on the S-K Study’s recommendation and at the request
of the Chair, Commission staff initiated a comprehensive evaluation of the type of information
our rules require registrants to disclose, how this information is presented, where and how this
information is disclosed, and how the Commission can leverage technology as part of these
efforts (collectively, “Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative”). Section 72003(a) of the FAST Act 6
also requires the Commission to carry out a study of the requirements contained in Regulation SK. 7 Specifically, Section 72003(a) requires that the study of Regulation S-K:
•

Determine how best to modernize and simplify such requirements in a manner that
reduces the costs and burdens on issuers while still providing all material information;

•

Emphasize a company-by-company approach that allows relevant and material
information to be disseminated to investors without boilerplate language or static
requirements while preserving completeness and comparability of information across
registrants; and

Pub. L. 112-106, Sec. 108, 126 Stat. 306 (2012). Section 108 of the JOBS Act requires the Commission to
conduct a review of Regulation S-K to determine how such requirements can be updated to modernize and
simplify the registration process for emerging growth companies. The S-K Study is available at
http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2013/reg-sk-disclosure-requirements-review.pdf. For a further discussion
of the S-K Study, see the Regulation S-K Concept Release, supra note 1, at Section II.C.
Pub. L. 114-94, Sec. 72003, 129 Stat. 1312 (2015).
In conducting this study, the Commission is required to consult with the Investor Advisory Committee and
the Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.

Evaluate methods of information delivery and presentation and explore methods for
discouraging repetition and the disclosure of immaterial information. 8

Request for Comment
The initiative to review the disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K is intended to
result in recommendations and proposals that will improve our disclosure system for the benefit
of investors and registrants. The purpose of this request for comment is to solicit public input on
Subpart 400 of Regulation S-K, which requires certain disclosures about a registrant’s
management, certain security holders, and corporate governance matters. 9 The input can include
comments on existing requirements in these rules as well as on potential disclosure issues that
commenters believe the rules should address. 10 The comments received in response to this
request for comment, as well as comments received in response to the Regulation S-K Concept
Release, will inform the Commission in carrying out the study of Regulation S-K required by
Section 72003(a) of the FAST Act. 11

Item 401 of Regulation S-K generally requires certain disclosures about a registrant’s
directors, executive officers, promoters and control persons. 12

For example, as noted in the Regulation S-K Concept Release, supra note 1, this could include industryspecific disclosure requirements, information about sustainability and governance matters, and additional
instances in which scaled disclosure could be implemented.
Comment letters received in response to this request for comment will be considered in connection with
any future rulemaking related to the disclosure requirements in Subpart 400 of Regulation S-K. If the
Commission proposes changes to these disclosure requirements the proposed changes will be subject to
public notice and comment.

such as foreign private issuers and smaller reporting companies. The Commission has a number of
outstanding proposals related to executive compensation disclosure and listing requirements. See
Disclosure of Hedging by Employees, Officers and Directors, Release No. 33-9723 (Feb. 9, 2015) [80 FR
8485 (Feb. 17, 2015)]; Pay Versus Performance, Release 34-74835 (Apr. 29, 2015) [80 FR 26329 (May 7,

Item 402 generally and is not intended to solicit specific comment on those proposals.

Item 407 of Regulation S-K generally requires certain corporate governance disclosure
about director independence, board meetings, various board committees (e.g.,
nominating, audit and compensation committees) and any process for shareholder
communications. 19
In connection with the staff’s continuing Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative and

corresponding work on the FAST Act mandate, the Commission welcomes public comments on
the issues that the staff should consider in conducting its review of Subpart 400 of Regulation SK, including, among other things, how best to modernize and simplify these disclosure items in
view of the objectives of the Regulation S-K study set forth in Section 72003 of the FAST Act
and whether additional disclosures in these areas are necessary or appropriate to facilitate
investor protection, to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and/or to facilitate capital
formation. In addition to the substance of the disclosure requirements, the Commission
welcomes comments on how information can be presented to improve its readability,
