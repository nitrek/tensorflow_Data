Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Washington, D.C. 20549
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 3939/June 23, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16554
In the Matter of
GRAY FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.,
LAURENCE O. GRAY, AND
ROBERT C. HUBBARD, IV

NOTICE

On May 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Respondents. On August 4, 2015, the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered an order in Gray
Financial Group, Inc. v. SEC, No. 15-cv-492, preliminarily enjoining the Commission from
conducting the present proceeding.
On June 17, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit issued an
opinion vacating the district court’s judgment “with instructions to dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction.” Gray Fin. Grp., Inc. v. SEC, No. 15-12831, slip op. at 37. That same day, the
Division of Enforcement submitted to this Office (but, apparently, not to the Office of the
Secretary) a letter forwarding a copy of the appellate opinion and stating that the Division
intended to notify me “of the appropriate timing for restarting this administrative proceeding.”
On June 21, 2016, Respondents submitted to this Office (but also, apparently, not to the Office of
the Secretary) their own letter, arguing that the preliminary injunction “remains in effect.”
I intend to restart this proceeding after the mandate issues, which is when the Court of
Appeals’ judgment becomes effective and final. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(c) & advisory
committee’s note; United States v. Palacios, 516 F. App’x 734, 738 (11th Cir. 2013). If the
mandate that eventually issues in Gray Financial Group, Inc. v. SEC includes a judgment
ordering dismissal of the case, then this proceeding may recommence because vacatur of the
injunction will be purely ministerial.
I therefore ask the parties to file a copy of the mandate promptly upon its issuance and
to not submit additional papers in this proceeding until the mandate issues. The parties are
reminded that Commission Rules of Practice 151 and 152 require papers to be filed with the
Office of the Secretary and to contain (in essence) captions. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.151, .152.
