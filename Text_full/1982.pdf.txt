-,48th, Annual Report)
of the Securities and
Exchange Commission
for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 1982

Chairman's Letter of Transmittal
The Honorable George Bush
President, U.S. Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510
The Honorable Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr.
Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
Gentlemen:
It is a pleasure to transmit herewith the Securities and Exchange Commission's 48th Annual Report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1982.
Fiscal 1982 was an exceptional year in terms of the volume and efficacy
of the Commission's efforts, and major programs brought to fruition for
the benefit of shareholders. Such programs reduce their corporations' expenses by hundreds of millions of dollars per annum, as well as the Commission's paperwork, but not investor protections.
The SEC is charged with the protection of investors and the maintenance
of fair and orderly markets. These mandates are discharged through the
SEC's public disclosure, enforcement and oversight functions, which
facilitate the formation, mobility and effective employment of the nation's
capital.
Last year the Commission brought 30% more enforcement cases, conducted 25% more investment company and advisor inspections, processed
8% more broker-dealer reports, and handled 5% more full disclosure filings, than in fiscal 1981, with 5% less personnel. Registration and other
fees offset 94 % of the Commission's $83 million budget, as compared
with 81 % in fiscal 1981.
The following were records, or the highest levels in several years: 250
enforcement cases were brought, 1,000 Investment Company and advisor
inspections were conducted, 6,600 broker-dealer reports were processed,
and 65,000 full disclosure filings were handled. The staff of less than
1,900 is at the lowest level since 1974.
The Commission also obtained, for the benefit of investors, disgorgements
and restitutions of $30 million, recision offers and refunds of $50 million, and
asset freezes of $35 million. Comparable data are not available for
prior years.

o-Estimates due to shift from manual to computer tabulations.
Major programs brought to fruition last year and the Commission's ongoing efforts, include the following:
Integration
Integration of corporations' registration and reporting requirements (under
the 1933 and 1934 securities acts) is one of the most important improvements in the securities laws since they were enacted half a century ago.
In the interest of shareholders, integration increasestheir corporations'
financing flexibility and reduces their expenses by over $350 million per
annum, as well as the Commission's paperwork, but not disclosures to the
investing public.
Net Capital Rule
The securities industry's net capital requirements were updated to take
into account the industry's improved financial and operational conditions.
This freed-up over $500 million of the industry's capital, which has helped
investment banking and brokerage firms handle the much greater volume
of financings and transactions since August and improve other services to
investors.
iv

Registration Exemptions
In the interest of small business shareholders, the exemption from registration of certain offerings (up to $5 million to other than the general public)
will reduce small businesses' expenses by about $50 million per annum.
Over $4 billion of such financings are expected this year. The exemptions
for larger private placements to sophisticated investors were also simplified
and improved.
These exemptions reduce corporations' expenses and the Commission's
paperwork, but not the investing public's protection. Most states are expected to adopt comparable exemptions, which will be the first joint state
and federal registration exemptions.
Swiss Accord
The Accord concluded with Switzerland removes the haven of the Swiss
secrecy laws from those who would trade on inside information. In this era
of increasing internationalization of the securities markets, the Swiss Accord is an historic precedent.
CFfC Accord
The Accord concluded with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
resolved a seven-yearjurisdictional dispute, which enabled the SEC to
authorize trading in Treasury, GNMA, foreign currency, certificate of
deposit and stock index options. These new options will facilitate government and mortgage financings, international trade and hedging the risks
of fluctuating interest rates and securities markets.
Proxies and Communications
Proposed improvements in the proxy rules and corporations' ability to
communicate with their shareholders (despite the high percentage of
securities registered in nominee names), will benefit shareholders and
reduce their corporations' expenses, as well as the Commission's paperwork.
Accounting Regulations
Eighty redundant or outmoded Accounting Series Releaseswere withdrawn
and the balance were codified in a ready-reference manual.
Investment Companies
Proposals to simplify and improve investment company prospectuses will
increase their utility and reduce expenses ultimately borne by investors, as
well as the Commission's paperwork, but not investor protections.
Self-Regulation
Private-sector self-regulation under the SEC's oversight is also being
enhanced. Effective self-regulation increases investor protections and
reduces Commission expenses.

v

For example, under the oversight of the Office of the Chief Accountant,
the 428 accounting firms which audit over 90% of publicly owned
corporations, are now on a three-year peer review cycle. The purpose of
these reviews is to assure high auditing standards.
In addition, the stock exchanges and the over-the-counter markets are
enhancing their electronic inter-market surveillance systems and transaction audit trails, under the oversight of the Market Regulation Division.
These measures facilitate the quick identification of possible manipulation
and insider trading.
The Commission is also soliciting comments concerning the creation of a
self-regulatory organization to conduct investment company inspections,
under the oversight of the Investment ManClgementDivision.
National Market System
The exchange and over-the-counter markets in 30 stocks have been electronically linked. This experiment is being closely monitored by the securities industry and the Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis.
An order exposure rule has been released for public comment, and last
sales in 184 national market system over-the-counter stocks are now being
reported on a real time basis.
Shelf-Registration
The shelf registration rule WClS
adopted on a temporary basis. It permits
corporations to file a single registration statement covering securities they
expect to sell from time to time within two years. Over $140 billion of
debt and $2 billion of equity offerings have been filed under the shelf
rule. Later this year, the Commission will determine whether to extend,
modify or withdraw the shelf rule.
Enforcement
Enforcement is the largest activity at the Commission. It accounts for
about a third of the total budget. The 250 enforcement cases brought last
year compare with 190 the year before, despite budgetary constraints and
personnel reductions. Nearly 60% of the cases were injunctive actions. As
in the past, most involved regulated entities and false or misleading corporate filings.
The 20 insider trading cases brought last year represented 40% of all such
cases within the past five years. Insider trading cases have received high
visibility, but they only amounted to 8% of the year's total cases.
Ten cases were brought under the accounting provisions of the Foreign
Corrupt practices Act of 1977. They represent 42 % of all such cases since
the FCPA was enacted.
Legislation
In addition to the Accord with the CFTC which was enacted last year, the
vi

SEC has proposed legislation to increase criminal fines from $10,000 to
$100,000; to permit civil fines up to three times insider trading profits; to
repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act; and to require all brokerdealers to join a registered self-regulatory organization. The Commission
also testified in support of amendments to the Glass-Steagall, Foreign Corrupt Practices and Bankruptcy Reform acts.
Litigation
There are also a number of important cases pending which may significantly impact the securities laws, including the Dirks inside information
case; several implied right of action cases, including Walck, Liberty
National Insurance and San Francisco Real Estate Investors; Dickinson, a
13(d) case; and many others in which the Commission is a party or has
filed amicus briefs.
Conferences
The Commission is also spending more time listening and responding to
the needs and interests of investors, corporations and others. During the
past 12 months, among many others, the Commission held:
• the first Research Forum, at which 40 leading securities analysts
recommended improvements in the SEC's disclosure and
rulemaking practices;
• the first Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital
Formation, under the Small Business Investment Incentive Act;
• the first round of meetings of the full Commission and members of
the senior staff with other boards and commissions with which the
SEC has overlapping jurisdiction:
-

the Federal Reserve Board,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
the Comptroller of the Currency,
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
as well as with the executive staffs of the North American
Securities Administrators, the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation and the self-regulatory organizations;

• a conference on major issues confronting financial institutions and
markets in the 1980's;
• and an international conference with securities regulations from 31
nations.
Task Force

In Congressional testimony and speeches the Commission has advocated
for over a year the formation of a task force to help simplify and improve
the regulatory structures of the financial service industries, for the benefit
vii

of investors and depositors.

Vice President Bush has recently formed

a

task group for this purpose.

The Commission will also be an active participant in prospective legislation, and continue to enforce effectively the securities laws in response to
emerging trends in the securities markets and the economy. For example,
many of last year's insider trading cases related to the significant increase
in tender offers. Some of the current financial reporting and internal
accounting controls cases reflect pressures to report profits

in a difficult

Conclusion
Some of the past year's results were the product of continuing improvements in mangement techniques, automation and paperwork reduction,
such as computer and data processing screens and computations for filing
and enforcement case reviews and investment advisor inspections; and
reductions in corporations' (and therefore the Commission's) paperwork per
filing.
However, the year's record results and the many major programs brought
to fruition are principally a tribute to the brilliant and dedicated efforts of
the Commissioners and staff. In its new book on regulatory reform, the
Heritage Foundation characterizes the SEC staff as "among the best and
brightest in the government", which is high praise, justly deserved.
The Commission has also received excellent support and cooperation from
the private-sector self-regulatory organizations, other federal and state law
enforcement agencies, the business and financial community,
and the legal
and accounting professions.
Sincerely,

John S.R. Shad

Enforcement Program
Key 1982 Results
The Commission maintains a comprehensive enforcement program in order
to address promptly violations of the Federal securities laws.The program must
be capable both of promptly responding to emergency threats to investors and
of anticipating emerging problems.
The enforcement program deploys about a third of the Commission's total
resources. In fiscal 1982, improved case and personnel management enabled
the Commission to bring 251 cases,a 31 % increase over fiscal 1981, despite
budgetary constraints and personnel reductions. A key factor was careful review
to ensure that casesand investigations were developed and completed without
unnecessary delays, including use of the computer-based Case Analysis and
Tracking System.
The 145 civil injunctive actions brought were a 22 % increase over 1981.
They included nine civil and criminal contempt proceedings. Administrative
proceedings increased 47% to 106 cases.Three reports of investigation under
Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act were published.
Commission Remedies-The Federal securities laws provide civil and ad.
ministrative remedies designed to rectify past violations and prevent future
violations.
The Commission's principal enforcement remedy is a Federal court injunction, ordering a defendant to comply with the law in the future. Violation of
the injunction may result in contempt proceedings. In fiscal 1982, 136 injunctive actions named 418 defendants.
In addition, in civil injunctive actions courts often enter orders for other
equitable relief such as restitution, disgorging illicit profits, or other relief appropriate to the particular case.The Commission obtained court orders in fiscal
1982 that required defendants to divest illicit profits of $33 million, either as
disgorgement or as restitution to defrauded investors. Another $53 million was
the subject of orders for rescissionof transactionsor the refund of investor funds.
Emergency actions brought by the Commission led to freeze orders by courts
that protected $37 million in investor funds until a disposition of the funds could
be made.
The Commission regulates certain entities, such as broker-dealers, investment companies and investment advisers.If regulated entities violate the federal
securities laws or regulations, they may be censured or have their registrations
suspended for up to 12 months or revoked in an administrative proceeding.
An effective registration is needed to stay in business. During fiscal 1982, the
Commission revoked the registration of 11 firms, suspended 9 and censured
28, compared to 7, 7, and 23 respectively, in 1981.

Administrative proceedings may also be instituted against persons associated
with regulated entities. The remedies include censure, suspension for up to 12
months or a bar from participation in the securities industry. The Commission
barred 44 individuals, suspended 82, and censured 19 in fiscal 1982, compared
to 23, 50, and 17, a year earlier.
Issuers may be subject to administrative proceedings pursuant to Section
15(cX4) of the Exchange Act if they fail to comply in a material respect with
the Act's disclosure requirements. They may be ordered to comply upon
specified terms and conditions. Five such proceedings were instituted in fiscal
1982, 9 in fiscal 1981.
Criminal sanctions for Federal securities law violations include fines and imprisonment. The Commission has requested legislation to increase the maximum criminal fine for most violations of the Exchange act from $10,000 to
$100,000 per violation. I The legislation would counter the effects of inflation
and raise the level of risk for those who engage in violative conduct.
In fiscal 1982, 47 defendants were named in 24 criminal indictments or informations relating to Commission investigations, compared to 48 and 26 last
year. In addition, more than $450,000 in criminal fines were imposed in 1982.
The Commission assisted state and local authorities and self-regulatory
organizations in enforcement efforts and also received their assistance. Over
50 representatives of state, federal and foreign agencies attended the Commision's 1982 Enforcement Training Program.
Sources of Further fnquiry- The Commission publishes litigation releases
which describe its civil injunctive actions and criminal proceedings mvolvinq
securities-related violations. Among other things, these releases report the
violative conduct that is either alleged by the Commission or the Department
of Justice or found by a court, and the disposition or status of the case. They
are published in the SEC Docket, copies of which may be reviewed at the Commission's regional offices. Commission orders that institute administrative proceedings and provide remedial relief are also published in the SEC Docket.
Private vendors disseminate much of this information.
Some of the more important areas of enforcement activity in fiscal 1982 are
discussed below. Illustrative casesare cited in footnotes, with references to relevant pages of hte SEC Docket.

Swiss Accord
Commission investigations of suspected insider trading have sometimes been
impeded by foreign secrecy laws or blocking statutes. On August 31, 1982,
significant progress was made in this area when the govemments of Switzerland
and the United States concluded six months of negotiations with the signing
of a Memorandum of Understanding concerning nation-to-nation law enforcement cooperation in insider trading cases. 2"fheMemorandum contains: (a) an
exchange of opinions which clarifies the ability of the Commission to use the
1977 Treaty between the United States and Switzerland concerning mutual
2

assistancein criminal matters in its investigationsof insider trading; (b) an agreement in principal to exchange certain diplomatic notes; and (c) understandings
with respect to an agreement between members of the Swiss Bankers Association which will permit signatory banks, under certain circumstances, to furnish
information and evidence to the Commission through the Swiss Federal Office for Police Matters, notwithstanding Swiss secrecy laws.

Insider Trading
Insider trading (the purchase or sale of securities by persons in possession
of material, non-public information relating to such securities) undermines the
expectation of fairness and honesty that is the basis of public confidence in
the nation's securities markets. The proliferation of tender offers and the advent of trading in standardized options contracts have increased opportunities
for those with material non-public information to reap large profits.
In response, the Commission has increased its efforts to combat this threat
to the securities markets, In fiscal 1982, the Commission brought 20 insider
trading actions (including the publication of a report pursuant to Section 21(a)
of the Exchange Act)." While these actions constituted only 8% of the total
cases brought, they compare with a total of approximately 50 such actions
brought since 1977, and 97 since 1949. The cases involved corporate executives, attorneys, accountants, bank officers and others who obtained confidential information concerning proposed tender offers, or other significant
developments, in the course of their work.
Proposed Ciuil Penalties-In order to increasethe deterrent effect of its enforcement actions, the Commission, in fiscal 1982, proposed legislation which would
permit court imposed civil penalties of up to three times the profit gained or
the loss avoided by a person who purchases or sells securities while in possession of material non-public information. Persons who aid and abet such conduct would also be subject to such penalties." The proposed penalties would
provide a strong disincentive to counter increased opportunities to profit from
the use of inside information.

Corporate Reporting and Accounting
The Exchange Act and Commission rules require periodic and timely
disclosure of information by publicly owned companies. Recently, problems
associated with reduced profits and high interest rates have demanded more
attention to the adequacy of reports of financial condition and business operations by companies that file with the Commission. Accordingly, the detection
and correction of materially inadequate or inaccurate reports is a high priority.
Financial disclosure violations may involve improper valuation of inventories,
assetsor liabilities, the remuneration of officers and other related parties, the
ability of a corporation to meet its obligations or the recognition of revenue
and expenses. Violations with respect to nonfinancial information may include

3

such things as material misstatements concerning corporate mineral reserves
or production or a failure to disclose relevant facts concerning corporate
management.
Closely related to the emphasis on fraud by reporting companies is enforcement of the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
(Section 13(bX2)of the Exchange Act). These provisions require issuers to make
and keep accurate books and records and to devise and maintain systems of
internal accounting controls which provide reasonable assurances that certain
statutory objectives are met. The requirements are intended to assure that
issuers have reliable financial information with which to prepare financial
statements and other disclosure documents.
Thirty-six issuer financial statement and reporting caseswere brought in 1982,5
including 10 alleging violations of the accounting requirements of the FCPA. 6
This is 40% of the 24 FCPA actions brought since enactment of the statute
in 1977. Nine delinquent filing actions were also included in this category.

Market Manipulation
The Commission is charged with insuring the integrity of trading on the national securities exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets. The Commission's staff, and the exchangesand the National Association of Securities Dealers
under the Commission's oversight, engage in surveillance of these markets.
Ten manipulation actions were brought in fiscal 1982.7They involved attempts
to create the appearance of trading activity through nominee accounts, the use
of confederates to make artificial trades and unauthorized trading of customer
accounts to prevent price declines.

Related Party Transactions
Fundamental to the relationship between an investor and management is
the expectation that a company's assets will be used for the benefit of the company and not for the personal benefit of its managers. Accordingly, the Commission's rules require disclosure of transactions by companies with management or related parties. In four actions, the Commission alleged that company
officials failed to disclose benefits received in related party transactions. 8

Securities Distribution Violations
Some issuers fail to register public offerings of their securities or rely on purported exemptions which are not available to them. Distribution violations may
also include material misrepresentations or omissions in connection with
securities offerings.
In fiscal 1982, 47 enforcement actions involved securities distribution viola.
tions. 9'fhe Commission also published a report pursuant to Section 21(a) of
the Exchange Act which emphasized the Commission's concern with respect
to disclosure issues raised in connection with the offer and sale of securities

4

in the form of retail repurchase agreements, and reminded thrift institutions
and banks of their disclosure obligations under the Federal securities laws. 10

Changes in Corporate Control
Sections 13 and 14 of the Exchange Act govern the activities of persons and
entities involved in gaining, or attempting to gain or maintain control or ownership of a corporation. These provisions govern proxy solicitations and the fiImg of reports by persons or groups who make a tender offer or acquire
beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a class of equity securities registered
with the Commission. These requirements are intended to insure that investors
have the material information needed to make informed investment or voting
decisions. Nine enforcement actions were brought in this area during fiscal
1982.11

Regulated Entities and Associated Persons
Fiscal 1982 actions involving regulated entities (including broker-dealers, investment companies and advisers) ranged from books and records Violations
to attempts to defraud customers. A number of cases included allegations that
broker-dealers failed adequately to supervise their employees. Three actions
involved "money laundering" activities (i.e., the failure to file Currency Transaction Reports as required by Internal Revenue Service regulations for cash
transactions in excess of $10,000).
Fiscal 1982 broker-dealer casestotalled 82. 12TheCommission also brought
35 other regulated entity cases, which included violations by investment companies and advisers and fraud upon regulated entities by their customers. 13The
Commission also published one related report pursuant to Section 21(a) of the
Exchange Act.

"Hot Issues" Task Force
"Hot issues" market problems in the Denver area included manipulation,
financial responsibility and recordkeeping Violations by broker-dealers. A task
force of 50 people drawn from Washington, each regional office and the National Association of Securities Dealers conducted examinations of 30 "hot
issue" broker-dealers in February 1982. Injunctive actions were filed against
five broker-dealers, three of which were placed under the supervision of
Securities Investor Protection Corporation receivers. Eleven other firms voluntarily closed for a period of time, five of which have been or are being liquidated.

Full Disclosure System
The Commission's full disclosure system insures that full and accurate
material information about publicly traded companies is available to investors.
Full disclosure fosters investor confidence, contributes to the maintenance of
fair and orderly markets and facilitates capital formation.

Key 1982 Results
Despite budgetary constraints and personnel reduction, during fiscal 1982
the Commission efficiently handled a record 65,000 full disclosure filings, a
5% increase over the 62,000 handled in fiscal 1981. These full disclosure filings included: Securities Act registration statements; filings under Securities
Act exemptions for small offerings; Exchange Act registration statements and
annual, quarterly and periodic reports; Williams Act filings; and filings governed by the proxy rules. The most complex filings increasedsubstantially to record
levels. They included: (1) approximately 4,400 Securities Act registration
statements, a 15% increase; (2) approximately 160 "new issuer" Exchange Act
registration statements, a 20% increase; approximately 200 merger proxy
statements, a 45% increase; and (4) 550 tender offer statements, a 65%
increase.
In the accounting area, the 428 accounting firms which audit over 90% of
publicly owned corporations are now on a three-year peer review cycle, and
the body of Accounting Series Releaseshave been simplified and codified into
a ready-reference manual, after withdrawing redundant and outmoded portions.
Role of Selective Review-Filings are handled in the selective review system,
which screens all filings received in order to identify those that are likely to
present significant disclosure issues and thus should be given a full review. A
key part of the system involves the use of computer techniques to aid the screening process. The Commission was able to handle the record volume of filings
due to the selective review system as well as strong management in the reviewing staff, more training, and more use of data processing.
Projects-The Division also completed two major projects: the integrated
disclosure program and Regulation D (which relates to limited securities offerings). The integration program includes Rule 415 (the "shelf rule"), which relates
to delayed or continuous offerings.
The Commission began a major review of the proxy regulations, to provide
more uniform and less duplicative disclosures in clear, concise language and
to reduce compliance costs (which are ultimately borne by shareholders) in a
manner consistent with investor protection.

Research Forum
To improve communication between the Commission and various users of
the Commission's disclosure documents, the Commission initiated the first
Research Forum, held on November 17, 1982. Over 40 representatives from
various types of users of Commission documents, such as securities analysts,
institutional investors, investment advisers, rating organizations and shareholder
groups, were invited to meet with the Commission and staff for discussion of
these issues relating to the form and content of disclosure documents: (1) nonfinancial reporting requirements; (2) financial reporting requirements; and (3)
proxy statement disclosure requirements.
Of particular importance, the Commission solicited views on how Commission releasescould be improved and how users of disclosure documents could
be encouraged to be more responsive to the Commission's requests for comments on proposed rulemaking initiatives.

The Integration Program
On February 24, 1982, the Commission announced adoption of the final
phase of its program to integrate the disclosure requirements under the
Securities Act and those under the Exchange Act, which comprehensively revised, simplified and improved the full disclosure system. 14
Movement toward an integrated disclosure system had been under way for
several years. The purpose was to combine the Securities Act transactionoriented system of disclosure and the Exchange Act continuous disclosure
system into a simplified, comprehensive corporate reporting system, reducing compliance costs and also improving investor protection.
The final phase included: (1) three new registration forms which constitute
the basic framework for registration under the Securities Act; (2) an expanded
and reorganized Regulation S-K, which sets forth uniform disclosure standards
applicable under both Acts; (3) revised procedural requirements governing the
registration of securities under the Securities Act and the reports of certain
issuersunder the Exchange Act; (4) temporary Rule 415 governing the registration of securities on a delayed or continuous basis(seeShelf Registration below);
(5) new Rule 176 identifying certain circumstances which may bear upon the
determination of what constitutes reasonable investigation and reasonable
ground for belief under Section 11(b) of the Securities Act; (6) new rules permitting the voluntary disclosure of securities ratings; (7) revisions to various
rules, forms and schedulesunder both Acts to implement coordinating changes;
and (8) the rescissionof obsolete forms under both Acts and 88% of the Guides
for the Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements and Reports.

Shelf Registration-Rule 415 under the Securities Act, which governs the
registration of securities to be sold on a delayed or continuous basis, was
8

adopted on a temporary basis, until December 10, 1982, when the Commission adopted the integrated disclosure system. At that time, the Commission
noted that the rule had been the subject of substantial commentary, varying
from support for the rule, as proposed or with modifications, to concern that
the proposal would have adverse effects on the capital raising process and the
securities trading markets. Recognizing the importance of commentators' con.
cerns, the Commission determined to afford the opportunity for continued consideration of the shelf registration process by adopting Rule 415 on a temporary
basis, monitoring the operation of the rule, conducting public hearings, and
considering written submissions. 151n
September 1982, the Commission determined that additional experience wasnecessaryin order to assessfully the issues
raised, and therefore extended the effective period for the rule until December
31, 1983. 16(Over2,200 shelf registration statements were filed from March
through December, 1982. Nearly 90% were traditional shelf filings, such as
employee stock purchase plans, secondary, best effort, tax shelter and mortgage participation offerings. Most of the balance were investment grade debt
filings. Such debt filings amounted to over 60% of the $70 billion of total debt
issuesfiled in March through December. About $20 billion (nearly half) of these
issues have been sold-of which about 30% were so-called "bought deals"sold to institutions without underwriting syndicates. The 34 equity shelf filings
in March through December amounted to only 1% of the 3,400 equity issues
filed-and to only 3 % of the $90 billion of total equity filings. All but two of
the 34 equity filings are for New York Stock Exchange listed companies.)
Cost Savings-One of the goals of the integration program was to reduce
burdens on registrants, while, at the same time, ensuring that investors are
provided with the material information on which to base investment decisions.
It is estimated that integration will save corporations (and, therefore, their
shareholders) over $350 million per annum, without compromising full
disclosure to investors. This estimate reflects anticipated cost savings from: (1)
new registration Forms 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3, with expanded eligibility for short
forms and streamlined procedures and disclosure requirements; (2) reduction
In the cost to the Commission of processing the above documents; (3) amendments to Form 5-8 for the registration of employee benefit plans, which
eliminated much of the disclosure that formerly was required and provided for
automatic updating through incorporation by reference; (4) new Form 5-15,
a simplified form for certain types of business combinations, which utilizes existing annual reports and therefore is much lessexpensiveto prepare than other
available forms; (5) reduction in reporting burdens for various other forms as
a result of the streamlining of disclosure requirements; (6) the availability of
short registration forms for foreign issuers, as a result of adoption of an integrated disclosure system for foreign issuers;(7) new Rule415, which eliminates
the necessity of filing separate registration statements for multiple offerings and
permits issuersto go to market quickly according to financing needsand market
conditions; and (8) reduction in underwriting spreads since Rule 415 has been
in effect.

Regulation D and Other Small Business Activities
In March 1982, the Commission adopted Regulation D, a series of rules providing exemptions from the Securities Act registration provisions for certain
limited offerings of securities. "The regulation simplifies and makes more
uniform the rules relating to limited and private offerings, eliminates any unnecessary restrictions, facilitates capital formation in a manner consistent with
investor protection, and should reduce costs to small businessesby an estimated
$50 million per annum.
The regulation groups together conditions to the use of the limited offering
exemptions and definitions that the exemptions have in common, and adds
certainty to the exemptions by defining the term "accredited investor"-one
who is deemed able to "fend for himself." The term "accredited investor" in.
c1udes: (1) banks, insurance companies, registered investment companies,
business development companies, or small business investment companies,
and certain employee benefit plans; (2) any employee benefit plan within the
meaning of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act with total
assets in excess of $5 million; (3) private business development companies;
(4) charitable organizations with assets in excess of $5 million; (5) directors,
executive officers and general partners of the issuer; (6) persons purchasing
at least $150,000 of securities, where the total purchase price does not exceed
20 percent of the purchaser's net worth; (7) natural persons with a net worth
of at least $1 million; and (8) natural persons with an income of at least $200,000
per year for two years preceding the offering and for the year in which the offering is made.
The Commission has continued to coordinate small business rulemaking,
including Regulation D, with the North American Securities Administrators
Association (NASAA) in order to develop a basic framework of limited offering exemptions that can apply uniformly at the Federal and state levels (pursuant to Section 19(cX3)of the Securities Act, which was promulgated by the
Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980). At its April 1982 meeting,
NASAA adopted a Uniform Limited Offering Exemption containing the major
elements of Regulation D. These joint efforts will result in a significant reduction of the burdens on small businessesby eliminating many of the differences
between Federal and state securities regulation of limited offerings.
The Uniform Limited Offering Exemption is the first joint state and Federal
registration exemption. It is an important precedent for future joint state and
Federal efforts to simplify and improve corporate compliance requirements in
a manner consistent with investor protection.
Gooernmeni-Business Forum on Capital Formation-Congress, in the Small
Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980, directed the Commission to conduct an annual Government-Business Forum "to review the current status of
problems and programs relating to small business capital formation," and to
include as participants other Federal agencies, state securities commissioners

10

and leading small business and professional
formation.

organizations

concerned

with capital

An Executive Committee
for the Forum was selected in March 1982 in accordance with Congressional
guidelines.
It met several times, sponsored a
survey, sought the views of executives of small businesses on capital formation, and developed discussion papers and proposals on four key subjects identified as crucial to capital raising. The Forum was held on September 23-25,
1982 and was attended by approximately
175 small business executives, accountants,
attorneys,
financial analysts, economists,
broker-dealers,
venture
capital investors, financial advisers, bankers and government
officials.
(Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, in November 1982, the final Forum
Report, which made 37 recommendations,
was distributed. The recommendations related to eight subject areas; (1) developing incentives for institutional
investors and others to invest in small business; (2) relaxing the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and similar regulatory restrictions to encourage investment in small business; (3) reducing costs associated with securities regulation; (4) developing uniform Federal/state securities regulation; (5) adjusting corporate tax rates and brackets to reflect the internal capital raising needs of small
business; (6) changing the tax treatment of capital gains to provide a stimulus
to capital formation,
particularly
for small businesses; (7) providing additional
tax modifications
to assist small business capital formation and retention; and
(8) revising Small Business Administration
programs to assist the financing of
small business.)

Classification of Issuers-In April 1982, the Commission established a system
of classifying
small issuers for purposes of exempting
certain of them from
reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. IBThe system provides
a rational adjustment
to the criteria for entry into, or exit from, the Exchange
Act reporting system and eliminates the costs of complying
with the registration and reporting
provisions of the Exchange Act for the smallest issuers.
The new classification
system changed the reporting scheme in three ways:
(1) a company will not have to register and file reports under Section 12(g) until it has 500 or more record holders of a class of equity security and total
assets of $3 million or more, in contrast to the former total asset criterion of
$1 million; (2) a company may deregister a class of securities registered under
Section 12(g) at any time that it has fewer than 500 record holders of the class
and has had total assets of less than $3 million at the end of each of its last
three fiscal years, in contrast to the former deregistration
provision, which was
based on 300 record holders; and (3) a company that is subject to Section 15(d)
will generally have its obligation
to file reports under that section suspended
with respect to any fiscal year on the first day of which it has fewer than 500
record holders of the class of securities giving rise to its obligation,
if the company has had total assets under $3 million at the end of each of its three most
recent fiscal years. The former provisions were based on 300 record holders.
The new provision for suspending the reporting obligation under Section 15(d)
is not available to an issuer for any year in which it has had a registration state-

11

ment become effective or in the two succeeding years.
Form 5-18- The Commission also broadened the availability of Form S-18,
the simplified Securities Act registration form for issuers that do not file Exchange Act reports, 19toinclude non-corporate registrants (such as limited partnerships) and registrants engaged in oil and gas related operations. The revision permitting limited partnerships to use Form S-18 expanded its use to many
real estate issuers previously unable to use the form.

The Proxy Review Program
In fiscal 1982, the Commission began a major review of the rules and regulations applicable to the proxy solicitation process.The revised proxy review program includes: (1) proposed Item 404 of Regulation S-K, relating to the
disclosure of management relationships and transactions, which was published for comment in fiscal 1982; (2) reexamination of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act relating to shareholder proposals; (3) the rules concerning the
disclosure of management remuneration; (4) Form S-14 under the Securities
Act relating to merger proxy statements; (5) the proxy contest rules; and (6)
facilitating shareholder communications particularly with respect to securities
registered in nominee names.
As a first step, on July 9, 1982, the Commission proposed for public comment a new Item 404 of Regulation S-K, "Certain relationships and related transactions," which governs disclosure of management relationships and transactions in proxy statements, registration statements and periodic reports."
Proposed Item 404 would mtegrate two disclosure provisions: Item 402(f) of
Regulation S-K, 21relatingto disclosure of transactions in which directors, officers, director nominees and certain of their associateshave a material interest;
and Item 6(b) of Schedule 14A, 22relating to relationships between directors,
officers, nominees, certain owners and significant customers, suppliers and
creditors.
The major changes proposed from the existing disclosure requirements in.
c1uded: (1) eliminating disclosure of a director's relationship with significant
customers, suppliers and creditors where the only relationship is directorship
with the other entity; (2) raising the equity ownership threshold requiring
disclosure of relationships from one percent to ten percent; (3) raising the
amount of business that must be conducted between the registrant and a
customer or supplier before the relationship is required to be disclosed; (4) requiring disclosure of the specific dollar amount of payments made to law and
investment banking firms only if it exceeds the threshold applicable to other
suppliers of services; and (5) expanding the classof relatives to those not more
remote than first cousins of directors, officers and nominees whose material
interests in transactions are required to be disclosed.
(On October 14, 1982, the Commission published for comment a vanety
of issues relating to the Federal regulation of the security holder process,"
including whether security holders' access to the issuer's proxy statement
12

should be provided under the Exchange Act or left to regulation under state
law. The Commission also invited comment on three specific proposals:(1) proposal I would retain the framework of current Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, with
certain changes designed to clarify the rule and simplify its application, (2) proposal II would permit the issuer, with security holders' approval, to vary the
procedures set forth in the rule; and (3) proposal III would require inclusion in
the issuer's proxy statement of all security holder proposals proper under state
law and not involving an election of directors, subject to numerical limitation.)
(Also subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, on December 2, 1982, the
Commission took two further steps in the Proxy Review Program. First, it
adopted Item 404 with two pertinent changes: (1) the class of relatives covered
is the immediate family of the specified persons and (2) only the transactions
of executive officers need be reported. Second, it proposed rule amendments
relating to recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Shareholder
Communications in its report delivered to the Division of Corporation Finance
in June 1982. The amendments proposed would (1) tighten the timetable for
proxy distribution; (2) under certain limited circumstances, eliminate the obligation of an issuer to disseminate the material that must be delivered to beneficial
owners pursuant to current rules; and (3) establish, without altering the current
process for proxy distribution, a means by which issuerscould obtain the identities, addresses and security positions of consenting beneficial owners.)

Foreign Issuer Integration Program
Forms F-1, F-2 and F-3 were proposed to provide an integrated disclosure
system for non-North American foreign private issuers similar to that recently
adopted for North American issuers. 24Theproposals would permit certain of
these issuers to use "short form registration." Form F-3 would be available to
"world class" issuers that have been filing periodic reports under the Exchange
Act for at least three years; the form relies on incorporation by reference of
such periodic reports. Form F-2 wold be available to other world class Issuers
and to a non-North American foreign private issuerthat had been filing periodic
reports for at least three years; such reports would be delivered to investors
with the prospectus. Form F-1 would be available to any non-North American
foreign private issuer and would require information to be included in the prospectus. Concurrently, rules relating to the age of financial statements 25and
the currency in which financial statements could be presented 25wereproposed.
(Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, on November 19, 1982, the foreign
issuer integration program was adopted. Also, in reponseto the recent hot issue
market in the securities of issuers from Canada and Australia, on October 28,
1982, the Commission published proposals to revise Rule 12g3-2 under the
Exchange Act, which exempts from Exchange Act registration the securities
of foreign issuers that have not voluntarily sought entry to the U.S. capital
rnarkets." The proposals would require foreign isuers to register their securities
under the Exchange Act in order to be quoted on NASDAQ.)

13

Standardized Options Disclosure
On September 16, 1982, the Commission adopted new regulations relating
to the offer and sale of standardized options:" (1) an optional registration statement form, Form S-20, to be used to register standardized options under the
Securities Act; (2) Rule 153b under the Securities Act, which provides that the
prospectus delivery requirement of the Securities Act is satisfied by providing
copies of the Form S-20 prospectus to the markets on which the options are
traded; (3) Rule 9b-1 under the Exchange Act, which establishes an option
disclosure document containing information concerning standardized options
and options trading; and (4) Rule 135b under the Securities Act, which exempts
that disclosure document from the requirements of Section 5 of the Act. These
new regulations will save the securities industry $1.5 million per year, while
improving investor understanding of standardized options by presenting the
essential information in a more comprehensible disclosure document, and by
making a prospectus available to investors who may be interested in more detailed information.
At the same time, the Commission adopted Rule 134a under the Securities
Act permitting the dissemination of instructional information about options
without it being deemed a prospectus for purposes of Section 5 of the Securities

Act.
Other Rulemaking Initiatives
Pro Rata Rule-On

May 25, 1982, the Commission published for comment
a proposed rule governing the acceptance of securities deposited in response
to a partial tender offer if a greater number of securities are deposited than
the bidder is bound or willing to purchase. 2!lTheproposed rule provided that
in such situations the bidder is required to accept securities on a pro rata basis
according to the number of securities deposited by each depositor during the
period such offer remains open. (Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year,
on December 15, 1982, the rule was adopted.)
Guide 5-ln June 1982, the Commission approved the publication of revisions to Guide 5 of the Securities Act Industry Guides, "Preparation of Registration Statements Relating to Interests in Real Estate Limited Partnerships," and
the adoption of related rule amendments. 3<YfheGuide revisions, which were
a major cooperative effort between the Commission and the Subcommittee
on Financial Statement and Track Record Disclosure of NASAA, will reduce
the regulatory burden on the real estate industry by promoting uniformity between Federal and state securities regulations. The changes standardized and
simplified disclosure of the prior experience and performance of sponsors of
public real estate programs. In a related rule change, Rule 3-14 of Regulation
SoX, "Special Instructions for Real Estate Operations to be Acquired,'. was
amended to allow, under certain circumstances, presentation of one rather than
three years of audited financial statements for individual properties acquired
by the partnership.

14

Amendment to Rule 13d-2(b)-On June 10, 1982, the Commission proposed an amendment ot Rule 13d-2(b) under the Exchange Act, to delete the part
of the rule that requires a person to file a Schedule 13G when no changes have
occurred in the information contained in the previously filed Schedule 13G. 31
(Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, on October 28, 1982, the Commission adopted final amendments to the rule which carried out the proposed
change and, in addition, provided that no Schedule 13G amendment need be
filed if the only change in information previously reported is a change in the
percentage of outstanding securities beneficially owned as a result of a change
in the shares outstanding. 32)
Dollar Umit Increases-During 1982, the Commission adopted 33amendments
to certain exemptive rules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in.
creasing the dollar amount of the exemptions provided by rules. These changes
reflect the effects of dollar inflation since the adoption of the rules. The amended
rules relate to: (1) sales of sharesto provide cash for distribution to shareholders
in connection with stock splits and similar transactions; (2) resales of securities
of issuers who do not furnish to the public information about their activities;
and (3) deferral of Section 16(a) reports of certain small transactions by corporate "insiders". At the same time, the Commission rescinded several obsolete
rules.
Interpretive Advice and Other Activities
Concomitant to the Commission's rule-making function is the role of the staff
in providing interpretive advice. In the area of full disclosure, the staff provides
such advice through telephone inquiries (an estimated 59,000 in fiscal 1982)
and written responses to formal requests for advice (an estimated 1,500).
Management Remuneration-In December 1981, the Commission published
an interpretive releaseconcerning management remuneration in a question and
answer format." The release gave particular attention to the disclosure of defined benefit pension plans, stock options and stock appreciation rights.
Proxy MonitoringProgram-As the final phase of a three-year survey, the Com.
mission in March 1982 authorized the publication of a release analyzing the
results of its 1981 proxy statement disclosure monitoring program. 35The
analysis indicated that during the three years covered by the program, there
have on the average been declines in (a) the percentage of board members
employed by the issuer or a subsidiary, (b) the number of boards with an affiliate of a supplier or creditor serving as a director and (c) the number of boards
with retained counselor investment banker serving as a director. The program
also found increases in the numbers of boards with audit, nominating and com.
pensation committees and in director compensation and decreases in the
percentage of membership of these committees affiliated with the issuer.

Accounting Matters
Oversight of the Accounting Profession-The

Commission has historically
monitored, relied on and encouraged initiatives in the standard-settingprocesses
15

of the private sector, subject to Commission oversight, through frequent staff
contact with the private sector standard-setting organizations, attendance at or
participation in meetings, public hearings, and task forces, and review and comment during the standard setting process. Moreover, this contact speeds referral of emerging problems found in company filings to the right private group
for resolution. Although the Commission will continue to seek to fulfill its
statutory responsibility by close oversight of private sector initiatives, it will not
hesitate to take appropriate regulatory action when necessary.
SEC Practice Section and Peer Review-As of June 3D, 1982, 428 accounting firms had voluntarily become members of the Division for CPA Firms of
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and particularly its SEC
Practice Section (SECPS);these firms audit over 90% of all publicly held companies. Firms that are members of the SECPS are subject to certain requirements designed to improve the quality of their audit and accounting practice. Among these are the filing of an annual report, the maintenance of a system
of quality control, and the testing of that system once every three years through
an independent peer review process.
An independent Public Oversight Board (POB) overseesand annually reports
on the SECPS. In its report dated June 30, 1982, the POB concluded that "the
self-regulatory structure is sound and is functioning properly." 36Basedon its
oversight of the 400 peer reviews which had been conducted, the POB concluded that "there is now considerable evidence that the peer review program
is functioning as intended and that section members are taking actions needed to improve the quality of their practice." 37
Although peer reviews provide no assurance that all audit failures will be
identified or avoided in the future, any audit failures that occur should be due
to isolated breakdowns or "people problems," and not to inherent deficiencies
in firms' system of quality control. In a sense, peer reviews should "pay for
themselves" by reducing auditors' risks of liability to those who rely on their
audits.
(1) Access Agreement-Under the terms of an "access" arrangement agreed
to by the SECPS and the Commission, for the first time the Commission's staff
reviewed a sample of the working papers underlying reviews. Based on this
review and the staffs review of the POB's oversight files, the Commission has
determined that it can rely to a great extent on the POB's oversight function
in fulfilling its own oversight responsibilities. Nevertheless,the Commission will
continue to monitor the peer review process by reviewing certain working papers
pursuant to the accessarrangement so that it can periodically evaluate this important self-regulatory initiative and the need for refinements in the process
as a result of changing professional, economic and regulatory conditions.
(2) Sanctions- The true test of any voluntary self-regulatory organization is
whether it appropriately sanctions members that do not meet its standards.
There are two aspects to the SECP's disciplinary procedures. First, the SECPS
may impose sanctions as a result of serious quality control deficiencies uncovered during peer reviews. While the SECPS has not imposed any "formal"
16

sanctions to date, some peer reviewed firms have voluntarily agreed to take
and report prompt appropriate corrective action. The Commission concurs with
the POB's belief that this informal process gives the SECPS the ability to act
promptly and achieves the same result as the imposition of a sanction. The
formal sanction process remains available and should be used when satisfactory corrective measures are not undertaken promptly or where a member firm
chooses not to cooperate. 38
Pursuant to the second aspect of the SECP'sdisciplinary procedures, member
firms are required to report to the Special Investigations Committee (SIC) litigation against them or their personnel and proceedings or investigations publicly announced by a regulatory agency that involve clients or former clients which
are or were registrants and that allege deficiencies in the conduct of an audit
or in reporting thereon in connection with any required filing under the Federal
securities laws. The SIC considers whether these allegations indicate the need
for corrective measures by such firms, changes in professional standards, and/or
appropriate disciplinary measures. The POB believes that the SIC made significant progress during the past year and that, although the structure for imposing sanctions has not yet been tested, the SECPS will appropriately discipline
member firms. 39TheCommission thus far has no basis for reaching any conclusion and believes that visible evidence as to specific SIC activity is critical
to demonstrate to the public the effectiveness of this aspect of the profession's
self-regulation.
The Commission continues to believe that all accounting firms which audit
public companies should join the SECPS. During the past year, a number of
changes were made to SECPS membership requirements which the SECPS
believes will significantly reduce the costs of membership while maintaining
an effective self-regulatory program. The principal change was the elimination
of the requirement that a quality control review panel (QCRP) be appointed
for peer reviews conducted by firms or administered by associations of firms.
The Commission does not object to the SECP's determination to eliminate the
QCRP.The Commission supports other initiatives designed to facilitate membership in the SECPS provided that they do not detract from the credibility of
the self-regulatory program.
FASB Activities-The Commission's staff monitors the activities of the FASB.
While the FASB has continued to perform in a generally satisfactory manner,
progress did not meet earlier expectations. The principal disappointment was
the absence of significant progress on the Conceptual Framework Project. A
description of this Project and certain technical agenda items follows.
(1) Conceptual Framework-An
exposure draft of a concepts statement on
reporting income, cash flows, and financial position was issued in November
1981. Based on review of the comments on the exposure draft, the FASB determined to delay the issuance of a final concepts statement, and urged preparers
to report cash flows in 1982 annual reports in a manner consistent with the
concepts proposed in the exposure draft. The Commission believes that it is
17

important for the FASB to expedite development of the concepts underlying
the reporting of relevant cash flow information.
The FASB also devoted substantial time and resources to the accounting
recognition phase of the project. This phase deals with initial recognition of,
subsequent changes in, and the appropriate way to measure-by historical cost,
current exchange value, or some other measure-assets, liabilities and equity
in the financial statements. The measurement issue must be resolved prompt.
Iy because the FASS's inability to select the appropriate measurement attribute
has delayed this phase significantly and raised considerable doubt about the
ultimate success of the Conceptual Framework Project.
(2) Foreign Currency Translation-A troublesome accounting issue was addressed during the year with the withdrawal of the controversial Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 8 and issuance in its stead of
SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." SFAS No.8 was heavily criticized.
SFAS No. 52 addresses this criticism by providing standards to (1) present information that is generally compatible with the expected economic effects of
a rate change on an entity's cash flows and equity, and (2) reflect in consolidated
financial statements the financial results and relationships as measured in the
primary currency in which each entity conducts its business. Since the implementation of SFAS 52 involves a significant amount of management judgment, the successof the new standard will depend on the good-faith of preparers
and independent auditors. The Commission encourages the FASB to continue
its monitoring effort and to provide timely guidance in identified problem areas.
(3) Other Projects-Other important items on the FASS's agenda include consolidations and the equity method of accounting, accounting for income taxes,
disclosures about oil and gas producing activities, and accounting for pensions,
as well as some narrow emerging practice problems. The Commission expects
that the Board will continue its efforts to provide more timely guidance to
preparers and auditors in a rapidly changing economic environment.
Other Significant Finanael Reporting Issues-During the past year, the Commission continued to be involved with several important financial reporting
issues including efforts to achieve more useful financial reporting for oil and
gas producing companies, and to keep abreast of various international standardsetting activities.
(1) Financial Reporting Practices for Oil and Gas Prooucers-Currently, the
Commission's requirements call for companies to disclose supplementary information about the value of their reserves, changes in those values and an
alternative measure of performance, all based on the reserve recognition method
of accounting (RRA). In February 1981, the Commission concluded that RRA
did not currently possess the requisite degree of certainty for use as a primary
method of accounting and expressed its support for an FASS project to develop
a comprehensive set of disclosures for oil and gas producers. On July 1, 1982,
the Commission proposed amendments to require presentation of supplemental
oil and gas disclosures pursuant to an FASS statement of accounting standards
expected to be issued later in 1982. 40
18

(Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, in November 1982, the FASB
published a final statement calling for such disclosures. Since the Commission
believes that the statement calls for adequate information about oil and gas
producing activities, it amended its rules in December 1982 to require disclosure
of the information specified in the FASB statement.)
(2) International Accounting and Reporting-The
growth of multinational enterprises and the increasing internationalization of the world's capital markets emphasizes the need for a greater degree of uniformity in informational requirements to improve comparability and make disclosures more useful and
understandable.
A number of regional and international bodies are working to narrow the
differences between financial reporting standards and otherwise increase comparability in this area. These include the United Nations (UN), the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Accounting Standards Committee. A related organization, the Intemational Federation of Accountants, issues auditing standards.
While the Commission is not a direct participant in any of these international
activities, it is interested in the various efforts to develop international standards of accounting and reporting. A convergence of requirements would pro.
vide more useful and understandable information to investors and other users
of financial reports, and lessen the differences between reporting requirements
for domestic and foreign private issuers registering securities with the
Commission.
The Office of the Chief Accountant monitors developments in international
accounting and reporting, maintains communications with various national and
international bodies and reviews and sometimes comments on their proposals.
A staff member from the Office of the Chief Accountant serves as an expert
advisor on the United States delegation to the UN and OECD working groups.
While the Commission recognizesthat the harmonization process is a long term
project, it is hopeful that these efforts will continue since they can have a good
effect on the efficiency of the world's capital markets.
Accounting-Related Rules and Interpretations- The Commission's principal accounting requirements are embodied in Regulation SoX(S-X)which governs the
formal and content of, and requirements for, financial statements filed under
the Federal securities laws. The Commission also publicizes its views on various
accounting and financial reporting matters in Financial Reporting Releases
(FRRs).For example, in August 1982, the Commission announced that, while
the FASB considered a final standard, financial reporting should be consistent
with the tentative conclusions of the FASB concerning the proper accounting
treatment for transactions intended to have the same substantive effect as a
legal extinguishment of debt, even though the debtor's obligations are not in
fact discharged as a legal matter."
In addition, the Commission staff periodically issues Staff Accounting
Bulletins (SABs) as a means of informing the financial community of its views
on accounting and disclosure issues."
19

The Commission's accounting-related rules and interpretations serve primarily
to supplement generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as established
by the private sector, by addressing those areas which are unique to Commission filings or where GMP is not explicit. The Commission continually evaluates
its requirements as the private sector changes financial reporting standards,
and modifies or eliminates those requirements which become unnecessary. To
the extent that the FASS and the AICPA accelerate their efforts to enhance
frnancial reporting, the Commission should be able to place more reliance on
private sector standards.
Sunset Review-During the past year, the Commission has continued to
devote substantial resourcesto a comprehensive review of its existing accountingrelated rules and interpretations. The objective of this review is to ensure that
the Commission's requirements remain necessary and cost-effective in today's
environment and that they contribute to the usefulness of financial reporting
without imposing unjustified burdens on registrants. As a result of this effort,
the Commission has made progress in reducing and simplifying its rules without
sacrificing the integrity of financial disclosure documents. Some specific initiatives in this area are discussed below.
(1) Codification of Finenciel Reporting Policies-In April 1982, the Comrnission issued FRR No. 1 which announced the publication of a codification of
certain existing Accounting Series Releases(ASRs). Of the 307 ASRs the Com.
mission had issued since 1937, 207 dealt with general accounting issues and
100 addressed various accounting and auditing matters in an enforcement
context. Of the general ASRs, 57 had been rescinded earlier and 79 were no
longer relevant, but portions of the remaining ASRs were codified because they
contained current and meaningful guidance for persons complying with the
Commission requirements. The codification is indexed and organized in a logical
manner and should provide a useful reference for the Commission's current
published views on accounting and auditing matters relating to financial reporting. It will be updated by future FRRs where appropriate.
In a related action, the Commission published Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release(MER) No. 1 as the first in a new series of releases which
will be used to announce accounting and auditing matters that are related to
Commission enforcement activities. AAER No. 1 includes a topical index for
the material included in the 100 enforcement-related ASRs to facilitate reference
to specific areas addressed by the Commission in those releases.
(2) Regulation S.X-As part of the continuing efforts to update and streamline
the Comrnlssion's regulations, the Commission has: (a) adopted uniform instructions for the presentation of pro forma financial information; 43(b)revised
the requirements for filing financial statements of businesses acquired or to
be acquired;" (c) simplified and standardized the requirements for disclosure
of a ratio of earnings to fixed charges; 45(d)proposed to revise the financial
statement and industry guide requirements for bank holding companies; 46and
(e) proposed to revise the financial statement requirements for investment companies (adopted December 6, 1982). 47Uponadoption of the proposed rules

20

regarding financial statement requirements for bank holding companies and
investment companies, the Commission will have substantially completed its
project, initiated in 1980, to establish uniform requirements applicable to virtually all filings with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act and Exchange Act as well as annual reports to security holders prepared in accordance
with the Commission's proxy rules.
(3) Scope of Seroices by Independent Accountants-In January 1982, the Commission announced the rescission of the rule requiring disclosure in proxy
statements about nonaudit services performed by independent accountants for
their audit clients. The Commission rescinded that rule because it concluded
that, although information about nonaudit services is important to enable the
Commission and others to monitor this activity by accountants, it is not generally of sufficient utility to investors to justify continuation of the disclosure requirement. In addition, the Commission noted that information about nonaudit
sevices performed by accountants will continue to be available to interested
persons because the SECPS revised its membership provisions to require
member firms to disclose additional information about their nonaudit service
activity in public annual reports filed with the SECPS that cover years ending
on or after January 1, 1982.

Regulation of the Securities M.arkets
Key 1982 Results
Fiscal 1982 saw many major developments in the regulation of securities
markets, while the industry smoothly handled a major market surge, commencing with the first 100 million share day on the New York Stock Exchange on
August 18. Commission action freed-up more than an estimated $800 million
in capital and cost savings to the securities industry, in addition to hundreds
of millions of dollars in estimated benefits to the public annually from the Commission's broker-dealerexamination program. Theseactions enhancedthe financial condition of the securities industry without adverse impact on investor
protection.
Specifically, recognitioin of the securities industry's improved financial and
operational condition, the Commission made adjustments to its net capital
rules, that allowed more productive use of more than $500 million of industry
capital previously held in reserves. An additional $200 million was freed up
through expanding permitted usesof letters of credit for clearing fund deposit
and stock loan collateral requirements. In addition, approval of a depository
linkage providing a nationwide institutional delivery system is expected to
realize annual cost savings exceeding $100 million.
In the national market system area, an experimental linkage of exchange
and over-the-counter (OTC) trading in 30 listed stocks commenced and is being carefully monitored by the Division of Market Regulation, the Directorate
of Economic and Policy Analysis and the securities industry. In addtion, the
Commission proposed an order exposure rule, based on principles developed
by a Securities Industry Association (SIA) committee, which addressedconcerns
over brokerage firms internalizing execution of their order flow. Also, in May
1982, Rule llAa2-1 became effective, which has resulted in the designation,
as of September 30, 1982, of 60 actively traded OTC securities as national
market system securities. The primary effect of this designation has been last
sale reporting to the public on a real time basis.
The order exposure initiative and the planning that assured smooth handling of the record trading volume are exceptional examples of the important
role that the securities industry and the self-regulatory organizations fulfill in
realizing the goals of the Federal securities laws.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, following enactment of the initial
portion of the historic SEClCFTC Accord, the Commission approved the listing
and trading of GNMA, treasury and foreign currency options products proposed by a number of national securities exchanges. If viable markets for these
new products develop, they will facilitate government and mortgage financ-

23

ing, foreign trade and hedging the risk of fluctuating interest and foreign exchange rates.
Securities Markets, Facilities and Trading
The National Market System-In April 1981 the Commissioin ordered" an
automated interface between the Computer Assisted Execution System (CAES)
operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the Intermarket Trading System (ITS)operated by seven national securities exchanges,
which became operational on May 17, 1982. In addition, the Commission approved the NASD's trade-through rules on May 6, 1982,49 which are designed
to ensure protection from inferior executions in linked stocks, whether trades
occur on or off the exchange floor.
In 1982, ITS continued to provide investors with improved execution
capabilities, resulting in an estimated annual savings of over $60 million.
The Commission also obseved another year of off-board trading pursuant
to Rule 19c-3 under the Exchange Act. In this regard, the Commission recognized that elimination of off-board principal restrictions involved potential order
exposure concerns and it proposed alternative ways to address these concerns.
The Commission has re-released for comment a rule, based on principles
developed by a special committee of the Securities Industry Association, which
would apply similar order exposure requirements to both off-board and exchange market makers. 50
On February 11,1982, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule llAcI1 under the Exchange Act governing the collection and dissemination of quotation information. 51 The amendments permit, under certain circumstances,
regional exchange specialists and "third market makers" to disseminate quotations on a voluntary, rather than mandatory, basis. The amendments are intended to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on secondary market
makers and enhance the accuracy and reliability of quotation information.
National System for the Clearance and Settlement of Securities TransactionsThe Commission approved proposed rule changes of the Midwest Clearing Corporation (MCC), Pacific Clearing Corporation (PCC) and Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia (SCCP) to create a unified, nationwide system for the
comparison of OTe trades. 52
The Commission approved a proposed rule change of the NASD which requires certain NASD Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) market makers
to use the facilities of a registered clearing agency to clear and settle NASDAQ
securities transactions when the clearing agency facilities are within 25 miles
of the market maker."
Also approved were proposed rule changes of the Midwest Securities Trust
Company (MSTC)54and the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (Philadel)"
establishing, through a linage with the Depository Trust Company (DTC), a
nationwide institutional delivery system that provides efficient communications
among brokers, banks and investment managers regarding the settlement of
24

institutional and other securities transactions. The linkage permits participants
in one securities depository to complete institutional trades with participants
in another securities depository and, thereby, to realize annual cost savings in
excess of $100 million.
In orders approving temporary proposed rule changes of the Midwest Clearing Corporation (MCC) and MSTC that enabled volume fee discounts, the Commission reconfirmed its policy that clearing corporations cannot levy fees on
securities transactions flowinq through interfaces. 56
CnC/SEC Accord-In December 1981, the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that they had reached an
Accord clarifying their respective jurisdictions over trading in certain new options, futures and options on futures products. In February 1982, specific
legislative changes to implement that Accord were proposed in the Securities
Accord Amendments of 198257and in certain provisions of the Futures Trading
Act of 1982. 58
The bills amending the Federal securities laws were passed in identical form
by both houses in September, and the securities laws amendments were signed by President Reaganon October 13, 1982.59The legislation clarifies not only
the Commission's jurisdiction over options on all securities, groups or indices
of securities, certificates of deposit and options on foreign currency traded on
a national securities exchange but also the CFTC's jurisdiction over futures (and
options on futures) on exempted securities (other than municipal securities) and
on certain broad-based indices and groups of securities. Pending further study,
futures trading on individual corporate and municipal securities is prohibited.
Options Trading-Proposals submitted by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the American Stock Exchange (Amex), the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange (Phlx) and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) regarding options on various GNMA's, United States Treasury securities, and foreign currencies were approved by the Commission on October 14, 1982.60(Trading in
Treasury options began on the CBOE and Amex on October 22, 1982.) In addition, the Amex has proposed trading in options on certificates of deposit
(CDs).61The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), CBOE and Amex all have
sought permission to trade "stock index" options that would be settled in cash.62
The NASD has also submitted a plan for options trading which includes index
options." Finally, the Commission has received "stock group; options proposals from the Amex, the CBOE, the NYSE and the Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE)
that would be settled by delivery of securities."
The Commission also adopted a new simplified disclosure system for
options-an optional registration form, Form S-20, and new Rules 153b, 135b,
and 134a under the Securities Act as well as Rule 9b-1 under the Exchange
Act.65 Under this new system, the risks, uses and mechanics of standardized
options trading area set forth in a basic "core" disclosure document. A simplified
prospectus (Part I, Form S-20) containing additional information about OCe.
as the issuer and the clearing agency of the options, is available through the
exchanges.

25

Market Manipulation-On March 16, 1982, the Commission published for
comment amendments to Exchange Act Rule 10b-6 which governs trading in
securities.w lf adopted, these amendments would define the term "distribution"
for purposes of the rule, codify existing staff positions concerning some of the
exceptions to the rule, and relax the prohibitions of the rule to permit participants in a distribution of securities to continue trading such securities until
three business days before the commencement of the sale of the securities being distributed.
Stabilization Reports-On August 31, 1982, the Commission published for
comment proposed amendments to Rules 17a-2 and 1Ob-7under the Exchange
Act and rescission of related Form X-17A_1.67 The Commission is proposing
that the requirement for reporting certain transactions, under Rule 17a-2, be
rescinded and that the rule be amended to require only that a manager of an
underwriting syndicate retain, in a separate file, records of all stabilizing transactions.
Exemptions {rom Shoo Sale Rule-On June 1, 1982, the Commission granted,
on a one-year trial basis, an exepmtion from the "tick test" provisions of Rule
1Oa-1, the short sale rule. The exemption permits a broker-dealer that has acquired a security while acting in the capacity of a block positioner" to disregard
a short position in that security in computing its net long position if and to
the extend that such short position is and has been for at least five business
days the subject of one or more offsetting positions created in the course of
"bona fide arbitrage," "risk arbitrage" or "bona fide hedge" activities.
Regulation of Brokers, Dealers, Municipal Securities Dealers and
Transfer Agents
Broker-DealerReporting Requirements-On December 10, 1981, the Commission adopted new Rule 17a-8 under the Exchange Act, which enables SROs
to enforce existing regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970.68
These regulations, among other things, require broker-dealers to make reports
and maintain records on domestic currency transactions of more than $10,000
and the import and export of currency and monetary instruments of $5,000
or more.
Fmancial Responsibility Requirements-During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted major revisions to the uniform net capital and the customer protection rules, Rules 15c3-1 and 15c3-3, respectlvely.s? These revisions included
the lowering of the ratio of minimum required net capital for those brokerdealers electing the alternative method of computing net capital, from 4% of
aggregate debit items to 2%. The early warning and capital lock-in levels were
also reduced from 7% and 6%, respectively, to 5%. 70
These changes were predicated on the industry's improved financial and
operational condition, and were intended to enable securities firms to use these
funds to make better markets and improve services to the investing public.

26

It is estimated that over $500 million of securities industry capital was freed-up
as a result of these changes.
Broker-Dealers' Carrying Agreements-On
February 19, 1982, the Commission approved a rule change to amend NYSE Rules 382 and 405.71 This rule
change sets forth the responsibilities of member broker-dealers when handling
customer accounts that are introduced on a fully disclosed basis by one brokerdealer to another under a carrying agreement. The amended rule requires all
"fully disclosed" carrying agreements between introducing and carrying
organizations to identify specifically, allocate between the parties and, at a
minimum, address their respective functions and responsibilities for seven particular areas.
Broker-Dealer and Transfer Agent Examinations-During fiscal year 1982, there
was increased emphasis on improving the efficiency, thoroughness, and overall
quality of regional office examinations, particularly oversight examinations of
SRO member firms. During the fiscal year, the staff developed sophisticated
computer programs for the analysisof information and conducted severaleducational programs for regional office regulatory staff. In addition, the staff reviewed
approximately 230 transfer agent examination reports and 900 regional office
broker-dealer examination reports in order to identify national concerns and
assist the regions. The Commission also adopted Rule 15b2-2, under which
SROs examine newly registered broker-dealers, thereby avoiding duplication
of Commissioin and SRO resources.
Such efforts to improve the Commission's broker-dealer examination program are necessary in order that the Commission's limited resourcescan meet
its considerable ongoing responsibilities, and respond to extraordinary problem
areas, such as the collapse this last year of the Denver "hot issue" or penny
stock market.
Administration of the SECO Program-Pursuant to the Exchange Act, brokerdealers who do not join the NASD are subject to direct regulation by the Commission through its SECO program with respect to professional qualifications
and just and equitable principles of trade. Following a Division study of this
program the Commission, in May, transmitted draft legislation to Congress to
abolish the SECO program and require all broker-dealers transacting an OTC
securities business to join a registered national securities association. The proposed legislation was under consideration by Congress at the close of the fiscal
year. 72
Self-Underwriting by SECO Broker-Dealers-On
January 7, 1982, the Commission approved an amendment to Rule 15blO-9, the so-called "selfunderwriting" rule.?" the amendment created a conditional exception to the rule
for SECO broker-dealers that limit their business to participation in the offer
and sale of securities issued by an affiliate which is not a broker-dealer.
Securities Con/irmations-On
August 19, 1982, the Commission withdrew proposed Rule 15c2-12 and a proposed amendment to Rule lOb-lO, the customer
confirmation rule, that would have required disclosure on confirmations of the
amount of any mark-up, mark-down, or similar remuneration received by any

27

broker-dealer effecting a "riskless" principal transaction in a debt security." At
the same time, the Commission proposed to amend Rule lOb-10 by: (1) providing a limited exception from the immediate delivery requiements of the rule
for certain "account management plans" offered by broker-dealers; and (2) requiring disclosures pertaining to yield and call features in transactions in debt
securities, except municipal securities."
Municipal Securities Brokers and Dealers- The Commission continued to consult with the bank regulatory agencies with respect to bank municipal securities
activities. In addition, the Commission staff issued several no-action and interpretive letters with respect to securities activities by municipal broker-dealers.
Fingerprinling- The Commission proposed amendments to Rule 17f-2 that
would simplify the process for and reduce the cost of, claiming exemptions
for certain personnel from the fingerprinting requirement under the Exchange
Act. 76

Transfer Agent Regulation- The Commission proposed rules establishing
minimum standards for registered transfer agents. The proposed rules would
ensure: (1) the prompt and accurate creation and maintenance of issuer
securityholder records; and (2) the safeguarding of funds and securities used
in connection with transfer activities when those funds and securities are in the
possession or control of transfer aqents."
Oversight of Self-Regulatory Organizations
National Securities Exchanges-As of September 30, 1982, ten exchanges
were registered with the Commission as national securities exchanges. During
the fiscal year the Commission granted applications by exchanges to delist 90
equity and 38 debt issues, and granted applications by issuers requesting
withdrawal from listing and registration for 20 equity issuesand ten debt issues.
In addition, during the fiscal year the Commission granted 272 applications
by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges.
The exchanges reported to the Commission 334 final disciplinary actions
imposing a variety of sanctions upon member firms and their employees. This
contrasts to 309 actions reported in fiscal 1981.
During the fiscal year, the Commission received from the exchanges 116
findings of proposed rule changes under Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act.
Among the significant rule filings aproved by the Commission, in addition to
rules designed to implement trading in new options products, were: (1) a
Philadelphia Stock Exchange pilot program relating to the allocation of new
listings to specialistsand the reallocation of listings due to substandard specialist
performance; 78 and (2) the creation of the Midwest Stock Exchanges' automated
execution system and the revision of the Boston Stock Exchanges' guaranteed
execution system."?
During the fiscal year, the Commission modified the exemptions provided
to regional stock exchanges from Rule 11b-1 under the Exchange Act so that
each exchange now has rules imposing certain specific obligations on its
28

specialists with respect to any security that is listed on its exchange but is not
listed on either the Amex or the NYSE.80
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.-The NASD is the only national
securities association registered with the Commission. At the close of the fiscal
year, the NASD, which has 3,577 members, reported to the Commission the
disposition of 429 significant disciplinary actions and 248 summary actions by
the NASDAQ Trading Committee, as compared with approximately 500 and
336 a year earlier. In addition, the Commission received from the NASD 18
filings of proposed rule changes, down 11 from 1981.
One of the significant NASD rules approved by the Commission during the
fiscal year adopted standards for NASD members and their associated persons
who participate in a public offering of a direct participation program (DPP).81
The rule change adds an appendix to the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice to
prescribe standards for the offering of DPPs in the areas of investor suitabihty,
disclosure of material information, and underwriter compensation. Adoption
of the rule change culminates severalyears of effort by the NASD and the Commission to establish written standards for the sale of DPPs.
Swveilfance and Compliance Inspections-During the fiscal year, the staff con.
ducted 22 inspections of self-regulatory organization (SRO)market surveillance,
disciplinary, compliance and operational programs. In all of these inspections,
upon notice of the inspection findings, each SRO has taken steps to respond
to the staff recommendation.
Specifically, inspections of the PSE's equity and options trading programs
disclosed only one major concern, a failure to institute disciplinary proceedings
against members in certain cases. Inspections of the Amex Stockwatch and
Market Surveillance units and disciplinary program disclosd that an audit trail
would enhance surveillance and that the exchange did not always bring charges
against members in appropriate cases. An inspection of the CBOE disclosed
certain deficiencies in the automated trading information collected by the
exchange.
A special inspection of the NYSE'sstockwatch surveillance program disclosed
that the NYSE failed to recognize a major manipulation in one of its listed
stocks. Other NYSE inspections reviewed the NYSE's efforts to develop a complete transaction audit trail. An audit trail would not only enable the NYSE to
conduct adequate surveillance of trading on its floor but would also result in a
reduction of its member firms' transaction reconciliation costs. In August 1982,
the NYSE proposed that an audit trail be implemented in stages in conjunction with the development and expansion of various automated systems at the
exchange, which are scheduled to be completed in January 1985 and that in
the interim, existing exchange and member firm systems and procedures be
modified to provide an effective audit trail in early 1983.
During 1982, the staff conducted comprehensive inspections of the Phlx's
equities and options trading programs. The inspections disclosed that the Phlx
had taken commendable steps to remedy deficiencies noted in previous
inspections.

29

At the end of the fiscal year, surveillance inspections that were in progress
included the NYSE Stockwatch Department, CSE market operations and
surveillance, and the NASD surveillance programs for OTC trading in stocks
quoted in the NASDAQ system.
The staff conducted inspections of four NASD District Offices concerning
investigations of customer complaints and terminations of registered representatives from employment for cause. In addition, the staff inspected the NASD
Denver District Office to evaluate, in particular, the officer's financial surveillance
of member broker-dealers active in the Denver penny stock market. The staff
also inspected the NASD Central Registration Depository. The staff also conducted two inspections focusing on the role of self-regulators in the prevention
or detection of major alleged frauds. These inspections were still in progress
at the end of the fiscal year.
The staff worked with a joint SRO task force, the Intermarket Surveillance
Group (ISG), in its efforts to develop an effective intermarket surveillance system.
The staff also conducted limited inspections of SRO intermarket surveillance
programs.
ClearingAgencies-Significant progress was made in the review of applications for full registration of clearing agencies under Section 17A(b) of the Exchange Act in accordance with the Division's standards for registered clearing
aqencies.v ln connection with its review, the Commission cancelled the clearing registration of Bradford Securities Processing Services, Inc. and TAD
Depository Corporatiorr" and extended until September 30, 1983, the temporary
registrations of, and registration proceedings regarding, the 11 active clearing
agencies. 84
The Commission also approved several proposed rule changes to enhance
clearing agencies' systems for controlling financial exposure, particularly from
participant insolvencies. For example, the National Securities Clearing Corporation increased its clearing fund to reflect variable use of its Envelope Settlement System," and established comprehensive admission and continuance standards, together with an enhanced surveillance program. 86
Market Oversight and Suroeil/ance System- The Market Oversight and
Surveillance System (MOSS) was initiated on a pilot basis in 1980. It is designed to automate the Commission's surveillance and oversight capabilities. In
August 1981, at the Commission's initiative, the SROs submitted a proposal
for an SRO intermarket surveillance program, to which the Commission would
have ready access. The SRO program, when fully implemented, should result
in significantly enhanced SRO surveillance and provide an alternative to the
surveillance capabilities of MOSS. In the interest of avoiding unnecessary costs
and duplication, the Commission has therefore deferred significant enhancement of the MOSS project, pending implementation and evaluation of the SRO
program.
During fiscal year 1982, the MOSS project continued on a pilot basis. It was
moderately refined and expanded from 31 percent to 50 percent coverage of

30

listed stocks. During this period, the Commission has closely monitored the
progress of the SRO project.
Pursuant to the requirement in the Congressional budget authorization for
MOSS, the Commission submitted reports to Congress on the MOSS project
on April 1, 1982 and October 1, 1982, which provide greater detail on MOSS
and SRO projects.
Applications for ReEntry-During the fiscal year, the Division of Market
Regulation received 85 applications to permit persons subjet to statutory disqualifications, as defined in Section 3(a) (39) of the Exchange Act, to become
associated with broker-dealers. The following SRO's filed such applications: (1)
NASD-60 applications; (2) NYSE-23 applications; and (3) Amex-two applications. Five of the 85 applications were subsequently withdrawn, 72 were pro.
cessed and 8 were pending at year end.
Municipal Securities Rulemaking fuard-As
in the case of the NASD, the Commission reviews proposed rule changes of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). During the last nine months of the fiscal year, the MSRB
filed 12 proposed rule changes.
The Commission approved three rule changes by the MSRB regarding rhe
formulae for calculating the yield and dollar price on municipal securities, MSRB
Rule G-33. 87
The Commission also approved a rule change by the MSRB which, among
other things, allows either side of a transaction to void a trade if the CUSIP
numbers of both sides are not identical. 88

Investment Companies and Advisers
Key 1982 Results
During the fiscal year the Commission completed and took remedial action
in a record number of investment company and adviser inspections while continuing a comprehensive program of simplifying the regulations which govern
investment companies and advisers.
Inspection Program-A Record Result-The Commission inspects the investment and operational activities of investment companies and investment advisers to ensure that they follow the disclosure in the prospectus and registration statement and comply with applicable statutes. The program deters abuses
and minimizes the risk of loss to investors.
During fiscal 1982, the Commission completed 1,065 investment company
and investment adviser inspections, a record number which represents a 26 %
increase over the 848 inspections completed in fiscal 1981. Improved productivity was made possible this year, despite budgetary constraints and personnel reductions, through the development of a computer program which: (1) identifies the relative priority each adviser should have, in terms of the frequency
of inspections, based upon certain client and asset-under-management data;
and (2) determines the relative risk inherent in each adviser's operations to gUide
the scope of the inspection procedures used by examiners. Based on findings
of the inspections completed during fiscal 1982, the staff found it necessary
to take remedial action in 77% of the cases-an increase of about 15 percentage points over the results in each of the preceding two years Thus, the use
of the new selection and risk appraisal techniques has improved the cost/benefit
ratio of inspection without reducing either the effectiveness of the inspection
program or the level of investor protection it affords.

Disclosure Study
During fiscal 1982, the Division of Investment Mangement's Disclosure Study
conducted a comprehensive re-examination of open-end management investment companies' registration and reporting requirements. At the end of the
year, the study was considering a proposal which will permit such companies
to reduce the length and complexity of their prospectuses and, at the same
time, aid readability and facilitate investors' understanding of the prospectus.
In fiscal 1982, the Commission revised Form N-1Q, the quarterly reporting
form for management investment cornpanies." The requirement for reporting
portfolio changes was shifted from a quarterly to an annual basis because: (1)
the staff made little internal use of the quarterly information; and (2) the institutional disclosure program established under Section 13(f) of the Exchange

33

Act sets appropriate disclosure requirements for all institutions, including investment companies.
The adoption of Rule 487 under the Securities Act permits most registration statements filed by unit investment trust series to become effective
automatically, if certain specified conditions are met. Generally, the rule
eliminates staff review of registration statements that do not present new
disclosure issues.Similarly, Rule 486, relating to automatic effectivenessof posteffective amendments to registration statments filed by registered separate accounts of insurance companies, eliminates staff review of routine filings. Rule
486 and Rule 487 were both adopted in May, 1982.

Investment Company Act Study
The Investment Company Act Study Group was formed in 1978 to review
the Investment Company Act and the rules, regulations and administrative practices thereunder in order to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens, without
compromising investor protection. The Commission has since adopted a series
of rules which afford exemptive relief from certain Investment Company Act
prohibitions. Generally, these rules codify exemptive orders previously granted
by the Commission.
During fiscal 1982, the Commission adopted Rule 180 which conditionally
exempts from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, interests and
participations issued in connection with the tax-qualified retirement plans commonly known as "H.R. 10" plans. 90 In addition, the Commission proposed Rule
2a-7 which would permit money market funds to maintain stable net asset values
per share through amortized cost valuation" or "penny-rounding" pricing.92 Proposed Rule 17f-5 wold permit domestic investment companies to maintain their foreign securities abroad in the custody of foreign banks or
depositories under certain conditions."

Bank-related Mutual Funds
Increased competition for savings and investment dollars has resulted in the
linking of money market funds with depository institutions in new ways. During fiscal 1982, the Commission considered a number of issues raised by these
new arrangements and wrote to bank regulatory authorities to seek their views
on their legality under the Federal banking laws. The Commission is reviewing
the disclosure related to such arrangements and proposes to issue a release
to clarify the disclosure and other securities law requirements for bank-related
funds.
In addition, in September of this year, the Commission held public hearings
to examine the general legal and policy issues that are raised when a mutual
fund proposes to purchase certificates of deposit of banking institutions in
reciprocity for sales of fund shares. 94Atthe end of the fiscal year, the Division
of Investment Management was in the process of evaluating the testimony
presented at the hearing.

34

Insurance Products
In October 1981, the Commission adopted Rule 6c-6(T) under the Investment Company Act, 95which provided insurance company separate accounts
and others with temporary exemptive relief from various provisions of that Act
to the extent necessary to permit them to take various actions in response to
the impact of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Revenue Ruling 81-225, issued
on September 25, 1981. Ruling 81-225 announced the IRS'sdetermination that,
prior to the annuity starting date, the owner of a variable annuity contract rather
than the insurance company sponsoring the separate account offering the contract, would be deemed to be the owner of the shares of the open-end investment company serving as the contract's funding portfolio. Thus, the earnings
and gains from the shares would be includible in the contract-owner's gross income for Fedearl income tax purposes. As a result, many sponsoring insurance
companies found it necessaryto create so-called "clone funds," and to substitute
sharesof the clone funds for those of an existing portfolio company. Rule 6c-6(T)
eliminated the need for individual exemptive applications to be filed with and
approved by the Commission in connection with these actions. In the same
release, the Commission proposed permanent Rule 6c-6, which was adopted
on September 21, 1982.98 That rule, among other things, expanded the nature
and modified the scope of the exemptive relief provided by the temporary rule.
On September 20, 1982, the Commission proposed Rule 11a-2 under the
Investment Company Act.97 This rule is the first of a planned series of proposals
to codify the standards developed with respect to certain so-called "start-up"
exemptive applications filed by insurance company separate accounts and
others. If adopted, Rule 11a-2 would eliminate the need for separate accounts
and others to file individual applications seeking Commission approval of terms
of certain routine exchange offers.

Investment Advisers Act Study
During fiscal 1982, upon the recommendation of the Investment Advisers
Act Study Group, the Commission adopted amendments that clarify and
simplify its investment adviser registration, reporting and disclosure requirernents." Among other things, the amendments eliminated the unaudited balance sheet requirement which had been applicable to approximately 80% of
investment adviser registrants who were required to file unaudited balance sheets
with their registration applications and annually thereafter. The Commission
also adopted temporary amendments to its investment adviser registration requirements deleting a number of items from Part I of Form ADV, the investment adviser registration application form, and is considering making the deletions permanent. 99Whilethe information contained in the deleted items is useful
to the Commission in its understanding of the investment advisory industry,
it is not essential to the Commission's investment adviser regulatory program.

35

Significant Applications and Interpretations
Unifonds-During
behalf

of Unifonds,

1982, the Commission
considered an application
filed on
a West Germand mutual fund, that sought relief pursuant

to Sections 6(c) and 7(d) of the Investment Company Act. Since the civil law
of West Germany comprehensively
regulates West German investment
companies and also permits the sale of securities within its jurisdiction
by investment companies organized under the laws of the United States, the Commission considered to what extent the securities laws of the United States could
defer to those of West Germany. The Commission
decided that if Unifonds
would modify its proposal in certain respects, the Commission
could take the
first procedural
steps toward granting the exemptive
relief that had been requested by issuing a notice of the filing of the application.
(After the close of
the fiscal year, (Jmfonds filed an amendment
agreeing to file a registration
statement
and disclosure
documents
comparable
to those filed by United
States companies, to withdraw its request for exemption from the enforcement
provisions of the Investment Company Act, and to arrange for an irrevocable
letter of credit in an amount equal to 5% of the value of the outstanding
shares
of Unifonds held by shareholders in the United Staes to satisfy any judgments
against the company obtained by such shareholders.)

Fiduciary Trust Company of New York-The

Economic

Recovery

Tax Act

permits an employee who participates
in a pension trust qualified under Section 401 of the Internal REvenue Code (Section 401 trust) to deduct from his
gross income certain qualified voluntary contributions
to his account in a Section 401 trust or to an individual
retirement
account (IRA). On November
9,
1981, Fiduciary Trust Company of New York (Fiduciary) requested the staffs
assurance that it would not recommend
that the Commission
take any enforcement action if Fiduciary should act as trustee of Seciton 401 trusts, which consrsted solely of such qualified voluntary employee contributions,
and invest their
assets in its pooled funds which consisted solely of assets of Section 410 trusts.
The staff granted Fiduciary's request, applying the exception in the Investment
Company Act for Section 401 trusts and collective trust funds maintained
by
a bank consisting solely of assets of such trusts.
The Woodside Group-On March 15, 1982, the staff advised The Woodside
Group that it would not recommend
any enforcement
action with respect to
the operation of companies which would primarily acquire leases entered into
by state and local governmental
entities as the means of acquisition
by such
entities of various equipment
and facilities. The staffs positon enables such
companies to operate without registering as investment companies in reliance
upon the exception under the Investment Company Act for companies primarily
engaged in the business of acquiring obligations
representing
part or all of the
sales price of merchandise
or of making loans to prospective
purchasers of
specified merchandise.

36

Institutional Disclosure Program
Money managers that fall within the definition of an "institutional investment
manager", in Section 13(tX5)of the Exchange Act, and that meet certain criteria
set out in Rule 13f-1 under the Exchange Act, file reports on a quarterly calendar basis on Form 13F. Managers required to file 13F reports disclose certain
equity holdings of the accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. In fiscal 1982, Form 13F reports were filed on behalf of 1,000 institutional
investment managers for holdings totalling almost $500 billion dollars.
Form 13F reports are available to the public at the Commission's Public Reference Room promptly after filing. Also available for public inspection at the
Public Reference Room are two tabulations of the information contained in Form
13F reports. The first of the tabulations includes a listing, arranged according
to the individual security, showing the number of shares held and the name
of the money manager reporting the holding. The second tabulation is a summary listing showing the number of shares of that security reported by all institutional investment managers filing reports. The tabulations are normally
available between 10-14 days after the end of the 45-day period for filing Form
13F reports for a particular calendar quarter.
Both tabulations are produced by an independent contractor selected through
the competitive bidding process. The contractor provides its services to the Commission without charge, and is required to make a variety of specified tabulations available to the public at reasonable prices within 10 days after receipt
of the reports.

37

Other Litigation and Legal Work
The Commission, through its Office of the General Counsel, participates in
a substantial amount of litigation in addition to the litigation it conducts before
trial courts in its injunctive actions and its own administrative proceedings.
Through this litigation, the Commission seeks to insure that its enforcement
program is carried out effectively, that judicial interpretation of the Federal
securities laws affords adequate protection to investors and that Commission
enforcement actions and investigations are not impeded by law suits brought
against the agency or its staff.

Key 1982 Results
In all, during the year 34 appellate matters relating to injunctive cases were
concluded, with only two outcomes unfavorable to the Commission; 21 cases
relating to Commission orders, with three adverse results; and 18 amicus matters, with five adverse to the Commission.
As to overall workload, the Office handled 251 litigation matters during the
past fiscal year, many of which are still pending. This included 62 appellate
matters before the Supreme Court and Federal courts of appeals in which a
party subject to a Commission injunctive action challenged the lower court's
resolution of the case favorable to the Commission or, much less frequently,
the Commission challenged an unfavorable outcome. The Office also handled
38 appellate matters in which efforts were made to overturn Commission orders,
primarily those issued in administrative proceedings conducted by the Commission or those affirming the outcome of proceedings conducted by the various
self-regulatory organizations against broker-dealers. In 58 instances during the
year, Commission participation as a friend of the court was considered or undertaken in litigation conducted by private parties, to give the court its views on
significant questions concerning the interpretation and scope of the Federal
securities laws. In addition, the Office handled more than 90 other litigation
matters before the Commission or in the Federal trial courts, including 23 suits
brought against the Commissioners or the Commission's staff, and 19 suits
under the various public information statutes.
In addition to litigation, the Office of the General Counsel is involved in significant legislative and regulatory work. For example, the Office has assisted the
Commission in proposing legislation which would permit civil fines to be levied
against inside traders; proposed repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act (discussed under "Public Utility Holding Companies," page 47); assisted
the Commission in resolving its jurisdictional dispute with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (discussed under "Regulation of the Securities
Markets," page 25) ; and supported amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Prac-

39

tices Act and the Glass Steagall Act. The following is a summary of the status
of these legislative initiatives and other projects of significance to the Commission and the public, as well as a discussion of major areas of the Office's
litigation, along with some of the more important issueslitigated during the year.

Litigation
Litigation Related to Commission lnjunctiue Actions-In fiscal 1982, 34 appellate matters relating to Commission injunctive actions were litigated and
concluded. In only two of those matters were the results not favorable to the
Commission.
This category involved mostly appeals in which a party attempts to reverse
the trial court's resolution of a Commission injunctive action. The Commission addressed issues concerning significant problem areas of compliance with
the Federal securities laws. For example, one important issue arising over the
years in Commission enforcement actions is the extent to which a wrongdoer
should be required to surrender the profits of his wrongdoing, which often may
then be made available to defrauded investors. In fiscal year 1982, two courts
addressed this critical question. In one court of appeals the Commission successfully asked that all members of the court rehear a case. The appellate panel
had previously set aside the trial court's determination that a corporate official,
who had obtained profits by trading in securities on the basis of information
not available to members of the public, should disgorge $53,000 in illegal profits. Instead, the panel found that only $11,000 should be disgorged. 100 The Com.
mission subsequently argued to the full court of appeals that, in Commission
enforcement actions, the standard of disgorgement should force wrongdoers
to give up all profits and not merely those recognized before the discovery of
the fraud. The Commission asserted that principles of unjust enrichment as
well as effective enforcement of the securities laws require that the Commission be able to insure that insider trading violations are not profitable.
In another court of appeals, the Commission was able to overturn a district
court decision denying disgorgement. 101 The court of appeals concluded that,
at a minimum, disgorgement of a substantial sum of money should be required,
and the trial court subsequently ordered the defendant to disgorge a sum in
excess of $140,000. The apellate court in that case also agreed with the Commission on another important point, holding that a corporate official can be
liable for fraud not only where he deals with an investor directly, but also through
an intermediary.
The appellate litigation handled by the Office also involves significant questions concerning the various reporting requirements of the Federal securities'
laws. In these cases,the Commission seeks to insure that members of the public
are provided with the information necessary to make an informed investment
decision. Of note this year, one court of appeals considered the requirement
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act that a filing be made with the Commission and sent to a company, when there has been an aggregation of stock-

40

holdings totalling more than 5%, in order to alert the company and its stockholders to that aggregation_102 In that case, the trial court had found that
a group with such a stockholding had been formed and had subsequently sold
the stock of its members at a premium of $12-118 per share over market. The
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with the Commission and the trial court that a group may exist even though its members
are not committed to acquisition, holding, or disposition of the securities on
specific terms. Instead, the members must simply combine to further a common objective. The court also held that members of the group need not have
voting control over the securities; power to dispose of the securities can also
establish beneficial ownership. (After the close of the fiscal year, a petition for
certiorari was filed with the Supreme Court seeking review of the Second Circuit decision.)
The vitality of the Commission's enforcement program can be undermined
if persons subject to injunctions against violating provisions of the Federal
securities laws have these court orders vacated. Last year, in a case pending
in the court of appeals, the Commission urged that a defendant who has consented to an injunctive decree is not entitled to be relieved from his bargain
unless circumstances unforeseen at the time of the original decree cause him
grievous harm. 103
Utigation Concerning Commission Orders-In fiscal 1982, 21 caseswere resolved involving judicial review by persons aggrieved by various Commission orders
including disciplinary actions by the Commission, and Commission orders on
review of such action by national securities exchangesand the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Resolution was not favorable to the Commission in only three cases. Like injunctive actions, these administrative cases frequently involve issues central to the Commission's enforcement program and
thus to the integrity of the securities markets. In addition, critical regulatory
issues, such as the breadth of the Commission's jurisdiction, frequently arise.
For example, in a case that at year end was pending before the Supreme
Court, the Commission obtained a favorable ruling from the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concerning the purchase or sale
of securities while in possessionof material, non-public information. 104 The court
affirmed the Commission's censure of a securities analyst for selectively releasing material inside information concerning widespread fraud within a publicly
traded corporation to institutional investors. The institutional investors then sold
over $17 million of the company's securities, which became worthless soon
after the fraud was publicly exposed. The Commission had determined that
corporate insiders must either disclose or abstain from trading in the securities
of their corporation on the basis of material inside information and that tippees who receive that type of information from insiders assume a similar duty.
In the regulatory area, the allocation of jurisdiction between the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was also the
subject of litigation. lOS In addition, this case presented the question of whether

41

options on Government National Mortgage Association securities (GNMA options) are securities. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
overturned a Commission order approving trading in GNMA options, holding
that the options are not securities under the Federal securities laws. The Court
also held that GNMA options are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
CFTC. In this and a companion case,the Commission sought Supreme Court review of the court of appeals' decision. In the petition, the Commission argued that
the court's analysis threatened to undermine seriously the ability of the Commission to fulfill its statutory responsibilities to regulate the options markets.
(Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, legislation was enacted to clarify
that options on securities are separate securities and that the Commission has
authority to regulate such options. The Commission thereafter approved certain options trading on two exchanges, which was challenged again in the court
of appeals. Following the legislation, the Supreme Court directed the court of
appeals to vacate its earlier decision as moot. The court of appeals also dismissed as moot the challenge to the Commission's later orders approving certain
options trading.)
Commission Participation in Private Utigation- The Commission also furthers
its goals of investor protection and maintenance of fair and orderly markets
through its participation as a friend of the court in litigation between private
parties. Since the Federal securities laws provide for both government and pnvate enforcement, decisions in private actions construing provisions of the Federal securities laws could have an adverse precedential effect on the Commission's own administration and enforcement of the law. In addition, private actions provide a necessary supplement to the Commission's enforcement program, enabling individual litigants to recoup investor losses.During fiscal 1982,
determinations were reached in 19 cases in which the Commission participated
as a friend of the court, of which five were not in accord with the views expressed by the Commission.
As with Commission enforcement litigation, the range of issues presented
by these cases is far-reaching. Certain issues, such as the scope of the term
"security," on which the Commission's jurisdiction depends, arise in enforcement cases as well as private litigation. In 1982 the Commission participated
in several private actions to take the position that the transfer of a controlling
stock interest, or a 100% stock interest, in a business constitutes the sale of
a security. 106 In these cases the Commission argued that the application of the
Federal securities laws should not depend on whether the purchaser of stock
buys a small interest, a controlling interest or all of the stock of a corporation.
Moreover, the Commission urged that a standard which permits such distinctions would deny persons who relied on the coverage of the securities laws the
protections of those laws.
Significantly, the Supreme Court decided a case in which the Commission
submitted a brief in conjunction with the Federal bank regulatory agencies,
urging that a certificate of deposit issued by a federally-regulated and insured
bank is not a security subject to the antifraud provisions of the Federal securities

42

laws."? The Supreme Court agreed with the government's position, pointing out
that there are important differences between a certificate of deposit issued by
a bank which is subject to comprehensive Federal banking regulations, and
other long-term debt obligations. The Supreme Court held that it is unnecessary
to subject banks issuing certificates of deposit to liability under the antifraud
provisions of the Federal securities laws since there is abundant protection for
the holders of bank certificates of deposit under the Federal banking laws. Consistent with the Commission's position, the Supreme Court limited its decision
to the applicability of the antifraud provisions to the issuance of certificates
of deposit by banks that are federally regulated.
An important and recurrent issue peculiar to private litigation-under what
circumstances injured parties can sue under the Federal securities laws to obtain redress for violations-was recently raised in a case now pending before
the Supreme Court. In this case, the Supreme Court granted review to consider whether Section 11 of the Securities Act, which expressly provides a
damage remedy for misrepresentations in registration statements filed under
that Act, precludes defrauded purchasers of registered securities from maintaining an action under the antifraud provisions of Exchange Act Section 100b)
and Rule lOb-5.108 In the Supreme Court, the Commission has urged that a
holding precluding the Section 100b)remedy would create serious gaps in investor protection. Similarly, the Commission has participated in several private
cases to urge that shareholders and their companies can bring suit for injunctive and other equitable relief to enforce Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act,
which protects shareholders by giving them information concerning persons
in a position to effect possible changes in corporate control. 109
This year the Supreme Court also provided a final resolution for many issues
that the lower courts have faced in deciding the constitutionality of state takeover
laws. 110 The Supreme Court ruled, as urged by the Commission, that the provisions of the Illinois law at issue, which delay tender offers and give local officials the right to pass upon the merits of such offers, impose burdens on interstate commerce which outweigh legitimate local benefits, and thus violate
the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. In reaching this result,
the Supreme Court stated that a state has no interest in protecting non-resident
shareholders.
Actions InvolVingRequests for Access to Commission Ales-In 1982 the Commission experienced a substantial increase in administrative Freedom of Information Actll1 and confidential treatment appeals (161 FOIA appeals and 18
confidential treatment appeals). The majority of the FOIA appeals were for access to Commission files relating to ongoing investigations; the majority of the
confidential treatment appeals were for documents containinq confidential
business information or trade secrets within the scope of FOIA Exemption 4112
and/or the Trade Secrets Act.'!" To expedite the processing of its burgeon.
ing case load, the Commission amended its FOIA appeal rules (17 C.F.R.200.80
et seq.) and its confidential treatment rules (17 C.F.R. 200.83 et seq.)to delegate
authority to the General Counsel to decide these appeals,
43

In deciding each of these cases,the Office carefully considered the requestor's,
as well as the submitter's, arguments as to the disclosability of information, so
as to balance the right of the requestor to have access to information in the
Commission's possession, against the legitimate concems of the submitters to
maintain the confidentiality of non-public information (such as trade secrets
and privileged commercial or financial data). Despite the fact that 179 requests
were processed in fiscal 1982, only 13 resulted in the filing of lawsuits against
the Commission. And, in each of the lawsuits resolved to date, the Commission's decision has been sustained by the reviewing court.
Right to Financiel Privacy Act-The Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA)
114 requires the Commission, when it issues a subpoena to a "financial institution" seeking records maintained there by a "customer," to provide simultaneous
notice of the subpoena to the customer. 115 The Act, which is designed to protect the legitimate privacy interests of bank customers, allows a customer, upon
receipt of notice, to challenge the subpoena by filing a motion for that purpose in Federal court. 116 If a customer can demonstrate to the district court
that the subpoena seeks information that is irrelevant to the Commission's investigation, or the Commission's investigation is not legitimate, the court may
quash the subpoena.
During fiscal 1982 the Commission issued 142 subpoenas subject to the
RFPA customer challenge provisions. Fewer than 20 of these subpoenas resulted
in customer challenge proceedings. And, in each case, the district court dismissed the customer's challenge and enforced the Commission's subpoena, finding
that the Commission was properly seeking the subpoenaed records.
Actions Against the Commission and its Sta/f- The Office of General Counsel
also defended the Commission and members of its staff in at least ten lawsuits
in which plaintiffs sought to enjoin Commission law enforcement proceedings
and/or damages against Commission employees conducting those proceedings.
In all but one of these actions resolved in fiscal 1982, the Office of General
Counsel obtained favorable decisions.

Significant Legislation and Regulatory Reform
Financial Seniices Industry- Task Force and Glass.Steagall Legislation- The
emergence of new products offered by mutual funds, banks, savings and loans,
and insurance companies has led to blurring of the lines that traditionally
separated the financial services industries. In order to deal with the resulting
wasteful, duplicative, and inconsistent regulation by a variety of government
agencies, the Commission proposed formation of a one-year bipartisan task
force to review the regulatory structure of the securities, banking, saving and
loan, and insurance industries. The task force would consider the regulation
of financial markets and services by function rather than outmoded industry
classifications, and would consider consolidating the functions of the various
regulatory bodies to achieve administrative savings and greater efficiency. (After
the close of the fiscal year, such a Task Force was established, chaired by Vice
President Bush.)
44

The Commission also supported proposed amendments to the Glass-Steaqall
Act to permit banks to underwrite and deal in municipal revenue bonds and
sponsor and distribute mutual funds, if those activities are carried out by
separate subsidiaries fully subject to the Federal securities laws.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act-The
Commission supported amendments duro
ing 1982 that would amend and clarify the accounting provisions of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) in order to reduce uncertainty and compliance burdens. The accounting provisions require that issuers make and keep
accurate books and records and devise and maintain systems of internal accounting controls which provide reasonable assurances that certain statutory
objectives are met. These provisions are intended to assure that issuers have
reliable information with which to prepare financial statements and other
disclosure documents.
The Commission also has responsibility for civil enforcement of the anti.
bribery provisions of the FCPA. These prohibit the corrupt use of payments
or gifts to officials of foreign governments and certain other persons in order
to obtain or retain business. In testimony submitted to the Congress, the Commission stated that it did not object to proposals that enforcement of the antibribery provisions of the FCPA be consolidated in the Department of Justice.
Sanctions on Insider Trading-In September 1982, the Commission propos.
ed legislation to Congress to amend the Exchange Act to add new sanctions
for illegal insider trading. Despite vigorous enforcement efforts, insider trading
violations, which undermine public confidence in the fairness of the securities
markets, apparently continue because of the opportunity to reap large profits
with little risk.
To deter illegal trading, the Commission proposes to impose greater risk
on insiders. The proposed legislation would authorize the Commission to seek
a court order requiring any person who violates the Exchange Act by purchasing or selling securities while in possessionof material nonpublic information
to pay, in addition to disgorging the profit made, up to three times the profit
gained (or loss avoided) as a result of the unlawful transaction. The penalty
would be payable into the United States Treasury. It would also increase the
current maximum fine of $10,000 for a criminal violation of the Exchange Act
to $100,000, which would affect, in addition to insider trading, most criminal
violations of the Exchange Act. The current $10,000 fine was established when
the Act was passed in 1934. The Commission believes that the deterrent effect
of the fine has been significantly diminished because of inflation. The larger
fine would restore and enhance the deterrent effect of the criminal provisions
of the Exchange Act.
Meetings With Outside Groups-During the year, the Commission completed
preparation for a Major Issues Conference, designed to bring together heads
of other Federal and state regulatory agencies and chairmen and presidents
of leading financial institutions and exchanges to explore the major issuescon.
fronting the nation's financial institutions and markets in the 1980's. (This con.
ference was held on October 6-8, 1982, attended by nearly 550 leading officials

45

of the financial, corporate, legal, accounting, and government regulatory communities, at which significant problems were identified and possible solutions
were suggested.)
The Commission also scheduled meetings, to reduce regulatory conflicts and
overlaps and to develop a more cooperative, coordinated approach regarding
matters of mutual interest, with the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In addition, meetings
were scheduled with the executive staffs of several exchanges and the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., to obtain a better appreciation of problems confronting the self-regulatory organizations and suggestions for improvements in the Commission's regulatory programs. (These meetings were
conducted after the close of the fiscal year. Similar meetings will be scheduled
with Congressional staffs and associations that represent investors, industry,
and the legal and accounting professions.)

Public Utility Holding Companies

Composition
Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (Holding Company
Act), the Commission regulates interstate public utility holding company
systems engaged in the electric utility business or in the retail distribution of
gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also covers the natural gas pipeline companies and nonutility companies within a registered holding company system.
There are presently 13 registered holding companies with aggregate assets,
as of June 30, 1982, of $62.9 billion. Total holding company system assets
increased $5.9 billion in the 12-month period ended June 30, 1982. Total
operating revenues, as of June 30, 1982, were $30 billion, a $3.5 billion increase over the previous year. In the 13 systems, there are 67 electric and/or
gas utility subsidiaries, 62 nonutility subsidiaries and 19 inactive companies,
for a total of 161 system companies, including the parent companies but excluding 7 power supply company subsidiaries. Table 34 in the Appendix lists
the systems and Table 35 lists their aggregate assets and operating revenues.

Proposed Repeal
Eight bills proposing modifications to or repeal of the Holding Company Act
were introduced in the 97th Congress. The Commission determined that, if
enacted, the industry-sponsored bills to amend the Holding Company Act would
leave it with insufficient authority to properly administer the Act. Instead, the
Commission voted to support the repeal of the Act stating that the Act was,
in fact, no longer necessary to fulfill its original purposes.
The Holding Company Act was originally designed to effect a restructuring
of the gas and electric utility industry and to prevent recurrence of the abuses
caused by multi-tiered utility holding companies. The Commission has achieved these purposes and most of the industry has been geographically integrated
and simplified. Developments since 1935 in the form of new accounting standards, sophisticated financial analysis, increased disclosure requirements and
other Federal securities laws and more effective state regulation all ensure the
soundness of the utility industry and the protection of utility consumers and
investors.

Financing
During fiscal year 1982, approximately $3.3 billion of senior securities and
common stock fmancing of the 13 registered systems was approved by the
Commission. Of this amount, approximately $2.5 billion was long-term debt
financing, and over $800 million was for equity financing. The Commission ap-

47

proved $4.4 billion of short-term debt financing and $292 million of pollution
control financing for the registered holding company systems. The short-term
debt amounted to approximately 38 % less than the $7.1 billion authorized in
fiscal year 1981. Table 36 in the Appendix presents the amount and types of
securities issued by the holding company systems under the Holding Company
Act.

Nonutility Subsidiary Matters
In National Fuel Gas Company, 117 and Consolidated Natural Gas Compenu.v?
both registered holding companies, the Commission authorized the acquisition of the outstanding common stock of newly organized nonutility subsidiaries,
Enerop Corporation and CNG Energy Company, respectively. In each case the
proceeds of the sale would be applied, at least in part, toward the marketing,
installation, servicing and financing of fuel conversion equipment to adapt
gasoline powered motor vehicles used in short-haul fleets to use compressed
natural gas or gasoline.
In New England Electric System, Commission authorization was granted
to permit: (1) New England Energy, Inc. (NEEI), a subsidiary of New England
Electric System (NEES), a registered holding company, to enter into a joint
venture with Keystone Shipping Company to build, own or lease, and operate
a self-loading, coal-fired collier; (2) NEES to advance to NEEI, and NEEI to
provide to the joint venture, funds for initial capital and for construction of the
collier; and (3) NEES to make certain guarantees in connection with these
trensactlons.!'? By an Opinion and Order dated December 9, 1981,120 New
England Power Company, another subsidiary of NEES, was authorized to
charter the vessel from the joint venture for a term of 24-112 years.
In American Electric Power Company, the Commission authorized the
American Electric Power Co., Inc., to acquire the capital stock of, and make
capital contributions to, a new consulting subsidiary, AEP Energy Services,
Inc.121 The principal function of the new subsidiary is the competitive marketing of management, technical and training services to non-affiliated entities. Business operations will be managed by a limited, permanent staff complemented by personnel and resources from the American Electric Power Service Corporation (AEP Service), temporarily assigned for particular consulting
projects on a full-cost reimbursement basis under applicable rules under the
Holding Company Act. 122 It is intended that expertise in the utility business,
developed over the years for intemal needs, be channeled to the open market
in order to create new sources of revenue and profit for the parent holding company and to spread fixed labor costs of AEP Service over a broader base, permitting the retention of skilled personnel during off-peak operating periods.

Fuel Programs and Service Companies
During fiscal year 1982, the Commission authorized over $1.5 billion for fuel
exploration and development activities of the holding company systems. This

48

represents a 50% increase over fiscal year 1981 fuel expenditures. Table 38
in the Appendix lists the authorization by holding company system for each
fuel program.
Largely as a result of radical changes in cost and availability of fuel, utilities
have embarked on major programs to acquire control over part of their fuel
supply. Generally, the arrangements involve the formation of subsidiaries or
entry into joint ventures for the production, transportation and financing of fuel
supplies or the supply of capital for the exploration and development of reserves
with a right to share in any discovered reserves. Since 1971, the Commission
has authorized expenditures of over $5.7 billion for fuel programs of holding
companies subject to the Holding Company Act.
At the end of calendar year 1981, there were 12 subsidiary service companies
providing managerial, accounting, administrative and engineering service to
11 of the 13 holding companies registered under the Holding Company Act.
The billings for services rendered to the holding company systems amounted
to $730.4 million or 2.59% of the total revenues generated by the electric and
gas operating utilities. The subsidiary service companies are heavily laborintensive, employing over 14,000 people, and have assetsof over $352 million.
Table 37 in the Appendix lists the subsidiary service companies with billings,
total assets,total personnel, and number of operating utility companies served.

Corporate Reorganizations
Reorganization proceedings in the United States Courts are commenced by
a debtor or by its creditors. Federal bankruptcy law allows a debtor in reorganization to continue to operate under the court's protection while it attempts to
rehabilitate its business and work out a plan to pay its debts. Where a debtor
corporation has publicly held securities outstanding, such cases raise many
issues that materially affect the rights of public investors. The issuance of new
securities to creditors and shareholders pursuant to a plan are exempt from
registration under the Securities Act. The Commission enters its appearance
and participates in corporate reorganization proceedings to protect the interests
of public investors holding the debtor's securities and to render independent,
expert assistanceto the courts and parties in a complex area of law and finance.
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes the Commission to enter its
appearance in any reorganization case and to raise, or present its views on,
any issue in a Chapter 11 case. Although Chapter 11 applies to all types of
business reorganizations, the Commission, in its 40 years of participation in
reorganization cases, has generally limited its participation to those in which
a substantial public investor interest was involved.
During the past fiscal year, 76 debtors with publicly issued securities outstanding entered Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings. The Commission entered
its appearance in 28 of these cases, with aggregate assets of $8.8 billion and
close to 290,000 public investors, compared to 18 cases with $2.5 billion and
130,000 investors in 1981. A list of these proceedings is set forth in Table 40
in the Appendix to this Report. In these cases the Commission presented its
views, in court and to other participants, on a variety of issues, including: (1)
the need for appointment of additional committees to represent equity security holders; (2) issues concerning the debtor's operations and sales of assets;
(3) the need for appointment of a trustee or examiner to conduct an investigation into the debtor's affairs; (4) questions concerning the status and rights of
the securities held by public investors, the classification of their claims, and
proposed treatment in reorganization plans; (5) the adequacy of disclosure
statements required to be transmitted to creditors and investors when their votes
on a plan are being solicited; (6) the reasonableness of fees sought by counsel
and other professionals; and (7) interpretive questions concerning the securities
laws and the Bankruptcy Code.
The Commission has been concerned to insure that public investors are adequately represented in Chapter 11 cases, especially since a plan of reorganization is developed through negotiations between the debtor and committees.
During the fiscal year, the Commission moved or supported the appointment
of investor committees in eight Chapter 11 cases involving about 70,000 in51

vestors. Committees were appointed in all cases except one which commenced a liquidation of its assets. In two of these cases, plans filed by the debtor
in possession,after negotiations with the committees, accorded public investors
a significant interest in the reorganized company.
The Commission has also moved for the appointment of a trustee in one
case and an examiner in three cases. In two cases the examiner's preliminary
report indicated a high probability of the existence of causes of action against
former officers, directors and possibly accountants. In two other cases, examiners, appointed in the previous year, have filed reports recommending
(1) the pursuit of causes against former officers, counsel, and others and (2)
subordination of certain senior bank creditor claims, respectively.
During the past year, the Commission has reviewed applications for interim
allowances filed by professionalsin all participating Chapter 11 cases.As a result
of the Commission's efforts, courts have adhered to the long-standing policy
of paying only a portion of interim allowances, generally limiting the award
to about 75% of the request. Fees payable in a large Chapter 11 case can be
substantial. For example, in White Motor Corp., for a two year period official
participants in the case requested interim allowances of over $12.6 million but
were paid about $9 million. Also, in Braniff International, interim fee requests
for a five month period totaled about $2.7 million with the court awarding about
$1.3 million. And in ltel Corporation, the court paid the full amount requested
of $6.5 million during the first six months of the case but thereafter reduced
the amount paid to 75% of amounts requested, which continue at about $10
million per year.

Administration, Support and
Analytical Services
Key Management and Program Developments
During fiscal 1982, the Commission stressed its commitment to maximize
the use of available resources. To this end, the Office ofthe Executive Director
gave technical assistancethat strengthened the Commission's internal management. Significant was the relocation and consolidation of the Commission's
headquarters staff into a single location at Judiciary Plaza. The move closed
a decade of duplicative facilities and services at Commission offices dispersed
at three locations, enhancing productivity an estimated 7% and averting over
$400,000 in costs associated with maintaining three buildings.
Assistance was also provided to shift dissemination of Commission findings
to the private sector, saving more than $300,000 annually. The Commission's
Docket, News Digest and Compilation of Decisions and Reports are now internally produced for use by the Commission's staff and is distributed externally
at no added cost to the public through private contractors.
Technical assistance was also provided to: (1) the Directorate of Economic
and Policy Analysis to increase the utility of their study reports to the Commission, increase the efficiency of maintaining an economic data base and provide for an Office of the Chief Economist; (2) the Office of the General Counsel
to improve available management information; (3) the Division of Enforcement to refine the Commission's CaseTracking System; (4) the Commission's
Public Reference Room to improve the delivery of information to the public;
and (5) other Federal agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency, the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on various management
topics.
The Commission continues to maintain an experienced, highly motivated
corps of senior executives. In 1982, the President honored the Commission by
awarding three of its top executives with coveted Senior Executive Service rank
awards. Theodore H. Levine and David P. Doherty, both Associate Directors
in the Division of Enforcement, were awarded the rank of Meritorious Executive.
William D. Goldsberry, Administrator of the Chicago Regional Office, was one
of the few Federal managers designated the rank of Distinguished Executive,
the highest award given to Federal employees.

Inter-American Conference
The Commission hosted the Seventh Annual Inter-American Conference of
Securities Commissions and Similar Organizations in May of this year. The Inter-

53

American Conference provides an opportunity for delegations of securities
regulators from throughout the world to exchange views and expepriences on
topics of common interest concerning the development, promotion, expansion,
and appropriate regulation of their national securities markets. The Conference
was attended by representatives of 30 member and observer nations and 10
self-regulatory and international financial organizations. The Conference theme
was "Improving Capital Markets Through Cooperation and Competition." The
major topics addressed were: (1) the organization and structure of securities
markets as a means of improving capital markets; (2) competition and cooperation between government and private enterprise with respect to investor savings; and (3) the role of foreign issuers and foreign investors in domestic capital
markets.
Information Systems Management
Data processing capabilities were extended to several new areas in 1982.
Some regional offices are using two new information systems. A prototyipe
customer accounts system uses microcomputers for financial analysis of brokerdealer customer accounts. An on-line system on the Commission's headquarters
mainframe computer provides the regions instant current and historical price
data from major stock exchanges. Other new systems implemented this year
allow the Commission to monitor and control filing fee records; allocate basic
automatic data processing (ADP) costs; monitor various regulated entities;
queueing the General Counsel's legal briefs by topic; and audit Commission
long-distance telephone calls.
Existing information systems were also extensively modified. The on-line personnel management system was expanded to incorporate additional data
elements required by the Office of Personnel Management and improve analysis
of personnel data. The filings tracking system was expanded to a fully integrated
on-line system to control all corporate filings and analyze new securities registration offering statistics. Finally, the complaint processing system was converted
to on-line to improve tracking of investor complaints.
The Office of Information Systems Management reorganized during 1982
to improve responsiveness to the Commission's ADP workload. Two new entities were created. The first serves as a focal point for the development of ADP
policy and standards, the oversight of the Commission's on-going ADP security program, the establishment of data administration functions, and the
organization of the Commission's microcomputer resource facility. The second
entity is responsible for systems development and securities market oversight
and surveillance activities.
In 1982, the Commission's computer hardward configuration was enhanced. A second processing unit was installed and internal memory capabilities
of both central processing units and data storage devices for on-lone systems
were upgraded. A switching unit was installed to allow operation of the
teleprocessing system when the primary processor becomes inoperable. The

54

Commission acquired 12 additional microcomputers in furtherance of the next
phase of the regional office microcomputer support project. The Commission's
ADP facility in the new building contains the latest in security, environmental,
and electrical controls and provides space and layout flexibility for current and
future operations, a marked improvement over the previous facility.
Extensive efforts were undertaken to review and evaluate ADP services,
eliminate nonessential services and, where possible, consolidate requirements.
These efforts resulted in a cost avoidance of over $600,000. Reliance upon the
industry to develop the market oversight surveillance system generated an additional cost avoidance of over $1 million.

Financial Management
In fiscal 1982 the Commission collected $78.2 million in fees for deposit
into the General Fund of the Treasury. This represented 94 % of the Commission's appropriated funds, as compared with 81 % in 1981.
Fees were collected from four major sources: (1) registrations under the
Securities Act of 1933, provided for 68%; (2) transactions on securities exchanges provided 24%; (3) other filing and report fees made provided 7%; and
(4) registration of SEC regulated broker/dealers provided 1 %.
The rise in 1982 revenues resulted principally from the growth in money
market funds.
The Office of the Comptroller continued to implement an automated integrated financial management system. The cash management system was expanded to track accounts receivable. It automatically generates payment requests and follow up letters. By producing faster payments, it is estimated that
the system will save the government over $6,000 annually in interest earned
which would otherwise be lost.
Recordkeeping of commercial long-distance telephone calls by individual
organizations was expanded to include Federal Telephone System calls in 1982.
The General Services Administration (GSA) provides the Commission with a
20% sample of all calls made for internal management review. During the year,
approximately $70,000 was saved in long-distance telephone charges.
Initiatives were begun to improve resource utilization, including the selection of a budget formulation package to track expenditures by cost categories.
Data transcription has been converted to terminal entry for certain payroll actions, reducing errors. The Commission took part in a no-cost travel agent project designed to purchase tickets at the lowest rate available.

Internal Audit
The internal audit function was transferred to the Office of the Executive
Director in 1982 with reporting responsibilities both to the Chairman and the
Executive Director. During the year, intemal audit examined the agency's payroll
system, helped develop an on-line payroll system, and began to implement OMB
Circular A-123, requiring vulnerability assessments and internal control reviews.
Follow-up studies of cash management and imprest fund audits were completed.
55

Personnel Management
During 1982, the Commission sustained a 5% reduction in its staffing level.
Although attrition enabled the Commission to meet its personnel reductions,
during 1982 plans were made to implement reductions-in-force (RIF).Procedures
developed made extensive use of ADP to rank employees in order of release.
This was the first full year of operation for the new performance appraisal
system developed under the Civil Service Reform Act. All employees were
evaluated using performance standards and critical elements tailored to their
specific positions. These appraisals are being used in decisions involving training, reassignments, promotions, and awards.
The merit pay program was implemented on schedule with a fixed pool of
money to pay for salary increases, with larger increases paid for superior
performances.
A number of other initiatives were taken to enhance productivity and the
reputation of the Commission as a progressive employer:
• A retirement planning seminar was conducted utilizing speakers from the
Office of Personnel Management, the Social Security Administration, organizations of retired persons, and retired members of the Commission's staff. This
widely praised seminar is to become an annual event.
• A conference was held to brief management on policies and trends in personnel, fiscal data processing, and procurement management.
• Despite curtailed hiring, the Commission continued its lawyer recruitment,
maintaining contact with law schools to keep the prospect of SEC employment
before law graduates.
• The SEC aggressively pursued affirmative action for handicapped persons
and undertook development of a disabled veterans program. The Commission's
new building is being equipped with stainless steel braille directional signs and
teletypwriter (TTY) telephones. The handicapped persons placement coordinator
is often asked to address new coordinators in other agencies regarding the
development and implementation of affirmative action programs, an indication of the respect the Commission enjoys in this area.

Facilities Management
The Commission moved into a consolidated headquarters building in 1982.
Furniture and equipment were moved, after prior planning, during June, July
and August weekends to minimize disruption. Consolidating Commission activities within one building eliminated the inconvenience of three previous locations and improved employee productivity by eliminating 15,000 trips between
buildings at a cost of over $60,000 per annum.
Nationwide use of common carrier service in lieu of the mails was begun
in 1982, resulting in guaranteed overnight delivery and annual savings of
$40,000. Obsolete facsimile equipment was replaced with telecopiers that will
improve transmission quality and speed.
Efforts to reduce or eliminate all but essential periodicals, and halt the prin-

56

ting and mailing of releases, and discontinuing the printing and typeset of the
SEC Docket resulted in a cost savings of over $1 million.
Subsidized parking in the Washington, D.C. and the Fort Worth offices was
eliminated for an annual savings of $55,000. The Commission exceeded its
Small Business Administration goal of 20% for awarding Federal contract
dollars to small and disadvantaged businesses.
To facilitate the acquisition of new field office space, a computerized system
was developed to monitor lease expiration dates.
Equal Employment Opportunity
The Equal Employment Opportunity Office completed an affirmative action
plan for minorities and women for 1982-1986, under guidance issued by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Black women in the agency
workforce increased 9% to 331 in 1982. Approximately 325 employees of
various regional offices completed a four-hour course on sexual harassment
prevention during 1982.
Annual observations were conducted for Hispanic Heritage Week, Asian and
Pacific American Heritage Week, Afro-American History Month, National
Secretaries Week, and Women's Week. Committees on the Federal Women's
Program and Hispanic Employment Program were also active during the year.
For the fourth year, the SEC-Securities Industry Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity sponsored achievement scholarships for minority students.
This program offers scholarships to an outstanding minority students seeking
a business career. The committee has donated more than $35,000 in
scholarships.
Public Affairs
The principal source of information on Commission actions is the Office of
Public Affairs. In fiscal 1982, the office processed 98,000 telephone inquiries,
responded to 1,100 written inquiries, and issued 64 press releases, as compared
with 92,000, 1,000 and 70 respectively in 1981.
The program assures cost-effective dissemination of news about Commission actions to millions of investors and thousands of corporations, brokerdealers, attorneys, accountants and others.
During 1982, 247 individuals from foreign and domestic regulatory agency
staffs, industry members and student groups visited the Commission to learn
about securities issues.
Additional published and audiovisual information on the Commission is produced by Public Affairs. "What Every Investor Should Know, A Handbook from
the SEC", a comprehensive new brochure, was published in 1982 and distributed
to the public throughout the U.S. by the Consumer Information Center,
Pueblo, Colorado. "Eagle on the Street", a 22-minute show dealing with the
SEC and the securities markets, is being rented and sold by the National
AudioVisual Center in 16mm and videotape versions.
57

Consumer Affairs and Information Services
The Commission's move into its new headquarters building provided important additional space for the public reference room. The conversion of public
records from paper to microfiche is almost complete; the records now contain
over one million microfiche, all accessable within minutes. During fiscal 1982,
public reference room inquiries decreased 15% to 140,000. These included
14,000 publication and 72,000 telephone requests.
Consumer complaints declined 19% to 17,000. Of these, 7,300 concerned
operation problems of registered broker-dealers, such as failure to deliver
securities or funds, or errors in account records; and 6,000 concerned issuers,
transfer agents, banks, mutual funds and investment advisers.
Finally, Consumer Affairs processed 1,536 Freedom of Information Act and
54 Privacy Act requests, as compared with 1,622 and 66 in 1981.
Economic and Policy Analysis
The goal of the Commission's economic and policy analysis program is to
provide the operating divisions with an objective economic perspective and the
related technical support to understand and evaluate the economic dimensions of the agency's regulatory oversight. This program is carried out by the
Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis and the Office of the Chief
Economist. The Office of the Chief Economist was established during the fiscal
year to enhance the Commission's long range policy overview, to draw increased
attention to the fundamental economic issues raised by the agency's regulatory
actions and to coordinate liaison on such issues with Congress, other government agencies and the academic community.
The economic staff meets regularly with the operating divisions to determine
which regulatory issues or programs are suitable for economic analysis and
plans for the collection of data needed for policy deliberations of program administration. The Directorate also reviews rule proposals before they are submitted to the Commission for consideration. In particular, the Directorate seeks
to assess the effects which proposed rules would have, if adopted, on competition within the securities industry and among competing securities markets,
as required by Section 23 of the Exchange Act, and on small businesses, as
required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Small Business Investment
Incentive Act. Where appropriate, the Directorate also identifies more costeffective means of accomplishing the regulatory objective under review.
When issues are particularly significant and effects uncertain, the Directorate
may develop and implement a program to monitor the proposed rule after its
adoption. Alternatively, the Directorate or Chief Economist may recommend
that the Commission not adopt or modify a rule because the expected costs
exceed the perceived benefits.
In the past fiscal year the Commission made special efforts to coordinate
activities of its various operating divisions in order to identify adverse economic
consequences at an earlier stage in the rulemaking process. This permits per58

tinent data collection and analysis to be planned and conducted in a more
thorough and timely manner.
The following are some of the Directorate's fiscal 1982 projects:
• Two analyses of Rule 15c3-1, the net capital rule.
• Publication of the annual "Staff Report on the Securities Industry" which
provides information on the structure, performance, and condition of the
securities industry and analyzes market conditions and other factors which led
to such results;
• Reports on the Intermarket Trading System and the National Securities
Trading System of the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, and the monitoring of the
operation of Exchange Act Rule 19c-3;
• A joint proposal with the Division of Market Regulation that eliminated
certain schedules in the FOCUS report, filed periodically by registered brokerdealers. The elimination of these schedules will save the securities industry $1.5
million annually without reducing investor protection.
• A study which employed economic and statistical analysis to estimate
the likely effects of Rule 415;
• An analysis of the cost effectiveness of Regulation 13D beneficial ownership disclosure requirements;
• An investigation into the operation of the Commission's tender offer rules,
focusing initially on the rule governing the proration period for tender offers;
• A study on the use of Regulation A and the effects of the increased dollar
amount of sales permitted under this exemption which became effective in 1978;

59As enacted, Public Law 97-303 amends the definition of "security" in Section
3(aXI0) of the Exchange Act explicitly to include any put, call, straddle, option, or
privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, group or index of securities (in.
c1uding any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any foreign currency
when the option on that foreign currency is traded on a national securities ex.
change. In addition, Section 9(f) of the Exchange Act was amended to provide that
the Commission's plenary authority to regulate options trading on securities exchanges extends to options on exempted securities. Finally, the legislation added
Section 9(g) to the Exchange Act to provide that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission shall have the authority to regulate the trading of any
options referred to in Section 3(aXI0).

Broker-dealers
which
are selfregulated through their membership in
a national securities exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers
earned revenues of $24,372 million in
1981, 22 percent above the 1980 level I
Three-fourths
of this increase
in
revenues stemmed from the growth of
the "All Other Revenues" category
which is composed primarily of margin
interest income and interest earned on
repurchase agreements.
Securities commission income, in the
past the largest component of total revenues, fell $211 million and accounted
for 27 percent of total revenues, whereas
"All Other Revenues" grew $3,349
million and accounted for 39 percent of
total revenues in 1981. Despite a three
percent increase in the market value of
equity sales on all registered exchanges,
securities commission incorne declined
because of changes in the mix of trans.
actions. Trading of broker-dealers for
their own account and the volume of
large public transactions, which generate

fewer commission dollars relative to
trading volume, were up. However, the
volume of small public transactions, which
generate proportionately more commission dollars, was down.
Trading profits grew by 25 percent to
$5,401 million to account for 22 percent
of total revenues. Revenues from underwriting rose by 17 percent in 1981; a slight
decrease in the combined volume of primary corporate and municipal offerings
were more than offset by a more profitable
mix of securities offerings.
Expenses grew by $4,652 million to
$21,583 million in 1981. A year-over-year
increase of 67 percent in interest expense
to $6,506 million accounted for over onehalf of the growth in total expenses. "All
Other Expenses" which includes registered
representatives' compensation, rose by
$1,271 million to $8,845 million in 1981
The 27 percent growth in expenses out.
stripped the 22 percent rise in revenues,reducing pre-tax income to $2,789 million,
a nine percent decline from the preceding
year.
Assets rose by $34,911 million to
$155,063 million and liabilities grew to
$144,734 million. Ownership equity rose by
$1,778 million to $10,329 million in 1981.

Securities Industry Dollar In 1981
For Carrying and Clearing Firms
Data for carrying and clearing firms only
are presented here to allow for more detail,
as reporting requirements for tnlrodLLcing
and carrying and clearing firms differ and
data aggregation of these two types of firms
necessarily results in loss of detail. Carrying and clearing firms are those firms which
clear securities transactions or maintain
possession or control of customers' cash or
securities. The 86 percent of industry revenues earned by carrying and clearing firms
in 1981 suggests that this group is a suitable proxy for the industry.
Securities commissions and trading
gains accounted for 26 cents and 23 cents,
respectively, of each revenue dollar in 1981.
Together these two items accounted for 49
cents of each revenue dollar eamed in 1981
as compared to 56 cents in 1980. In terms
of dollars, they accounted for $10,124 million of the $20,862 million of total revenues
eamed by carrying and clearing firms.
"Other related revenues" securities accounted for 18 cents of the revenue dollar
in 1981, a substantial increase from 12
cents in 1980. Margin interest income rose
to account for 14 cents of each revenue
dollar in 1981 compared with 12 cents in

1980.
Total expenses rose to consume 89 cents
of each revenue dollar eamed in 1981, an
increase over the 1980 level of 86 cents.
The industry's pre-tax profit margin fell to
11 cents per revenue dollar in 1981 from
15 cents in 1980.
Interest expense, agam the single largest
expense item, rose by 59 percent to absorb
28 cents of each revenue dollar, which
compares to 22 cents in 1980. In dollars,
interest expense grew to $5,916 million in
1981 from $3,718 million in 1980 Employee-related expenses (registered representatives' compensation and clerical and
administrative employees' expenses) consumed 34 cents of the revenue dollar in
1981,2 cents below the 36 cent level in
1980. Registered representatives' cornpensation while increasing by 8 percent over
the 1980 level, absorbed less of each revenue dollar in 1981 (18 cents) than It did
the previous year (20 cents). In dollar terms,
employee-related expenses accounted for
$6,989 million of the $18,516 million of
total expenses.
The "All Other Expense" category, which
includes promotional costs, regulatory fees
and expenses and rruscellaneous items,
consumed 10 cents of each revenue dollar, in both 1980 and 1981.

Self-Regulatory Organizations:
Revenues, Expenses, Pre- Tax Income
and Balance Sheet Structure!
In 1981, volume in the secondary equity
market expanded at a less rapid rate than
the previous year, and stock prices fell considerably in the latter half of the year. These
factors help to explain the modest increase
In self-regulatory organizations' ("SROs' ")
and their subsidiaries' aggregate total
revenues, and the sharp decline in their aggregate net income. Aggregate total
revenues of SROs reached $372 million in
1981, up from $337 million (about 11 percent) the previous year. However, SROs' ago
gregate total expenses rose nearly 20 percent from $283 million to $338 million
resulting in a more than 36 percent decline
in aggregate pre-tax income from $54
million in 1980 to $34 million in 1981.
As is clear from the accompanying
tables, individual SROs differ widely in their
dependence on particular sources of revenues. For example, over 56 percent of the
NYSE's 1981 total revenues were generated
from two income categories: Commission
fees/transaction revenues and listing fees.
This contrasts sharply with data from the
Intermountain and Spokane Stock Exchanges who reported no income from
Commission fees/transaction revenues but
respectively received 21 percent and 60
percent of revenues from listing fees. Fees
associated with communication activities
increased for each of the three SROs' reporting income in that category. Consistent
with previous years, the "All Other Revenues" category continued to be the largest
single source of revenues. In 1981, all other
revenues exceeded $182 million, or 49 percent of total revenues.
On the expense side, aggregate employee costs jumped one-fifth during the
year to $145 million, of which such costs
at the NYSE accounted for approximately
'Data for self-regulatory organizations for
1980 and 1981 are not comparable With previous data because of a change in the data source

86

44 percent of the aggregate total figure.
Communication, data processing and col.
lection expenses constitute the next largest
specific cost category. Such expenses for
all SROs combined increased 18 percent
last year to over $63 million. Occupancy
and equipment costs increased by 25 percent to reach $22 million in 1981. As in
the past, expenses classified in the "All
Other Expenses" increased, but at a lesser
rate than in previous years. Finally, total expenses for all SROs combined rocketed to
$338 million, up almost 20 percent from
1980.
The 1980-1981 balance sheet structure
of SROs, also set forth in the accompany.
ing tables, provides insight into the overall
operations of these entities. Aggregate total
assets of SROs dipped to $629 million in
1981 from a high of $760 million in 1980.
Most of this decline can be traced to the
Midwest Stock Exchange, whose assets
slipped from $156 to $110 million. Total
assets for five other SROs also declined in
1981. Although the NYSE was among
those experiencing a decline, with $165
million in total assets at year-end 1981, it
continued to maintain the largest asset base
of all of the eleven reporting SROs. Aggregate total liabilities which dropped even
more sharply than total assets declined 28
percent to $394 million at fiscal year-end
1981. As a result aggregate net worth for
all SROs totalled $236 million last yearthe largest figure reported to-date. Seven
of the eleven SROs experienced an increase
in net worth in 1981. The sharp diversity
in the relative size of these SROs can be
seen by contrasting the $109 million net
worth of the NYSE with the $13 thousand
net worth of the Spokane Stock Exchange.
Aggregate 1981 clearing agency revenues increased approximately $10.6 million
over 1980. However, total revenues from
clearing and depository services remained
relativelyunchanged as the result of various
offsetting factors. Specifically, clearing revenues were reduced by the transfer of Brad.
ford Securities Processing Services, Inc.

operations to its brokerage and banking
affiliates. In 1980, Bradford accounted for
$10 million of clearing service revenues. On
the other hand, the Options Clearing Corporation doubled its revenues to $10 4
million as a result of an expansion during
the year in the number of listed options
The increase in the "Interest and Other
Revenues" category by $12.5 million was
primarily due to an over-all rise In Interest
rates over the previous year.
Aggregate clearing agency expenses also
increased during the year, rising by $11
million despite the transfer of Bradford's
operations, which last year accounted for
$11.7 million in expenses. For the most
part, the increase in expenses can be attributed to a general rise in the cost of
operations resulting from inflation. For ex-

ample, Employee Costs increased by $5.3
million to $68 4 million.
In addition to ordinary operating expenses, clearing agencies may Incur losses
as a result of the default of a participant.
During 1981 Midwest Cleannq Corporation
incurred a $2.4 million loss from the default of one of its participants. This loss was
the largest of its kind ever experienced by
a clearing agency, eliminated Midwest's
$1.6 million operating profit, and created
an "Excess of Expenses over Revenues" of
approximately $750,000. Stock Cleannq
Corporation of Philadelphia also incurred
a loss due to a participant default dunnq
the year. Philadelphia's loss of $730,000 increased its Excess of Expenses over Revenues to $806,000.

ON EXCHANGES

Market Value and Share Volume
The total market value of all equity securities transactions on registered exchanges totaled $533 billion in 1981. Of
this total, $491 billion, or 92 percent, represented the market value of transactions
in stocks and $42 billion, or eight percent,
the market value of options transactions.
The remainder covers the market value of
transactions in warrants and riqhts. The
value of equity transactions on the New
York Stock Exchange was $416 billion, up
five percent from the previous year. In contrast, the market value of such transactions
fell 15 percent to $40 billion on the American Stock Exchange and one percent to

98

$76 billion on all regional exchanges combined. The volume of trading in stocks on
all registered exchanges totaled 16 billion
shares in 1981, a three percent increase
over the previous year with 81 percent of
the total accounted for by trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Although the number of contracts
traded on options exchanges rose 13 percent during 1981 to 109 million contracts,
the market value of such contracts eased
three percent to $42 billion. The volume
of contracts executed on the Chicago Board
Options Exchange rose nine percent to 58
million; trading on the American Stock Exchange increased 20 percent; Philadelphia
Stock Exchange contract volume expanded
30 percent; and Pacific Stock Exchange
contract volume went up 27 percent.

Purpose and Type of Registration
Effective registrations for cash sale for
the account of issuers amounted to $115
billion (73 percent) of the $158 billion of
effective registrations in fiscal year 1982.
Some $62 billion of these effective registrations (39 percent of all registrations) were
intended for immediate offerings rather
than for extended or other types of offerings, an increase of $1 billion (2 percent)
from the value of such registrations in the
previous fiscal year. Securities issues
registered by business to be offered to the
general public totalled $60 billion, an increase of $3 billion (6 percent) from the
value of such offerings in fiscal year 1981.
Of this amount, debt securities accounted for $38 billion (or 63 percent of
this total), preferred stock $4 bilion (6 percent) and common stock $19 billion (31
percent). Cash rights offerings (offerings to
security holders) came to $543 million, a
decline of 17 percent from the $656 million
of such offerings in the previous year. Immediate cash offerings by foreign governments in fiscal year 1982 totalled $1 billion,
a decrease of $2 billion (57 percent) from
the $3 billion of such offerings in fiscal year
1981.
In fiscal year 1982, another $53 billion
of securities (33 percent of all registrations)
were registered for cash sale for the account
of the issuer in delayed and extended offerings (offerings other than those for immediate cash sale). Registrations for
delayed offerings (offerings pursuant to
Rule 415, or so-called "shelf' registrations)

amounted to $21 billion. Securities
registered for the account of issuers other
than for cash sale (in conjunction with exchange offers, for example) amounted to
$39 billion in 1982, or 25 percent of all
registrations. Registrations of securities for
secondary offerings (for the account of
security holders rather than issuers) amounted to $5 billion (3 percent) of all registrations in fiscal year 1982. Of these latter registrations, $1 billion (23 percent) were
in conjunction with cash sales and $3
billion (77 percent) were for other types of
offerings such as ones to be offered from
time to time.
Of the $67 billion of debt securities registered in fiscal year 1982, 56 percent or
($38 billion) were registered for immediate
cash sale to the general public for the account of the issuer, and delayed and extended cash sale for the account of issuer
accounted for 34 percent. Registrations of
preferred stock for immediate cash sale for
the account of issuer represented 54 percent of the $7 billion of preferred stock registrations; registrations for other than cash
sale for the account of issuer made up 39
percent of such registrations. Registrations
of common stock for immediate cash sale
for the account of issuer ($19 billion) comprised 23 percent of the $83 billion of common stock registrations; registrations for
delayed and extended cash sales for the account of issuer accounted for 35 percent
of these registrations; and registrations for
other than cash sale for the account of
issuer comprised 37 percent.
Note: 1981 figures have been revised.

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table reflects, the securities laws
provide for a wide range of enforcement actions by the Commission. The most common types of actions are injunctive
proceedings instituted in the Federal district
courts to enjoin continued or threatened

securities law violators, and administrative
proceedings pertaining to broker-dealer
firms and/or individuals associated with
such firms which may lead to various
remedial sanctions as required in the public
interest. When an injunction is entered by
a court, violation of the court's decree is a
basis for criminal contempt against the

Trading Suspensions
During fiscal year 1982, the Commission
suspended trading in the securities of nine
companies, 14 less than the 23 trading suspensions in fiscal 1981. In most instances
the trading suspension was ordered eithe;
because of substantial questions as to the
adequacy, accuracy or availability of public information conceming the company's
financial condition or business operations,
or because transactions in the company's
securities suggested possible manipulation
or other violations.
Foreign Restricted

List

The Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign Restricted List which is
designed to put broker-dealers, financial institutions, investors and others on notice of
possible unlawful distributions of foreign
securities in the United States. The list consists of names of foreign companies whose
securities the Commission has reason to
believe have been, or are being offered for
public sale in the United States in possible
violation of the registration requirement of
Section 5 of the Securities Act. The offer
and sale of unregistered securities deprives
investors of all the protections afforded by
the Securities Act, including the right to receive a prospectus containing the information required by the Act for the purpose of
enabling the investor to determine whether
the investment is suitable for him. While
most broker-dealers refuse to effect transactions in securities issued by companies
on the Foreign Restricted List, this does not
necessarily prevent promoters from illegally
offering such securities directly to investors
in the United States by mail, by telephone,
and sometimes by personal solicitation.
The following foreign corporations and
other foreign entities comprise the Foreign
Restricted List

Fuel Programs
During fiscal year 1982, the Commission

holding company systems. This represents
a 50 percent increase over fiscal year 1981
fuel expenditures. The following table lists
the authorization by holding company system for each fuel program.
Largely as a result of radical changes in

Commission has authorized expenditures
of over $5.7 billion for fuel programs of
holding companies subject to the Holding
