Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
August 12, 2016

In the Matter of
Safecode Drug Technologies Corp.
Dynamic Ventures Corp.
File No. 500-1

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) that there
is a lack of current and accurate information concerning the securities of Safecode Drug
Technologies Corp. (“Safecode”) (CIK No. 1508470), a Delaware corporation with its
principal office located in Jerusalem, Israel with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously,
“Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the symbol
SAFC because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended June 30, 2013.
On April 5, 2016, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to
Safecode requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations. Safecode did not
receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the
Commission as required by Rule 301 of Regulation S-T under the Securities Act of 1933
(“Securities Act”) (17 C.F.R. § 232.301 and Section 5.4 of the EDGAR Filer Manual.)

It appears to the Commission that there is a lack of current and accurate
information concerning the securities of Dynamic Ventures Corp. (“Dynamic Ventures”)
(CIK No. 1454384) a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business listed as
Scottsdale, Arizona with stock quoted on OTC Link under the symbol DYNV, because it
has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended June 30, 2012. On March 1,
2016 a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to Dynamic
Ventures requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations. Dynamic Ventures
did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file
with the Commission as required by Rule 301 of Regulation S-T under the Securities Act
(17 C.F.R. § 232.301 and Section 5.4 of the EDGAR Filer Manual.)
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed companies.
Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed companies is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on August 12, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on August 25,
2016.
By the Commission.
