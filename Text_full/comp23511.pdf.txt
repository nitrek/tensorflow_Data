JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission” or “SEC”) alleges the
following against defendants David Aubel (“Aubel”) and Robert Raffa (“Raffa”) (collectively,
the “Defendants”):
SUMMARY
1.

The Defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud involving the publicly traded

stock of Green Energy Renewable Solutions, Inc. (“Green Energy” or “EWRL”) from at least
April 2012 through at least January 2013 (the “relevant period”). The purpose of the scheme
was to obtain illegal financial benefit for Aubel and Raffa at the expense of innocent investors by
selling shares of Green Energy’s stock to those unsuspecting investors at artificially high prices.
Aubel and Raffa took steps to secretly acquire a large quantity of Green Energy stock and to
disguise their ownership interest in the stock. Aubel and Raffa then manipulated, and thereby
artificially increased, the share price and trading volume of Green Energy’s stock, before selling
millions of shares of the stock to investors unaware of the artificial increase in price for proceeds

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 2 of 20

of more than $1.6 million. The defendants sold the stock into a segment of the public securities
markets known as the Over-the-Counter securities market, or the “OTC Market.”
2.

At various times material to this complaint, Green Energy was a Florida

corporation based in Detroit, Michigan, and it purported to be in the business of developing
waste processing and recycling facilities. Green Energy’s stock was registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)
and its stock was quoted in the OTC Market under the symbol “EWRL.”
3.

The OTC Market, also referred to as the microcap market, is a marketplace for

buying and selling shares of stock in companies with more limited assets and lower stock prices than
companies listed on the major stock exchanges. Approximately 10,000 companies have shares that
trade on the OTC market’s two inter-dealer quotation systems: the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB)
and OTC Link (formerly known as “Pink OTC Markets Inc.” or “the Pink Sheets”). The OTC
Market is decentralized, without an actual physical location where stocks can be bought and sold.
Instead, buyers and sellers in the OTC Market trade with one another through various modes of
communication such as the telephone, email and proprietary electronic trading systems. The OTC
Market is less transparent than, for instance, stock exchanges, and also subject to fewer regulations.

4.

Raffa and Aubel accomplished their fraudulent scheme, by, among other things,

(a) secretly obtaining a significant percentage of Green Energy’s stock and holding the stock in
offshore accounts they controlled but in which the shares of stock were not held in their names
(“nominee accounts”); (b) further disguising their ownership of a large percentage of Green
Energy’s stock by failing to file required SEC disclosure reports; (c) engaging in various types of
manipulative trading designed to artificially increase or otherwise stabilize Green Energy’s stock
price, as well as artificially increasing the trading volume of the stock; (d) orchestrating and
paying for promotional campaigns designed to spark investor interest in Green Energy with,

2

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 3 of 20

among other things, misleading and/or incomplete information; and (e) ultimately selling
millions of shares of Green Energy stock to unsuspecting investors, thereby obtaining proceeds
of more than $1.6 million.
5.

The Defendants’ conduct violated various antifraud, registration, and disclosure

rules and regulations of the SEC and of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a),
5(c), 17(a)(1), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 77e(a)
and (c); 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1) and (3)] and Sections 10(b), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78m(d) and 78p(a)] and Rules
10b-5(a), 10b-5(c), 13d-1, 13d-2, and 16a-3, thereunder [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5(a) and (c),
240.13d-1, 240.13d-2 and 240.16a-3].
6.

Based on these violations, the Commission seeks: (1) entry of permanent

injunctions prohibiting the Defendants from further violations of the relevant provisions of the
federal securities laws; (2) disgorgement of the Defendants’ ill-gotten gains, plus pre-judgment
interest; (3) the imposition of civil monetary penalties due to the egregious nature of the
Defendants’ violations; and (4) such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
AUTHORITY, JURISDICTION and VENUE
7.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to enforcement authority conferred

by Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77t(b)] and Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. §§78u(d)].
8.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331, Sections

20(b) and (d) and 22(a) and (c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and (d), and 77v(a) and
(c)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§78u(d), 78u(e), and
78aa].

9.

The District of Massachusetts is the proper venue for this action under 28 U.S.C.

§1391(b)(2), Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §77v(a)] and Section 27 of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78aa], because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses
of business constituting the violations alleged herein occurred within and/or affected the District
of Massachusetts, as well as investors and prospective investors residing in the District of
Massachusetts.
10.

The Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means and

instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mail in connection with the acts, practices, and
courses of business alleged herein.
11.

The Defendants’ conduct involved fraud, deceit, or deliberate or reckless

disregard of regulatory requirements, and resulted in substantial loss, or significant risk of
substantial loss, to other persons.
DEFENDANTS
12.

David Aubel, 57, resided in Florida during the relevant period and was a

significant shareholder of Green Energy’s common stock.
13.

Robert Raffa, 56, resided in New Hampshire during the relevant period and was a

significant shareholder of Green Energy’s common stock.
THE SCHEME TO MANIPULATE THE PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME
OF GREEN ENERGY STOCK AND TO PROFIT FROM ITS SALE
A.

Aubel and Raffa Secretly Obtain Ownership and Control of Large Blocks
of Green Energy Stock

14.

By at least April 2012, the Defendants initiated a scheme to secretly control a

large percentage of Green Energy’s stock, to manipulate the price and trading volume of the

4

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 5 of 20

stock and to profit by selling millions of shares of the over-priced Green Energy stock to
innocent investors.
15.

As of April 2012 the Defendants had acquired convertible promissory notes

previously issued by Green Energy in order to obtain financing. The promissory notes were
financial instruments reflecting loans received by Green Energy and the company’s agreement
that the debt reflected in those loans could be converted into equity in the company by the
holders of the notes. The Defendants caused the conversion of those notes into equity that
entitled them to approximately 6.5 million shares of Green Energy stock and arranged for the
stock to be held for their benefit in nominee accounts at a broker-dealer doing business in
Panama. The nominee accounts were in the name of Panamanian business corporations called
Brookside International Ltd., Network Communications Inc., Concept Assets Inc., and Sierra
Consultant Corp. (the “Panamanian Entities”), which the Defendants controlled.
16.

In order to sell the shares of Green Energy in the OTC Market, Aubel and Raffa

sought to have the 6.5 million shares deemed “unrestricted,” which would enable them to sell the
shares directly to the investing public. The Defendants accomplished this by arranging for the
transfer agent responsible for maintaining records tracking the ownership and status of Green
Energy’s stock to receive opinion letters representing that none of the four Panamanian Entities
were affiliates of Green Energy. The opinion letters were false because Aubel and Raffa were
operating through and controlled the Panamanian Entities.
17.

The Panamanian Entities were, in fact, affiliates of Green Energy, as were Aubel

and Raffa. An “affiliate” of an issuer (here, Green Energy) is a person that directly, or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, such issuer. Aubel and Raffa controlled Green Energy because of their significant

5

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 6 of 20

ownership of Green Energy’s stock. The Panamanian Entities were affiliates because they, like
Green Energy, were controlled by Aubel and Raffa.
18.

The 6.5 million shares of Green Energy stock owned and controlled by the

Defendants, through the Panamanian Entities, represented approximately 92% of Green Energy’s
purported unrestricted stock as of April 2012, as well as approximately 26% of the total
outstanding shares (restricted and unrestricted) of the company’s stock, which far exceed the
10% threshold for qualifying as an affiliate. Aubel and Raffa also qualified as affiliates because
the large percentage of Green Energy stock they owned and controlled, directly and indirectly,
gave them the ability to control or influence Green Energy.
19.

Aubel was well aware that he held control over Green Energy. In fact, during a

call secretly recorded during a Federal Bureau of Investigation (the “FBI”) undercover
investigation, Aubel was asked if he controlled Green Energy and he advised, in response, that
he had control over the company through a lawyer, who was his partner and who had put the deal
together.
20.

Because the Panamanian Entities, as well as Aubel and Raffa, were affiliates of

Green Energy, any sales of the company’s stock by the Defendants, whether directly or through
the nominee accounts, were subject to sales and volume limits imposed by SEC Rule 144. SEC
Rule 144 limits the volume of securities that may legally be sold for the account of an “affiliate”
of an issuer to the greater of one percent of the shares or other units of the class of outstanding
stock as shown by the most recent report or statement published by the issuer, or the average
weekly reported volume of trading in such securities.
21.

In addition to concealing their ownership and control of 6.5 million shares of

Green Energy stock by using nominee account holders and the false opinion letters, Aubel and

6

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 7 of 20

Raffa also failed to file required disclosure forms with the SEC. Officers and directors of a
company, as well as persons who are beneficial owners of more than 10% of a SEC-registered
issuer’s stock are generally required to file SEC Form 3, which is an initial statement of
beneficial ownership. An individual or entity that owns and exercises control of shares of stock
is the beneficial owner of the stock regardless of whether the stock is held in a third party’s name
and/or account (i.e., “nominee accounts”). In addition, after effecting transactions, beneficial
owners are required to file SEC Form 4, which discloses changes in beneficial ownership.
Finally, persons who are beneficial owners of more than 5% of a SEC-registered issuer’s stock
are generally required to file disclosure reports on Schedule 13D, as well as related amendments
to Schedule 13D reflecting material changes.
22.

During the relevant period the Defendants were the beneficial owners of the 6.5

million shares of Green Energy stock and they sold millions of shares of the stock in the OTC
Market, all without filing SEC Form 3, a Schedule 13D disclosure report or SEC Form 4. Aubel
and Raffa knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that they were required to file SEC Forms 3
and 4 and a Schedule 13D.
B.

Aubel and Raffa Orchestrate the Initial Promotional Campaign for and Sales
of Green Energy Stock

23.

Having obtained millions of shares of Green Energy stock and fraudulently

arranged to have those millions of purportedly unrestricted shares at their disposal both directly
and through their use of nominee accounts, the Defendants orchestrated a promotional campaign
in late June and early July, 2012, designed to increase Green Energy’s stock price (the “Initial
Promotion”). At or about the same time, the Defendants intended to sell, and secretly did sell,
shares of Green Energy stock to investors.

7

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 8 of 20

24.

During the summer of 2012, to launch the promotional campaign, Aubel and

Raffa hired various stock promoters, sometimes characterizing the payments as being targeted
for “investor relations services.”
25.

First, Green Energy issued a series of press releases designed to create the illusion

that the company was thriving and expanding, which was not the case. The first press release,
issued on June 25, 2012, stated: “Green Energy purchased a 5-acre parcel of land in Highland
Park, Michigan in November 2011 and began preparation of the site to receive construction and
demolition (“C&D”) waste. The site is cleared and most of the necessary equipment is in place
to receive waste material and begin advanced recycling operations to recover valuable materials
in the waste stream. Green Energy is working closely with local officials to complete the
permitting process and expects to commence full operations within 60 days.” The press release
was misleading in that the 5-acre parcel was never cleared and, aside from a rental scale, no
equipment was ever placed on the site to receive waste material and begin advanced recycling
operations. The parcel never was intended to be used for recycling operations.
26.

On June 27, 2012 the company issued another press release stating: “Green

Energy Renewable Solutions (OTCQB: EWRL) announced today that it has signed a long term
contract with Disposal Specialties, LLC of Birmingham, Michigan that will guarantee up to
1,000 tons per day of construction and demolition waste for recycling operations at its Highland
Park, Michigan facility.” The press release was misleading in that there was no “facility” in
Highland Park, Michigan apart from a 5-acre parcel of unimproved land.
27.

From approximately June 26, 2012 through July 6, 2012, stock promoters, whom

the Defendants hired, touted Green Energy in various forums and through various media with
statements like “I Believe That EWRL Will Be A Huge Win Over At Least 3 Days! . . . EWRL

8

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 9 of 20

Is The Mirror Image Of What Archer Daniels Was 20 Years Ago! . . . all this could make EWRL
one of the most solid and largest percentage gainers, possibly yielding 2000-3000% returns in
the super short term!” The promotions and promotional materials were materially misleading.
First, there was no disclosure that these promotions were funded by the Defendants, that is Green
Energy affiliates who secretly owned and controlled millions of shares of Green Energy stock
and who intended to dump those shares into the OTC Market and sell them to unsuspecting
investors if and when the promotional efforts led to a rise in stock price. Second, the materials in
toto were designed to create the impression that Green Energy was a vibrant, active company
when, in fact, its actual business operations were nearly dormant and there was no basis for
representing that its fortunes were on the rise. Third, the promotional materials themselves
contained material misstatements by incorporating the misstatements made in Green Energy’s
June 25 and June 27 press releases.
28.

Green Energy’s stock price and trading volume increased dramatically as a result

of the promotional campaign conceived, orchestrated, and paid for by Aubel and Raffa. Green
Energy’s stock price rose from approximately $.01 per share on or about June 1, 2012 to as high
as approximately $.88 per share on or about June 29, 2012. In addition, the trading volume of
Green Energy’s stock increased from zero shares traded on or about June 1, 2012, to millions of
shares traded per day during much of the Initial Promotion.
29.

Aubel and Raffa took advantage of the increased investor interest and rise in the

stock price by selling several million shares of Green Energy stock to unsuspecting investors
without disclosing their role in the touting of Green Energy’s stock or their controlling interest in
Green Energy. From June 20, 2012, through July 27, 2012, Aubel and Raffa sold approximately
2.5 million shares of Green Energy stock for approximately $1 million in proceeds.

9

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 10 of 20

30.

Shortly after the stock sales, Aubel and Raffa wired more than $324,000 in stock

sale proceeds from Panama to a company called International Coastal Financial, Inc. (“ICF”),
which was controlled by Aubel. In addition, a law firm in Panama wired approximately
$432,000 in stock sale proceeds to ICF. Aubel, through ICF, then wired at least $25,000 from
the proceeds to a purported consulting company controlled by Raffa.
31.

Aubel and Raffa knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that they were required

to disclose their stock ownership and sales in filings with the SEC. At no time before, during or
after the Initial Promotion did Aubel or Raffa file the disclosures required in SEC Form 3, SEC
Form 4, Schedule 13D, or otherwise. Aubel and Raffa failed to make the required filings and
disclosures in order to hide their ownership and sales of Green Energy stock.
C.

The Sales of Green Energy Stock Made and Caused by Aubel and Raffa, by
Entities They Controlled, Exceeded Legal Limits on “Affiliate” Sales

32.

The stock sales of the Defendants were subject to sales and volume limits

imposed by SEC Rule 144 because the Defendants were “affiliates” of Green Energy.
33.

An “affiliate” of an issuer (here, Green Energy) is a person that directly, or

indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common
control with, such issuer.
34.

The defendants controlled Green Energy because of their significant ownership of

Green Energy’s stock.
35.

SEC Rule 144 limits the volume of securities legally able to be sold for the

account of an “affiliate” of an issuer to the greater of one percent of the shares or other units of
the class of outstanding stock as shown by the most recent report or statement published by the
issuer, or the average weekly reported volume of trading in such securities.

10

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 11 of 20

36.

The Defendants sold approximately 2.5 million shares of Green Energy’s stock

from approximately June 2012 through July 2012. Green Energy’s SEC filing for the quarter
ended June 30, 2012 disclosed the number of Green Energy’s total outstanding shares of
common stock as approximately 63 million shares. Defendants’ stock sales exceeded the
proscribed limits imposed by SEC Rule 144.
D.

Aubel and Raffa Take Steps to Stabilize Green Energy’s Stock Price to Set
the Stage for Further Promotions and Stock Sales

37.

Following the Initial Promotion, Aubel and Raffa still controlled millions of

shares of Green Energy stock, which they intended to sell. To that end, the Defendants took
steps to artificially prop-up Green Energy’s stock price, which would enable them to sell the
stock they controlled at artificially higher prices.
38.

In late August, 2012, Aubel and Raffa contacted an individual who they believed

could assist them with further promotions of Green Energy stock. Unknown to the Defendants,
the individual they contacted was an individual cooperating with federal law enforcement
authorities (the cooperating individual or “CI”) and working with undercover agents of the FBI
who were investigating market manipulation activities.
39.

Aubel and the CI spoke by telephone on September 6, 2012. The call was

recorded as part of the FBI’s undercover investigation. During the September 6 call, Aubel
boasted to the CI that he and Raffa had sold approximately two million shares of Green Energy
stock during a recent promotion. Aubel also told the CI that he had just purchased
approximately 40,000 shares of Green Energy stock to increase the bid price (i.e., the price at
which investors would expect to buy stock). Aubel made the purchase through a series of “buys”
using a brokerage firm in Panama. Aubel explained to the CI that he entered the buy orders to
prevent Green Energy’s stock price from declining. Four of the purchases in the series resulted

11

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 12 of 20

in an uptick, or increase, in the price of Green Energy’s stock. One neutralized a downtick, or
decrease, in its price. These buy orders, which were entered to influence Green Energy’s stock
price, were false and misleading because they appeared to show legitimate market demand.
40.

In addition, later in the same September 6 call with the CI, Aubel advised that he

planned to buy Green Energy stock at the end of the day for the purpose of generating an uptick
in the stock price, a manipulative trading practice known as “marking the close.”
41.

“Marking the close” is a form of stock price manipulation that involves the

placing and execution of orders shortly before the close of trading on any given day to artificially
influence the closing price of the security. Aubel made it clear during the September 6 call with
the CI that he intended to “mark the close” and to cause an artificial price uptick in Green
Energy’s stock with late-in-the-day transactions.
42.

Consistent with what he told the CI, late that day Aubel, through one of his

Panamanian Entities, bought approximately 1,000 shares of Green Energy stock during the last
trade of the day at approximately $.11 per share. That purchase had the effect of raising Green
Energy’s stock price from the price at which the second-to-last trade that day had been executed-approximately $.095 per share. Aubel engaged in similar trading activity on a series of
additional days, marking the close on those days as well.
43.

Aubel knew when he made these late-in-the-day purchases, or was reckless in not

knowing, that he was marking the close, which he intended to operate as a fraud or deceit upon
investors.
E.

Aubel and Raffa Plan and Execute a “Cross Trade” Intending to Finance
Further Promotions and Stock Sales

44.

Following the Initial Promotion, Aubel and Raffa took steps to liquidate the

remaining shares—approximately 10 million—of Green Energy that they controlled.

12

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 13 of 20

45.

For example, they sought to raise additional financing for further promotional

campaigns and/or they discussed selling their remaining shares through, among other things,
cross trades. A cross trade as referenced herein is a coordinated trade in which two parties agree
to trade stock at a prearranged date and price.
46.

In late August 2012, Aubel and Raffa contacted the CI for assistance with a

second touting campaign in order to “get liquid,” or obtain financing in exchange for stock.
During a telephone call with the CI on September 6, 2012, that was recorded as part of the FBI’s
undercover investigation, Aubel and Raffa arranged with the CI to have an associate of the CI—
who purported to represent brokers willing to buy stock for their customers in exchange for a
kickback—to purchase shares of Green Energy in order to generate $150,000 to $250,000. Their
expectation was that the proceeds then would be used by the CI to launch a digital marketing
campaign for Green Energy. Unknown to the Defendants, the CI’s associate was an agent of the
FBI acting in an undercover capacity (the “undercover agent”) and the brokers were fictitious.
47.

Ultimately, the defendants’ intent was that a cross trade (the “Cross Trade”)

would be executed between the Defendants and the undercover agent so that: (a) the Defendants
could sell stock in order to obtain money to finance another promotional campaign; and (b) the
Defendants could continue to indirectly control the stock by providing a kickback to the
purchaser of the Green Energy stock, the undercover agent, to ensure that the purchaser would
not resell the stock at a time that could negate the effects of a promotional campaign.
48.

Aubel and Raffa both participated in the September 6 recorded telephone call with

the CI. During that call, the Defendants arranged for the undercover agent to use purported
broker associates to purchase shares of Green Energy in exchange for money, which could
subsequently be used by the CI to launch the digital promotional campaign.

13

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 14 of 20

49.

Following the September 6 call, Raffa and the CI engaged in at least one

additional recorded telephone conversation to work out the details of the Cross Trade. In
particular, Raffa and the CI discussed and agreed that one of the undercover agent’s purported
broker associates would purchase approximately 174,000 shares of Green Energy stock at
approximately $.115 per share (for a cost of approximately $20,000) from the Defendants on
September 7, 2012, and that the undercover agent would receive a $6,000 kickback.
50.

On or about September 7, 2012, Raffa engaged in the Cross Trade.

51.

Thereafter, on or about September 19, 2012, the Defendants wired $6,000 to the

undercover agent’s bank account through a nominee entity controlled by Aubel.
52.

Armed with new capital, Aubel and Raffa orchestrated additional promotional

campaigns concerning Green Energy’s stock in approximately September 2012, November 2012,
and January 2013 and, in connection with the promotions, sold millions of additional shares of
Green Energy stock.
53.

For example, in or about September 2012, the Defendants sold hundreds of

thousands of shares of Green Energy stock for net proceeds of approximately $41,000.
Thereafter, during the promotion of Green Energy’s stock in November 2012, the Defendants
sold millions of additional shares of Green Energy for net proceeds of over $400,000.
54.

On or about December 28, 2012, the Defendants wired approximately $10,000 to

a stock promoter, which then, along with other stock promoters, touted Green Energy from on or
about and between January 1, 2013 and January 4, 2013.
55.

In or about January 2013, the Defendants sold approximately 1,390,000 shares of

Green Energy stock for net proceeds of approximately $30,000.

14

Case 1:16-cv-10670 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 15 of 20

56.

The Defendants did not disclose their intent to sell stock or their stock sales to the

SEC or any prospective investors throughout 2012 and 2013. During the subsequent
promotional campaigns Aubel and Raffa sold millions of additional shares of Green Energy
stock in the OTC Market, all without filing SEC Form 3, a Schedule 13D disclosure report or
SEC Form 4. Aubel and Raffa knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that they were required to
file SEC Forms 3 and 4 and a Schedule 13D. Aubel and Raffa failed to make the required filings
and disclosures in order to hide their ownership and sales of Green Energy stock.
57.

In none of the materials used in the promotional campaigns did Aubel or Raffa

disclose that funding for the promotion came from them, when they secretly owned and
controlled millions of shares of Green Energy stock and intended to dump those shares into the
OTC Market and sell them to unsuspecting investors if and when the promotional efforts led to a
rise in stock price.
