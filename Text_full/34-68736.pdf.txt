In the Matter of
JOHN W. ADAMS and AIP, LLC,

ORDER MODIFYING DISTRIBUTION PLAN
AND DIRECTING DISBURSEMENT OF
DISGORGEMENT FUND

Respondents.

On February 23, 2009, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Disgorgement Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) in connection with this
proceeding pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement
Plans, 17 C.F.R. §201.1103 (Exchange Act Rel. No. 59433). The Notice advised parties they
could obtain a copy of the Proposed Plan of Distribution (“Distribution Plan”) at www.sec.gov.
The Notice also advised that all parties desiring to comment on the Distribution Plan could
submit their comments, in writing, no later than March 25, 2009. No comments were received
by the Commission in response to the Notice. On May 6, 2009, the Commission issued an
Order Approving Distribution Plan of a Disgorgement Fund (“Order”) (Exchange Act Rel. No.
59870).
The Distribution Plan states that upon approval of the Plan, the Fund Administrator shall
establish an Escrow Account and a Controlled Distribution Account (collectively the “Accounts”)
at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”). After the Plan was approved, however, the Fund
Administrator was unable to establish the Accounts at Wells Fargo due to a change in the bank’s
policy. Instead, the Fund Administrator established the Accounts at Huntington National Bank.
The Division requests that the Commission approve this modification to the Distribution Plan.
The Distribution Plan also provides that in order to distribute the funds, the Fund
Administrator will submit a Payment List to the assigned Commission staff, who will obtain
authorization from the Commission to disburse pursuant to Rule 1101(b)(6). The Payment List,
which is in the amount of $2,628,775.28, has been received by Commission staff and the staff
requests that the Commission authorize disbursement of the funds.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that:
1)
2)

The Distribution Plan is hereby modified. All references to Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. shall be replaced with Huntington National Bank; and
The Commission staff shall transfer $2,628,775.28 of the Disgorgement Fund to
Huntington National Bank, and the Fund Administrator shall distribute the monies
to investors, as provided for in the Distribution Plan.

By the Commission.

Secretary
