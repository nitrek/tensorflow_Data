ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order Instituting
Proceedings (OIP) on March 30, 2015. The OIP alleges that Respondents violated the antifraud
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 in their operation of three collateral loan obligation
funds (known as the Zohar Funds) by reporting misleading values for the assets held by the funds and
failing to disclose a conflict of interest arising from Lynn Tilton’s undisclosed approach to
categorization of assets. The proceeding was stayed by order of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit between September 17, 2015, and June 2016. See Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, 2016
U.S. App. LEXIS 9970, at *37 (2d Cir. June 1, 2016); Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, ECF Nos. 76, 125.
The hearing is currently scheduled to commence on October 24, 2016.
Two subpoenas directed to the Commission were issued on September 1, 2016, at
Respondents’ request. See Lynn Tilton, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4116, 2016 SEC LEXIS
4116 (A.L.J. Sept. 1, 2016). Under consideration are Respondents’ October 17, 2016, Motions: (1) to
Compel the Office of Litigation and Administrative Practice to Produce Documents Responsive to
Respondents’ Subpoenas; and (2) for Leave to File the Motion to Compel. The Motion for Leave to
File will be granted. The Motion to Compel states that Respondents and the Commission’s Office of
Litigation and Administrative Practice (OLAP) held numerous meet and confers to resolve any
privilege assertions, but that OLAP continues to withhold inter-agency communications that the
undersigned had ordered to be released. Ex. 2 of the Declaration of Mary Beth Maloney attached to
the Motion to Compel is a privilege log sent to Respondents on October 14, 2016. Next to each
withheld document is a privilege claim of work product doctrine, law enforcement privilege, and/or
deliberative process privilege. But no particularized showing as to the law enforcement, or any other,
privilege’s applicability has been made. See In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d 923, 944 (2d Cir. 2010)
(“[T]he party asserting the law enforcement privilege bears the burden of showing that the privilege
applies to the documents in question.”). Accordingly, the Division and/or OLAP must submit the
withheld items to the undersigned for in camera review by noon EDT on October 21, 2016, and
include an explanation as to how the claimed privilege[s] apply to each withheld document. Individual
items that are part of an email chain may be lumped together for the purpose of the explanation.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
