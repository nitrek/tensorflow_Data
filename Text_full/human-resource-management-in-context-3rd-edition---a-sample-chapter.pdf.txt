chapter 1

Human resource management
and its external contexts

i n tRO d u c t iO n
This chapter provides the theoretical and practical backgrounds to the rest of
the book. It does this by giving an outline description, analysis and overview of
contemporary human resource management (HRM) within the United Kingdom
(UK) and the external contexts driving it. These contexts are identified within the
framework of the strategy, insights and solutions professional area of the CIPD’s HR
Profession Map (CIPD 2009). HRM, loosely defined as the managing of people at
work, has undergone significant changes in its purposes, structures and activities
in recent years. This chapter starts by examining the factors influencing these
developments and considers the changing nature of HRM and how it has developed
historically. The chapter then identifies and discusses some key issues on the HRM
agenda. These include: how the human resources (HR) function is organised, HR
and performance, line managers and HR, outsourcing HR, HRM and ethics, and HR
strategy. Next, the chapter summarises the major institutional, external contexts
impacting on the HR function that influence HR strategy and practices; issues
that are revisited in greater depth later in the book. Finally, the chapter puts
these developments into a global context by discussing some trends in
international HRM.

d e f in in g and unde rstanding con t emporary h rm
Providing a definitive definition of contemporary HRM is problematic. This
is because there is no generally agreed framework for understanding and
analysing the HR function; there are only competing models. In practice, the HR
function within organisations in the UK (and elsewhere) is infinitely flexible,
organisationally contingent over time and driven principally by the external
contexts of the age; and these often change within short periods of time. Indeed,
the history of HR in the UK and elsewhere shows that it has had to change
its priorities and focus its activities by re-inventing itself continuously. This
has been largely in response to external socio-economic factors beyond the
immediate control of HR practitioners or senior managers. For these reasons a
variety of definitions, frameworks and models can be found in any of the basic
(or not so basic) texts and in the wide range of articles examining and exploring
the functions, roles and antecedents of contemporary HRM in organisations.
However, some understanding of the differing frameworks and intellectual
underpinnings of HRM is necessary, if readers are to identify, understand and
analyse the major external and internal contexts within which HR professionals
operate today. It is these dynamic contexts which provide a continuing theme
throughout the text.
One major text in the field, Marchington and Wilkinson (2008), defines HRM
curtly as the management of employment. Another standard text provides no
agreed definition of HRM but distinguishes between ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ versions
of it. These writers, drawing upon Guest (1987) and Storey (1992), claim soft
HRM ‘recognises employees as a resource worth investing in, and tends to focus
on high commitment/high involvement human resource practices.’ Hard HRM
‘identifies employees as a cost to be minimised, and tends to focus on “flexibility
techniques” and limited investment in learning and development’ (Beardwell
and Claydon 2007, pp671, 675). Boxall and Purcell (2008) regard HRM in the
English-speaking world as all those activities associated with the management of
employment relationships in the firm.

Human resource management and its external contexts

from personnel management to hrm
For Torrington et al (2008, p6), the term HRM is used in two ways. They provide
a useful distinction between ‘HRM mark 1’ and ‘HRM mark 2’. The first is a
generic term used to describe the body of management activities which have
been traditionally labelled ‘personnel management’. The second is regarded as a
distinctive approach to HRM and suggests a specific philosophy towards carrying
out ‘people-oriented organisational activities’. Generic HRM seeks to achieve four
key objectives: staffing, performance, change-management and administration.
These organisational objectives are delivered primarily by personnel/HR
specialists or personnel/HR generalists. HRM as a distinctive approach to
managing people delivers organisational objectives by HR professionals in
collaboration with line managers.
Guest (1987), in turn, has identified a number of ‘stereotypical’ features
distinguishing the personnel management tradition (HRM mark 1) from the
distinctive HR tradition (HRM mark 2). Personnel management is specialist and
professionally driven. Its features include: a short-term, ad hoc time perspective;
a pluralist, collective approach to managing employment relations; bureaucratic,
centralised, organisational structures; and cost minimisation evaluation criteria.
The distinctive, ‘new’ HR tradition (HRM mark 2) is largely integrated with
line management. Its features include: a long-term, strategic time perspective; a
unitary, individual approach to managing employment relations; more organic,
devolved, flexible organisational structures; and maximum utilisation of human
resources.
Interestingly, Torrington et al identify six main periods or ‘themes’ in the history
of personnel management and its transition into contemporary HRM. Indeed,
as Gennard and Kelly (1997, p31) have perceptively observed, delivery of the
personnel/HR function has always been flexible and has adjusted its dominant
values historically ‘as macro circumstances change’. Legge (1995, p xiv) argues,
however, that the apparent overshadowing of personnel management by the
distinctive HRM tradition lies in its function as ‘a rhetoric about how employees
should be managed to achieve competitive advantage [rather] than as a coherent
new practice’. Keenoy (1990) goes further in his critique of the new HRM,
viewing it as ‘a wolf in sheep’s clothing’. For him, HRM is more rhetoric than
reality and simply supports ideological shifts in the employment relationship,
driven by market pressures.
Torrington et al (2008) describe the first theme in the evolution of personnel
management and HRM in the UK as ‘social justice’. This originated on a limited
scale amongst a few enlightened employers in nineteenth-century Britain. These
employers promoted a welfare approach to managing people by attempting to
ameliorate working conditions and avoid adversarial industrial relations. Second,
in the first half of the twentieth century, ‘humane bureaucracy’, influenced by
managerial practitioners and observers such as Taylor (1911), Fayol (1916)
and Mayo (1933) came to the fore in management practices. Taylor’s ‘scientific
management’ principles adopted a work study, incentive-based approach to
managing people. This was followed by the ‘human relations’ school, originating

in Mayo’s works reported in the Hawthorne experiments, and later others, which
aimed at fostering good ‘human relations’, high morale and efficiency at work.
Third, in response to strong trade unions in the 1960s, a period of ‘negotiated
consent’ was fostered by personnel and industrial relations managers. This aimed
at containing union power and managing workers by representative systems and
collective agreements. Fourth, from the late 1960s, the focus was on ‘organisation’
provided by personnel specialists. They did this by developing career paths,
opportunities for personal growth and workforce planning. Fifth, the recent
‘HRM’ theme, with its focus on performance management, planning, monitoring
and control, flexibility and employees as individuals, emerged and grew in the
English-speaking world throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. This was in
response to what is loosely described as globalisation and neo-liberal economic
policies.
A sixth theme claimed by some observers, such as Bach (2005, pp28–9), is a
‘new HR’. Driven by employer demands for competitive advantage, this theme
is characterised by a ‘new trajectory’ in response to significant long-term
trends in the business context. These include a global perspective, issues of
legal compliance, the emergence of ‘multi-employer’ networks (or ‘permeable
organisations’), engagement of individual employees emotionally at work, and a
customer-centred focus in business. This trend or theme seems to reflect a shift
away from the ‘management of jobs’ by organisations to the ‘management of
people’ within them (Lepak and Snell 2007).
In their summary review of the HR literature, Beardwell and Clark (2007) identify
five comparative models of personnel management and HRM. They describe
these as: the planning perspective, people management perspective, employment
relations perspective, structure/systems perspective, and role perspective. In each
case, practices and theories of managing people within each of the personnel
management and HRM traditions differ. In outline, personnel management
in the planning perspective is reactive and marginal to corporate plans. In the
people management perspective, people are a variable cost, subject to compliance
and organisational control. In the employment relations perspective, personnel
management accepts that self-interest dominates at work and that conflicts
of interests among stakeholders are inevitable. Personnel management in the
structure/systems perspective imposes control of staff from the top and control of
information flows downwards. In the role perspective, personnel management is
specialised, professional and driven by personnel specialists.
Within the HRM tradition, HRM is strategy-focused and central to the corporate
plan in the planning perspective. In the people management perspective, HRM
views people as social capital capable of being developed and committed at work.
In the employment relations perspective, HRM supports coincidence of interests
among stakeholders and de-emphasises conflict in the workplace. HRM in the
structure/systems perspective promotes employee participation and informed
choice by staff, with open channels of communication to management aimed at
building employee trust and commitment. In the role perspective, HRM is largely
integrated into line management.

Human resource management and its external contexts

7

Clearly from this brief outline of some of the recent literature in the field, there
is no universally agreed definition of contemporary HRM or the practices it
incorporates; an issue which is explored more fully in Chapter 5. However, two
observations can be made. First, HRM in the UK, as elsewhere, is historically
‘path dependent’. This means, and explains how, institutions, social structures
or patterns of behaviour in the present are limited by what has happened in the
past, even though past circumstances may no longer apply. Second, as Guest
(1997, p266) has argued, this lack of consensus about HRM arises from the
‘absence of a coherent theoretical basis for classifying HRM policy and practice’.
In examining the key literature in the area, Guest identifies three broad categories
of general level theory about contemporary HRM. These are: strategic theories,
such as those of Miles and Snow (1984) and Schuler and Jackson (1987);
descriptive theories, such as those of Beer et al (1985) and Kochan et al (1986);
and normative theories, such as those of Walton (1985) and Pfeffer (1994). Each
theoretical category originates in different sets of assumptions about HRM. These
are contingency theory, systems theory and motivation theory respectively. What
these theoretical schools have in common is that contemporary HRM is deemed
to be distinctive in some way or other from traditional personnel management;
debates that are revisited later in this book. A summary of the main features of
personnel management and HRM is provided in Figure 1.1.

Introducing HRM, organisations and management

the hr profession map
It is useful to conclude this introductory section by drawing upon the CIPD’s
HR Profession Map and its commentary on contemporary HR practices (CIPD
2009). The outcomes of the Map are based upon in-depth interviews with senior
practitioners across the main economic sectors in the UK in 2008–09. Four issues
stand out:
●●

●●

●●

●●

The Profession Map covers not only the technical elements of professional
competence required in the HR profession but also the behaviours.
The Map describes what HR professionals need to do, what they need to know,
and how they need to do it within each of 10 professional areas (outlined below)
and eight behaviours, organised into four bands of professional competence.
Areas of expertise in the Map are organised by professional competence, not by
organisation structures, job levels or roles.
The breadth and depth of the HR profession are covered from small to large
organisations, fundamental to ‘sophisticated’ practices, local to global levels,
corporations to consultancies, charities to public services, and traditional to
progressive activities.

The CIPD’s approach to contemporary HR practice in the Profession Map is a
normative, competence-based one. A major conclusion is that a significant shift
has taken place in the focus of HR. There has been a move away from a primary
focus on supporting line managers and helping them manage people well to one
ensuring that ‘the organisation has the sustainable capability it needs to deliver its
aims both today and in the future’. The Map seeks to do this by examining what
HR people do and what they deliver across every aspect and specialism of the
HR profession. The professional areas identified within the Map, in addition to
‘strategy, insights and solutions’, are ‘leading and managing the human resources
function’, ‘organisation design’, ‘organisation development’, ‘resourcing and talent
planning’, ‘learning and talent development’, ‘performance and reward’, ‘employee
engagement’, ‘employee relations’ and ‘service delivery and information’.
Three observations emerge from the CIPD’s analysis. First, the HR Profession
Map identifies the underpinning knowledge, skills and behaviours that HR
professionals need to have if they are to be successful. Second, it creates a clear
and flexible framework for career progression, recognising that both that HR
roles and career progression vary. Third, the Map also provides a comprehensive
view of how HR adds sustained value to organisations in which it operates, now
and in the future (CIPD 2009). The CIPD’s HR Profession Map, in short, places
HRM at the heart of promoting improved performance, the effective managing of
people at work and sustainable capability.

s om e ke y issue s in hrm
Given the changing contexts of HRM and HR practices, some key issues in
contemporary HRM have emerged out of these developments. These contexts
have affected the nature and structure of the HR function, its links with
performance, HR and line managers, outsourcing HR, ethics and HRM, and HR
strategy.

developments in the hr function
A number of developments have taken place within the HR community and HR
work in recent years. First, research by the CIPD (2008) as part of its study on the
changing HR function agenda has identified some major changes in the structure
of HR in large private and public sector organisations. This reveals that many
large organisations are adopting variants of Ulrich’s (1997) multi-legged model
of HR structures, rather than having centralised HR departments as in the past.
This has resulted in HR functions becoming more specialised and being divided
between ‘shared services’, ‘business partners’, ‘centres of expertise’ or ‘vendor
management’, overseen by ‘corporate HR’. These roles are illustrated in Figure 1.2.
●●

Shared services. Those working in shared services undertake a lot of HR
administrative tasks and provide information and advice through intranets and
call centres to clients. Staff are often employed for their good interpersonal,
customer service and team management skills, which can be prioritised over
their HR knowledge.

Business partners. This HR role varies widely. Some business partners report
to senior HR managers, others to senior line managers. Research shows that
business partners are expected to work with business units or line managers on
strategic development, organisational design, business performance or change
management.
Centres of expertise. Other HR practitioners provide support to business
partners, develop detailed policy for corporate HR, and act as reference points
for shared services when dealing with complex queries. The most common
centres of HR expertise are people resourcing, employment relations, pay and
rewards, learning and development, and organisational development.
Vendor management. These staff provide third-party services, such as pension
administration, managed through service-level agreements.
Corporate HR. Those working in corporate HR have responsibility for
developing HR and people strategy. Corporate HR players increasingly have a
governance role, ensuring that organisations uphold corporate values, comply
with their legal requirements and follow ‘good practice’ HR.

According to the CIPD (2008), the separation of transactional, generalist HR
roles from transformational specialist ones within large organisations has led
to changing skill requirements, and some recruitment problems, within the HR
profession. In small and medium-sized enterprises, in contrast, HR is still likely
to take on more traditional people management and development activities,
based on generalist roles.
As noted below, a second development within HR is continuing delegation of some
HR activities to line managers. The HR areas that line managers typically deal with
include recruitment and selection, pay and reward, performance management,
grievances and discipline, coaching, and learning and development. It is generally
accepted that some line managers have skills gaps in people management and
development activities and therefore have difficulties implementing HR policies
effectively. Devolving HR activities to line managers has implications for HR
professionals. who need to be facilitators, help line managers carry out their
HR/people management and development activities effectively, and support
line managers in getting the most out of the people resources. In designing
and developing HR policies and procedures, HR practitioners also need to be
aware that these will be delivered by line managers and that line managers need
ownership of them; a theme developed further later in this chapter.
A third set of developments is in learning and development (L&D), where
the focus is on ‘learning’ rather than ‘training’ and where the skills of those
working in the field have changed. Today, business awareness and consultancy
skills are highly valued among L&D practitioners. They provide solutions to
business problems and support organisational change. There has also been a
professionalisation of those delivering work-based learning, with staff working
in these areas being increasingly certificated and well qualified. E-learning and
blended learning have become important as technology develops, in a field where
virtual learning environments, podcasts and gaming technology are increasingly

popular. Coaching line managers has also been identified as a very effective L&D
practice.

hrm and performance
Since the 1980s and 1990s, there have been fundamental changes in the
structures and management processes of organisations in the private and public
sectors. Adjustments to the functions, structures and roles of the HR function are
partly in response to these changes but also reflect the revolution in information
and communication technologies (ICTs) outlined above. Three changes
stand out. In this period, first, many large-scale hierarchical organisations
have become divisionalised. This has resulted from breaking them up into
a number of semi-autonomous operations or quasi-businesses, responsible
for all the business activities within their areas of jurisdiction. Examples of
divisionalisation include splitting large companies into separate, independent
organisations, creating executive agencies and trusts in the public services
and, in multinational businesses, setting up international product (or services)
divisions with responsibility for individual products on a European or global
basis (Hughes 2003, Geppert and Mayer 2006). Second, budgetary devolution is
now commonplace. This has resulted in allocating responsibility for managing
activities within planned financial resources or targets to the lowest possible
levels within organisations. Third, internal markets have been created. This is
where services are traded between ‘purchasers’ and ‘providers’ to ensure that
different groups are responsive to the needs of each other and that such activities
are cost-effective. In short, divisionalisation, devolved budgeting and internal
markets have resulted in a fundamental shift from the management of tasks in
the private and public sectors to management by financial performance (Sisson
and Storey 2000).
It follows that the search for improved performance from individuals and
groups within organisations is now a crucial managerial goal in most businesses
and public enterprises. Customised HR practices and promoting appropriate
employee behaviours play critical roles in facilitating this. The framework within
which performance is organised, measured and reviewed is established in
dedicated, organisational, performance management systems. The underlying aim
of these systems is to get the best outcomes and highest efforts from individuals,
teams and organisations, in pursuing corporate goals.
A principal feature of performance management is that it connects the objectives
of an organisation with the job targets of individuals and focuses on work
improvement, learning, development, motivation and reward. A performance
management system starts with the induction of new staff when they join
an organisation and has four elements: defining performance standards and
setting targets, reviewing and appraising performance, reinforcing performance
standards, and supporting individuals through counselling and other means to
meet performance standards. The review process then identifies the learning and
development needs of individuals and allocates rewards for measured outcomes
(Armstrong and Baron 2005).

Introducing HRM, organisations and management

Leading organisations seek therefore to develop, in collaboration with HR
professionals, systematic frameworks designed to improve individual and
organisational performance in ways that can be measured and reviewed.
Analysing claimed links between HRM and performance is now a major area
of interest for both researchers and policy-makers. A wide range of studies has
attempted to demonstrate the positive relationship or links between certain
‘bundles’ of HR practices and high organisational performance (Appelbaum et al
2000, West et al 2002, Godard 2004).
Guest et al (2003) provide a useful theoretical framework guiding this analysis,
as illustrated in Figure 1.3. In outline, their model suggests possible links
between a series of managerial inputs and performance outputs. The inputs
are business strategy, HR strategy and HR practices. The HR practices include
induction, job design, recruitment and selection, appraisal, pay and reward,
training and development, financial flexibility, harmonisation, communication
and job security. The outputs are effective HR outcomes, quality of goods and
services, productivity and financial performance. Evaluating the effectiveness
of these HR activities allows an assessment of how well they are working in
practice. In this study, managing directors and HR professionals were asked to
assess the effectiveness of each of the above HR practices. There were relatively
little differences of opinion between them, with job security deemed to be one
of the most effective HR practices and job design and appraisal being the least
effective. The more HR practices used, and the more effectively they are used,
the better organisational performance is likely to be. From this study at least,
HR effectiveness appears to demonstrate the link between HRM and business
performance.
There are also critiques of performance management systems. One is that
they encourage a short-term view amongst UK managers, which may hamper
organisational performance in the longer term. Second, there is growing
concern that these systems add unduly to stress in working life for many
employees, because of their focus on improving the bottom line. Third, and most
importantly, performance management systems do not always deliver what they
promise. The main driver of performance management is improving overall
organisational effectiveness. However, writers such as Bevan and Thompson
(1992) and others have found from surveys of performance management
that there was no relationship between high-performing UK companies and
performance management systems.

hrm and line managers
Where HR professionals concentrate on developing strategy, designing
performance management systems to match changing business priorities and
other high-level business activities, line managers take on an important role
in implementing HR strategies, policies and practices. Divisionalisation and
devolved budgeting also promote delegation of HR activities. The importance of
the line manager role in delivering HR has been highlighted by Hutchinson and
Purcell (2003, p ix), amongst others. They found that the behaviour of first-line

managers was the most important factor explaining variations in job satisfaction
and job discretion amongst employees. ‘It is also one of the most important
factors in developing organisational commitment.’ It has been noted too that
strengthening the relationship between managers and their employees results in a
positive approach to employee performance and motivation. Such studies indicate
that line managers can make real differences to employee attitudes and behaviour
(Purcell et al 2003). They also demonstrate the critical role that line managers
play in implementing HR policies (Renwick 2003).
To undertake their HR role successfully, line managers need to work closely
with HR practitioners to maintain consistency and effectiveness in carrying
out their HR activities. A survey by Industrial Relations Services (Industrial
Relations Services 2004) asked respondents in 62 organisations about the areas of
responsibility typically exercised by line managers. This reported, first, that they
had major responsibility in absence management, performance appraisal, team
briefing and staff development. Second, line managers and HR professionals had
shared responsibility in induction, training and discipline. Third, line managers
had little responsibility in recruitment, performance pay, promotions and welfare.
Another, later, survey by the CIPD (2007), however, which also examined line
management and HR responsibility for HR, found, first, that 39 per cent of line
management respondents had main responsibility for recruitment and selection
decisions and 10 per cent for training and development. Second, HR was a shared
responsibility for 84 per cent of respondents in recruitment and selection, 59
per cent in training and development, 46 per cent in employee relations, and
35 per cent in pay and benefits. In general, successive surveys have highlighted
increasing HR responsibilities being devolved to line managers in organisations,
normally in conjunction with HR professionals as partners.
Devolving HR activities to line managers, however, is not without its difficulties.
As Renwick (2003) points out, there are several problems in doing this. First,
line managers do not always have the skills and competencies to manage people
effectively. The low technical and educational bases of many UK line managers
provide barriers to the effective devolution of HR activities in some organisations.
Second, in other cases, line managers are not interested in HR work, believing
that competence in the field is gained from a mixture of common sense and
experience rather than from training. Line managers think they know how to
manage people, motivate them and deal with their problems, but have problems
doing this (Cunningham and Hyman 1999). Third, line managers have more
pressing priorities than managing and developing the people working for them.
HRM is low on their lists of management priorities. Moreover, they need support,
recognition and rewards from top managers to become motivated to deal with
HR issues effectively (Marchington and Wilkinson 2008). Fourth, the ways in
which HR practices are implemented by line managers are often inconsistent
and contradictory, resulting in often subjective and discretionary decisionmaking, unless HR support is provided (Hutchinson and Purcell 2003). Training
line managers in their HR responsibilities and working in partnership with HR
professionals appear to be key issues here.

outsourcing hr
In addition to delegating HR responsibilities to line managers, organisations
commonly outsource some HR activities to outside bodies or agencies.
Outsourcing HR is where organisations subcontract HR activities (and in
some cases general commercial activities such as catering and maintenance) on
grounds of cost savings, the need to draw on specialist external expertise not
available internally, and obtaining independent HR advice from outside people
with greater knowledge, skills and experience in their fields of competence
than insiders have. Cost factors, for example, often cause managers to consider
whether support functions can be provided more cheaply externally. Moreover,
subcontractors commonly seek to provide a better service by drawing upon
expertise unavailable to their client. Other factors increasing the incidence of
outsourcing include the argument that firms gain competitive advantage by
focusing their efforts on core business activities and distinctive areas of HR
competence. There are also benefits associated with flexibility and leanness. Thus
where a core activity is outsourced, suppliers can be changed when they perform
badly or their prices become uncompetitive.
Outsourcing takes various forms, such as a shared service centre working
for a single organisation, a joint venture between organisations combining
HR resources or a multi-client call centre providing HR advice to several
organisations (Cooke et al 2004). The sorts of HR activities typically outsourced
include payroll administration, recruitment and selection, learning and
development, executive search, and outplacement and redundancy counselling.
Research carried out in the United States indicated four main areas of HR
covered by outsourcing arrangements: general HR, transactional work, human
capital activities, recruitment and selection. This study shows that reliance on
outsourcing varied with organisational size and complexity, product market
uncertainty and the importance of HR strategy to the business (Klass et al 2001).
A number of HR implications arise from outsourcing. There are legal issues
to consider when an in-house activity is subcontracted, such as transfer of
undertakings regulations. There may be issues associated with control of the
subcontracted activities. There are implications regarding the regulation of
performance levels. With outsourcing, performance is not regulated through a
typical contract of employment, but is managed through commercial contracts
and service level agreements. There are also implications for job security and
work intensification within outsourced organisations (Taylor 2008).

ethics and hrm
Ethical organisations have always existed although most businesses have
traditionally been driven by economic not ethical goals. In the nineteenth
century, for example, Quaker companies operated on distinctive ethical principles
and firms such as Cadburys incorporated welfare policies into their business
philosophies, which benefited their workforces. This was in contrast to most
other firms at the time that were driven solely by the profit motive. Today

Introducing HRM, organisations and management

examples of successful businesses noted for the ethical principles they promote
include the Co-operative Bank, Scott-Bader and Traidcraft.
Some argue that business organisations cannot have ‘ethics’ or be ‘ethical’, as
they are not agents of morality and not driven by moral imperatives. However,
organisations have sufficient structural complexity to be agents, so they can
be called to account for their actions and the consequences of them. If a body
can take decisions and implement them, then it must be responsible for those
decisions (Kaptein and Wempe 2002). Indeed, as corporate legal entities, business
organisations are accountable in law for some of their actions. Therefore part of
corporate responsibility stems from legal requirements – such as employment
law, health and safety and consumer protection – but part of this responsibility
is moral or ethical. Being profitable is a virtue of business organisations but it is
not their only virtue. As Kitson and Campbell (1996, p98) argue: ‘We can expect
organisations to be socially responsible because that is part of the contract out of
which they were created.’ It is a ‘condition of the permission that society granted
that they exist in the first place’.
Until recently, there was relatively little mention of ethics in the HRM literature
in the UK, although it is growing, stimulated by the growth in ethical investment
and ethical consumerism discussed earlier. A different picture emerges in
the United States, where ethics and ethical behaviour feature prominently
in both HR practice and academic research. Yet almost every HR decision
and issue poses ethical questions, since they deal with people issues covering
recruitment and selection, managing performance, equal opportunities, learning
and development, employee relations, pay and rewards, and termination of
employment. Marchington and Wilkinson (2008) argue persuasively that
ethical and socially responsible HR practices may become even more elusive
as organisations devolve HR activities to line managers, who are required to
meet corporate targets that stress production and service targets as their first
priorities. However, ethical recruitment and selection, for example, demand
properly drafted job descriptions and person specifications, candidates only being
invited to interview where they meet the essential requirements and unsuccessful
candidates having their applications returned to them, with the selectors’ reasons
for their decision. Applicants can also be given the results of any assessments
made of them. Perhaps the underlying argument for ethical HR practices is that
companies adopting them benefit by gaining employee commitment, the trust
and loyalty of their workforce and improved organisational performance.
Winstanley et al (1996, p5ff) have written that ‘the relationship between
ethics and human resource management is emerging as a subject of serious
academic enquiry.’ They have identified three main issues: ethical concerns,
ethical frameworks and putting ethics into practice. They raise concerns about
the lowering of employment standards, for example, where several types of
undesirable change have been identified. These are, first, job insecurity and risk
at work. Second, new forms of work organisation and management control are
giving rise to surveillance and control of employees at work. Third, deregulation
of management decision-making in firms is leaving little scope for power-based

employee participation in the workplace, and this element in contemporary HRM
‘is at best unsympathetic to the exercise of democratic rights by employees or to
stakeholder models of corporate governance’. Fourth, the rhetoric of HRM, with
its themes of commitment and identification, fits poorly with the trend towards
less secure employment and evidence of diminished employer commitment
to employees, with ‘a relentlessly instrumental orientation to the employment
relationship on the part of employers’.
Winstanley et al (1996, p9ff) also claim that the prevailing common-sense ethical
framework justifying contemporary HRM policies based on their utilitarianism
to organisations is a weak principle for ethical action. They identify a number of
alternative ethical frameworks lending themselves to analysing HRM. These are:
●●

●●

●●

●●

Basic human, civil and employment rights. This seeks greater job security,
openness, and transparency, and aims to avoid making scapegoats at work.
Social and organisational justice. This aims to provide procedural principles
for evaluating current employment practices.
Universalism. This emphasises the Kantian principle of treating individuals as
ends in themselves and not just means to ends.
Community of purpose. This seeks to adopt a stakeholder and more
communitarian view of the firm rather than just a stockholder one.

Another level of engagement with ethics is for HR professionals to utilise
appropriate frameworks that help to explain and analyse the nature of changes
taking place in the employment relationship and to use the frameworks ‘more
prescriptively’. In seeking ways of putting ethical principles into practice in HRM,
Winstanley et al (1996, p11) propose the use of employment charters, legal
regulation, innovation in good practice and challenging ‘the inevitability thesis’
on the demise of job security. They are unconvinced that the ‘ethical stewardship’
role of HR professionals in raising awareness of ethical issues is a viable one.
‘There is the risk that assuming ownership of the “ethical” issues and conscience
in the organisation might yet again serve to decrease their status.’ Drawing on
Connock and Johns (1995), they conclude that ethical leadership must come
from the top of organisations. It must ‘not be part of the ghetto of human
resource management’. In their view, growing interest in stakeholding, ethical
consumerism and international labour standards are some of the most significant
developments putting ethics and HRM on the political agenda.

hr strategy
A key feature of HRM mark 2, as indicated above, is its role in and contribution
to HR strategy formulation and implementation, which Tyson (1995, p3)
describes as the as the intentions of an organisation towards its employees. He
defines HR strategy as ‘a set of ideas, policies and practices which management
adopt in order to achieve a people-management objective’. Rather than consisting
of a detailed document, covering all areas of people management, HR strategy
is now conceived as an incremental process. It is aimed at influencing key
HR practices promoting improved performance and competitive advantage

Introducing HRM, organisations and management

at work, taking account of organisational politics and what is possible in the
circumstances. A main characteristic of an effective HR strategy, whatever form
it takes, is its integration with business strategy. There are a number of models of
HR strategy, which are fully examined in Chapter 5, but each is underpinned by
the idea that HR policies and practices need to support the goals of a business,
whatever sector it is in, if they are to be effective. HR strategies, in other words,
need to have ‘external fit’ with business strategies and be vertically integrated with
them (Fombrun et al 1984, Guest 1987, Schuler and Jackson 1987, Pfeffer 1998).
Vertical integration thus refers to the links between business strategy, the external
contexts and HR policies and practices.
In addition to ‘external fit’, it is also argued that there needs to be ‘internal fit’
between different aspects of HR strategy. This ‘horizontal integration’ of HR
means that HR strategy needs to achieve a high level of compatibility of its
various elements, not creating policy conflicts between them. One common
critique of HR specialists is that they fail to co-ordinate their HR policies and
practices to promote consistent and unambiguous messages from management
to employees. For example, an HR policy aimed at reducing headcount may be
contradictory to another promoting learning at work. Similarly, an incremental
pay system without an incentive element, say, may work against a recruitment
and selection policy that seeks to attract self-motivated people expecting personal
rewards for good performance. A number of studies show that clear benefits
accrue from organisations having an appropriate ‘mix’ of internally consistent HR
practices, integrated together and supporting rather than negating one another
(Huselid 1995, Wood 1995).
In the managerial literature on HR strategy, then, it is argued that the greater the
degree of vertical and horizontal integration within an organisation, the more
effective its HR strategy is likely to be. The nature and feasibility of the possible
links between business strategy and HR strategy, and the internal consistency of
HR strategy, are consistent themes in the strategy literature (Boxall and Purcell
2008).
There is a body of critical literature, however, that challenges these assumptions
and questions the links between HRM and its strategic integration with business
policy. Legge (1995, p116), for example, argues, first, that the ‘matching’ approach
is based upon a classical, rational approach to strategy that assumes a top-down,
unitary planning process which is simplistic and not congruent with reality. She
highlights the conceptual problems and ‘fuzziness’ permeating the major strategy
models used to match HR policies with business strategy. Second, this raises
doubts ‘about their operationalisation in empirical research and the consequent
validity of such studies’ findings’. She sees these matching models being mainly
employed at the normative level, rather than being empirically tested (Golden
and Ramanujam 1985). According to one study, an examination of the processes
of strategic and HRM change called into question whether managers actually
have a genuinely free choice in strategic stance anyway (Storey and Sisson 1993).
Third, Legge (1995, p124) questions whether the close matching of strategy and
HR policies is desirable anyway. She asks, for example, whether it is possible to

have corporate-wide, mutually reinforcing HR strategies, where an organisation
operates in highly diversified product markets and, if not, does it matter in
terms of organisational effectiveness? Lastly, she questions, in terms of internal
integration, whether developing an organisational culture supportive of a
particular business strategy stops employees adopting different behaviours in
response to changing market demands. In other words, there can be inflexibilities
resulting from too close a match between HR strategies and business strategies.

ac t i vi t y 1 . 3
Identify any three of the above developments in HR that affect your organisation, showing why
they are important within it. What sorts of problems arise from these HR developments and how
does your organisation address them?

t h e e xte rnal co nte xts of h rm
To summarise the debate so far, contemporary HRM provides a distinctive
approach to managing people at work. Although traditional personnel
management approaches remain in some organisations, what Torrington et al
(2008) describe as the ‘HRM theme’ is the dominant trend in people management
in firms and public organisations today. Contemporary HRM by this analysis
has a strategic focus, is integrated with line management and is individualistic
in its orientation. The work that senior HR professionals commonly undertake,
certainly within leading-edge organisations, is scanning their environments in
response to external change, working closely with senior managers as business
partners, and building HR capability at individual and organisational levels.
HR practitioners also work in complex, changing organisational contexts.
In order to address the HR issues arising from these circumstances, HR
professionals have to understand these contexts and try to manage them by
developing and implementing appropriate HR strategies and practices, in the
short, medium and long terms. In this section, what HR professionals ‘need
to know’ to perform effectively in responding to the major external contexts
impinging on organisations is briefly explored. The external contexts of HRM are
important because HR practices, in any country, are socially embedded in their
wider, institutional, external contexts. This means that organisations are affected
by external forces that require managers to adapt their internal organisational
structures and behaviours to deal with them (Berger and Luckman 1967). As
Pfeffer and Salancik (1978) argue, organisational activities and outcomes are
accounted for by the contexts in which the organisation is embedded. For
illustrative purposes, a summary of these external contexts, known by the
acronym STEEPLE, and some key drivers within them, is provided in Figure 1.4.
The internal contexts facing HR practitioners are considered in Chapter 2 and the
business and managerial contexts in Chapter 3.

strategy, insights and solutions
Drawing upon the HR Profession Map in the professional area of strategy and
solutions, a range of prescriptive, underpinning knowledge has been identified
that HR practitioners with the highest levels of professional competence ‘need to
know’ to perform effectively. A selection of these are summarised and described
below.
First, HR practitioners need an understanding of their own organisation’s
strategy, its performance goals and drivers, and the sector in which they
work. These cover the market factors impacting upon performance, including
demography, customers, competitors and globalisation. They need to know,
understand and speak the language of the business they work for and the ‘full
range of human resources levers’ driving organisational performance. Second,
HR practitioners need a broad understanding and technical capability of all 10
HR professional areas (summarised below), with in-depth knowledge in one or
two of them, including strategy, insights and solutions. Third, they need to know
or access relevant employment and discrimination law in both their local and
international jurisdictions. Fourth, they need to know the external and internal

influences, including political and economic ones, impacting on the directions,
shape and performance of their organisations and the HR levers that can be
applied within them. Fifth, HR practitioners need to be able to shape and lead
change programmes and know how to develop organisational strategies and
operating plans in response to these forces. Sixth, they need to know how to
determine organisational capability and resourcing levels to support the delivery
of HR strategy and plans. Finally, HR professionals at the highest levels of
professional competence need to know ‘what external human resources thought
leaders and benchmark companies are doing in a variety of areas’. They also need
to consider how these lessons ‘may apply to [their] own organisation’, which
necessitates developing ‘fit-for-purpose (though stretching) human resources
solutions and anticipation of need’ (CIPD 2009, p9).

the socio-cultural context
In the social sphere, population trends are a key driver. There are, however,
counter-cyclical shifts in population trends. On the one hand, there is rising
population growth in the UK and globally, although this is offset by falling birth
rates in west and east Europe generally. Higher immigration into the UK and
Europe results in increases in the size of the potential labour force, depending
on the ages of the migrant populations and their age distributions. It also affects
the supply and demand for goods and services in product markets and public
services. On the other hand, a generally ageing population, as is the case in
most of west and east Europe, results in not only losses of skills, knowledge and
competencies from the labour market but also increased demand for different
kinds of goods and services by both younger and older people. It places greater
demands on pension funds and social services for the elderly, as opposed to
fashionable consumer goods for younger people delivered by leading-edge,
hi-tech businesses. Another mega-social trend is increasing socio-economic
inequality, with rising affluence for wealthy people and elite groups. This is
accompanied by increased relative deprivation for others, rises in asset prices
(such as housing stock) and rises in private debt. All these social developments
have both strategic and HR implications for organisations in terms of demand for
labour, supply of labour and demand for products or services.
At the micro-social level, there are a number of distinctive social trends, all of
which impact on organisations, employees, the customers they serve and the
HR function. These developments include changing sources of social identity,
increased dependency on drugs and alcohol, rising divorce rates, and rising
numbers of single-parent households. One social consequence emerging out
of these trends is increased solo-living (or single-person households) amongst
all age groups. Other social trends include increased self-satisfaction and
personal narcissism, with reduced interest in social conformity as well as greater
preparedness to take personal responsibility for the self. Underpinning these
trends is increased individualism and reduced collectivism at home, at work
and in society. The impacts of these developments on working life are wide
ranging. These include rising demand for flexible working arrangements and
contractual flexibility, more individually oriented HR policies and practices, a

lower propensity to unionise and take organised industrial action, and more job
mobility within the workforce (Office for National Statistics 2009b).

the technological context
There have been ground-breaking technological innovations in society during
the past decades. These have implications for organisations, managers and
workers. The most obvious examples are the World-Wide Web, email, intranets,
Blackberries, video-conferencing and, in HRM particularly, the introduction of
HR databases, electronic payroll systems and electronic record systems, all linked
with innovatory ICTs. During the past 10 years or so, ever-newer forms of ICTs
have been launched, most of which have implications for how people construct
their identities and how they are managed at work. These include Google’s search
engine; Wikipedia, an online free encylopaedia; Twitter, claimed to be one stage
on from Google by applying human intelligence and recommendation to the
ordering of information; and, since 2007, the BBC iPlayer. Other technological
communication innovations include the iPhone, with its touch screen, rotating
screen and zooming screen; Craiglist, the classified advertising database now
operating in over 50 countries; and Facebook with over 300 million people
active on the website. Developments in medical and health technologies are
also extending life expectancies and how long people work and remain in the
labour market. Other important technological drivers include improvements
in biotechnology, hi-tech medicine and a remarkable range of complex
pharmaceutical products.
As Soete (2001) points out, a number of implications arise out of the applications
of these new technologies. First, there has been the dramatic reduction in the
costs of digital information and communication processing, which is not showing
any sign of decreasing returns and is unlikely to do so in the future. Second, there
has been the technologically driven ‘digital convergence’ between communication
and computer technology at all levels, which is rendering feasible any
combination of communication forms. Third, there has been the rapid growth
in international electronic networking, both terrestrial and through satellites.
Fourth, these developments affect communication between individuals, within
organisations, amongst organisations, and increasingly between individuals
and machines. They affect all aspects of society, including work, business and
the public sector. Fifth, these technologies render physical space and distance
irrelevant in many business, working and human transactions. This effectively
makes ICTs the first global, technological transformation process. They radically
affect how people work, what they do at work, and how people are managed
within organisations.

the economic context
In the economic sphere, a number of indicative trends are discernible. One
is market uncertainty arising out of recession and slow macro-growth in the
2010s. This, in turn, is likely to be offset eventually by an economic upturn and,
most probably, the continued globalisation of business activities. The economy

23

is also affected by government macro-economic policies, such as fiscal policy,
monetary policy and its own economic activities, as well as by international
economic forces. On the business front, for example, an increased role played
by international or multinational companies in national economies, and more
intense international competition for goods and services, contributes to falls
in demand in domestic markets and a rise in unemployment. These and other
economic forces impinge on demand for labour, the types of labour required by
firms and public organisations, and labour supply. They determine how people
are recruited, trained or retrained. On the other hand, with hyper-competitive
conditions in some markets, pressure is put on competing firms to retain labour,
reskill it or make it redundant. Firms have to adjust their HR policies and
practices accordingly.
In the wider labour market, there continues to be increased demand for higherskilled workers by UK employers and reduced demand for lower-skilled ones.
Certainly in the UK, there appears to be limited growth in skills levels. These
create recruitment, training and general HR issues for many organisations. At
micro-level, there are indications of greater willingness by some workers to switch
jobs and employers, resulting in higher labour turnover, increased transaction
costs for employers, and personal disruption for the individuals concerned
(Office for National Statistics 2009a). There are also significant changes in the
structure of the economy, the manufacturing and extractive sectors being much
less important than a generation ago, with increased activity in private and public
services today. This has implications for education and training policy generally
and for the employment prospects for existing and potential workers particularly,
such as graduates in higher education.
Within the European single market, people, goods, services and money move
around as freely as they do within one country. People travel across the European
Union’s (EU) internal frontiers for business and pleasure. Alternatively, they
stay at home and enjoy a vast array of products being imported from all over
Europe (and beyond). Some argue that the single market is one of the EU’s most
important political achievements. The single market is certainly at the core of
the EU today. Ever since the Single European Act, which established a single
market in 1992, the EU has swept away the vast array of technical, regulatory,
legal and bureaucratic barriers that formerly stifled free trade and free movement
of goods, services and people. In terms of the free movement of goods and
services, the single market relies largely on the regulatory authorities to guarantee
competition. In terms of the free movement of labour, one consequence is that
skilled professional workers can work anywhere in the EU, resulting in firms
having to adjust their recruitment and HR policies to this market situation. Thus
the UK’s economic prosperity, its job creation prospects, and the opportunity
for firms and their workforces to benefit from it, are intimately linked with
general levels of economic activity in mainland Europe. Indeed, according to the
European Commission (2009a), the single market has created several million jobs
since its launch and generated more than €800 billion in extra wealth during this
time.

Introducing HRM, organisations and management

the environmental context
To protect the ecological environment, there are a number of issues on the
business agenda. These include increased interest in sustainable development,
sustainable investment and sustainable consumption by producers, investors
and consumers respectively. For individuals wanting sustainable production and
investment, for example, this means avoiding not only activities likely to cause
illness, disease or death, or to destroy and damage the environment, but also
those organisations that treat people dishonestly or with disrespect. Second, for
firms, it means choosing methods of working and investing that focus primarily
on the effects of the company’s products or services on the environment, people
and communities. Another positive strategy is listing the environmental benefits
that producers would like to see their organisations promote. For workers, this
can mean good working conditions and for investors the need to articulate
what they would like to see their money support. Environmentally-sensitive
consumers, in turn, may seek to buy products (or services) which are produced
ethically, do not harm the environment and promote the well-being of people at
work. From an HR viewpoint, sustainable producers, investors and consumers
expect companies to act decently in their dealings with staff. This means acting
ethically in their relations with suppliers and local communities and managing
their businesses with all their organisational stakeholders.
One outcome of this growing interest in environmental issues has been the
emergence of ‘green HR policies’ by a number of environmentally conscious
businesses. These companies are noted as developing strategic environmental
management policies, especially in the United States. In one survey of 93 US
companies, it was reported that some companies were undertaking common
green HR initiatives, whether as part of a strategic business plan or a one-off
practice. These included 78 per cent which were using either the World-Wide
Web or teleconferencing to reduce travel, 76 per cent promoting reduction
of paper use, and 68 per cent implementing wellness programmes fostering
employees’ proper nutrition, fitness and healthy styles of living (Bucks 2009).
Clearly, this trend is likely to continue, given the shift to ‘green’ the economy
by some leading politicians and pressure groups. All these environmental
developments have implications for the HR function and the ways in which
people are managed at work.
Although green advocacy is limited, employees can have a key role in building
a business’s reputation for green HR, and contented workers can become ‘green’
advocates. A number of initiatives are possible. First, ‘green’ businesses can get
the support of their stakeholders in promoting a sustainable business model.
Second, a variable pay element can link pay to ‘eco-performance’, with the
concept of eco-performance being an extension of a common HR practice used
in environmentally friendly businesses. Third, employees can help customers
understand the importance of ‘green living’, by highlighting the green practices
of their own businesses. Fourth, rewards can be provided to employees who
follow green practices established within their firms. These include: recycling
office paper, turning off lights and appliances when staff are not in a room, and

convincing customers they should recycle their packaging. Employees, in short,
can be ambassadors for everything good about their company. An important one
is advocating sustainability just as naturally as promoting their business over the
competition.

the political context
In the political context and in a global age, political support for free market
economics and centre-right government remains generally strong amongst
the electorates of the UK, Europe and internationally. National, European
and international policy-makers follow this pathway. Within the UK, there is
continuing public support for increased government promotion of a competitionand-choice economic agenda. The main political institutions impacting on HR
in the UK are Parliament, devolved assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, and local authorities, including large bodies such as the Greater London
Assembly. In Europe, there are the political institutions of the EU (see Chapter
10).
Organisations in both the private and public sectors have to plan responses to
the political pressures emanating from these bodies, using appropriate strategies,
policies and practices if they are to prosper or at least survive. They do this by
drawing upon the support of organised pressure groups, political lobbying or
campaigning publicly. Another ongoing political development is privatisation
and marketisation. These are normally offset by increased state and European
regulation of private and public businesses on the grounds of accountability and
the public good. Both the corporate and public sectors have to address the legal
requirements arising out of regulation, such as employment legislation or health
and safety law as outlined below. Most importantly in the political sphere, there is
increasingly active government involvement in labour markets. This too provides
both opportunities and threats to organisations as employers. On the one hand,
they have to reward, train and develop existing staff to retain them. On the other,
they have to compete with one another for scarce skills and competencies in the
open labour market.

the legal context
The legal landscape of employment has expanded exponentially in the last 30
years and there is no sign that this trend will diminish. This is especially the case
in regulation of the individual employer–employee relationship, encapsulated in
the contract of employment, employment protection, discrimination legislation
and health and safety at work. In terms of the contract of employment, unfair
dismissal and redundancy laws are the major areas of legal intervention.
Discrimination law now ranges across sex, equal pay, ethnicity, disability, religion,
age and atypical employment. Health and safety incorporates working time
and related working issues. Legislation covering a statutory national minimum
wage, statutory sick pay, family friendly policy, human rights and transfer of
undertakings are all now recognised fields of employment law. HR departments
have to comply with these legal rules, monitor and evaluate them.

Introducing HRM, organisations and management

In terms of regulatory activity by the UK government, devolved assemblies in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and local authorities, there is no simple
explanation why such an extensive regulatory regime has emerged on a piecemeal
basis in the past 20 years. However, a number of factors appear to have influenced
the rise of the regulatory state. These include UK membership, first, of the
European Common Market and, latterly, of the EU, the decline of trade unionism
and collective bargaining, macro-economic policy promoting employment (or at
least not increasing unemployment), and political expediency (Taylor and Emir
2009). As Moran (2003, p7) concludes, the private character of the UK’s former
self-regulatory system has been transformed ‘to be replaced by tighter state
controls; and the institutions and cultures bequeathed to us by the Victorians
have either disappeared or are embattled.’ Many HR issues are intrinsically linked
with these developments.

the ethical context
Creating, exchanging and distributing wealth in market economies like that of the
UK is full of moral ambiguities. In the private sector, for example, businesses exist
primarily to make profits. To earn profits, businesses produce goods or services
and engage in the buying and selling of goods, services and other factor inputs.
If profit making is the first claim on business activities, supporters of stockholder
theory (ie that businesses exist primarily for those owning ‘stock’ or ‘shares’
within them) argue that there is no need for businesses to act ethically towards
their stakeholders, other than shareholders, because the prime responsibility
of business is to make money. Others argue, in contrast, that producers should
consider the effects of their actions on their wider stakeholders and take their
interests into consideration. Producing goods like tobacco and alcohol for
profit, for example, is explicitly unethical because of the dangers to the health
of people. Some also argue that it is unethical for top business executives to
receive excessive reward packages (the ‘fat cats’ syndrome), when their company’s
employees are on low wages, non-permanent contracts and are doing what many
would perceive as demanding, stressful, low-quality work. Those arguing for
social responsibility and ethical responses in business organisations, therefore, say
business is not exempt from ethical concerns but must recognise, respond to and
manage them appropriately (Mellahi and Wood 2003).
There is, however, no universal model of corporate ethics. Business ethics,
or ethical corporate practices, are both subjective and contingent upon
those pursuing or evaluating them. Corporate ethics raises questions about
how firms should deal with those business issues that have implications for
their stakeholders. But firms do not produce universalistic answers to these
questions. Chryssides and Kaler (1993, p3) claim that business ethics has two
aspects. ‘One involves the specific situations in which ethical controversy arises;
the other concerns the principles of behaviour by which it is appropriate to
abide.’ These include: ethics of employment, including pay, unions, workers’
rights, equal opportunities and non-discrimination; ethics of accounting,
finance, restructuring and investing; and ethics of information technology and
whistle-blowing.

Central to the study of corporate ethics is the assumption that ‘moral rules’
apply to business behaviour, just as they do to individual behaviour and that
certain actions are wrong or immoral and others are right or moral. Thus it is
generally agreed that employers expect their employees not to steal from them,
parties to a contract expect each other to honour it and suppliers expect the
businesses dealing with them to pay them promptly. The problem is that there is
no universal benchmark of morality. Different people resolve moral dilemmas in
business using different approaches and alternative frames of reference; this is the
case with HR issues too (Sternberg 2004).

This section addresses briefly the extent to which HRM is a universal model
of ‘good’ HR practice or whether it is culturally and country specific. A second
issue is trends in international HRM and whether there is convergence in HRM
internationally.

the origins and progress of hrm
As noted earlier in this chapter, the origins of HRM as a distinctive way of
managing people (HRM mark 2), which has a strategic focus, is integrated with
line management and is individualist in orientation, were laid in the United
States during the 1980s. By this time, the scientific management, human relations
and human capital schools of management theory about managing people had
been largely rejected by many management practitioners. Scientific management
had been based on effective job design and payment systems; human relations
on social and psychological insights promoting harmony in the workplace; and
human capital theory on investing in labour as an asset in firms, not viewing it
as a cost, to raise labour productivity (Schultz 1971). Interestingly, most of these
studies about managing people had also originated in the United States.
The next stage, debated first within the United States, was to move on from the
flawed studies of the so-called ‘in search of excellence’ literature (Tiernan et al
2001). The crucial issue was to find a framework through which organisations
could link their strategic goals with the people they employed, so as to promote
organisational effectiveness in conditions of market competitiveness and
technological innovation. In 1984, two seminal works on HRM were published.

Introducing HRM, organisations and management

One, promoting a ‘soft’ version of HRM, was developed at Harvard Business
School by Beer et al (1985). This model of HRM starts with analysing stakeholder
interests in the business and the business’s situational factors. As indicated
in Figure 1.5, the Harvard model provides a ‘map’ of the determinants of HR
policy choices and HR outcomes for developing employee commitment within
organisations. HR policy choices include employee influence and rewards.
HR outcomes include employee commitment, competence, congruence and
cost-effectiveness. Within the model, business strategy is developed in relation
to employee needs, with the long-term consequences of HRM being individual,
organisational and societal well-being.
The other important work at this time was the Michigan model of HRM
promoted by Fombrun et al (1984). This is a ‘hard’ version of HRM, emphasising
the importance of having a tight ‘fit’ between HR strategy and business strategy,
which defines and determines the types of employee performance required
by organisations. The aim of this model is to improve overall organisational
performance, with the underpinning goal of creating a strategically-based value
system promoting high employee performance. It is based on an ‘HR cycle’, as
illustrated in Figure 1.6. The focus of this cycle is employee performance. The
search for performance is reinforced by adopting HR selection processes that
appoint employees with appropriate aptitudes, knowledge and values. Effective
selection is supported, in turn, by an appraisal system enabling employee
performance to be reviewed regularly and a development system aiming to
improve performance shortcomings. Finally, the reward system is designed to
distinguish and compensate different levels of performance. The HRM cycle then
restarts through an iterative process.
As a result of these path-finding and subsequent studies, the concepts of
strategy and strategic HRM were, by the 2000s, firmly incorporated in both the
literature and practice of HRM. This was despite problems regarding the nature,
significance, consequences and possible applications of the concepts involved.

However, a major debate in the field remains: is the North American HRM
paradigm resulting in a convergence of HRM practices universally? Basically,
convergence theory or the convergence thesis has a long history (Kerr et al 1960).
It argues that factors specific to organisations explain HR strategies and policies,
with country-specific factors being less important. Thus the US convergence
thesis posits that HRM practices are converging internationally as a result of
globally driven market and technological forces which affect all firms. Because
these forces are universally self-evident, the HR practices associated with them
will be transferred around the world (Locke et al 1995). In short, the ‘market
forces model’ of convergence posits that market forces generate convergence in
HRM within firms towards a US model of HR (Gooderman and Brewster 2003).
The divergence thesis, in contrast, argues that HR systems are determined by
national, institutional contexts, not by market and technological forces. This is
because national institutions are unique and do not respond readily to market
and technological imperatives. Indeed, it is argued, institutional contexts are
slow to change, because they derive out of deep-rooted value systems and beliefs.
Moreover, change is path dependent and can only be understood in relation
to the specific social contexts within which it takes place (Maurice et al 1986).
Supporters of the divergence thesis argue, because of its North American origins,
that HRM is a culturally specific model, largely relevant to Anglo-Saxon business
cultures only. The basic assumptions underpinning the Anglo-Saxon approach to
HRM are identified with, first, a strong tradition of ‘free enterprise’ and the ‘right
to manage’. This means that government intervention in business is expected
to be either residual or supportive of it, and that firms are largely autonomous
bodies within the market system. Second, the preferred pattern of employment

relationships within Anglo-Saxon HRM is individually rather than collectively
based; they are not generally subject to trade unionism and collective bargaining.
Third, businesses exist primarily to enhance narrow ‘shareholder’ value, not
broader ‘stakeholder’ interests. The divergence model, in short, suggests that
deep-seated differences exist among countries, resulting in continuing divergence
in HRM and no convergence in HRM amongst firms.

european and international hrm
Other writers suggest that HRM in places like mainland Europe is essentially
different from Anglo-Saxon HRM for a number of cultural, legal and institutional
reasons. First, the culture of mainland Europe is far less individualistic than
that of North America, the UK and many Commonwealth countries. Above
all, the United States is an exceptional case and atypical of the rest of the world
(Trompenaars 1985). Second, legislation in Europe protecting individual
employment rights, promoting collective employee communication and
information channels such as works councils, and providing extensive social
security provisions is far more extensive than that found in the United States and
elsewhere. Third, the ‘Rhineland’ model of business enterprise, despite recent
reforms within it, contrasts with Anglo-Saxon capitalism by its promotion of the
‘stakeholder economy’. Thus whereas the Anglo-Saxon model of ‘shareholder’
capitalism is characterised by the drive for short-term returns for investors, the
Rhineland model is a regulated market economy based on political consensus
and comprehensive systems of social security. Fourth, trade union rights are
normally incorporated in the Rhineland model but not so strongly within AngloSaxon states. Fifth, public ownership is more widespread in mainland European
countries than in the United States, whilst in countries like Germany interlocking
shareholdings and close management of companies result in less pressure for
short-term profits and fewer incentives to drive competitors out of markets
(Randlesome 1993).
This analysis gives rise to a corresponding convergence thesis in the European
literature, just as in the Anglo-American literature. This is called the ‘institutional
model of convergence’, which suggests that institutional forces generate
convergence in HRM amongst European firms towards a common European
model of HR. As in the case of the United States, European management and
European HRM are claimed to be specific in their nature and common in their
culture. This is highlighted by Thurley and Wirdenius (1989), who claim that
European management has three main characteristics. First, it is broadly linked to
the idea of European integration. Second, it reflects key values such as pluralism
and tolerance, although it is not consciously developed out of these values. Third,
it is associated with a balanced stakeholder approach and the concept of ‘Social
Partners’ in business.
Katz and Kahn (1978) argue, in turn, that cross-national analyses need to take
account of the wider societal variables determining how organisations operate
within their external contexts. The national institutional arrangements most
affecting national business systems include their employment relations systems,

political institutions, the legal framework of corporate governance, education and
training systems, the legal system, and product, labour and capital markets. Thus,
scope for corporate decision-making on employment issues in countries such as
Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain is relatively low, because
of the comprehensive labour market legislation in these countries. In the UK,
Ireland and the Nordic countries, on the other hand, the state traditionally plays
a more limited role in this area, so scope for independent corporate decisionmaking is greater. In terms of HR practices, the societal contexts of European
(and other) countries are likely to explain differences in the extents to which
multinational corporations are able to pursue distinctive HR policies within
them.
A study by Brewster et al (2004, p434) of 23 European countries in the 1990s
examined these issues of convergence and divergence, drawing on a largescale empirical dataset. Figure 1.7 summarises this study’s findings in terms of
‘directional convergence’ of HR practices amongst countries. This shows that there
was strong evidence of directional convergence in four HR areas, considerable
evidence in one area and weak evidence in two areas. The authors conclude
that: ‘From a directional convergence point of view, there seems to be a positive
indication of convergence.’ In terms of ‘final convergence’ of HR practices (ie
whether countries are moving towards a common endpoint), however, the answer
was not so conclusive. None of the HR practices converged ‘at the end of the
decade’. There were therefore some signs of HR convergence amongst European
countries in the direction of trends. But there were very substantial differences,
even continuing divergence, in final convergence. Differences amongst countries,
in other words, appeared to be increasing. What this research appears to
demonstrate is that whilst some directional convergence in European HRM is
apparent, ‘there is no unequivocal trend towards final convergence.’

Introducing HRM, organisations and management

multinational corporations
A multinational corporation (MNC) is a business organisation with headquarters
in one country and operations in a range of others. There are numerous examples
of US, UK, European and Asia-Pacific MNCs. These firms, by their very nature,
are large organisations and their size means that they often have considerable
power and influence globally and locally. The reasons why MNCs expand into
different countries vary: reducing transport and distribution costs, avoiding
trade barriers, securing supplies of raw materials or markets, and gaining cost
advantages such as low labour costs. MNCs also bring benefits to host countries
in terms of economic growth and employment opportunities, improvements in
production techniques and the quality of human capital, availability of quality
goods and services locally, government tax revenues, and improvements in
local infrastructures. MNCs also have distinctive HR policies and practices in
managing their multinational workforces.
An important characteristic of MNCs and their HR practices is the notion of
‘embeddedness’. This suggests, despite the process of globalisation, that economic
activity is firmly embedded in distinct national or regional settings or national
business systems. The persistence of different national business systems means
the contexts in which firms manage their workforces differ markedly. How
MNCs manage their workforces across national borders is related to the national
business systems of their countries of origin. The evidence relating to MNCs in
the United States, for example, indicates that there is a strong ‘country of origin’
effect in areas such as performance management, diversity and employment
relations. However, as MNCs spread geographically, the embeddedness of their
original business system declines. Another characteristic of MNCs is that they
have scope to tap into the HR practices of their countries of operation, besides
their original one. Through the process of ‘reverse diffusion’ MNCs are able to
draw upon HR practices in their foreign subsidiaries and spread these around
their international operations subsequently. Since MNCs are embedded in
distinct national business contexts, HR practices that are transferred across
countries are amended when they are implemented in their new settings.
It is also argued that evidence of convergence across countries is most evident
in relation to MNCs and that globalisation is driving a process of convergence
of HR practices within them. Ferner and Quintanilla (1998) claim that the
internationalisation of French, German and Swiss firms has coincided with
them adopting many HR practices common amongst US and UK companies.
These include devolved business units and performance-related pay. But other
evidence indicates that marked differences amongst MNCs remain. For example,
employment regulations differ between countries and there continues to be
centralised collective bargaining in some countries but not in others. Thus what
is considered normal or accepted practice in HRM continues to vary across
national boundaries. One explanation is that while globalisation causes changes
in national models of HRM and at firm level, ‘these changes are not all occurring
at the same pace, nor are they all in the same direction.’ Another observation is
that pressures of globalisation are not felt evenly across sectors within countries.

So there probably is ‘no neat process of convergence’. HRM comes in different
national styles but none of these ‘is free from pressures to change’ (Edwards and
Rees 2006, p293).

con clusio n: hrm , hr strat egy an d h r solu t ion s
From the evidence provided in this chapter, to be effective in the business world
today HR professionals need to understand the external contexts (STEEPLE)
in which their organisation operates and the levers driving change within it.
Appropriate and relevant HR strategies, operational HR activities and HR
solutions are important factors in meeting organisational needs to promote
competitive advantage in the marketplace. The underpinning argument is
that people make a difference to organisational performance. Recruiting,
selecting, deploying, rewarding, appraising and developing the ‘right’ people
in organisations are necessary conditions for organisational effectiveness,
efficiency and business success. Having the ‘wrong’ people lacking the knowledge,
skills, attitudes, and customer-focus to match organisational expectations and
requirements is seen to be antithetical to these objectives.
Current good practice indicates that the HR function is critical to formulating
and delivering these business and HR objectives and promoting appropriate
HR activities. To achieve this purpose, HR specialists have to understand
the business they work in, its markets and the forces driving it in the sector
where the business operates. They also need to understand their organisation’s
business strategy, its performance goals and drivers. More specifically, HR
practitioners have to draw on insights to lead and influence decisions at strategic,
tactical, team, and individual levels across the organisation. They feed these
insights and observations to senior managers to influence strategy, as well as
developing prioritised HR plans aiming to deliver the needs of the organisation
in line with its overall HR strategy. Other roles for HR include: partnering line
managers to address sensitive HR issues; advising and coaching managers on the
implementation and delivery of HR plans; and, where change is on the agenda,
developing project plans to support the implementation of change initiatives, for
example during restructuring and mergers.
In carrying out their roles, HR practitioners have to understand the market
factors impacting on performance, customers, competitors, globalisation,
population change and other factors. Most importantly, in today’s competitive
business climate, they are expected to speak the ‘language of their business’
and be able to draw upon the range of HR toolkits available that influence
organisational performance.
To be effective, the HR function has to build relationships with internal and
external specialists, taking account of current good practice and emerging
HR trends, as well as understanding the external HR market. HR is expected
to oversee compliance with regulation and corporate policy and to ensure
that the organisation has the right people in sufficient numbers, in the right

places, with the right experience and capabilities, to deliver the goals of the
organisation. HR specialists also need to understand relevant HR technical
skills, with in-depth knowledge of some of them. In the HR Profession
Map, these are leading and managing the HR function, organisation design,
organisation development, resourcing and talent management, learning and
talent development, performance and reward, employee engagement, employee
relations, and information and service delivery. To support these activities, HR
specialists have to access internal and external experts. Finally, HR professionals
need to understand the external and internal influences affecting their business or
organisation, including political influences impacting on the direction and shape
of the organisation and its performance.

In summary, taking account of its contextual circumstances, and to promote
appropriate HR solutions, the HR function has to develop critical awareness of
what is possible in terms of HR strategy and practices. It also has to recognise
what is likely to be acceptable to managers and employees and how strategy and
practice can be implemented and reviewed to promote organisational advantage.
It does this in the light of the contextual constraints facing it.

1. Historically, HRM has been infinitely flexible in adjusting to the dominant
macro-economic, political and other contexts within which it has operated;
HRM is historically path dependent. Contemporary HRM has emerged out of
the drive for competitive advantage and the search for improved performance
by organisations, whether in the private, public or third sectors, and changes
in the external contexts. The latest, dominant ‘trend’ in HRM represents a
distinctive approach to managing people at work, with a strategic focus,
integrated with line management and individualistic in its orientation to
the managing of people. However, HRM remains a ‘contested terrain’ both
practically and theoretically.
2. The external contexts of HRM continually change and the HR function has
to respond constantly to them by developing, implementing and evaluating
appropriate HR strategies, policies and practices. The strategy, insights
and solutions professional area of the CIPD HR Profession Map identifies
the substantive knowledge and behaviours required by HR professionals in
order to be effective in relation to the internal and external contexts of their
organisations.
3. STEEPLE is a useful analytical tool enabling HR professionals and senior
managers to identify and respond to the changing external contexts acting
on organisations. It covers the current and longer-term socio-cultural,
technological, economic, ethical, political, legal and environmental
developments affecting HR strategy and practices.
4. Major developments in the structure of the HR function are the creation of
‘shared services’, the ‘business partner’ role, ‘centres of expertise’, the ‘vendor
management’ role and ‘corporate HR’. Within the new HR paradigm, some HR
activities are devolved to line managers. In learning and development, the
focus is increasingly on ‘learning’ rather than on training.

5. With divisionalisation, devolved budgeting, internal markets and increased
competition in product and service markets, the search for improved
performance is a driving force in most organisations. Linking individual and
group performance to the goals and objectives of organisations has been a
critical element in the performance management cycle. This involves setting
individual targets, finding ways of measuring them, appraising them, reviewing
performance, rewarding performance, identifying training needs and setting
new targets.
6. Delegation of HR activities to line managers results in them taking on an
important role in implementing HR strategies and HR practices. To be effective
in this role, line managers need to work with HR professionals and gain their
support in managing their staff. Despite the difficulties of this, research
shows that line managers play a critical role in motivating staff, promoting job
satisfaction and improving performance.
7. Outsourcing of HR activities is another feature of contemporary HRM. It is used
to save costs for organisations, draw on external professional expertise, and
seek independent HR advice not available in the host organisation. Outsourcing
takes various forms. HR activities typically outsourced include payroll
administration, recruitment and selection, training and development, executive
search, and outplacement and redundancy counselling.
8. Most HR decisions pose ethical questions, since they deal with people
issues covering recruitment and selection, managing performance, equal
opportunities, learning and development, employee relations, rewards and
termination of employment. Also, demands for ethical investment and ethical
consumption put further pressure on HR to ensure ethical decision-making
in organisations. With the demise of traditional personnel management,
and its ‘mediatory’ and ‘welfare’ roles between employer and employee, HR
practitioners have to be aware of the ethical issues arising from employing
people, rewarding them, appraising them, and managing them fairly and
consistently.
9. To promote effective HR strategy, the emphasis is on integration. Vertical
integration (or ‘external fit’) refers to the links between business strategy, the
external contexts and HR policies and practices. Horizontal integration (or
‘internal fit’) refers to HR strategy with a high degree of compatibility amongst
its various elements.
10. Internationally, a main debate has been the extent to which the Anglo-Saxon,
‘new’ HRM paradigm is a universal model of practice. On balance, the evidence
suggests that HR practices tend to be country-specific, because of powerful
institutional and historical path-dependent factors, with HRM diverging
among countries rather than generally converging – although some directional
convergence is noted in Europe. MNCs exhibit some convergence in HR
practices among countries but they also import HR practices from their host
countries into local businesses and adapt them.

Background
In a current analysis of age discrimination
in 30 European states, it is reported that
public opinion has shifted dramatically
since an earlier survey only a year ago.
The majority of Europeans now perceive
discrimination on grounds of age to be
widespread, with opinions about the extent
of age discrimination having turned around
radically in the course of a single year. Last
year, an outright majority of Europeans
perceived discrimination on this ground to
be rare (52 per cent). This year the balance
has shifted, with 58 per cent now perceiving
it to be widespread, compared with 37 per
cent who believe it is rare. Two per cent
think that discrimination on grounds of age
is non-existent in their country and a further
3 per cent say they ‘don’t know’.
When respondents were asked to estimate
the extent of age discrimination, they were
not asked to differentiate whether it is
on the grounds of old age or youth. Thus
respondents would have had different ideas
in mind when thinking about this question.

CD23526.indb 36

Regardless of the above distinction, the
majority view in all but six countries is that
age discrimination is widespread. In fact,
in 22 of the 30 countries surveyed, this
opinion is held by an absolute majority.
Hungarian respondents top the list, with 79
per cent saying that age discrimination is
widespread in their country. This is followed
by respondents in the Czech Republic (74
per cent), France (68 per cent), Latvia (67
per cent) and the Netherlands (66 per cent).
Older respondents are more likely to say
age discrimination is widespread, although
it is uncertain whether respondents
associate ‘age discrimination’ with a specific
age group. But on the basis of this survey,
respondents aged 40 or over are more likely
to say that discrimination on ground of age
is widespread. This is in direct contrast to
other grounds of discrimination, which are
more likely to seen as widespread by the
youngest groups of respondents. Women
(60 per cent) are more likely to see age
discrimination as being widespread than are
men (55 per cent).

Human resource management and its external contexts

Changes in perceptions of discrimination
on grounds of age
Perception that age discrimination is
widespread has increased throughout
Europe. Since last year, the perception
that age discrimination is widespread
has increased from 42 per cent to 58 per
cent (+16 points). This trend is noted in all
countries surveyed, with the exception of
Portugal, where only a minor increase was
recorded (+2 points). Further, apart from
Italy (+8 points), these shifts are above 10
percentage points in all other countries
surveyed. The largest increases were
recorded in Cyprus (+27 points), Romania
(+25 points), France and the Netherlands
(both +22 points).
The economic crisis seems to lie at the core
of this shift in opinion: one of the perceived
consequences of the crisis is that the jobs
of older Europeans are less secure.
In 14 of the 30 countries surveyed, the
majority view is that age discrimination
is now less widespread. This view is
particularly strong in Cyprus (77 per cent)
and is next highest in Denmark (64 per
cent) and Malta (62 per cent). Conversely,
there are also three countries where at least
six out of 10 respondents feel the contrary:
73 per cent of Hungarians, 65 per cent of
Czech and 60 per cent of Slovaks think age
discrimination is more widespread.
Experience of age discrimination
Age is the ground for discrimination
that is most frequently experienced by
respondents. Whilst public perceptions
of age discrimination have shifted in
the course of the year, the proportion of
respondents reporting that they have been
discriminated against has not changed.
However, at 6 per cent, ‘age’ continues
to represent the most common ground
of self-reported discrimination. Unlike
discrimination on ground of ethnicity, there

CD23526.indb 37

37

is no significant gap between experienced
and witnessed discrimination on grounds
of age, with 8 per cent of respondents
reporting that they had witnessed this
form of discrimination. This comparatively
high figure may well be due to the fact
that age is a shared attribute relevant
to everyone, and young and old may be
susceptible to suffer discrimination under
various (often differing) circumstances. Age
discrimination is ‘most’ prominent in the
Czech Republic, with 11 per cent saying they
have experienced it and 17 per cent saying
that they have witnessed it. Other countries
showing higher than average levels of
reported discrimination, for both measures,
are Sweden and Slovakia.
Tasks
1. Why has perceived age discrimination
increased in Europe during the last year?
2. What factors account for differences
in perceived and experienced age
discrimination amongst European states?
3. The director of HR (Europe) in the MNC
where you work is both surprised and
concerned about this contextual issue
and its possible impact on the company.
As a senior HR executive in your
company, you have been asked by the
director of HR to:
a. Identify the possible ethical issues
facing the company arising from the
report summarised above.
b. Draft a policy paper indicating how
to respond to any potential age
discrimination within the company in
the UK division.
c. Outline any learning and development
issues arising from the above report
to suggest how the company might
implement a learning and development
plan addressing age discrimination.
