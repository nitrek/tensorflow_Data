Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
April 21, 2016

In the Matter of
CelLynx Group, Inc.,
Dot VN, Inc., and
Global Health Voyager, Inc.,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of CelLynx Group, Inc. (CIK
No. 1067286), a defaulted Nevada corporation with its principal place of business listed
as Miami, Florida with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink Sheets”) operated
by OTC Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the ticker symbol CYNX, because it
has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended March 31, 2013. On August 19,
2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to CelLynx
Group, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, but CelLynx
Group, Inc. did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid
address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of
Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Dot VN, Inc. (CIK No.
1412130), a delinquent Delaware corporation with its principal place of business listed as
San Diego, California with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol DTVI,
because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended January 31, 2012. On
November 7, 2013, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance
to Dot VN, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and Dot VN,
Inc. received the delinquency letter in November 2013, but failed to cure its
delinquencies.
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Global Health Voyager, Inc.
(CIK No. 318622), a void Delaware corporation with its principal place of business listed
as Los Angeles, California with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol
GLHV, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended June 30, 2013.
On August 19, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation
Finance to Global Health Voyager, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing
obligations, and Global Health Voyager, Inc. received the delinquency letter on August
24, 2015, but failed to cure its delinquencies.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed companies.

2

Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed companies is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on April 21, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 4, 2016.
By the Commission.

Secretary
