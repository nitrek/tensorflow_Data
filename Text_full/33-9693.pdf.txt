CHANGES TO EXCHANGE ACT REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS TO
IMPLEMENT TITLE V AND TITLE VI OF THE JOBS ACT
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: We are proposing amendments to our rules to implement Title V and Title
VI of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). The proposed
amendments would revise rules adopted under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) to reflect the new, higher thresholds for registration,
termination of registration and suspension of reporting that were set forth in the JOBS
Act. The proposed rules also would apply the thresholds specified for banks and bank
holding companies to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the proposed
amendments would revise the definition of “held of record” in Exchange Act Rule 12g51, in accordance with the JOBS Act, to exclude certain securities held by persons who
received them pursuant to employee compensation plans and establish a non-exclusive
safe harbor for determining whether securities are “held of record” for purposes of
registration under Exchange Act Section 12(g).
DATES: Comments should be received on or before March 2, 2015.

STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND TEXT OF PROPOSED RULE
AMENDMENTS

I.

INTRODUCTION
Prior to the enactment of the JOBS Act, 11 Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act 12

required an issuer to register a class of its equity securities if, at the end of the issuer’s
fiscal year, the securities were “held of record” by 500 or more persons and the issuer had
total assets exceeding $1 million.13 Under Section 12(g) and the Commission’s rules
prior to the JOBS Act amendments, an issuer that had a class of equity securities
registered under Section 12(g) was able to terminate that registration if the number of
record holders of that class fell below 300, or the number of record holders of that class

11

Pub. L. No. 112-106, 126 Stat. 325 (Apr. 5, 2012).

12

15 U.S.C. 78l(g). Congress enacted Section 12(g) in 1964 following the release of a study of the
securities markets conducted by the staff of the Commission in the early 1960s, which was
commissioned by Congress to serve as a basis for legislation. Report of Special Study of
Securities Markets of the Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R. Doc. No. 88-95 (1963).
Section 12(g) was enacted to “improve investor protection by extending to the larger companies in
the over-the-counter market the registration, reporting, proxy solicitation, and insider trading
requirements … applicable to companies listed on an exchange.” Report of the Committee on
Banking and Currency to Accompany, S.1642, S. Rep. No. 88-379 (1963) at 1.

13

See 15 U.S.C. 78l(g)(1). The Commission has the authority, under Section 12(h), to raise the asset
threshold for Section 12(g) registration. 15 U.S.C. 78l(h). The Commission raised the asset
threshold for Section 12(g) registration from $1 million to $3 million in 1982, $5 million in 1986
and $10 million in 1996. See System of Classification for Purposes of Exempting Smaller Issuers
From Certain Reporting and Other Requirements, Release No. 34-18647 (Apr. 15, 1982) [47 FR
17046 (Apr. 21, 1982)], Reporting by Small Issuers, Release No. 34-23406 (Jul. 8, 1986) [51 FR
25360 (Jul. 14, 1986)], and Relief From Reporting by Small Issuers, Release No. 34-37157 (May
1, 1996) [61 FR 21353 (May 9, 1996)]. For the thresholds applicable to foreign private issuers,
see infra note 84 and the discussion in the following text.

fell below 500 and the issuer’s assets were no more than $10 million at the end of each of
its last three fiscal years. 14
Exchange Act Section 15(d) 15 requires an issuer with an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act to file the same reports as an issuer with a registered
class of securities under Exchange Act Section 12. Prior to the enactment of the JOBS
Act, an issuer’s reporting obligation was automatically suspended under Section 15(d)(1)
if, on the first day of any fiscal year other than the year in which the registration
statement became effective, there were fewer than 300 holders of record of the class of
securities offered under the registration statement.
The JOBS Act amended Sections 12(g) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act to adjust
the thresholds for registration, termination of registration and suspension of reporting. 16
Specifically, Section 501 of the JOBS Act 17 amended Section 12(g)(1) of the Exchange
Act to require an issuer to register a class of equity securities (other than exempted
securities) within 120 days after its fiscal year end if, on the last day of its fiscal year, the
issuer has total assets of more than $10 million and the class of equity securities is “held
of record” by either (i) 2,000 persons, or (ii) 500 persons who are not accredited
investors. Section 601 of the JOBS Act 18 further amended Exchange Act Section
12(g)(1) to require an issuer that is a bank or a bank holding company, as defined in
14

See 15 U.S.C. 78l(g)(4) and 17 CFR 240.12g-4(a).

15

15 U.S.C. 78o(d).

16

The changes to Exchange Act Sections 12(g)(1), 12(g)(4) and 15(d)(1) were effective upon
enactment of the JOBS Act and do not require any Commission action. We are proposing
amendments to our rules to reflect the new, higher thresholds provided by the JOBS Act in our
rules and to implement the required safe harbor for securities received pursuant to employee
compensation plans.

Section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 19 to register a class of equity
securities (other than exempted securities) within 120 days after the last day of its first
fiscal year ended after the effective date of the JOBS Act if, on the last day of its fiscal
year, the issuer has total assets of more than $10 million and the class of equity securities
is “held of record” by 2,000 or more persons. Section 601 of the JOBS Act also amended
Exchange Act Section 12(g)(4) and Exchange Act Section 15(d)(1) 20 to enable an issuer
that is a bank or a bank holding company to terminate the registration of a class of
securities under Section 12(g) or suspend reporting under Section 15(d)(1) if that class is
held of record by less than 1,200 persons. For other issuers, the threshold in Section
12(g)(4) for termination of registration and in Section 15(d)(1) for suspension of
reporting remains at 300.
Section 502 of the JOBS Act 21 amended Exchange Act Section 12(g)(5) 22 to
exclude from the definition of “held of record,” for the purposes of determining whether
an issuer is required to register a class of equity securities, securities that are held by
persons who received them pursuant to an “employee compensation plan” in transactions
exempted from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act. 23 Section
503 of the JOBS Act 24 instructed the Commission to revise the definition of “held of
record” pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g)(5) to implement the amendment made
by Section 502 of the JOBS Act, and to create a safe harbor for issuers when determining

whether holders received their securities pursuant to an “employee compensation plan” in
a transaction exempted from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities
Act.
We believe that the increased registration threshold established by the JOBS Act
is intended to permit issuers to defer Exchange Act registration until issuers have a larger
shareholder base. In connection with the amendments made by Title V and Title VI of
the JOBS Act, we are proposing to amend our rules to reflect the new, higher registration,
termination of registration and suspension of reporting thresholds under revised
Exchange Act Sections 12(g)(1), 12(g)(4) and 15(d)(1). We also are proposing to permit
savings and loan holding companies to register, terminate registration and suspend
reporting using the same thresholds that apply to banks and bank holding companies.
Finally, we are proposing to amend Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1 to reflect the amendment
to Exchange Act Section 12(g)(5) and establish a non-exclusive safe harbor that issuers
may follow when determining if securities held by persons who received them pursuant
to an employee compensation plan in transactions exempted from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act may be excluded when calculating the
number of the issuer’s holders of record when determining whether they are required to
register under Exchange Act Section 12(g)(1).
After enactment of the JOBS Act, we sought comment from the public prior to the
issuance of a proposing release. We have considered the pre-proposal comment letters
received to date on Title V and Title VI of the JOBS Act, and we are requesting comment
on various issues relating specifically to the proposed amendments. 25 In this release, we
25

To facilitate public input on JOBS Act rulemaking before the issuance of rule proposals, the
Commission invited members of the public to make their views known on various JOBS Act

7

are proposing rule amendments to implement and address issues specifically related to
Title V and Title VI of the JOBS Act. We recognize that commenters have urged us to
consider and propose additional amendments. For example, several commenters have
recommended that the Commission make rule revisions related to the use of the term
“accredited investor” or permitting other issuers to register, terminate registration and
suspend reporting using the same thresholds that apply to banks and bank holding
companies. 26 We have considered the suggestions made by these commenters, but at this
time we are not proposing amendments that extend substantially beyond reflecting the
new statutory requirements.
II.

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS RELATING TO EXCHANGE ACT
REPORTING THRESHOLDS
A.

Application of the Increased Thresholds for Registration and
Reporting Obligations

As a result of the JOBS Act changes to Exchange Act Sections 12(g)(1), 12(g)(4)
and 15(d), we are proposing changes to Exchange Act Rules 12g-1, 12g-2, 12g-3, 12g-4
and 12h-3, which are the rules that govern the mechanics relating to registration,
termination of registration under Section 12(g) and suspension of reporting obligations
under Section 15(d). These rules currently reflect the prior holder of record statutory

initiatives in advance of any rulemaking by submitting comment letters to the Commission’s
website at http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/jobsactcomments.shtml. Comment letters received to date
on Title V of the JOBS Act are available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobs-title-v/jobs-titlev.shtml and on Title VI of the JOBS Act at http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobs-title-vi/jobs-titlevi.shtml.
26

See Section II.C. relating to the term “accredited investor.” See also letters from Wilmer Hale
(June 25, 2012), and Ledgewood, P.C. (Sept. 12, 2012) on behalf of their respective clients, a real
estate investment trust and a real estate limited partnership, requesting that the Commission use its
exemptive authority to revise the holder of record threshold to treat non-bank issuers similarly to
banks and bank holding companies.

8

thresholds in Sections 12(g) and 15(d). We are proposing to amend these rules to reflect
the new thresholds set forth in the JOBS Act.
Exchange Act Rule 12g-1 currently provides that an issuer shall be exempt from
the registration requirements if, on the last day of its most recent fiscal year, it had total
assets not exceeding $10 million. JOBS Act Section 501 amended Section 12(g)(1) to
expressly include the $10 million asset threshold. We are proposing to revise Rule 12g-1
to reflect the asset and holder of record thresholds established by Titles V and VI of the
JOBS Act relating to the requirement to register a class of equity securities under the
Exchange Act. The revision would additionally remove an outdated reference currently
contained in the rule. 27
As noted above, Section 601 of the JOBS Act amended Exchange Act Section
12(g)(4) to raise the threshold at which an issuer that is a bank or a bank holding
company may terminate registration of a class of equity securities from 300 to 1,200
holders of record. Section 601 similarly amended Exchange Act Section 15(d)(1) by
providing for an automatic suspension of the duty to file reports for a bank or bank
holding company with respect to a class of equity security that is held of record by less
than 1,200 persons at the beginning of its fiscal year, provided that the bank or bank
holding company did not have a Securities Act registration statement that became
effective during that year.
27

Under Exchange Act Rule 12g-1, foreign private issuers may not rely on the exemption from
registration provided in that rule if their securities are quoted on an automated inter-dealer
quotation system. The NASDAQ Stock Market was the only automated inter-dealer quotation
system in existence when this provision was adopted and has subsequently registered as a
securities exchange with the Commission. See In the Matter of the Application of the Nasdaq
Stock Market LLC for Registration as a National Securities Exchange; Findings, Opinion and
Order of the Commission, Release No. 34-53128 (Jan. 13, 2006) [71 FR 3550 (Jan. 23, 2006)].
As a result, the reference to an automated inter-dealer quotation system is no longer necessary and
we are proposing to remove it.

9

As currently in effect, Exchange Act Rules 12g-2 and 12g-3 reflect the holders of
record thresholds in the Exchange Act for terminating registration and suspending
reporting that existed prior to the JOBS Act amendments and not the new thresholds for
banks and bank holding companies. Specifically,
•

Rule 12g-2 addresses securities deemed to be registered pursuant to Section
12(g)(1) upon termination of the exemption pursuant to Section 12(g)(2)(A) or
(B) 28 and establishes a 300-person threshold for such a class of securities to be
registered under Section 12(g).

•

Rule 12g-3 addresses the 300-person threshold for the registration of
securities of successor issuers under Section 12(b) or Section 12(g).

In addition, although the statutory provisions of Exchange Act Section 12(g) and
15(d) do not suspend reporting obligations immediately when an issuer reaches the
designated threshold, Exchange Act Rules 12g-4 and 12h-3 permit issuers to immediately
suspend their duty to file periodic and current reports. These rules, however, reflect the
thresholds in Sections 12(g) and 15(d) prior to the JOBS Act amendments and not the
new threshold for banks and bank holding companies. Specifically,
•

Rule 12g-4(a) provides that termination of registration under Section 12(g)
shall take effect in 90 days, or such shorter period as the Commission
determines, after the issuer certifies on Form 15 29 that the class of securities is
held by less than 300 persons, or 500 persons where the total assets of the

28

Section 12(g)(2)(A) [15 U.S.C. 78l(g)(2)(A)] provides an exemption from Section 12(g)
registration while the class of securities is listed and registered on a national securities exchange
under Exchange Act Section 12(b) [15 U.S.C. 78l(b)]. Section 12(g)(2)(B) [15 U.S.C.
78l(g)(2)(B)] provides an exemption for securities issued by registered investment companies.

29

17 CFR 249.323.

10

issuer have not exceeded $10 million on the last day of each of the preceding
three years.
•

Rule 12g-4(b) provides that the duty to file current and periodic reports under
Exchange Act Section 13(a) 30 for that class of securities is suspended
immediately upon the filing of a certification on Form 15 provided that the
issuer has less than 300 holders of record, or 500 holders of record where the
issuer’s total assets have not exceeded $10 million on the last day of each of
the preceding three years.

•

Rule 12h-3 provides that the duty to file current and periodic reports under
Section 13(a) pursuant to Section 15(d) for that class of securities is
suspended immediately upon the filing of a certification on Form 15, provided
that:
o the issuer has less than 300 holders of record or 500 holders of record
where the issuer’s total assets have not exceeded $10 million on the last
day of each of the preceding three years;
o the issuer has filed its Section 13(a) reports for the most recent three
completed fiscal years, and for the portion of the year immediately
preceding the date of filing the Form 15 or the period since the issuer
became subject to the reporting obligation; and

30

15 U.S.C. 78m(a).

11

o a registration statement has not become effective or was required to be
updated pursuant to Exchange Act Section 10(a)(3) 31 during the fiscal
year. 32
Because the new statutory threshold for banks and bank holding companies is not
reflected in Rule 12g-4, banks and bank holding companies seeking to rely on the new
1,200-holder threshold may not rely on the existing procedural accommodations in the
rule. As a result, the statute requires them to wait 90 days after filing a certification with
the Commission that the number of holders of record is less than 1,200 persons to
terminate their Section 12(g) registration and cease filing reports required by Section
13(a) rather than being able to suspend their Section 13(a) reporting obligations
immediately upon the filing of a Form 15 in reliance on the rule. Similarly, banks and
bank holding companies are not permitted to rely on Rule 12h-3 to immediately suspend
their Section 15(d) reporting obligations using the new higher statutory threshold during a
fiscal year. Rather, Section 15(d)(1) provides that they may use the higher thresholds
only when seeking to suspend a Section 15(d) obligation on the first day of a fiscal year.
Similarly the new statutory threshold also is not reflected in current Rules 12g-2 and 12g3, leaving all issuers to refer to the lower 300-holder threshold under these rules.
We are proposing to amend these rules to include the JOBS Act thresholds for
banks and bank holding companies. 33 The proposed changes would allow banks and
31

15 U.S.C. 78j(a)(3).

32

The automatic statutory suspension of an issuer’s Section 15(d) reporting obligation also is not
available as to any fiscal year in which the issuer’s Securities Act registration statement becomes
effective or is required to be updated pursuant to Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act.

33

One commenter expressed support for a change permitting banks and bank holding companies to
immediately suspend Section 13(a) reporting at the 1,200-holder threshold upon filing Form 15, as
is permitted for all issuers under current rules at the 300-holder threshold. See letter from John
Marshall Bank (Apr. 13, 2012).

12

bank holding companies to rely on the Commission’s rules to suspend reporting
immediately, to avoid being deemed registered upon the termination of certain
exemptions or as a successor issuer, and to terminate their registration during the fiscal
year, at the higher 1,200-holder threshold.
B.

Increased Thresholds for Savings and Loan Holding Companies’
Registration and Reporting Obligations

We are proposing to apply the same thresholds to savings and loan holding
companies that apply to banks and bank holding companies. As noted above, banks and
bank holding companies under Title VI of the JOBS Act are subject to a higher
shareholder registration threshold for a class of equity security under Section 12(g)(1) of
the Exchange Act, and a higher threshold for termination of registration under Section
12(g)(4) and for suspension of the duty to file reports under Section 15(d)(1). Section
3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act defines the term “bank”; 34 however, neither the Exchange
Act nor the Commission’s rules define “bank holding company.” Section 2 of the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956 specifically excludes “savings and loan holding
companies” from the definition of bank holding company. 35 Thus, while banks, savings
associations and bank holding companies are covered by Title VI of the JOBS Act,
savings and loan holding companies are not.

34

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6). Exchange Act Section 3(a)(6) defines a “bank” to include Federal savings
associations and any other banking institution or savings association, as defined in the Home
Owners’ Loan Act. We read this definition to include savings and loan associations and other
similar entities.

35

A savings and loan holding company is a company that controls savings associations or other
savings and loan holding companies, similar to the way a bank holding company is a company that
controls banks or other bank holding companies. Savings associations and banks are all
depository institutions, and each one is regulated by the appropriate Federal banking agency. 12
U.S.C. 1813(q). The definition of “appropriate Federal banking agency” provides which federal
banking agency is the primary regulator for the various types of national, state and foreign banks
and savings associations.

13

A commenter representing community banks asserted that savings and loan
holding companies should be covered by Title VI of the JOBS Act. 36 Other commenters
from the banking industry and Congress have also requested that savings and loan
holding companies be treated similarly to bank holding companies for purposes of the
registration, termination of registration and suspension of reporting provisions of the
Exchange Act. 37 One commenter acknowledged that the JOBS Act did not “expressly
extend its new threshold for termination of registration to savings and loan holding
companies,” but suggested that correction of that omission would be “entirely consistent
with the intent and purpose of the JOBS Act.” 38
Based on a review of reporting issuers, we estimate that approximately 125
savings and loan holding companies were reporting issuers as of June 30, 2014, most of
which are registered pursuant to Section 12(b). 39 Approximately 90 of these companies
reported fewer than 1,200 holders of record and would be eligible to terminate
registration under the proposed threshold. 40 These savings and loan holding companies,

See, e.g., letters from American Bankers Association (Aug. 10, 2012); Community Bankers

Wayne Savings Community Bank (Apr. 12, 2012); U.S. Representative Stivers (May 4, 2012);
and U.S. Representative Gibbs (Dec. 19, 2012).

38

See letter from American Bankers Association.

39

Savings and loan holding companies were identified by examining filings in the relevant Standard
Industrial Classification codes.

40

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Board of Governors”) previously
determined to exempt commercial savings and loan holding companies from its initial requirement
that savings and loan holding companies generally submit the same reports as other banking
entities regulated by the Board of Governors. See Agency Information Collection Activities
Regarding Savings and Loan Holding Companies: Announcement of Board Approval Under
Delegated Authority and Submission to OMB, (Dec. 23, 2011) [76 FR 81933 (Dec. 29, 2011)].
There are six commercial savings and loan holding companies that are all exchange-listed issuers
obligated to file, and would continue to be obligated to file, Exchange Act reports pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(b) (15 U.S.C. 78l(b)). For ease of application and due to the limited
effect on, and small number of, such issuers, we are not proposing to differentiate between

14

however, are subject to regulation by the Board of Governors and are generally required
to submit the same reports to banking regulators as other banking entities regulated by the
Board of Governors, including banks and bank holding companies covered by Title VI of
the JOBS Act. 41
As noted above, the increased thresholds provided by the JOBS Act for
registration, termination of registration and suspension of reporting for banks and bank
holding companies do not apply to savings and loan holding companies. This creates
inconsistent treatment among depository institutions, resulting in different registration
requirements for savings and loan holding companies that otherwise provide services
similar to those provided by banks and bank holding companies and are generally subject
to similar bank regulatory and supervision requirements. We have received comments in
support of treating savings and loan holding companies the same as banks and bank
holding companies with regard to the increased thresholds.
We are proposing to revise our rules so that savings and loan holding companies
are treated in a similar manner to banks and bank holding companies for the purposes of
registration, termination of registration or suspension of their Exchange Act reporting

commercial saving and loan holding companies and other savings and loan holding companies for
purposes of this rulemaking.

111-203, 124 Stat. 1376) (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision, the
regulator that formerly supervised savings and loan holding companies, and transferred its
authorities (including rulemaking) related to savings and loan holding companies to the Board of
Governors. The Board of Governors assumed supervisory responsibility for savings and loan
holding companies and their non-depository subsidiaries beginning on July 21, 2011. The Board
of Governors is responsible for the consolidated supervision of bank holding companies and
savings and loan holding companies and requires those entities to provide data relating to
capitalization, liquidity, and risk management as well as periodic financial reports in order for the
Board of Governors to analyze the overall financial condition of those entities to ensure safe and
sound operations. These reports include, among others, quarterly Consolidated Financial
Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C) and an Annual Report of Bank Holding
Companies (FR Y-6).

obligations. Unlike for bank holding companies, which are able to rely on the JOBS Act
statutory changes, the revised rules would be the sole basis on which savings and loan
holding companies could rely when making those determinations. We are proposing to
apply the new higher thresholds applicable to banks and bank holding companies to
savings and loan holding companies 42 because we believe the regulatory oversight
applicable to savings and loan holding companies is substantially similar to the regulatory
oversight for bank holding companies. We believe these companies should be treated
consistently with other depository institutions under our rules. We are therefore
proposing to amend Exchange Act Rule 12g-1 to establish an exemption for savings and
loan holding companies from the registration requirement that mirrors the exemption for
banks and bank holding companies established by the JOBS Act. In addition, we are
proposing to revise Exchange Act Rules 12g-2, 12g-3, 12g-4 and 12h-3 to permit savings
and loan holding companies to immediately suspend current and periodic reporting upon
filing Form 15 at the 1,200-holder threshold in the same manner as banks and bank
holding companies.
C.

Application of the Increased Threshold for Accredited Investors

Section 501 of the JOBS Act amended Exchange Act Section 12(g)(1) to increase
the threshold that triggers registration by an issuer other than a bank or bank holding
company to total assets exceeding $10 million and a class of equity security (other than
an exempted security) held of record by either 2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not
accredited investors (as such term is defined by the Commission). 43 A number of
42

Under our proposal “savings and loan holding company” would be defined pursuant to Section 10
of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. 12 U.S.C. 1461.

43

The statutory amendment was effective upon enactment of the JOBS Act and does not require any
Commission action. While this change primarily affects issuers that have never had a reporting

16

commenters pointed to potential compliance concerns with respect to identifying
accredited investors and recommended ways to facilitate issuers’ use of the increased
threshold for holders of record that are accredited investors. Some commenters
recommended that the Commission confirm that the term “accredited investor” as used in
this provision of the JOBS Act has the same meaning as set forth in Securities Act Rule
501(a) 44 of Regulation D. 45 One commenter further recommended that the Commission
permit an issuer to rely on an annual affirmation from investors that their accredited
investor status has not changed. 46 Other commenters recommended that the Commission
provide guidance or a safe harbor to allow issuers to rely on an ongoing basis on
information previously obtained about a shareholder’s accredited investor status. 47
Commenters also recommended that the Commission provide additional flexibility by,
for example, permitting issuers to rely on the determinations made by certain third

obligation under the Exchange Act, issuers that have filed a Securities Act registration statement
that became effective but have not triggered an Exchange Act Section 12(g) registration
requirement and issuers that have terminated registration or suspended their reporting obligation
will need to monitor the accredited investor status of their investors as of the last day of each fiscal
year.

45

See letters from New York City Bar Association (June 6, 2012) (“NYCBA”) and the Business
Law Section of the American Bar Association (June 26, 2013) (“ABA”). The ABA letter further
requested that the Commission provide guidance on the type of information upon which issuers
may rely and specifically recommended that the Commission not require issuers to take reasonable
steps to verify accredited investor status.

46

See letter from ABA.

47

See letters from Foley & Lardner (May 24, 2012) and NYCBA. Foley & Lardner recommended
allowing reliance on information obtained at the time the issuer’s securities were initially issued,
or, in the alternative, when the securities were most recently issued, when making the
determination of whether the holders are accredited for purposes of counting holders under
Section 12(g). NYCBA recommended that the Commission expressly permit an issuer “to rely on
any determination of ‘accredited investor’ status made in connection with the issuer’s most recent
sale of securities to the relevant investor, or the most recent transfer to the investor in connection
with which the issuer actually determined that the investor was ‘accredited.’” Other commenters
also supported permitting issuers to rely on information previously provided if an investor fails to
provide the issuer with updated information. See letters from ABA and Keith Paul Bishop (June
13, 2012).

17

parties, such as financial intermediaries, or permitting determinations during a reasonable
period before or after the fiscal year end. 48
To rely on the new, higher threshold established by the JOBS Act, an issuer will
need to be able to determine which of its record holders are accredited investors. We are
not proposing to establish a new definition of “accredited investor” for the purposes of
Section 12(g)(1). Securities Act Rule 501(a) contains a definition of “accredited
investor” that includes any person who comes within, or who the issuer reasonably
believes comes within, any of eight enumerated categories. 49 Section 413(b) of the
Dodd-Frank Act specifically requires the Commission to undertake a review of the
“accredited investor” definition in its entirety, as it relates to natural persons, every four
years and no earlier than July 10, 2014. 50

48

See letter from ABA. ABA suggested that the rule should provide some flexibility on the timing
of the determination. This would permit issuers to rely on information available to them at the
time they made a judgment regarding accredited investor status, rather than requiring issuers to
update the information as of the end of the fiscal year. See also letter from NYCBA
recommending that the Commission adopt rules open to the possibility that limited access trading
venues may be able to treat all participants as accredited investors. One commenter recommended
that the Commission require issuers to determine accredited investor status as of the last day of
each fiscal year. See letter from Keith Paul Bishop.

49

Under Securities Act Rule 501(a) the categories of accredited investor include: a bank, insurance
company, registered investment company, business development company, or small business
investment company; an employee benefit plan (within the meaning of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act) if a bank, insurance company, or registered investment adviser makes the
investment decisions, or if the plan has total assets in excess of $5 million; a tax exempt charitable
organization, corporation or partnership with assets in excess of $5 million; a director, executive
officer, or general partner of the company selling the securities; an enterprise in which all the
equity owners are accredited investors; an individual with a net worth of at least $1 million, not
including the value of his or her primary residence; an individual with income exceeding $200,000
in each of the two most recent calendar years or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000
for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year; and a
trust with assets of at least $5 million, not formed only to acquire the securities offered, and whose
purchases are directed by a person who meets the legal standard of having sufficient knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
the prospective investment.

50

We have already requested comment on this definition. See Amendments to Regulation D, Form
D and Rule 156, Release No. 33-9416 (Jul. 10, 2013) [78 FR 44806 (Jul. 24, 2013)].

18

We are proposing that the definition of “accredited investor” in Securities Act
Rule 501(a) apply in making determinations under Exchange Act Section 12(g)(1). 51 The
“accredited investor” determination would be made as of the last day of the fiscal year
rather than at the time of the sale of the securities. 52 Issuers conducting offerings in
reliance on an exemption from Securities Act registration in which purchasers must be
accredited investors typically take appropriate steps to establish a reasonable belief that a
prospective investor is an accredited investor. This reasonable belief is based on an
issuer’s due diligence and depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding
the determination. We believe applying the familiar concepts of the accredited investor
definition in Rule 501(a) to the registration threshold in Section 12(g)(1) would facilitate
compliance for issuers.
After an issuer completes its offering and has sold securities to purchasers who
have been determined to be accredited investors, it is not required to periodically assess
an investor’s continued status as an accredited investor. We recognize that issuers may
have difficulty determining whether existing security holders are accredited investors for
purposes of the threshold in Section 12(g)(1) and that providing a safe harbor or other
guidance could help to mitigate costs for issuers seeking to determine accredited investor
status. Some commenters have suggested that we permit issuers to rely on information
previously provided by these security holders in connection with the purchase or transfer

51

Although the term “accredited investor” is also defined in Securities Act Rule 215 [17 CFR
230.215] for the purpose of the statutory exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(5) [15
U.S.C. 78d(a)(5)], the definition of “accredited investor” contained in Securities Act Rule 501(a)
of Regulation D is the more commonly understood meaning of the term, given the prevalence of
the use of Regulation D for exempt offerings.

52

Securities Act Rule 501(a) otherwise defines “accredited investor” as being determined at the time
of the sale of the securities.

19

of securities for an indefinite period into the future. 53 We believe such reliance could,
however, result in the use of outdated information that may no longer be reliable.
Instead, an issuer will need to determine, based on facts and circumstances, whether it
can rely upon prior information to form a reasonable basis for believing that the security
holder continues to be an accredited investor as of the last day of the fiscal year.
Without new guidance from the Commission, when making the determination at
fiscal year-end of whether a security holder is an accredited investor for purposes of
Exchange Act Section 12(g)(1), issuers would likely use procedures similar to those used
when relying on Rule 506. 54 We recognize that the accredited investor determination
under the Securities Act is made in the context of an investor making an investment
decision, while in the Exchange Act context it is made when an issuer is considering
whether it must register a class of securities with the Commission. In light of this, we are
considering whether a different approach would be appropriate for determining
accredited investor status under Section 12(g) and solicit comment on the appropriate
structure and criteria for such an approach below.
Request for Comment
1.

We are proposing to revise Rule 12g-1 to reflect changes made by Titles V and VI

of the JOBS Act. Should we include the requirements of Section 12(g)(1) in our rules as
proposed? Should we delete the provision in the current Rule 12g-1 that precludes
53

See supra note 47.

54

The procedures used in a Rule 506 offering may vary depending on a number of factors, including
the nature of the purchaser and whether the offering is pursuant to Rule 506(b) or Rule 506(c).
Rule 506(c) requires an issuer to take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers of securities sold
in such offering are accredited investors. As we previously recognized when we adopted Rule
506(c), “issuers may have to apply a stricter and more costly process to determine accredited
investor status than what they currently use.” See Eliminating the Prohibition Against General
Solicitation and General Advertising in Rule 506 and Rule 144A Offerings, Release No. 33-9415
(Jul. 10, 2013) [78 FR 44771 (Jul. 24, 2013)].

20

foreign private issuers from relying on the exemption from registration if their securities
are quoted on an automated inter-dealer quotation system, as proposed?
2.

The higher registration and reporting thresholds could result in issuers having a

significant number of shareholders with freely tradable shares who lack current
disclosure information about the issuer. How would investors get the information they
need in connection with purchases and sales? What investor protection issues are raised
when these security holders engage in secondary market transactions and how might they
be addressed?
3.

Should we extend the new registration, termination of registration and suspension

of reporting thresholds for banks and bank holding companies to savings and loan
holding companies, as proposed? We are proposing to use the definition of “savings and
loan holding company” as defined in Section 10 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. Does
the proposed definition cover the appropriate entities? If not, what definition should be
used?
4.

We are proposing to permit savings and loan holding companies to use the higher

thresholds equivalent to those available to banks and bank holding companies. Are there
facts and circumstances, other than those discussed above, that we should consider in
evaluating whether to provide those higher thresholds? How would using different
thresholds for savings and loan holding companies impact market participants and
investors? What effect would different thresholds have on competition between savings
and loan holding companies and other depository institutions, such as banks and bank
holding companies?
5.

The population of savings and loan holding companies includes commercial

savings and loan holding companies that the Board of Governors exempted from its
21

initial requirement that savings and loan holding companies generally submit the same
reports as other banking entities regulated by the Board of Governors. 55 These
commercial savings and loan holding companies are all exchange-listed issuers that are
currently registered and required to file reports under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.
Should these companies be permitted to rely on the higher thresholds applicable to banks
and bank holding companies? Should we instead carve out such savings and loan holding
companies or provide other limitations for these companies?
6.

Some commenters have recommended that we provide a safe harbor or other

guidance to provide issuers with more certainty on how to establish a reasonable belief
that a security holder is an accredited investor and therefore qualifies under the definition.
Are there circumstances in the determination required to be made under Section 12(g)
that suggest the need for a safe harbor or guidance, and if so, is one preferable over the
other? What should be the parameters of any safe harbor or guidance? Should a safe
harbor or other guidance specify the methods of inquiry an issuer could make or the
documents it should obtain that would establish a reasonable belief? What methods or
standards should we adopt and what steps should we require in making the
determination? What negative effects on investors, if any, could result from providing a
safe harbor or other guidance? Absent a safe harbor or other guidance, what burdens
would the issuer face in establishing reasonable belief that a security holder is an
accredited investor and in making the determination as to whether it has exceeded the
Section 12(g) thresholds for Exchange Act reporting? Please quantify, if possible, the

55

See supra note 40.

22

expected costs of establishing a reasonable belief every year for each accredited investor
and compare the expected costs to the estimated costs of registration.
7.

If the rules were to include a safe harbor or other guidance, should we permit an

issuer to form its reasonable belief that a person is an accredited investor based on
determinations made by specified third parties? For example, in Securities Act Rule
506(c)(2)(ii)(C) we allow issuers to rely on a written confirmation by a registered brokerdealer, a registered investment adviser, a licensed attorney, or a certified public
accountant to satisfy the requirement that the issuer take reasonable steps to verify the
accredited investor status of a purchaser. Should a similar written confirmation be
sufficient here? Should we permit written confirmations from other third parties not
subject to regulatory oversight? Why or why not? If we permit written confirmations
from third parties that are not subject to regulatory oversight such as those found in Rule
506(c)(2)(ii)(C), should we require issuers to perform some level of due diligence on the
accredited investor determinations made by those third parties or on the third parties
making those determinations? Would the answer depend on the nature of the third party?
Alternatively, should we permit an issuer to rely on a written certification by the investor,
on other specified information obtained by the issuer, or on a combination of a
certification and other information? What information, other than a written investor
certification, would it be appropriate to require? Would the answer depend on whether
an issuer had determined at the time of the initial investment that the investor was an
accredited investor? For what period of time should that determination be considered
reliable? Should the safe harbor or other guidance specify that determinations made a
specified period before or after the fiscal year end would be deemed to be reasonable? If

23

so, what would be a reasonable time period for making such determination? What
documentation, if any, should be retained by the issuer?
8.

For purposes of any safe harbor or other guidance, should we permit an issuer to

rely on previously obtained information relating to the person’s accredited investor status,
such as information obtained at the time the issuer’s securities were initially, or most
recently, sold to that person? Should such a provision be limited to situations in which
the issuer does not have information that would lead it to believe that the previously
obtained information was incorrect, unreliable or had changed? Should we place a time
limit on the permitted use of previously obtained information, such as only permitting the
use of information received within the preceding six months or year? Should an issuer be
able to rely on information previously obtained if the security holder failed to respond to
an issuer’s request for an annual affirmation of accredited investor status?
III.

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO EXCHANGE ACT RULE 12g5-1
A.

Statutory Requirement and Definition of “Employee Compensation
Plan”

Exchange Act Section 12(g)(5), as amended by Section 502 of the JOBS Act,
provides that the definition of “held of record” shall not include securities held by
persons who received them pursuant to an “employee compensation plan” in transactions
exempted from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act. By its
express terms, this new statutory exclusion applies solely for purposes of determining
whether an issuer is required to register a class of equity securities under the Exchange
Act and does not apply to a determination of whether such registration may be terminated

24

or suspended. 56 The provision, which is substantially broader than the Commission’s
current rules exempting compensatory employee stock options from Section 12(g)
registration, 57 does not define the term “employee compensation plan.”
Section 503 of the JOBS Act instructs the Commission to amend the definition of
“held of record” to implement the amendment in Section 502 and to adopt a safe harbor
that issuers can use when determining whether holders of their securities received them
pursuant to an employee compensation plan in exempt transactions. We are proposing to
amend Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1 to implement the statutory exclusion created by
Section 502 of the JOBS Act and to establish a non-exclusive safe harbor for issuers as
directed by Section 503. 58
Subsequent to the adoption of the JOBS Act, a number of commenters provided
recommendations to the Commission as to how “employee compensation plan” should be
defined. Some commenters recommended that the Commission interpret the term
broadly to promote the use of employee equity issuances. 59 One commenter indicated
that “linking the scope of Rule 701 and amended Section 12(g)(5) makes sense, in light

56

The statutory exclusion in Section 12(g)(5) specifically refers to Exchange Act Section 12(g)(1),
which relates to when an issuer must register its securities with the Commission.

57

Exchange Act Rule 12h-1(f) [17 CFR 240.12h-1(f)] provides non-reporting issuers with an
exemption from Section 12(g) registration for stock options issued under written compensatory
stock option plans under certain conditions. Exchange Act Rule 12h-1(g) [17 CFR 240.12h-1(g)]
provides a similar exemption for stock options for reporting issuers that are required to file such
periodic reports. The exemptions provide specific eligibility requirements and are limited to
options issued pursuant to a written compensatory stock option plan. See Exemption of
Compensatory Stock Options from Registration Under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, Release No. 34-56887 (Dec. 3, 2007) [72 FR 69554 (Dec. 7, 2007)] (the
“Compensatory Stock Options Release”).

of the apparent purpose of the latter provisions, and will avoid needless complexity.” 60
Another commenter recommended that the Commission establish a non-exclusive safe
harbor without recommending a specific definition for “employee compensation plan.” 61
This commenter suggested that “application in a Section 12(g) context of the familiar
concepts applied in connection with the exempt issuance of compensatory equity
securities under Rule 701 will facilitate compliance by streamlining a smaller issuer’s
learning curve and simplifying recordkeeping.” 62 In addition, this commenter
specifically recommended that the safe harbor “explicitly import the interpretation of
Rule 701(c)” in order to incorporate “the full range of compensatory arrangements and
security holders described in Rule 701(c) under the Securities Act” and that it “should
cover equity securities in the hands of the full range of participants and permitted
transferees enumerated in Rule 701(c).” 63 This commenter also indicated that “the
requirement of a written arrangement is reasonable in the Section 12(g)(5) context, as
well as for Rule 701.” 64 Commenters also made specific recommendations regarding
additional securities that should be considered “securities received pursuant to an
employee compensation plan.” 65
60

See letter from NYCBA. For a more detailed explanation of Securities Act Rule 701, see infra
notes 66 and 72.

61

See letter from ABA. ABA indicated that “it is important that the concept of ‘employee
compensation plan’ encompass both traditional plans and individual compensatory agreements
and include compensatory arrangements established by the various entities related to the issuer
enumerated in Rule 701(c).”

See id.

63

See id.

64

See id., indicating that state corporate law generally requires some documentation of authorized
issuances of equity securities. This recommendation contrasts with recommendations of other
commenters suggesting that the term “employee compensation plan” should not be read to require
a written arrangement. See supra note 59.

65

See, e.g., letter from David C. Fisher (June 13, 2012), recommending that “securities acquired in
an issuer-sponsored internal market, limited to transactions in securities received pursuant to the

26

Instead of creating a new definition for the term “employee compensation plan,”
we are proposing to revise the definition of “held of record” and establish a non-exclusive
safe harbor that relies on the current definition of “compensatory benefit plan” in Rule
701 and the conditions in Rule 701(c). 66 Although some commenters recommended that
we create a new, broad definition, we believe that by not defining the term “employee
compensation plan,” and by providing for a non-exclusive safe harbor, we are providing
issuers with flexibility in their determination under Section 12(g)(5). We concur with
some commenters who recommended applying the Rule 701 concepts that issuers already
employ for exempt issuances, and propose to use those concepts as part of the nonexclusive safe harbor. We further believe that developing a new definition for “employee
compensation plan” at this time potentially could result in needless complexity and create
conflicts with the current definitions of “compensatory benefit plan” and “employee
benefit plan,” which the Commission has sought to harmonize. 67
By conditioning the new exclusion from “held of record” upon the securities
being received pursuant to an employee compensation plan in transactions exempted
from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act, Section 502 of the
JOBS Act uses Securities Act concepts to identify persons that an issuer may exclude
issuer’s employee compensation plans, will be considered securities received pursuant to an
employee compensation plan.” See also letter from NYCBA suggesting that “‘closed system’
platforms and trading venues” may be able to afford issuers a reasonable basis to determine that
participants are excludable employees.
66

In 1988, the Commission adopted Securities Act Rule 701 [17 CFR 230.701] to provide an
exemption from Securities Act registration for offers and sales of securities made pursuant to
compensatory benefit plans by issuers that are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section
13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. See Compensatory Benefit Plans and Contracts, Release No. 336768 (Apr. 14, 1988) [53 FR 12918 (Apr. 20, 1988)] (the “Rule 701 Adopting Release”).

See Rule 701 – Exempt Offerings Pursuant to Compensatory Arrangements, Release No. 33-7645
(Feb. 25, 1999) [64 FR 11095 (Mar. 8, 1999)] (the “1999 Rule 701 Release”), and Registration of
Securities on Form S-8, Release No. 33-7646 (Feb. 25, 1999) [64 FR 11103 (Mar. 8, 1999)] (the
“1999 Form S-8 Release”).

27

from its determination of the number of holders of record under Section 12(g)(1) of the
Exchange Act. Given this express interaction between Securities Act and Exchange Act
concepts in this provision of the JOBS Act, we believe that it would facilitate compliance
if the terminology we use in proposed Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1(a)(7) is consistent with
the terminology used in our Securities Act rules.
In regulating securities offerings to employees, we use the term “employee benefit
plan,” as defined in Securities Act Rule 405, 68 for Securities Act Form S-8 registration, 69
but use the term “compensatory benefit plan” in the Securities Act Rule 701 exemption.
A “compensatory benefit plan” under Rule 701(c)(2) is broadly defined as “any purchase,
savings, option, bonus, stock appreciation, profit sharing, thrift, incentive, deferred
compensation, pension or similar plan.” 70 When adopting Rule 701, the Commission
expressly stated that it patterned the definition of “compensatory benefit plan” on the
definition used in Securities Act Rule 405. 71 Rule 701 includes a number of conditions
consistent with the Rule 405 definition of “employee benefit plan.” In particular, Rule
701(c) limits the exemption to offers and sales of securities under a written compensatory

68

Securities Act Rule 405 defines an “employee benefit plan” as any written purchase, savings,
option, bonus, appreciation, profit sharing, thrift, incentive, pension or similar plan or written
compensation contract solely for employees, directors, general partners, trustees (where the
registrant is a business trust), officers, or consultants or advisors. However, consultants or
advisors may participate in an employee benefit plan only if: (1) They are natural persons; (2)
They provide bona fide services to the registrant; and (3) The services are not in connection with
the offer or sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction, and do not directly or indirectly
promote or maintain a market for the registrant’s securities.

69

The Commission permits issuers that are subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements to
register the offer and sale of securities to employees pursuant to employee benefit plans on Form
S-8. This form provides for abbreviated disclosure and automatic effectiveness upon filing. See
Adoption of Form S-8, Release No. 33-3480 (June 16, 1953) [18 FR 3688 (June 27, 1953)]. See
also Registration and Reporting Requirements for Employee Benefit Plans, Release No. 33-6867

benefit plan established by the issuer for the participation of its employees and other
specified persons. 72 Many of the conditions applicable to exempt offers and sales made
under Rule 701 are also similar to conditions placed on Form S-8 registration of
securities to be offered under an “employee benefit plan” as defined in Rule 405. For
example, Rule 701(c)(3) defines eligible family members consistent with Form S-8. 73 In
addition, the Rule 701 exemption includes a number of conditions to its use, including
but not limited to conditions that the plan be written and delivered to employees; that the
plan be established by the issuer, its parents, its majority-owned subsidiaries or majorityowned subsidiaries of the issuer’s parent, for the participation of their employees,

72

Securities Act Rule 701(c) exempts offers and sales of securities (including plan interests and
guarantees pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii)) under a written compensatory benefit plan (or written
compensation contract) established by the issuer, its parents, its majority-owned subsidiaries or
majority-owned subsidiaries of the issuer’s parent, for the participation of their employees,
directors, general partners, trustees (where the issuer is a business trust), officers, or consultants
and advisors, and their family members who acquire such securities from such persons through
gifts or domestic relations orders. This section exempts offers and sales to former employees,
directors, general partners, trustees, officers, consultants and advisors only if such persons were
employed by or providing services to the issuer at the time the securities were offered. In
addition, the term “employee” includes insurance agents who are exclusive agents of the issuer, its
subsidiaries or parents, or who derive more than 50% of their annual income from those entities.
As explained in the 1999 Rule 701 Release at Section II.D, Rule 701 is also available to persons
with a de facto employment relationship with the issuer. Such a relationship would exist where a
person not employed by the issuer provides the issuer services that traditionally are performed by
an employee and the compensation paid for those services is the primary source of the person’s
earned income.

73

Form S-8 and Rule 701 are available for the exercise of employee benefit plan options by an
employee’s family member who has acquired the options from the employee through a gift or a
domestic relations order. See the 1999 Form S-8 Release at Section III and the 1999 Rule 701
Release at Section II.E. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 701(c)(3) [17 CFR 230.701(c)(3)], for
this purpose, “family member” includes any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent,
grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-inlaw, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, any person

employee) own more than 50% of the voting interests.

Definition of “Held of Record” and Non-exclusive Safe Harbor for
Determining Holders of Record

As directed by Section 503 of the JOBS Act, the Commission is proposing to
amend the definition of “held of record” and to establish a safe harbor in Rule 12g5-1 that
issuers can rely on when determining if securities held by persons who received them
pursuant to an employee compensation plan in transactions exempted from the
registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act may be excluded when
calculating the number of holders of record of a class of equity securities for purposes of
determining the issuer’s registration obligation under Section 12(g)(1)(A). 75 We received
comments addressing issues about the scope of the safe harbor. One commenter
recommended that the Commission expressly provide that the safe harbor is a nonexclusive safe harbor akin to the Securities Act Rule 506 safe harbor under Securities Act
Section 4(a)(2). 76 This commenter also recommended that a safe harbor should provide
that in a “subsequent transaction (including a business combination) that is exempt from,
74

The Commission adopted amendments to Form S-8 and the Rule 405 definition of “employee
benefit plan” that made Form S-8 available for the issuance of securities to consultants or advisors
only if: they are natural persons; they provide bona fide services to the registrant; and the services
are not in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction, and do not
directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for the registrant’s securities. See 1999 Form
S-8 Release and 1999 Rule 701 Release. Rule 701(c)(1) applies the same limitations regarding
consultants and advisors as those provided in Form S-8 and the Rule 405 definition of “employee
benefit plan.”

75

As proposed, this amendment would not affect the definition of “held of record” when
determining the number of holders for the purposes of termination of registration or suspension of
reporting or with regard to the number of holders reported pursuant to Item 201(b) of Regulation
S-K (17 CFR 229.201(b)).

76

See letter from ABA recommending that the Commission provide “that the safe harbor(s) is not
the exclusive means by which an issuer may comply with the ‘compensatory plan carve-out’
provisions of Section 12(g)(5).” This commenter suggested that “failure to satisfy all conditions
to reliance on the safe harbor(s) should not preclude reliance on the statutory carve-out itself.”

30

or otherwise is not subject to, the registration requirements of Section 5, the securities
issued in that transaction to eligible employees, former employees, and other covered
persons in exchange for securities covered by the Section 12(g)(5) compensatory plan
securities carve out” would also be covered. 77 The same commenter further
recommended that securities issued in unregistered transactions based on the “no sale”
theory should be included within the definition of “transactions exempt from section 5.” 78
1.

Definition of “Held of Record”

We are proposing to amend the definition of “held of record” to provide that when
determining whether an issuer is required to register a class of equity securities with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g)(1) an issuer may exclude securities
that are either:
•

held by persons who received the securities pursuant to an employee
compensation plan in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of
Section 5 of the Securities Act or that did not involve a sale within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act; or

•

held by persons eligible to receive securities from the issuer pursuant to Exchange
Act Rule 701(c) who received the securities in a transaction exempt from the

77

See id.

78

See id. The “no sale” theory relates to the issuance of compensatory grants made by employers to
broad groups of employees pursuant to broad-based stock bonus plans under the theory that the
awards are not an offer or sale of securities under Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C.
77b(a)(3)]. See Employee Benefit Plans; Interpretations of Statute, Release No. 33-6188 (Feb. 1,
1980) [45 FR 8960 (Feb. 11, 1980)] at Section II.A.5.d; Employee Benefit Plans, Release No. 336281 (Jan. 15, 1981) [46 FR 8446 (Jan. 27, 1981)] at Section III. Many issuers rely on the “no
sale” theory when making such awards to employees where no consideration – and hence no
“value” – is received by the issuer in return. The staff has not objected to these issuances in a
series of no-action letters. See, e.g., no-action letter to Verint Systems Inc. (May 24, 2007).

31

registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act in exchange for
securities excludable under proposed Rule 12g5-1(a)(7).
Section 502 of the JOBS Act refers specifically to “transactions exempted” from
the Securities Act Section 5 registration requirements. A number of issuers, however,
issue securities to employees without Securities Act registration on the basis that the
issuance is not a sale under Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act and therefore do not
trigger the registration requirement of Securities Act Section 5, which applies only to the
offer and sale of securities. While securities issued to employees in transactions that do
not involve a sale under Section 2(a)(3) are not technically “transactions exempted from
the registration requirements of section 5,” they are similar to other compensatory
issuances to employees in exempt transactions in that the issuer provides the awards to
employees for a compensatory purpose. We are therefore proposing to exclude such “no
sale” issuances from the definition of “held of record” in Rule 12g5-1 for purposes of
determining an issuer’s obligation to register a class of securities under the Exchange
Act.
As proposed, the rule would also permit an issuer to exclude holders who are
persons eligible to receive securities from the issuer pursuant to Rule 701(c) and who
acquired the securities in exchange for securities excludable under the proposed
definition. 79 The proposed exclusion is intended to facilitate the ability of an issuer to
conduct restructurings, business combinations and similar transactions that are exempt
from Securities Act registration so that if the securities being surrendered in such a
transaction would not have been counted under the proposed definition of “held of
79

See supra note 72 and 73 and infra note 82 (describing the types of persons eligible to receive
securities under Rule 701(c)).

32

record,” the securities issued in the exchange also would not be counted under this
definition. 80 The securities issued in the exchange would be deemed to have a
compensatory purpose because they would replace other securities previously issued
pursuant to an employee compensation plan. We believe such an approach would be
consistent with the intent of Section 502 of the JOBS Act and would provide issuers with
appropriate flexibility to conduct certain business combinations and similar transactions.
2.

Non-exclusive Safe Harbor for Determining Holders of Record

We are proposing a non-exclusive safe harbor under proposed Rule 12g5-1(a)(7)
that would provide that a person will be deemed to have received the securities pursuant
to an employee compensation plan if such person received them pursuant to a
compensatory benefit plan in transactions that met the conditions of Securities Act Rule
701(c). 81
As proposed, an issuer would be able to rely on the safe harbor for determining
the holders of securities issued in reliance on Securities Act Rule 701, as well as holders
of securities issued in transactions otherwise exempted from, or not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act that satisfy the conditions of Rule 701(c),
even if all the other conditions of Rule 701, such as issuer eligibility in Rule 701(b)(1),
the volume limitations in Rule 701(d) or the disclosure delivery provisions in Rule
701(e), were not met. Thus, the safe harbor would be available for holders of securities
received in other employee compensation plan transactions exempted from, or not subject

80

Consistent with Rule 701(c), securities held of record by former employees would be excluded
when determining the securities held of record only if the employees were employed by or
providing services to the surviving issuer at the time the exchange securities were offered.

81

As proposed, failure to satisfy all of the conditions of the non-exclusive safe harbor would not
preclude reliance on Section 12(g)(5) or other provisions of proposed Rule 12g5-1(a)(7).

33

to, the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act, such as securities
issued in reliance on Securities Act Section 4(a)(2), Regulation D of the Securities Act, or
Regulation S of the Securities Act, that meet the conditions of Rule 701(c).
We believe that using the conditions of Rule 701(c) to structure the safe harbor
for determining whether holders received their securities pursuant to an employee
compensation plan in exempt transactions would allow issuers to apply well understood
principles of an existing Securities Act exemption to the new Exchange Act registration
determination under the JOBS Act. The safe harbor would be available for the plan
participants enumerated in Rule 701(c), including employees, directors, general partners,
trustees, officers and certain consultants and advisors. 82 The safe harbor also would be
available for permitted family member transferees with respect to securities acquired by
gift or domestic relations order, or securities acquired by them in connection with options
transferred to them by the plan participant through gifts or domestic relations orders. 83
Because the safe harbor would be limited to holders who are persons specified in Rule
701(c) who received the securities under specified circumstances, once these persons
82

A de facto employee would be considered an employee for purposes of proposed Rule 12g51(a)(7). For purposes of Rule 701, the scope of eligible consultants and advisors is the same as
under Form S-8. See 1999 Rule 701 Release at Section II.D and 1999 Form S-8 Release at
Section II.A.1. This also would be the case for purposes of proposed Rule 12g5-1(a)(7). We note
that unlike traditional employees, consultants and advisors typically provide their services to
multiple clients rather than to the same issuer on a dedicated basis. This distinction may cause
them to be less likely to hold the securities they receive as compensation and more likely to sell
them. However, the fact that securities would no longer be eligible for the exclusion under the
safe harbor following their transfer should limit the potential for abuse. We believe that in light of
the Rule 701 restrictions applicable to consultants and advisors, the compensatory nature of the
transactions justifies treating consultants and advisors who are eligible to receive securities in
compensatory transactions that satisfy the conditions of Rule 701(c) as persons who receive
securities pursuant to an employee compensation plan for purposes of the proposed safe harbor.

83

See Rule 701- Exempt Offerings Pursuant to Compensatory Arrangements, Release No. 33-7511
(Feb. 27, 1998) [63 FR 10785 (Mar. 5, 1998)] at Section III.E.4. Including family member
transferees in the safe harbor would be consistent with the approach in Rule 701(c), which
provides an exemption to family member transferees in connection with stock options because of
their common economic interest and the non-capital raising nature of the transactions.

34

subsequently transfer the securities, whether or not for value, the securities would need to
be counted as held of record by the transferee for purposes of determining whether the
issuer is subject to the registration and reporting requirements of Exchange Act Section
12(g)(1).
In addition, under the proposed rules, foreign private issuers 84 would be able to
rely on the safe harbor when making their determination of the number of U.S. resident
holders under Exchange Act Rule 12g3-2(a). 85 Under Rule 12g3-2(a), foreign private
issuers that meet the asset and shareholder threshold of Section 12(g) are exempt from
registering any class of securities under that section if the class of securities is held by
fewer than 300 holders resident in the United States. For purposes of determining
whether this threshold is met, Rule 12g3-2(a)(1) specifies that the method shall be as
provided in Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1, subject to specific provisions relating to brokers,
dealers, banks and nominees. 86 Because the rule directs issuers to the definition of “held
of record” in Rule 12g5-1, the statutory changes to Section 12(g)(5) as well as the

84

The definition of “foreign private issuer” is contained in Exchange Act Rule 3b-4(c) [17 CFR
240.3b-4(c)]. A foreign private issuer is any foreign issuer other than a foreign government,
except for an issuer that (1) has more than 50% of its outstanding voting securities held of record
by U.S. residents and (2) any of the following: (i) a majority of its officers and directors are
citizens or residents of the United States; (ii) more than 50% of its assets are located in the United
States; or (iii) its business is principally administered in the United States.

85

17 CFR 240.12g3-2(a)

86

The proposed amendment to Rule 12g5-1 would be limited to determinations under Section 12(g).
The definition of “foreign private issuer” in Exchange Act Rule 3b-4 contains a cross-reference to
Rule 12g3-2(a) for purposes of calculating record ownership in determining whether more than 50%
of an issuer’s outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly held by residents of the United
States. In contrast to the proposed approach to Rule 12g3-2(a), we are proposing to amend Rule 3b-4
to clarify that securities held by employees must continue to be counted for the purpose of
determining the percentage of the issuer’s outstanding securities held by U.S. residents, and thus for
determining whether an issuer qualifies as a foreign private issuer. See the proposed amended
instruction to paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 3b-4.

35

proposed changes to Rule 12g5-1 would also apply to the determination of a foreign
private issuer’s U.S. resident holders for the purposes of the Rule 12g3-2(a) analysis. 87

Instead of leaving the term “employee compensation plan” undefined and

providing a safe harbor for purposes of determining the number of holders of record
under Section 12(g)(1), should we create a new definition for purposes of the
determination? If a new definition would be preferable, please describe how “employee
compensation plan” should be defined and explain why a definition would be preferable.
10.

In some circumstances issuers may rely on a “no sale” theory under Section

2(a)(3) of the Securities Act to issue securities to employees. As proposed, securities
held by persons who received those securities pursuant to an award to employees that did
not involve a sale within the meaning of Securities Act Section 2(a)(3) would be
excluded from the definition of “held of record” for purposes of determining an issuer’s
Exchange Act Section 12(g) registration obligations. Should these securities be excluded
from the definition?
11.

The exclusion from “held of record” in proposed Exchange Act Rule 12g5-

1(a)(7)(i) for securities received pursuant to employee compensation plans would include
within its scope holders of securities received pursuant to an employee compensation
87

The definition of “foreign private issuer” under the Securities Act, which is found in Securities
Act Rule 405 [17 CFR 230.405], is the same as the definition under Exchange Act Rule 3b-4. The
definition of “foreign private issuer” under the Securities Act was last amended in Foreign Issuer
Reporting Enhancements, Release No. 33-8959 (Sept. 23, 2008) [73 FR 58300 (Oct. 6, 2008)]. At
that time, an instruction to paragraph (1) of the definition, which was the same as the Instruction to
Paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 3b-4, was inadvertently omitted. We are proposing to amend the foreign
private issuer definition under Rule 405 to reinsert the omitted instruction but with a proposed
revision, identical to that proposed under Rule 3b-4, clarifying that securities held by employees
must continue to be counted for the purposes of determining the percentage of the issuer’s
outstanding securities held by U.S. residents and foreign private issuer status under the Securities
Act.

plan in transactions that do not involve a sale within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) or
that are exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5. Further, the safe harbor
proposed in Rule 12g5-1(a)(7)(ii) would be available to securities issued in those
transactions as long as the person received the securities pursuant to a compensatory
benefit plan in transactions that met the conditions of Securities Act Rule 701(c). Should
the scope of the safe harbor be more limited, such as by restricting it to securities
received pursuant to exempt transactions that meet all of the requirements of Securities
Act Rule 701, the requirements of Regulation D or another specified subset of
exemptions? If so, please explain why.
12.

We are proposing a non-exclusive safe harbor that relies, in part, on existing Rule

701(c) to establish guidelines for an issuer to use when determining whether holders of
their securities received them pursuant to an employee compensation plan. Does using
existing Rule 701(c) provide sufficient guidance to issuers? Should we provide
additional guidance for implementing the safe harbor? If so, please explain what
additional guidance is needed.
13.

For purposes of the safe harbor, should we limit the categories of persons who

may receive securities pursuant to employee compensation plans? For example, our
proposed safe harbor includes consultants and advisors because they qualify under Rule
701. Should they only be included if they are natural persons and meet the other Rule
701(c) conditions, as proposed? Alternatively, should consultants and advisors be
excluded?
14.

Should we, as proposed, permit securities held by family member transferees

acquired by gift or domestic relations order, or securities acquired by them in connection
with options transferred to them by the plan participant through gifts or domestic
37

relations orders to be excluded? If we modify the scope of the transferees or the type of
securities, what modifications would be appropriate?
15.

Exchange Act Rules 12h-1(f) and12h-1(g) exempt compensatory employee stock

options from registration under Exchange Act Section 12(g) by exempting issuers from
counting holders of stock options received pursuant to written compensatory stock option
plans under specified conditions. 88 How does the exclusion provided by Section 502 of
the JOBS Act and our proposals, including our proposal to exclude securities that do not
involve a sale under Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act, affect the continuing need for
these rules? 89 Should either Rule 12h-1(f) or Rule 12h-1(g) be rescinded in light of the
amendments made by Section 502 of the JOBS Act and our proposals? Alternatively, are
there any modifications needed to reflect the changes related to Section 502 and make the
rules more useful?
16.

Should we permit an issuer to exclude from the “held of record” determination

securities issued to security holders in an exchange exempt from registration under the
Securities Act where the securities surrendered by those holders in the exchange were
received by them pursuant to a compensatory benefit plan that met the conditions of the
proposed rule? As proposed, the exclusion would be limited to securities issued in an
exchange exempt from Securities Act registration to persons eligible to receive securities
pursuant to Rule 701(c) from the issuer, such as former employees who were employed
by or providing services to the surviving issuer at the time the exchange securities were

See letter from ABA, which suggested that while Rule 12h-1(f) may no longer be necessary, Rule
12h-1(g) may have continuing applications. Specifically, there may be instances in which an
issuer subject to an Exchange Act reporting requirement may issue to employees compensatory
options that are part of a class of equity securities not registered under the Exchange Act.

offered. Should the Commission consider expanding the exclusion to securities received
by other former employees in such an exempt exchange where the securities to be
surrendered in the exchange were received pursuant to a compensatory benefit plan in
transactions that met the conditions of the proposed rule? Would the possibility that an
exempt exchange could cause a number of former employees previously counted as
exempt from the “held of record” determination to be counted as holders of record
immediately on consummation of the exchange inhibit companies from entering into
these transactions?
17.

Foreign private issuers are subject to different standards relating to when they are

required to register a class of equity securities under the Exchange Act. Should the
Commission permit foreign private issuers to exclude securities received pursuant to an
“employee compensation plan” in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the
Securities Act registration requirements from the 300 U.S. holders threshold in Exchange
Act Rule 12g3-2(a), as proposed? Should we instead require foreign private issuers to
continue counting these securities when determining their number of U.S. holders?
Should we further permit issuers to exclude such securities for purposes of assessing
whether an issuer qualifies as a foreign private issuer or should such securities be
included in this determination, as would be required under our proposed amendments to
Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 3b-4?

The definition of “held of record” in Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1 requires an

issuer, for the purposes of determining whether it is subject to the provisions of Section
12(g) or Section 15(d), to count as holders of record only persons identified as owners on
records of security holders maintained by or on behalf of the issuer in accordance with
accepted practice and subject to certain conditions. This rule simplifies an issuer’s
determination process by allowing it to look to security holders that appear in its records.
Are there alternative definitions of “held of record” that would more appropriately
address the purposes of Section 12(g)? 90

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Title V and Title VI of the JOBS Act increased the registration thresholds for

issuers, amended the definition of “held of record” to exclude securities issued pursuant
to employee compensation plans and increased the thresholds for termination of
registration and suspension of reporting under the Exchange Act for banks and bank

holding companies. The Commission is proposing rules to implement Title V and Title
VI of the JOBS Act.
In proposing rules or amendments, we are mindful of the costs imposed by and
the benefits obtained from our rules. The discussion below attempts to address the
economic effects of the proposed amendments, including the likely costs and benefits of
the amendments as well as the effect of the amendments on efficiency, competition and
capital formation. 91 Some of the costs and benefits stem from the statutory mandates of
Title V and Title VI, while others are affected by the discretion we exercise in revising
our rules to reflect this mandate. These two types of costs and benefits may not be
entirely separable to the extent our discretion is exercised to realize the benefits that we
believe were intended by Title V and Title VI. We request comment on all aspects of the
economic effects, such as the costs and benefits, of the amendments that we are
proposing. We particularly appreciate comments that distinguish between the economic
effects that are attributed to the statutory mandate itself and the economic effects that are
the result of policy choices made by the Commission in implementing the statutory
mandate.

baseline for our consideration of the effects on efficiency, competition and capital
91

Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when making rules under the
Exchange Act, to consider the impact on competition that the rules would have, and prohibits the

appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 78w(a). Further, Section 2(b) of the
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [17 U.S.C. 78c(f)] require
the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine
whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the
protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition and capital
formation.

formation, is the state of the market as well as market practices prior to the JOBS Act.
Prior to the JOBS Act, issuers were required to register their equity securities with the
Commission upon reaching 500 holders of record and total assets of $10 million, and
were allowed to terminate registration or suspend the duty to file with the Commission
when the number of holders of record had fallen below 300. However, Exchange Act
Rules 12h-1(f) and 12h-1(g) permitted issuers to exclude stock options issued under
written compensatory benefit plans under certain conditions from the registration
requirements of Section 12(g).
The JOBS Act raised the thresholds at which an issuer is required to register a
class of equity securities with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g), provided that
persons holding certain employee compensation plan securities need not be counted when
determining whether an issuer is required to register, and raised the thresholds at which
banks and bank holding companies are permitted to terminate registration or suspend
reporting obligations with the Commission. These statutory changes made by the JOBS
Act went into effect as soon as the JOBS Act was signed into law. As a result of the
JOBS Act, some banks and bank holding companies were newly eligible to terminate
registration or suspend reporting, and as of June 30, 2014, we estimate that more than 90
have elected to do so. 92 We estimate that there are approximately 500 banks and bank
holding companies that currently report to the Commission,93 of which some may be
eligible to terminate registration under the JOBS Act but have elected to continue

92

The Commission staff derived this estimate of the number of banks and bank holding companies
that have elected to terminate registration or suspend reporting by analyzing Form 15 filings on
EDGAR. Commission staff is continuing to monitor such filings.

The Commission staff derived this estimate by analyzing annual filings submitted to the
Commission during calendar year 2013.

reporting. We are proposing to amend specified Exchange Act rules to reflect the new,
higher threshold for banks and bank holding companies under Section 12(g)(4) and
Section 15(d)(1). For those banks and bank holding companies that would be eligible to
terminate registration under Section 12(g), the proposed rules set forth procedural
accommodations that are available to other issuers under current rules to accelerate the
process.
The proposed rules would also permit savings and loan holding companies to use
the same, higher thresholds for registration, termination of registration and suspension of
the reporting obligation that apply to banks and bank holding companies. There are
approximately 125 savings and loan holding companies that currently report to the
Commission. 94 As we explain in more detail below, we estimate that approximately 90
would be eligible to terminate registration or suspend reporting under the proposed rules.
In addition, the proposed rules would apply the definition of “accredited investor”
in Securities Act Rule 501(a) in making determinations under Exchange Act Section
12(g)(1). Finally, the proposed rules would revise the definition of “held of record” and
establish the scope of a non-exclusive safe harbor for issuers to rely on when determining
whether securities were received pursuant to an employee compensation plan in
transactions exempted from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities
Act or did not involve a sale within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act.
The proposed safe harbor would rely on the definition of “compensatory benefit plan” in
Securities Act Rule 701 and the conditions in Securities Act Rule 701(c).
We considered alternative definitions of “employee compensation plan.” We also

94

Id.

43

considered whether to provide additional guidance with respect to the determination of
accredited investor status when establishing the number of holders of record. These
decisions may affect how a non-reporting issuer counts its holders of record for the
purpose of the registration thresholds under the Exchange Act; hence it could affect
whether an issuer can remain a non-reporting issuer. However, due to limited availability
of shareholder information on these non-reporting issuers, we are unable to quantify the
number of non-reporting issuers that might be affected by these decisions.
B.

Analysis of the Proposed Rules

The proposal would affect registrants generally, and banks, bank holding
companies and savings and loan holding companies specifically, as well as non-reporting
issuers, employees and other investors. We analyze the costs and benefits associated
with the proposed rules below.
Increased thresholds for banks and bank holding companies
The JOBS Act amended Sections 12(g) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act to raise the
thresholds at which banks and bank holding companies may terminate registration or
suspend their obligations to file reports with the Commission to 1,200 holders of record.
These changes were effective immediately upon the enactment of the JOBS Act, and
banks and bank holding companies may rely on the amended provisions to terminate
registration or suspend their reporting obligations. However, under the statute, banks and
bank holding companies that want to use the higher threshold must wait 90 days after
filing a certification with the Commission that the number of holders of record is less
than 1,200 persons to terminate their Section 12(g) registration and cease filing reports
required by Section 13(a) and must wait until the first day of the fiscal year to suspend
any Section 15(d) reporting obligations. Our existing rules afford issuers with procedural
44

accommodations that let them suspend their reporting obligations immediately upon the
filing of a certification on Form 15. To make these procedural accommodations
applicable to banks and bank holding companies at the higher threshold, we are
proposing to revise Exchange Act Rules 12g-2, 12g-3, 12g-4 and 12h-3 to reflect the
1,200 holders threshold for banks and bank holding companies, which would permit
banks and bank holding companies to rely on the rules to cease reporting during a fiscal
year, rather than wait the prescribed 90 days or until the end of the reporting year. This
would reduce issuer compliance and reporting costs during the fiscal year the issuer
ceased reporting, but would also accelerate the loss of investor access to current
information about the issuer. The proposed changes also would harmonize the statutory
and regulatory thresholds and lessen potential confusion that could arise from the
differences in the thresholds contained in the statute and the existing rules.
We estimate that there are approximately 500 banks and bank holding companies
that currently report with the Commission. Many of these reporting issuers have more
than 1,200 holders of record and would not be eligible to cease reporting under the new
thresholds. Out of that 500, 143 reporting banks and bank holding companies have
between 300 and 1,200 holders of record and may be eligible to cease reporting, although
89 of them would have to give up a national exchange listing to do so. Because banks
and bank holding companies remain subject to other regulatory reporting requirements, 95
it is possible that they would continue reporting even if they are eligible to cease
reporting under the Exchange Act. We anticipate that banks and bank holding companies
would weigh the benefits of being a public company against the burden of additional

95

See supra note 41.

disclosure costs, in deciding whether to terminate registration or suspend their reporting
obligation. Commonly cited benefits of being a public company include the ability to
obtain a lower cost of capital for investment and growth, increased liquidity through a
broader shareholder base, and greater ability to finance acquisitions and offer equitybased incentive contracts. 96 Commonly cited costs of being a public company include
the need to comply with increased regulations and regulatory supervision, including
requirements for independent audits, disclosure of information to competitors, loss of
control and ownership dilution. 97
Permitting savings and loan holding companies to use the higher thresholds
We are proposing to apply the 2,000-holders of record threshold for registration to
savings and loan holding companies in revised Exchange Act Rule 12g-1. We are also
proposing to extend the increased thresholds established by Section 601 of the JOBS Act
to savings and loan holding companies by specifically including them in revisions to
Exchange Act Rules 12g-2, 12g-3, 12g-4 and 12h-3 that accommodate banks and bank
holding companies at the higher 1,200 holders of record threshold for termination of

registration or suspension of the duty to file reports. As a result, savings and loan holding
companies would be able to delay registration with the Commission until they reach the
2,000-holder threshold, and savings and loan holding companies with between 300 and
1,199 holders of record would be newly eligible to terminate or suspend their Exchange
Act reporting obligations.
We estimate that approximately 125 savings and loan holding companies had a
class of securities registered pursuant to the Exchange Act as of June 30, 2014; 98 of these
approximately 100 are registered pursuant to Section 12(b). By analyzing the number of
holders of record for these companies, the staff determined that approximately 90 of the
125 savings and loan holding companies would be eligible to terminate registration or
suspend reporting. Most of the newly eligible companies would have to give up a
national securities exchange listing to do so. Because delisting from a national securities
exchange could severely impact the liquidity of traded securities, many of these savings
and loan holding companies may be unwilling to suspend their reporting requirements
even if such an action was available to them. We therefore do not expect many of these
savings and loan holding companies to avail themselves of the extended provisions.
If we do not extend the provisions of Section 601 to savings and loan holding
companies, there would be inconsistent treatment relative to banks and bank holding
companies, resulting in different registration requirements and levels of disclosure for
savings and loan holding companies that provide similar services and are generally
subject to the same regulatory requirements. This could have an adverse impact on their
ability to compete. Alternatively, savings and loan holding companies could seek to
98

The Commission staff derived this estimate by analyzing annual filings submitted to the
Commission.

47

become chartered as banks or bank holding companies and thereby incur associated costs;
this could distort the competitive balance of products and services offered by these
institutions.
Applying consistent treatment between savings and loan holding companies and
banks and bank holding companies would lessen the likelihood of changes to the current
competitive balance between these institutions. Moreover, the potential loss of
information that would otherwise be made public through Exchange Act reporting if the
provisions of Section 601 are extended to savings and loan holding companies would be
mitigated because the savings and loan holding companies would continue to file reports
with banking regulators. 99 As a result, extending the relief to savings and loan holding
companies to provide consistent treatment relative to banks and bank holding companies
may have a positive impact on the overall efficiency of markets served by the potentially
affected institutions.
Definition and safe harbor for securities “held of record”
Section 12(g)(5), as amended by Section 502 of the JOBS Act, excludes from the
definition of “held of record” securities held by persons who received them pursuant to
an employee compensation plan in transactions exempted from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act for purposes of determining whether an
issuer is required to register a class of security pursuant to Section 12(g)(1). Section 503

99

While the proposed rules should have effects on competition by ensuring that savings and loan
holding companies are not put at a disadvantage relative to banks and bank holding companies, the
termination of registration or suspension of reporting by savings and loan holding companies may
lessen the information available to investors and adversely affect efficiency and capital formation
by possibly increasing information asymmetries, monitoring costs, and cost of capital. However,
the impact on efficiency and capital formation may be mitigated to the extent that the reports that
savings and loan holding companies file with banking regulators contain information comparable
to that mandated by the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act.

48

of the JOBS Act directs the Commission to adopt a safe harbor that issuers can use when
making the holder of record determination. By making it easier for non-reporting
companies that issue securities to their employees to remain below the registration and
reporting thresholds in the Exchange Act, the statutory changes could benefit issuers by
allowing them to better control how and when they become subject to the reporting
requirements, while continuing to use securities to compensate employees. These
changes could be particularly beneficial for smaller or cash-constrained issuers that could
more easily issue securities to their employees as a form of compensation without being
subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements and the associated compliance costs.
However, for these issuers, the potential registration of a class of securities and the
associated reporting may be delayed, adversely impacting investors, including
employees, who otherwise might benefit from the information provided through
Exchange Act reporting requirements. As a result, the proposed rules regarding the
definition of “held of record” and the scope of the safe harbor could have an impact on
the potential costs and benefits to the affected issuers and their investors by affecting
areas such as the ease of relying upon the statutory exemption, the number of nonreporting companies able to forestall registration, and the amount of information
available to investors in those issuers.
Instead of establishing a new definition for the term “employee compensation
plan,” we are proposing to amend the definition of “held of record” to permit an issuer to
exclude securities held by persons who received them pursuant to an employee
compensation plan in transactions exempted from the registration requirements of Section
5 of the Securities Act, or not involving a sale within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) of
the Securities Act. Proposing to exclude securities issued to employees in transactions
49

that do not involve a sale under Section 2(a)(3) from the definition of “held of record” for
purposes of determining an issuer’s obligation to register a class of securities under the
Exchange Act would be beneficial to issuers who rely on the “no sale” theory when
making compensatory grants to certain employees. Excluding such “no sale” securities
could reduce the number of holders of record of an issuer and potentially delay required
Exchange Act reporting.
We are also proposing to establish a non-exclusive safe harbor that relies on
Securities Act Rule 701(c) and the definition of “compensatory benefit plan” in that rule
to assist issuers in making the determination of whether holders of securities received
pursuant to an employee compensation plan may be excluded. We believe that relying on
an existing definition that is already understood by market participants would make it
easier for issuers to avail themselves of this safe harbor than if we proposed a new
alternative definition. The proposed non-exclusive safe harbor relies upon the conditions
in existing Rule 701(c). While generally broad in application, the conditions in Rule
701(c) provide limitations, such as requiring that securities be sold under a compensatory
benefit plan, that the plan be written, that the plan be established by the issuer or certain
specified related entities and that participation be limited to employees and certain other
specified persons. Although we are unable to quantify the impact of proposing this safe
harbor because we cannot measure the number of issuers that would rely on the safe
harbor, we can qualitatively assess the proposed safe harbor’s impact. A safe harbor that
applies the familiar concepts of existing Rule 701(c) should create efficiencies in
applying the safe harbor and avoid conflicts with existing rules, which should reduce
costs more significantly for smaller issuers seeking to rely upon the proposed safe harbor.
Foreign private issuers would be able to rely on the proposed safe harbor when
50

making their determination of the number of U.S. resident holders under Exchange Act
Rule 12g3-2(a). While we are unable to quantify the number of foreign private issuers
that would be impacted, we acknowledge that it may allow some foreign private issuers
to delay registering with and reporting to the Commission. The considerations about cost
and benefit tradeoffs for foreign private issuers would be analogous to the ones discussed
above for domestic issuers.
Use of the term “accredited investor” in Exchange Act Section 12(g)
Section 501 of the JOBS Act raises the threshold number of holders of record at
which an issuer is required to register a class of equity securities under the Exchange Act
to 2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not accredited investors. The provision was
effective upon enactment of the JOBS Act. In order for an issuer to rely on the new,
higher threshold established by the JOBS Act, the issuer will need to be able to make
accredited investor determinations if it has more than 500 holders of record.
We propose that the definition of “accredited investor” as specified in Securities
Act Rule 501(a) determined as of the last day of the fiscal year rather than at the time of
sale of the securities apply when making determinations under Exchange Act Section
12(g)(1). Issuers are familiar with this definition, which should facilitate compliance.
Developing an alternative definition for purposes of Section 12(g)(1) could impose costs
on issuers by requiring them to familiarize themselves with, and apply, a new and
different standard. We are unable to estimate how many issuers would be impacted by
using the Rule 501(a) definition of “accredited investor” as compared to an alternative
definition. We acknowledge that not providing specific guidance or rules on how to
confirm a security holder’s status as an accredited investor for purposes of determining
holders of record could result in some uncertainty for issuers.
51

Some commenters have recommended that the Commission address potential
compliance issues related to the accredited investor threshold by providing a safe harbor
for determining accredited investor status. 100 We could, among other things, permit an
issuer to rely on an annual affirmation of accredited investor status by the investor or rely
on an ongoing basis on information regarding accredited investor status received by the
issuer at the time the securities were initially issued to the investor or at the time the
securities were most recently issued to the investor, or permit issuers to otherwise rely on
information previously provided by an investor.
Addressing potential compliance issues relating to the use of “accredited investor”
in Section 12(g) could increase efficiency by providing issuers with a prescribed process
to determine and update the accredited investor status of their investors. For example, a
safe harbor that permits an issuer to rely on an annual affirmation of accredited investor
status by the investor, other information obtained by the issuer or on a combination of a
certification and other information would likely be less costly than requiring an issuer to
establish a reasonable basis for its determination through other means. These methods,
however, may be less accurate in establishing whether the investor is accredited.
Alternatively, a safe harbor that permits an issuer to rely on an ongoing basis on
information previously obtained relating to accredited investors status, such as allowing
reliance on information obtained by the issuer at the time the securities were initially
issued to the investor or at the time the securities were most recently issued to the
investor would likely be even less costly than requiring the issuer to seek an annual
affirmation of accredited investor status by the investor or to establish a reasonable belief

100

See, e.g., letters from ABA, Foley & Lardner and NYCBA.

52

that the investor is an accredited investor, but could also lead to more outdated
information. Permitting issuers to rely on inaccurate information to determine accredited
investor status could result in issuers with more than 500 non-accredited investors failing
to register and leaving investors in those issuers with less information and protection
under the federal securities laws. These costs may be mitigated if the safe harbor
specified time limits on the permitted use of the information or if the safe harbor were
conditioned upon the issuer not having information that the previously obtained
information was incorrect, unreliable or had changed.
Another alternative would be a safe harbor that permits an issuer to rely on a third
party certification for determining the accredited investor status of investors. We do not
have adequate information about third party certification providers and the characteristics
of this industry to assess this alternative in terms of reliability and cost of the provided
certification services. To the extent that reputational concerns would incentivize the third
party certification providers to perform reliable and updated due diligence, third party
certification could potentially provide accurate information at a cost that economies of
scale may lessen.

In this release we have discussed the anticipated costs and benefits of the

proposed rules. We request data to quantify the costs and the value of the benefits
described throughout this release. We seek estimates of these costs and benefits, as well
as any costs and benefits not described, that may result from the adoption of these
proposed amendments. We also request comments on the qualitative benefits and costs

VI.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
Certain provisions of our disclosure rules and forms applicable to issuers contain

“collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 101 The hours and costs associated with preparing and filing forms
and retaining records constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by the collection of
information requirements. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not
required to respond to, a collection of information requirement unless it displays a
currently valid Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) control number.
Compliance with the information collections is mandatory. Responses to the information
collections are not kept confidential and there is no mandatory retention period for the
collections of information.
The amendments proposed today do not alter the disclosure requirements set forth
in the rules and forms; however, the JOBS Act amendments to Exchange Act Sections
12(g) and 15(d) and the proposed amendments to our rules to reflect those statutory
amendments are expected to immaterially decrease the number of filings made pursuant
to these rules and forms. Exchange Act Rules 12g-1, 12g-2, 12g-3, 12g-4 and 12h-3 set
forth when an issuer’s securities are required to be registered and the procedures for a
registrant to terminate its registration or suspend its duty to file reports. The proposed
amendments would provide thresholds that issuers may rely on when determining their
registration and reporting obligations and would allow savings and loan holding
companies to use the same registration and termination of registration or suspension of

101

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

54

reporting thresholds that apply to banks and bank holding companies. 102 Exchange Act
Section 12(g)(5) and the proposed amendment to Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1 also exclude
securities received pursuant to certain employee compensation plans from the
determination of when an issuer is required to initially register with the Commission.
These changes would reduce the number of registrants required to continue filing with
the Commission and also reduce the number of issuers required to initially register a class
of securities. 103 For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that the amendments would not
materially reduce the number of filings received, nor would the changes affect the
incremental burden or cost per filing.
The titles for the affected collections of information are:
(1) “Form 10” (OMB Control No. 3235-0064); 104
(2) “Form 20-F” (OMB Control No. 3235-0288); 105
(3) “Form 40-F” (OMB Control No. 3235-0381); 106
(4) “Form 10-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0063); 107
(5) “Form 10-Q” (OMB Control No. 3235-0070); 108
(6) “Form 8-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0060); 109
102

We are proposing to amend Rule 12g-1 to reflect the new higher thresholds in Section 12(g)(1)
and to establish an increased registration threshold for savings and loan holding companies.

103

The changes to Rule 12g5-1 are expected to affect the number of issuers required to register with
the Commission; however, we do not have access to data to support an estimate of the number of
issuers that will not be required to file reports based on the JOBS Act amendments and our
proposed implementation of such amendments. Due to the lack of data, for PRA purposes we are
not intending to provide a reduced estimate of the number of issuers.

(8) “Schedule 14C” (OMB Control No. 3235-0057); 111
(9) “Form 15” (OMB Control No. 3235-0167).
The forms were adopted under the Exchange Act and set forth the disclosure
requirements for periodic, current and other reports required to be filed by issuers
registered with the Commission.
We estimate that there are approximately 625 Exchange Act registrants that are
bank holding companies or savings and loan holding companies. We estimate that
approximately 90 bank holding companies have filed Forms 15 to terminate or suspend
their reporting obligations under the Exchange Act based on the statutory changes in the
JOBS Act. 112 We further estimate that approximately 90 savings and loan holding
companies or similar entities with fewer than 1,200 holders of record would be eligible to
file a Form 15 after our proposed changes. To put these numbers in context, the current
PRA estimate for the number of annual reports on Form 10-K filed annually is 8,137.
Because the proposed rule amendments do not affect our estimates of the burden or cost
per filing and we do not anticipate a material decrease in the number of filings as a result
of the proposed rule amendments, we are not submitting revised burden estimates for
these collections of information to OMB for review in accordance with the PRA and its
implementing regulations at this time. 113

112

After the JOBS Act became effective, we saw an increase in the number of termination and
suspension of registrations by bank holding companies. We do not anticipate a similar rate of
deregistration for bank holding companies after revising our rules to reflect the new, higher
deregistration threshold.

We request comment on our approach and the accuracy of the current estimates.
Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), the Commission solicits comments to: (1) evaluate
whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the
functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2)
evaluate the accuracy of the Commission’s estimate of burden of the collection of
information; (3) determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility and
clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) evaluate whether there are ways to
minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are required to
respond, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of
information technology.
Persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements
should direct the comments to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk
Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, and send a copy to Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090, with reference
to File No. S7-12-14. Requests for materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with
regard to these collections of information should be in writing, refer to File No. S7-12-14,
and be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services,
100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-2736. OMB is required to make a decision
concerning the collection of information between 30 and 60 days after publication of this
release. Consequently, a comment to OMB is assured of having its full effect if OMB
receives it within 30 days of publication.

SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT FAIRNESS ACT
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996

(“SBREFA”), 114 the Commission must advise OMB as to whether a proposed regulation
constitutes a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if
adopted, it results or is likely to result in:
•

an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more (either in the form
of an increase or a decrease);

•

a major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or

•

significant adverse effects on competition, investment or innovation.

If a rule is “major,” its effectiveness will generally be delayed for 60 days pending
Congressional review.
We request comment on whether our proposed amendments would be a “major
rule” for purposes of SBREFA. We solicit comment and empirical data on:
•

the potential effect on the U.S. economy on an annual basis;

•

any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries;
and

•

any potential effect on competition, investment or innovation.

We request those submitting comments to provide empirical data and other factual
support for their views to the extent possible.
VIII. INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS
The Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis in
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603. This Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis relates to
114

Pub. L. No. 104-121, Tit. II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

58

the proposed amendments to Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rules 3b-4, 12g1, 12g-2, 12g-3, 12g-4, 12g5-1, and 12h-3.
A.

Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action

The primary reason for, and objective of, the proposed amendments is to
implement Title V and Title VI of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act directs the Commission
to issue rules to implement the changes and specifically charges the Commission with
amending the definition of “held of record” and establishing a safe harbor for the
determination relating to “employee compensation plan” securities. We are proposing
rules that would revise existing rules to reflect the new, higher Exchange Act registration,
termination of registration and suspension of reporting thresholds for banks and bank
holding companies, apply the definition of “accredited investor” in Securities Act Rule
501(a) in making determinations under Exchange Act Section 12(g)(1), revise the
definition of “held of record” to exclude certain securities held by persons who received
them pursuant to employee compensation plans, and establish a non-exclusive safe harbor
for issuers to follow when determining whether those securities are “held of record.” We
are also proposing to provide relief from the Exchange Act registration requirements for
savings and loan holding companies by applying the same thresholds to savings and loan
holding companies that apply to banks and bank holding companies. Permitting savings
and loan holding companies to register, terminate registration and suspend reporting
using the same thresholds as banks and bank holding companies would provide consistent
treatment across depository institutions. Revising the definition and providing a nonexclusive safe harbor to issuers relating to the determination of securities “held of record”
would further assist issuers in determining which holders of record they are required to
count under the registration requirements of Exchange Act Section 12(g).
59

B.

Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Rules

For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, an investment company is a small
entity if it, together with other investment companies in the same group of related
investment companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most
recent fiscal year. 115 Exchange Act Rule 0-10(a) 116 defines an entity, other than an
investment company, to be a “small business” or “small organization” if it had total
assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year. We estimate that
there are approximately 900 issuers that are required to file with the Commission, other
than investment companies, that may be considered small entities.
The proposed rules establishing the use of the Securities Act Rule 501(a)
definition of “accredited investor” under Exchange Act Section 12(g)(1) and amending
the definition of “held of record” to exclude certain securities held by persons who
received them pursuant to employee compensation plans and establishing a non-exclusive
safe harbor for issuers to follow when determining whether those securities are “held of
record” may affect small issuers relying on the revised rules and safe harbor to determine
the number of holders of record. While an issuer is not required to register a class of
equity securities pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act until the issuer’s total
assets exceed $10 million, a small business or small organization may rely on the rules
when determining to whom to issue securities and whether to compensate employees
with securities. By providing guidance on the meaning of the term “accredited investor”
in the Exchange Act context, the proposed rules may facilitate private offerings and the
ability of an issuer to determine their registration and reporting obligations. By excluding
115

17 CFR 270.0-10(a).

116

17 CFR 240.0-10(a).

60

certain employee compensation securities from the definition of “held of record,” the
proposed rules would facilitate the use of equity compensation by small issuers, thereby
helping them to preserve cash and giving them greater ability to determine when the
Exchange Act Section 12(g) registration obligation would be triggered.
We cannot estimate the number of small entities affected by these proposed rules.
By definition, they are not yet subject to Section 12(g) registration and reporting
requirements, which are triggered by the issuer having total assets exceeding $10 million
as of the last day of its fiscal year. We do not otherwise have information about the
number of shareholders at small entities, including those who have received securities as
a result of employee compensation plans. We request comment on the number of small
entities that would be impacted by our proposals, including any available empirical data.
C.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements
When determining whether an issuer must register under Section 12(g)(1), the

issuer would be permitted to rely on the proposed rules. The proposed use of the
Securities Act Rule 501(a) definition of “accredited investor” and safe harbor under the
proposed amendment to the definition of “held of record” would assist an issuer in
determining the number of holders of record. In order for an issuer to rely on the safe
harbor, the securities would need to be issued in a transaction exempt from, or not subject
to, the registration requirements and satisfy the requirements of Rule 701(c), which
includes the requirement that the securities be offered or sold under a written
compensatory benefit plan or written compensation contract. In addition, issuers seeking
to rely upon the safe harbor may need to maintain records to help establish their
compliance with the safe harbor conditions. We are not aware of any other

61

recordkeeping or compliance requirements associated with the proposed definition and
safe harbor.
The proposed rules and amendments affecting banks, bank holding companies
and savings and loan holding companies would not add any new reporting, recordkeeping
or other compliance requirements on those entities and we are not aware of any bank,
bank holding company, or savings and loan holding company registrants with less than
$5 million in assets. The proposed rules would raise the thresholds relating to
registration for those entities and reduce their compliance burdens.
D.

Duplicative, Overlapping or Conflicting Federal Rules

The Commission believes that there are no rules that duplicate, overlap or conflict
with the proposed rules or amendments.
E.

Significant Alternatives

Pursuant to Section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 117 the Commission
must consider certain types of alternatives, including: (1) the establishment of differing
compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources
available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation or simplification of
compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (3) the use of
performance rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the
rule, or any part of the rule, for small entities.
We are proposing that the current definition of “accredited investor” in Securities
Act Rule 501(a) apply in making determinations under Exchange Act Rule 12g-1(b)(1).
We could develop a new definition of “accredited investor” for purposes of Section

117

5 U.S.C. 603(c).

62

12(g)(1); however, given the prevalence of the use of Regulation D for exempt offerings,
many issuers are familiar with and rely upon the definition in Rule 501(a). The increased
registration threshold established by the JOBS Act is intended to permit issuers, including
small entities, to defer Exchange Act registration until issuers have a larger shareholder
base. Because proposed Rule 12g-1(b)(1) is intended to facilitate an issuer’s ability to
make the determination of when it is required to register, we believe use of the familiar
Rule 501(a) definition of “accredited investor” will further this regulatory objective for
all issuers, including small entities.
The proposed amendment to the definition of “held of record” and related safe
harbor, if adopted, would apply to all issuers, including small entities, that choose to
exclude securities held by persons who received them pursuant to employee
compensation plans in certain exempt transactions or transactions not involving a sale
within the meaning of Securities Act Section 2(a)(3). The proposed amendment and safe
harbor help define the contours of an exemption from registration for issuers that might
otherwise cross the Section 12(g) registration thresholds.
The proposed rules are intended to permit issuers, including small entities, to
exclude certain securities from the determination and to assist issuers in making that
determination by clarifying and simplifying requirements for all entities. Establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements relating to employee compensation plan
securities or accredited investor determinations for small entities could complicate the
rules and make them more difficult to apply as those issuers grow, cease to be small
entities, and are required to determine whether they must register with the

63

Commission.118 With respect to the use of performance standards rather than design
standards, we note that the holder of record threshold is a statutorily created design
standard, requiring issuers to register if their holders of record coupled with their total
assets cross the threshold. As we are modifying the definition of “held of record” and
clarifying the determination of “accredited investor” under this statutory design standard,
we did not evaluate whether a performance standard would be more useful.
F.

Solicitation of Comment

We are soliciting comments regarding this analysis. We request comment on the
number of small entities that would be subject to the rules and whether the proposed rules
would have any effects that have not been discussed. We request that commenters
describe the nature of any effects on small entities subject to the rules and provide
empirical data to support the nature and extent of the effects.
