In the Matter of
LOUIS V. SCHOOLER

ORDER DIRECTING FILINGS
On August 23, 2016, Law Judge Carol Fox Foelak issued an initial decision with respect
to Louis V. Schooler. The initial decision barred Schooler from associating with any broker,
dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or
nationally recognized statistical rating organization and from participating in an offering of
penny stock. On October 11, 2016, Schooler’s counsel filed with the Commission a document
that appears to be a judgment of death regarding Louis V. Schooler issued by a Tahitian court.
At this time, the Commission requests the parties’ views as to whether, in light of the
document filed with the Commission by Schooler’s counsel, this proceeding should be
dismissed, a finality order should be issued, or the Commission should follow some other
procedure, consistent with the Rules of Practice, with respect to the proceeding.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the parties submit filings on this issue, not to exceed
five pages, by October 28, 2016.
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.

Secretary
