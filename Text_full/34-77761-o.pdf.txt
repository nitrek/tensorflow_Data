current and accurate information concerning the securities of Giant Resources, Inc. (CIK
No. 1327926), an Alberta corporation with its principal place of business listed as
Calgary, Alberta, Canada with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol
GIREF, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended December 31,
2012. On August 18, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation
Finance to Giant Resources, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing
obligations, and Giant Resources, Inc. received the delinquency letter on August 31,
2015, but failed to cure its delinquencies.
