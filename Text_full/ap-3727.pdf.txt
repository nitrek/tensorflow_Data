In the Matter of
DEVON C. MCLEAN

ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE AND
STAYING PROCEEDING

On March 1, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. On March 10, I postponed the hearing in this matter, scheduled a telephonic prehearing
conference for March 21, and directed the Division of Enforcement to provide an update on the
status of service of the OIP on Respondent. Devon C. McLean, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release
No. 3696, 2016 SEC LEXIS 927. Thereafter, the Division filed proof of service establishing that
Respondent was personally served with the OIP on March 17, 2016.
During the March 21 prehearing conference, the parties agreed in principle to a
settlement on all major terms. Based on that agreement, the Division submitted a motion to stay
the proceeding. Given that the parties agreed in principle to a settlement during the conference
and that a stay was also discussed, I construe the Division’s motion as a joint motion to stay in
accordance with Rule of Practice 161(c)(2)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(c)(2)(i).
For good cause shown, it is ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED, and the
proceeding is STAYED, subject to compliance with Rule of Practice 161(c)(2), requiring that
this office be notified promptly if any of the requirements of the rule are not met.
