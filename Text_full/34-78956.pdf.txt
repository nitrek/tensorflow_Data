I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and

Commission, 17 C.F.R. § 201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement of these proceedings initiated
against Respondent on September 16, 2016, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order
Making Findings and Revoking Registration of Securities Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to As Seen On TV, Inc.(“Order”), as set forth below.

ASTV (CIK No. 1432967) is a Florida corporation located in Austin, Texas.

ASTV failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1
and 13a-13 thereunder because it has not filed any periodic reports with the Commission
since the period ended December 31, 2014.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), registration of each class of Respondent’s
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be, and hereby is, revoked.2
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
