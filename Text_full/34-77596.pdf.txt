OF 1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER

Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-anddesist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against INTL FCStone Inc. (“INTL FCStone,” the “Company,” or
“Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of
Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of
these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which
the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the
Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted,
Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to
Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-andDesist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that1:
Summary
1.
This matter arises from INTL FCStone’s violations of the reporting, books and records,
and internal control provisions of the Exchange Act. Between fiscal year 2010 and June 30, 2013,
INTL FCStone overstated its operating revenues by $10 million and its net income by $6 million as a
result of accounting errors in recording and reporting over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative trading gains
at a subsidiary, INTL FCStone Markets, LLC (“IFM”). INTL FCStone’s internal accounting controls
failed to timely prevent or detect the accounting errors. In January 2014, INTL FCStone restated its
financial statements, determined that certain of its controls were not designed or operating effectively,
and reported the existence of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”)
as of September 30, 2013.
Respondent
2.
INTL FCStone, a Delaware corporation based in New York, New York, provides
execution and advisory services in commodities, currencies and international securities. INTL
FCStone’s common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the
Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “INTL.”
INTL FCStone Delays Filing its Fiscal Year 2013 Form 10-K
3.
On December 17, 2013, INTL FCStone disclosed that it would delay the filing of its
Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, as a result of errors in the reconciliation of
IFM’s accounting records to its back office system. The Company also disclosed that it was evaluating
the effect these errors may have on previously filed consolidated financial statements and continuing to
assess the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and ICFR for current and prior periods.
4.
In its fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K filed on January 15, 2014, INTL FCStone restated its
consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, restated certain financial information
for fiscal year 2010, restated quarterly fiscal year 2012 financial information, revised its quarterly fiscal
year 2013 financial information to correct immaterial errors, and disclosed a material weakness in ICFR
related to accurate and timely accounting for certain over-the-counter derivative trading activities at
September 30, 2013. The effect of the restatements on INTL FCStone’s pre-tax income (loss) is
reflected in the following chart (dollars in millions).

The revisions to INTL FCStone’s pre-tax income (loss) increased INTL FCStone’s third quarter
fiscal year 2013 from $4.1 million to $4.9 million (a $0.8 million, or a 16.3% understatement as
originally reported). Additionally, INTL FCStone corrected errors related to intercompany physical
sales which were not correctly eliminated. These errors overstated INTL FCStone’s fiscal year 2011
and 2012 sales of physical commodities and cost of sales by $1.3 billion (1.9% of sales) and $2.6
billion (3.6% of sales), respectively. Additionally, these errors overstated the first, second and third
quarter FY 2013 sales of physical commodities and cost of sales of 1.3%, 7.7%, and 10.6%,
respectively (based on sales).
IFM’s Asset Reconciliation Process
5.
IFM used an internally-developed application to capture, store and report master records
(i.e., customer/broker) and transactional data (i.e., quotes, orders, trades, etc.) for its OTC derivatives
trading business. IFM refers to this system as “ETT,” which stands for Electronic Trade Ticket.
Information from ETT was a part of the system of books, records and accounts that INTL FCStone
relied upon to prepare its consolidated financial statements. At month-end, IFM’s accounting
department reconciled information extracted from ETT to the activity recorded in the general ledger
(the “Asset Reconciliation Process”).
6.
IFM relied on a manual Asset Reconciliation Process, which was performed and
reviewed by the same person, the IFM controller. As a part of the Asset Reconciliation Process each
month, the IFM controller manually ran queries to identify and extract transactional data from ETT,
converted the extracted data to an Excel spreadsheet, and then reconciled the activity in ETT to the
activity recorded in IFM’s general ledger. IFM’s controls and procedures failed to segregate the duties
between the preparer and the reviewer of the Asset Reconciliation Process.
INTL FCStone Discovers the Accounting Errors
7.
During its audit of INTL FCStone’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended
September 30, 2013, INTL FCStone’s independent auditor questioned an item on the reconciliation
between ETT and the general ledger. INTL FCStone’s prompt investigation led to a more fulsome
3

examination of the Asset Reconciliation Process and caused management to conclude that its ICFR
related to accurate and timely accounting for certain over-the-counter derivative trading activities were
not reasonably designed to detect errors in recording trading gains to the general ledger.
8.
During its review, INTL FCStone identified errors relating to differences between
ETT’s balances and the amounts that had been recorded in the general ledger at period-end.
Specifically, INTL FCStone discovered : (1) a $4.0 million overstatement of trading gains on the
transfer of certain cotton derivative positions between IFM’s internal trading books during fiscal year
2011 (the “Cotton Positions Error”); (2) a $1.3 million and a $3.0 million overstatement of trading
gains on certain energy derivative positions (the “ClearPort Error”); (3) a $1.1 million understatement
of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Hanley (no income statement impact) and a $0.7 million
overstatement of trading gains on certain derivative positions acquired as a part of the Hanley Group
acquisition (the “Hanley Error”); and (4) certain other errors that INTL FCStone corrected as a part of
the restatement (the “Other Errors”).
The Cotton Positions Error and the ClearPort Error
9.
The Asset Reconciliation Process failed to capture valuation errors related to certain
trades that were moved between IFM’s market-maker and back-to-back trading books. “MarketMaker” accounts include positions that expose the Company to market risk. “Back-to-back” accounts
are generally fully hedged and managed to generate no significant profit or loss.
10.
In November 2010, certain cotton positions in two market-maker accounts were
transferred to IFM’s back-to-back trading book. At the time the positions were moved, the value of the
transferred positions reflected a $4.0 million loss. The accounting department did not properly account
for the losses associated with the transferred cotton positions, which caused a $4.0 million
overstatement of trading gains for fiscal year 2011.
11.
In April 2011, four accounts with OTC derivatives positions that were cleared through
CME ClearPort and characterized as “back-to-back” accounts were reclassified to “market-maker”
accounts. At the end of April 2011, IFM recognized the change in the value of its market-maker
accounts as trading gains for the month. However, in calculating the net change of its market-maker
accounts, IFM erroneously considered the March 31, 2011 value of the four ClearPort accounts to be
zero rather than $1.3 million, thereby creating a $1.3 million overstatement of trading gains in fiscal
year 2011.
12.
In subsequent months, IFM erroneously double-counted gains associated with the four
ClearPort accounts. Because the operations department did not notify the accounting department about
the ClearPort account reclassification, the ClearPort Error accounts were improperly included in two
separately-generated manual revenue computations. In May 2013, the IFM controller discovered that
certain adjustments to record revenue associated with these accounts had been recorded backwards. In
response, the IFM controller made an adjustment to correct year-to-date fiscal year 2013 revenues.
Corresponding adjustments, however, were not made to correct a $3.0 million overstatement of
revenues related to fiscal years 2011 and 2012.
4

13.
Two factors contributed to the ClearPort Error. First, existing controls were not
designed to ensure that a change in classification of accounts from back-to-back to market-maker, or
vice versa, was communicated to the accounting department. Second, controls over the reconciliation
between trading system data and the general ledger and the review thereof were not designed to detect
errors timely in recording trading gains to the general ledger.
The Hanley Error
14.
On July 1, 2010, INTL FCStone acquired Chicago-based Hanley Group of companies, a
trading firm that specialized in complex OTC structured products. Prior to the acquisition, one of
Hanley’s companies, HGC Trading, was a customer of IFM. IFM valued its derivative positions with
HGC Trading within ETT. HGC Trading independently valued these same positions using HGC
Trading’s internal system, known as Option 1. Because ETT and Option 1 used different assumptions
and valuation methodologies, IFM and HGC Trading maintained different valuations for the same
derivative positions.
15.
During the pre-acquisition due diligence, the risk department determined that HGC
Trading’s valuation exceeded IFM’s by $1.1 million. However, the purchase accounting of the Hanley
acquisition erroneously used the Option 1 valuations instead of the ETT valuations and therefore failed
to properly account for the valuation differences, which caused INTL FCStone to overstate the value of
the derivatives and understate goodwill by $1.1 million.
16.
INTL FCStone also failed to account for changes in values of the derivative positions
between the acquisition date and September 1, 2010, when IFM transferred HGC Trading’s positions to
IFM’s accounting records. By September 2010, the valuation difference between the two systems had
increased by $0.7 million. Consequently, INTL FCStone’s revenues were overstated by an additional
$0.7 million.
Other Errors
17.
In addition to the above misstatements, INTL FCStone corrected certain immaterial
errors with respect to the impact on the intercompany physical precious metal sales which it had not
correctly eliminated for the consolidated income statements, resulting in a gross-up of physical
commodities and costs of sales of physical commodities for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 as well as
interim quarters within fiscal years 2012 and 2013. As a result of these errors, INTL FCStone’s fiscal
year 2011 and 2012 sales of physical commodities and cost of sales were overstated by $1.3 billion
(1.9% of sales) and $2.6 billion (3.6% of sales), respectively.

18.
In determining to accept the Respondent’s Offer, the Commission considered the
remedial acts undertaken by INTL FCStone.
