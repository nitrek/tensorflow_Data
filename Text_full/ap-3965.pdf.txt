SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On June 15, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A hearing is scheduled to commence on July 13, 2016.
On June 22, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration establishing that
Respondents were served with the OIP by June 20, 2016, in accordance with 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(ii). Accordingly, Respondents’ answers to the OIP were due by July 5, 2016.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a)-(b), .220(b). To date, no Respondent except for Advanced
Life Sciences Holdings, Inc., has answered the OIP.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that Respondents Anoteros, Inc., Emperial Americas, Inc.,
Nord Resources Corporation, and UNR Holdings, Inc., shall SHOW CAUSE by July 18, 2016,
why this proceeding should not be determined against them due to their failures to file answers
or otherwise defend this proceeding. If these Respondents fail to respond to this order, they will
be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against them, and the registrations of
their securities will be revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
It is further ORDERED that the hearing scheduled to begin on July 13, 2016, is
POSTPONED sine die, and a telephonic prehearing conference shall be held at 3:00 p.m. Eastern
on July 20, 2016.
