Policy Number: 9,055
Approved by: City Manager
Effective Date: December 16, 2012
Department: Human Resources

Compensation Administration Policy
Policy Statement
The City of Spruce Grove believes in compensating its employees in a manner that rewards
individual performance, while maintaining internal equity and external competitiveness. This
policy will outline one aspect of total compensation – salary administration.

Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to assist employees in understanding the manner and principles by
which salaries are administered and adjusted and to help supervisors translate the results of
performance appraisals into meaningful salary adjustments for each employee.

Responsibilities
Supervisor
Fundamental to the effective and equitable administration of salaries is a valid, accurate and
current position description. A supervisor shall review, update and approve position
descriptions when:
§

A new position is created.

§

A significant change occurs in the position title, new duties, new responsibilities or
reporting relationships.

§

A position becomes vacant.

§

Annually along with the performance appraisal process

City of Spruce Grove | Compensation Administration Policy

7

Human Resources
§

Manage and maintain current job descriptions in accordance with the corporate records
structure

§

Review all updated job descriptions and where responsibilities have changed, review the
classification level

§

Perform market salary reviews

Human Resources Manager
§

Review merit salary adjustments from each General or Department Manager

§

Make recommendations to the City Manager for the approval of salary adjustments

Salary Adjustments
Council Approval
Funds for salary and/or pay adjustments (Market, Merit and COLA) to the compensation system
are subject to the budget approval process by Council.

Market Salary Adjustments
Should unique market conditions indicate that the market salary range for a specific position or
positions within a salary grade differ substantially from the City’s salary range established for
that position, the City Manager may establish an exception to the City's salary ranges.

Market Salary Review
Salary ranges attached to each job at the City of Spruce Grove will be reviewed every two (2)
years in response to external influences (market, economic, etc.) and adjusted where it is
deemed appropriate, fiscally responsible and fiscally possible. The City Manager may approve
market salary adjustments to the salary ranges of the compensation system, in accordance with
the Council approved budget.
Should an upward market adjustment to the salary range be deemed necessary, all permanent
employees, regardless of length of service, shall be eligible for such an increase provided an
employee’s salary is not red-circled.
In the case of an employee who has not yet completed the City’s probation period, the
employee’s salary may be adjusted retroactively upon successful completion of their
probationary period.

Market Salary Adjustments to Salary Ranges Attached to Red-circled
Positions
There shall be no market adjustment to the salary of an employee whose salary has been redcircled.

City of Spruce Grove | Compensation Administration Policy

8

Application of General Salary Increase or Cost of Living Allowance (COLA)
Cost of living adjustments (a percentage) may be made to employee salaries. This can be done
in one of two ways.
§

COLA may be reflected by a percentage increase by which the salary range is
adjusted. For example, if the range is adjusted by 2%, the salaries of employees whose
jobs are classified in that range shall be adjusted by 2% and the increase reflected in
their hourly rate.

§

The second way would be a lump sum payment for the COLA. The salary ranges would
not change and neither would the hourly rate. For example, a 2% COLA lump sum
payment for an employee earning $50,000 annually would be a $1,000 payment, with no
change to the salary range or hourly rate.

Please note the following about COLA lump sum payments regarding LAPP:
§

Lump sum payments meet the LAPP definition of “Variable Pay” and are pensionable
and included in salary for pension purposes.

§

Lump sum payments will not be incorporated in bi-weekly pay base rates

Merit Pay Adjustments
Eligibility for Merit Pay Adjustments
Merit pay adjustments are determined through the performance appraisal process.
Employees with less than 12 months service will be eligible for merit adjustments on a pro-rated
basis.

Merit Pay Adjustments
Merit Pay adjustments will be based on the overall performance rating following the formal
Performance Review process as set out below.

NOTE:

§

Lump sum payments meet the LAPP definition of “Variable Pay” and are pensionable
and included in salary for pension purposes.

§

Lump sum payments will not be incorporated in bi-weekly pay base rates.

§

Lump sum payments may be re-earned based on performance.

There shall be no merit adjustment to the salary of an employee whose performance is
assessed as “Below Expectations” until such time as that employee’s performance is assessed
as "Fully Competent" or better. At that time, at the discretion of the City Manager, an
adjustment may be made. There shall be no retroactivity in any such adjustments.

Amounts of Merit Salary Adjustments
The funding for merit pay is approved by Council as per the budget process. The amount of
merit salary adjustments are determined by the City Manager and are outlined in Schedule “A”
to this policy. Schedule “A” is updated annually after Council approves the budget.

Salary Range Administration
Range Maximum – Exceptions
No employee’s salary, exclusive of any earned lump sum payment for merit performance, shall
exceed the maximum of the range for the job to which the employee has been appointed unless
an exception has been approved by the City Manager.

City of Spruce Grove | Compensation Administration Policy

10

Range Minimum – Exceptions
An employee that lacks the necessary qualifications and experience may be hired at a
developmental salary level, which is below the minimum of the pay range. Otherwise, no
qualified employee's salary may be established below the minimum of the salary range for the
position to which the employee has been appointed.

Salaries on Appointment
General Guidelines
In recognition of directly related experience, the employee may be appointed at a rate above the
minimum of the range, with careful consideration for salary parity within the appointee’s work
unit specifically and within the City of Spruce Grove generally.
The amount of the appointee's salary shall be determined by the City Manager, upon
recommendation by the responsible Manager after consultation with the Human Resources
Manager, but the recommended salary shall normally not exceed the mid-point of the salary
range for the position.
In the case of an appointee who will report directly to the City Manager, the appointment salary
shall be determined by the City Manager. The appointment salary shall normally not exceed the
mid-point of the salary range for the position.

Salaries on Promotion
Where an employee is promoted to a job with a higher pay range, the employee will be eligible
for an increment effective the date of the promotion. The increment to the employee’s salary
shall be a minimum of 3% of their current salary.

Salaries upon Upward Reclassification
Where an employee’s position is reclassified to a higher classification level, effective the date of
reclassification, the Employee will be eligible for a salary increase of a minimum of 3% or be
placed at the minimum of the new range, whichever is greater.
At the discretion of the City Manager, and upon recommendation of the responsible Manager
and the Manager of Human Resources, an additional increase may be granted, provided the
resulting salary does not exceed the maximum of the salary range for the position.

City of Spruce Grove | Compensation Administration Policy

11

Salaries upon Downward Reclassification
Where an employee’s position is reclassified, through the application of the City's Job
Evaluation system and the employee’s current salary is above the maximum salary of the new
pay grade, the employee’s salary shall be red-circled for a period of twenty-four months from the
effective date of the downward reclassification. The employee is not eligible for either market or
COLA adjustments to the red-circled salary during the twenty-four month time period.
Within the twenty-four (24) month time period, should the maximum of the correct range for the
job meet or exceed the red-circled salary, the employee’s salary will be placed on the
appropriate range and the employee will be eligible for both market and COLA salary
adjustments.
At the end of the twenty-four (24) month period, an employee who is red-circled will be placed
on the correct range for the position at a rate which does not exceed the maximum for the
correct range. The employee will be eligible for both market and COLA salary adjustments.

Salaries upon Demotion
Should an employee be moved to a job where the maximum salary of the pay grade is less than
that of the employee’s former job, the employee’s salary shall be so reduced so that it falls at or
below the maximum of the range for the new job, whichever is the closest to the employee’s
pre-demotion salary.

Salaries upon Transfer
Where an employee is transferred by the city to a job with the same salary range, they will at a
minimum maintain their current salary.

Salaries on Temporary Assignment (Acting Incumbency)
Eligibility
An employee will receive acting incumbency pay, provided:
§ The “acting” employee will be assuming the normal, full duties of the position and not
merely performing a “housekeeping” function as typical during vacation coverage; and
§

The “acting” employee is expected to assume the full scope of responsibilities in a higher
salary classification for a period of time greater than 15 working days.

General Guidelines
The employee will receive acting pay at a rate of 5% above their current pay or the minimum
rate of the salary range of the relieved position, whichever is greater.
An employee, who is assuming additional duties due to a vacancy in the same or lower salary
range, for a period of ninety calendar days or more, will be eligible for 5% above their current
salary or a lump sum as approved by the City Manager.

City of Spruce Grove | Compensation Administration Policy

12

Acting Pay adjustment meets the LAPP definition of “Variable Pay” and is pensionable and
included in salary for pension purposes.
ETO and overtime accrual will cease when acting in a supervisory position and vacation accrual
will be adjusted to the supervisory rate for the term of the acting incumbency.

Department: Human Resources

Sick Leave Policy
Policy Statement
The intent of the Sick Leave Policy is to provide salary and position continuance during periods
of absence from work due to illness or non-work related injury. Sick Leave is intended to cover
short-term health related absences, as well as provide income protection during the qualifying
period for Weekly Indemnity Benefits and/or Long Term Disability Benefits.

Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines with respect to the accrual of sick leave
benefits and the use of this benefit.

Eligibility
Employees are not eligible for sick leave benefits if they are absent because of an injury that is
covered by workers’ compensation and they qualify for benefits or if they were injured while
working for another employer.

Employee Responsibilities
Employees must contact their supervisor at the start of the workday to advise that they will be
unable to attend work due to illness or injury.
If requested, Employees are responsible for providing the city with a medical certificate to

Accrual towards sick leave will commence on the first day of employment, although eligibility to
receive the benefit will subject to Eligibility requirements as set out above.
Employees will accrue sick leave at a rate of .07 hours for every hour worked, to a maximum
equivalency of eighty-five (85) working days.
For example, assume an employee works thirty-five (35) hours per week;
seventy (70) hours over a two-week pay period. The employee would be
credited with 4.9 hours accrued sick leave for that pay period. This employee
City of Spruce Grove | Sick Leave Policy

17

could accrue a maximum of five hundred ninety five (595) hours sick leave
accrual.
Accruals of sick leave will cease and be frozen, should an employee be absent, for any reason

exceed two (2) hours in length

§

Up to three (3) days of sick leave accrual may be granted annually for the employee to

evaluation may be requested. It is expected that employees will fully cooperate with
requests made of them, otherwise benefits may be suspended.

Regular Full-Time Hours of Work Schedule
Administrative Employees
The administrative offices of the City of Spruce Grove are open to serve the public from 8:30 am
to 4:30 pm Monday through Friday. Regular Hours of Work for Administrative Employees,
unless otherwise scheduled by an Administrative Supervisor, fall within these hours.
Administrative employees work a seven (7) hour day over a five (5) day period, thus working a
thirty-five (35) hour work week.
Rest breaks for Administrative Employees include a one (1) hour unpaid lunch break, and a
fifteen (15) minute paid rest break for each half-day worked.

Operational Employees
Regular Hours of Work for Operational Employees, unless otherwise scheduled by an
Operational Supervisor, are 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Sunday through Saturday. Operational
employees work an eight (8) hour day over a five (5) day period, thus working a forty (40) hour
work week.
Rest breaks for Operational Employees include a one (1) hour unpaid lunch break, and a fifteen
(15) minute paid rest break for each half-day worked.

Alternate Hours of Work Schedules
Alternate hours of work schedules refer to work schedules that vary from regular full time hours
of work and include flex time, compressed work weeks, captive work force, earned time off
(ETO), and telecommuting.
Alternate Hours of Work schedules will only be considered where they increase organizational
efficiencies and must be ratified by a Work Agreement form signed by the Employee, Supervisor
and Human Resources.
Procedure #9,012, City of Spruce Grove Overtime and Flexible Hours of Work Schedule
Procedure outlines the framework required.
An Alternate Hours of work schedule is considered temporary and shall be reviewed every three
months to ensure it is meeting the operational requirements of the work area.

Flex Time Schedule
Flex Time refers to a scheduling arrangement whereby the employee works the required hours
per day for their position, but they are allowed some flexibility to work outside the regular hours

City of Spruce Grove | Hours of Work Policy

80

of work, provided they are present at work during designated core working hours. For example,
the starting time or departure time could be varied, provided the total required daily hours for the
position are met.

Compressed Work Week Schedule
A compressed work week refers to a scheduling arrangement whereby the employee works the
required hours per week for their position, but over a shorter period of days by working outside
the regular hours of work. Where operational requirements permit, a supervisor may assign an
employee or group of employees to a compressed work week schedule.
For example: A forty (40) hour, five (5) day work week, could be compressed to a forty (40)
hour, four (4) day work week by working ten (10) hours per day, rather than eight (8) hours per
day.
Should an employee work a compressed work week, they must take two (2) consecutive days of
rest. The third day of rest will be scheduled based on operational requirements.

Captive Work Force Schedule
Captive Work Force refers to designated operational positions that are required to remain
available to serve the public seven (7) days a week, eight (8) hours per day, including rest
breaks. This term refers to Enforcement Services employees only.
Employees designated as a captive workforce may be scheduled to work, in any manner which
best meets operational needs, within a forty (40) hour work week. Paid rest periods of a
minimum of thirty (30) minutes and maximum of one (1) hour must be taken during each shift in
excess of five (5) hours, and may be scheduled by the designated Supervisor.

Captive Workforce General Holidays
Employees who are designated as a captive work force may be scheduled to work on a General
Holiday. Captive work force employees are ineligible for extra pay on General holidays, except
for approved overtime.
In recognition of this possibility in work scheduling, captive work force employees shall receive
an additional six (6) hours pay on each pay date to compensate for non-worked General
Holidays. This pay will be included in the calculation of the employee’s pensionable income.
Employees who are required to be on duty on a General Holiday shall receive an additional six
(6) hours pay which will not be considered pensionable income.

Earned Time Off
Earned Time Off (ETO) refers to an alternate work schedule in which employees may, upon
written approval, work hours outside of their regular hours of work and take time off work with
pay for those extra hours worked.

Telecommuting Schedule

alternate worksite. As with other alternate work schedules, this is a temporary work schedule
that may be arranged for short periods of time and is limited to those positions that can
accommodate this type of work.

Calculation and Payment of Overtime
The City of Spruce Grove’s calculation and payment of overtime exceeds the minimum

any one day or the total number of hours worked in excess of thirty-five (35) or forty (40) hours
in a week. Note, that those that are on the Earned Time Off (ETO) Program, overtime
calculation will begin after ETO is accrued. Leaves without pay do not count as time worked.
Employees may elect to be paid for overtime worked or take time off work in lieu of being paid,
recognizing the City will have final decision on method of payment, either time in lieu or paying
wages.

Rate of Pay
The rate of overtime pay will be 1.5 times the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay. If an
employee is required to work on a General Holiday, they will be paid 2 times their regular hourly
rate of pay.
If an employee chooses to take time off in lieu of pay, the employee will be paid their regular
rate of pay on the days they take off as banked time.

Banking of Overtime Hours Worked (Time off in Lieu of Pay)
If an employee wishes to take time off in lieu of overtime pay, they may do so provided they sign
an Individual Overtime Agreement. Any banked time must be taken within 3 months of the end
of the pay period in which it was earned, if departmentally feasible. If banked time is not taken
within this period, it will be paid on the employees next pay period.

City of Spruce Grove | Hours of Work Policy

83

The maximum time that can be banked to be taken as time off in lieu of pay is thirty-five (35)
hours for Administrative employees and forty (40) for Operational Employees. Any overtime

Office Etiquette Guidelines
Office Etiquette Vision Statement
The City of Spruce Grove is committed to providing public services that meet the
highest professional and ethical standards. In carrying out these public services,
staff of the City will respect their customers and each other, foster a work
environment that is conducive to effective performance while recognizing quality
of life and present a positive and professional image to the community.

Office Etiquette Recommended Guidelines
Rules governing office etiquette are not necessarily documented in our policies or procedures –
they tend to boil down to common sense and courtesy. As the workplace becomes busier and
more pressured, these guidelines are more apt to fall by the wayside. Here are some tips to
keep in mind:

Office Neatness and Cleanliness
§

Ensure that our work areas, including desks, are neat and tidy. Stack files, banker’s
boxes and papers neatly and when a project is complete put it away either in storage or
a cabinet.

§

Employees are allowed to personalize their work areas. You should be aware of how
items are displayed, for example pictures should be in frames or holders of some type
and personal items should be tasteful and kept to a minimum. Absolutely no racial,
moral or ethical items will be tolerated.

§

Many employees have windows and Items placed against these windows can been seen
from the sidewalk or street. Be aware of this.

§

Should you have a delivery come, and are notified of such, you should pick it up
immediately and put it away as soon as possible.

§

Employees are to use discretion when eating at their desks. Meals should be eaten in
the staff room, however should circumstances dictate that meals or snacks be eaten at
their desk, staff are requested to consider the image to the public, the smells in the
workplace and the impact of spills and food particles on computers, work surfaces and
paperwork.

§

If an accident occurs and a mess is made (i.e. spilling coffee), immediately do your best
to clean it up. The cleaners will have the tools to do the job, but do as much as possible
to clean it up.

City of Spruce Grove | Office Etiquette Guidelines

93

Coffee Bar and Staff Room Etiquette
Each floor coffee bar will be maintained and cleaned by those on that floor. It is the
responsibility of all those that use the coffee bar to ensure that it is clean and that coffee
supplies are looked after. Should you take the last cup of coffee, make another pot; do not
expect someone else to make it for you. If you dirty dishes or cutlery, ensure they are washed
and put away after use.
The 3rd floor coffee room will have a weekly departmental schedule to ensure that it is tidy on a
daily basis and to clean out the cooler at the end of the week. Should you use the cooler,
please note that anything left in it will be thrown out after 4:00 pm every Friday. The cooler is
designed to keep lunches and snacks cool and fresh for a short period of time, it is not designed
to refrigerate items for extended periods of time. Coffee making and condiment refilling duties
will still fall to the person that first arrives in the coffee room in the morning and the person who
took the last cup. Again, if you use dishes or cutlery, ensure they are washed and put away
after use.
Cooking and reheating of food should only be done in the 3rd floor microwave. With our very
open spaces, this will keep odors away from any public areas. One should also be aware that
others might be allergic to some odors or find them offensive. Be aware of what you bring to be
reheated.

Noise
§

Use the handset to check voicemail. Speakers, when so equipped are to be used
primarily for conference calls and using them for voicemail playback can be distracting to
those around you.

§

Be aware of the impact that your voice has on those around you. Use a conversational
tone when conversing on the phone or with colleagues and customers in open areas.

§

Be aware of the volume of audio equipment: radio, CD player, computer speakers, you
may be using. If others can also hear it, this is a distraction. Consider using
headphones.

§

If you are having a discussion either with a co-worker or a customer be aware of where
you are and who is around. For example, do not stand in front of someone’s office door
or workstation and have this discussion. Move into a conference room, empty office or
away from where it may distract others trying to work.

Scent
§

Be aware that others may be allergic or sensitive to your perfume, aftershave or any
other scents you may use in your area such as aromatherapy.

§

Should you have allergies, make it known to those around you.

City of Spruce Grove | Office Etiquette Guidelines

94

Interpersonal
§

If passing a colleague’s office or workstation and think about dropping in for a chat,
consider that they may be busy or trying to concentrate, so do not interrupt unless you
really have to speak to them.

§

Respect closed doors. There’s obviously are reason they are closed.

§

If someone is on the phone or having a conversation with someone else, indicate you
need to speak with him or her and then leave. Respect their privacy.

§

If you are speaking with someone and they need to take a phone call, excuse yourself
and give them privacy.

§

Should you find yourself privy to a conversation that is taking place in an open area or at
someone’s desk, do not feel that you have to contribute unless the conversation is
directed to you. Respect the privacy of others conversations.

§

If you should overhear something personal or private, keep it to yourself.

§

Treat everyone with respect and dignity. Never engage in any actions that may
embarrass people or make them feel uncomfortable.

§

Don’t criticize publicly. If you disagree with a position a colleague has taken, request a
private meeting where you can ask for clarification and, if appropriate, express your
concerns.

§

Don’t make cell phone calls in public or common areas, such as the staff room.

§

Turn off your cell phone when you go into a meeting. If you are expecting a call that is
critical, ask the meeting facilitator if you may leave your phone on. Use whatever “silent
ringer” feature the phone is equipped with and leave the room to answer the call.

§

If a fax isn’t addressed to you, don’t read it.

§

Try and return every call and email within 24 hours.

§

Never assume that any of your coworkers are less busy or stressed than you are when
making requests.

§

If you have committed to working on a committee or group project, value and respect
your colleagues time and make an effort to attend meetings and show up on time.

§

Do not go into someone else’s desk or personal space without authorization from that
individual.

§

If you have a concern with another’s actions, talk to them about it. If a resolve is not
reached speak to the department supervisor.

§

Other departments may have a slightly different culture and operational requirements.
Be aware that coffee time for you may not apply or appeal to others.

§

Do not judge others. You do not know what their position requirements are. They may
have to leave to go out for meetings or for other reasons.
City of Spruce Grove | Office Etiquette Guidelines

95

Social
§

Decorating for occasions such as Christmas shall be simple and tasteful. Decorations
should be coordinated so that it appears similar on all floors and must be approved by
management.

§

Attendance is not compulsory for staff functions or events, but efforts should be made to
at least make an appearance. Management and staff will plan and promote various staff
functions throughout the year.

Dress Code
The dress code, including personal grooming and Casual Fridays, is addressed in a Human
Resources Policy.

City of Spruce Grove Internal Email Etiquette
Internal email is a vital communications tool at the Organization of Choice. When used well, it
encourages the sharing of information and increases productivity. The following guidelines are
designed to help staff use this tool effectively.

Creating Emails
§

Whenever possible, make your messages short and to the point. Mark is FYI (For
information), Follow-up Requested or Feedback Requested.

§

Think about the message content before you send it. Make sure that the content is
relevant. Nobody likes junk email.

§

Make sure to have a descriptive subject line. Some people discard emails with vague or
no subject lines.

§

When sending internal emails to the City of Spruce Grove distribution list, ensure that
everyone really needs the information you are sending. There are over 140 on the City’s
list.

§

Use bold or coloured type sparingly. Treat your email as you would a letter.

§

Be polite. Terseness can be easily misinterpreted.

§

Use humour and irony sparingly, as it can be easily misinterpreted.

§

Quote from the original message where relevant.

§

End your emails with a brief signature (your name, title, department, and contact phone
number) to help the recipient understand who it is from.

§

Do not use all capital letters, as this is considered SHOUTING.

§

Without the benefit of eye contact, voice inflection, and body language, the written word
can come across as harsh. Reread your emails before sending them to ensure your
message cannot be misunderstood.

City of Spruce Grove | Office Etiquette Guidelines

96

§

The use of "smilies", or emoticons, is discouraged as this makes the City’s emails look
unprofessional.

§

When composing an email, fill out the “To:” field last. This will prevent you from
accidently sending the email before you are finished writing it.

Sending Emails
§

When replying to mailing list messages, or to messages sent to many recipients, make
sure you are not unintentionally replying to the whole list.

§

Let people know (by cc’ing or with a separate email) that you’ve forwarded their
message so they will know that they may expect a reply.

§

Think before you send. Never reply to an email when angry. Once it has been sent, you
can’t get it back.

§

As a courtesy, check with the recipient before sending large attachments (5MB or
greater).

§

Consider everything that you send by email to be public. People can forward your emails
and you never know where they will end up.

General Email Use
§

Please be patient with inexperienced email users.

§

Don't keep mail on your server longer than necessary, especially large attachments.

§

Keep your inbox clean. Delete anything that is trivial or that you don’t need.

§

Don't correct people's spelling and punctuation. It is considered rude. Often emails are
typed quickly and many people have no way of running a spellcheck on their emails.

§

Never "flame" people by sending abusive email messages.

§

Don't make personal remarks about third parties. Email messages can come back to
haunt you.

§

Don't send unsuitable emails or attachments, including anything of an abusive, sexual or
racist nature, as well as other subjects that may make the City liable under the Canadian
Human Rights Act.

§

Never mark things as urgent if they aren't. When you really do have an urgent message,
people may not believe it.

§

Don't post your email address on the Internet unless you want to be deluged with spam
emails. When signing up for things like Web shots, realize that many companies will sell
these lists. Avoid giving your email address, or choose the “do not contact” feature.

§

If you do get spam emails, do not use the “unsubscribe” feature. This is just a method for
the sender to verify that a real person is reading the message and will usually lead to
more spam. Simply delete the spam message.
City of Spruce Grove | Office Etiquette Guidelines

97

§

Due to the problems with spam emails, many companies are now using spam filters. To
avoid having your email tagged as spam you should always have an appropriate subject
and do not use all capitals or bolding in the subject line.

§

Use abbreviations and acronyms sparingly, and only those that are common to the
English language such as FYI and BTW. You risk of confusing your recipient.

§

Never open attachments from someone that you do not know well. Never open
attachments that end in ".exe" or “.scr” no matter whom they are from. Report these
emails to IT.

§

Do not participate in online chain letters, they merely increase Internet traffic and slow
things down for everyone. Simply delete the message.

§

Remember to activate your Out of Office Assistant in Outlook when you will be away
from the office.

§

Limited personal use is permitted on email, Office Suite and the Internet when it
complies with City policies and guidelines, has no negative impact on the performance of
the staff member and/or colleagues, and does not impose a storage burden on City’s
information storage systems. You may not use the City’s electronic networks for private
business, personal gain or profit, or political activity.

§

While all City staff are entitled to a reasonable expectation of privacy, be aware that the
system administrator and management may examine email that is sent and received on
City email accounts and computers. The City has monitoring technology solutions in
place to maintain the integrity of the system and protect it from viruses, and to ensure
the system is operating efficiently and in conformity with the law.

§

All information obtained, stored or disseminated using City of Spruce Grove computer
systems is not personal information and is subject to the Freedom of Information and
Protection of Privacy Act.

City of Spruce Grove Voicemail Etiquette
The City of Spruce Grove is committed to delivering top-notch customer service to citizens and
visitors alike. One area that is often overlooked is voicemail etiquette. The following tips and
guidelines will help staff ensure that when people phone in, they can either leave a message or
reach another person without too much difficulty.

Setting Up Your Voicemail
§

Set your voicemail to answer the phone in the fewest rings possible.

§

Use a professional and warm voicemail message. Limit the background noise when
recording your message.

§

Voice mail for front-line customer service numbers that are shared by a number of
people should be generic in nature and include the area’s name instead of an
individual’s name.
City of Spruce Grove | Office Etiquette Guidelines

98

§

Keep your message short so callers won’t wait long to leave a message. If possible, let
the caller know what number to press to reach an operator or other person should they
choose not to leave a message.

§

Update your outgoing voicemail message often. If you are out of the office or away from
your desk, let your callers know why they can't reach you and when you will be available
to be reached.

§

It is better to have a generic outgoing message than one that is outdated.

Returning Voicemail Messages
§

Check your messages as often as possible. Try to return all calls within two hours, and
at the very latest within 24 hours.

§

Thank the caller for leaving you a voicemail message.

§

Leaving Voicemail Messages

§

Speak clearly and slowly, using a pleasant tone of voice.

§

State your name, the date and the time of your call.

§

Leave a detailed message that includes your phone number and when you can be
reached.

§

Keep your message short and to the point.

General Voicemail Use
§

When possible, answer your phone personally.

§

Don’t use your voicemail to screen your calls.

§

Keep your mailbox clean. Delete answered and unimportant messages to give you room
for new messages.

portion of the leave. From the date of birth of the child, the birth mother will receive six (6)
weeks of sick leave benefit. If the delivery was a caesarean delivery the birth mother will
receive an additional two (2) weeks sick leave benefit. Part-time employees will be paid sick
leave pro-rated to their normal working week.

for parental leave of up to thirty-seven (37) weeks.
Birth Mothers must take the parental leave immediately following their Maternity Leave.

City of Spruce Grove | Maternity and Parental Leave Policy

107

If both parents are employed by the City of Spruce Grove, either or both parents may take
parental leave.

Request for Maternity and/or Parental Leave
To ensure that the City of Spruce Grove can make the necessary arrangements to
accommodate an employee taking Maternity or Parental Leave, employees are asked to provide
a minimum of three (3) months written notice before commencement of the leave. Human
Resources will provide a Maternity/Parental Request for Leave of Absence form. This is to help
the City procure staffing solutions and alleviate any additional work stress on other employees
that may occur as a result of the employee’s absence.

Leave Parameters
§

A Maternity Leave may begin anytime within twelve (12) weeks of the expected date of
delivery.

§

For the purposes of this policy, the health-related portion of a maternity leave shall begin
on the date of birth of the child.

§

A parental leave may begin anytime within fifty-two (52) weeks of the date of birth or
adoption of the child, with the exception of a birth mother, who must take a parental
leave immediately following the maternity leave.

In the event that both parents are employed by the City and are eligible for Maternity and
Parental Leave, the leave must be taken in one continuous period and cannot be taken
simultaneously.
In the event that the employee requires leave before the actual birth due to medical reasons
sick days shall be used, with the confirmation of a doctor’s note.
In the event a birth or adoption necessitates lengthy post-natal hospitalization, the employee
has the option to delay all or part of their Maternity or Parental leave until the child may be
released from the hospital’s care. In the case of a birth mother, however, the employee must
take the health-related portion of their leave immediately following the birth.
Maternity/Parental Leave must be taken in one continuous leave. In the event that an employee
requires more than the allotted available Maternity/Parental Leave, an extension may be
granted by the City Manager at his discretion.

Return to Work from Maternity/Parental Leave
Employees must give four (4) weeks’ notice regarding their expected date of return to work.
Human Resources should be contacted as soon as possible in the event of any changes.
