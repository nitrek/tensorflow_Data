FOREWORD
The 22d Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Congress for the fiscal year July 1, 1955, to June 30,
1956 (herein called "1956"), describes the work of the Cornmission
during the year in discharging its duties under the Federal securities
laws which it was established by the Congress to administer. These
include supervision of the registration of securities for sale in interstate commerce to the public, the surveillance of the interstate
securities markets, regulation of the activities of brokers and dealers
and investment advisers, the regulation of public utilitv holding
company systems and investment companies, and litigation in enforcement of the Federal securities laws in the courts.
The year 1956 has been one of great activity in the regulation and
supervision of securities markets by the Commission. The increasing
responsibility of the Commission was brought about by the sustained
high level of economic activitv in the country, and the accompanying
stepped-up activit V in the Nation's capital markets.
In 1956 new issues of securities registered for public sale totaled
$13.1 billion, the largest amount in the Commission's history and
more than $2 billion in excess of the amount registered in the preceding year. The value of securities traded on stock exchanges during 1956 was $38 billion, more than double the figure of fiscal 1953.
Stockholders in publicly owned American corporations are estimated
by the New York Stock Exchange to include about 8.5 million domestic individuals, 2 million more than 5 years ago. About 4,600 brokers
and dealers were registered with the Commission as compared with
4,100 3 years ago.
Enforcement activities such as broker-dealer inspections and
investigations of fraud and market manipulations have been greatly
expanded to meet current needs occasioned by abuses incident to
the marketing of certain types of securities of speculative quality.
The Commission's Enforcement Program, to assure fair disclosure
of material facts in connection with the marketing of corporate
securities and for the prevention, detection and punishment of fraud
in the sale of securities, has been intensively pursued in the interest
of the investing public. Administrative and legal actions taken
under the Enforcement Program have exceeded those of any prior
year. These include 100 suspensions of offerings for which the small
issues exemption was claimed, 8 stop orders of securities for which
XI

FOREWORD

registration statements Were filed, 45 revocation and denials proceedings against broker-dealers and investment advisors; 33 injunctive and one subpoena enforcement actions and 20 criminal referrals
to the Department of Justice.
The Commission has continued its program of strengthening and
simplifying its rules, forms and procedures with a view to the more
effective dissemination of information to investors, the prevention,
detection and punishment of fraud and the elimination of unnecessary complexities and duplications. An intensive study of the problems of small business in marketing securities, particularly for equity
capital, was conducted by the Commission in 1956, and shortly
after the close of the year om exemptive regulations for issues of
$300,000 or less were revised and streamlined so as to provide better
protection to the investing public without unnecessary or burdensome compliance requirements on small business enterprises seeking
access to the interstate capital markets. There was also established
shortly thereafter a Branch of Small Issues in our Division of Corporation Finance in Washington, D. C., to coordinate and facilitate
the handling ill our nine regional offices throughout the country of
the filings for small issues.
During the year, the Commission and its staff have appeared
before committees of the Congress on many occasions in connection
with proposed legislation dealing with the Commission's work and
other subjects of interest to the Congress. Various legislative proposals considered are discussed in this report. This work of the
Commission in assisting the Congress is of great importance to the
public interest.
To meet the greatly increased workload in accordance with the
recommendation contained in the President's Budget, the Congress
granted the Commission an appropriation for an average employment
of about 730, in 1956, which represented a small increase from 1955
and, most significant, an end of successive annual curtailments of staff
from a high of over 1,700 in 1942 to an all-time low of 666 on June
30, 1955. For 1957, the Congress, recognizing this Commission's
request in light of the vastly expanded economy and capital markets,
appropriated funds for an average employment of 794.
Statutory fees for registration of new issues of securities and trading in issues registered for trading on stock exchanges are imposed
by the Federal securities laws. These fees are not available to the
Oommission for expenditure and are covered into the Treasury as
miscellaneous receipts. These fees, however, amounted to 39 percent
of the 1956 appropriation for the Oommission and therefore represent
a reduction in the cost of the Commission which must be provided
by the general taxpayer.

FOREWORD

XIII

During 1956 the Commission has rendered an effective administration at a minimum cost. However, constantly increasing regulatory and supervisory responsibility brought about by the great
activity in the securities markets makes it essential that the Congress
provide funds for this Commission adequately to fulfill its statutory
function of protection of the investor, the consumer and the public
in accordance with the acts of Congress which it has the responsibility
to administer.
The work of the Securities and Exchange Commission in protecting the investor, the consumer and the public according to the standards established bv the Congress in the Federal securities laws is
vitally important to the maintenance of confidence in the securities
markets which is essential to the preservation of the free enterprise
system.
The charts which follow show in graphic form various aspects of
the activities and personnel of the Commission relating to its increased workload.

PART I
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM
The most important aspect of the Commission's activities during
1956 has been its Enforcement Program. The aim of the Enforcement
Program is to assure fair disclosure of all material facts about corporations offering securities to the public in interstate commerce and
to prevent fraud, deceit and manipulation in the sale, purchase and
trading of securities, and thus to provide the protection to public
investors which is the objective of the Congress expressed in the
Federal securities laws. The Enforcement Program, under the dayto-day direction of the Commission, has been carried out by the Commission's operating divisions and offices in Washington, and by its 14
regional and branch offices in principal cities throughout the Nation.
The necessity for an increasingly vigorous Enforcement Program has
arisen from the tremendous economic activity of the country, which
has been reflected in the most active capital markets in our Nation's
history. Enforcement problems confronted by the Commission during
the relative economic stagnation of the 1930's, the World War II
period of market quiescence, and the postwar recovery have been
dwarfed by the problems confronting the Commission in the past
2 years of dynamic economic growth and the accompanying requirements for capital.
At no time in the Commission's experience have activities and prices
in the securities markets reached such highs. This upsurge has taken
place in a relatively short period of time. For example, the dollar
amount of securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933
increased by 75 percent from $7.5 billion in the comparatively recent
fiscal year 1953 to $13.1 billion in fiscal 1956. During the 1930's, the
average dollar amount of securities registered was about $2.5 billion,
and in some years was below $1 billion. In the postwar years from
1945 to 1950 it was $4.5 billion a year on the' average.
Of the $400 billion gross national product annual rate figure, over
$60 billion is applied for Qapital purposes of industry, that is to say,
to provide plant facilities, tools and working capital needed by American industry. Much of the $60 billion amount is supplied from
internal sources, such as depreciation accruals and retained earnings.
The capital formation process supplies the balance estimated at $7 to
$8 billion annually through investments in the capital markets by the
American people.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The work of the Commission in sustaining the investors' confidence
in the integrity of the capital markets must take into account conditions which if permitted to exist can only result, ultimately, in the
destruction of investor confidence and the thwarting of the Congressional objectives set forth in the securities laws. Our free enterprise
system will be damaged if these conditions grow and are not stamped
out. A few of these problems with which the Commission has been
faced and our efforts to cope with them are deserving of consideration
by the Congress and the public generally.
1. The problem of new, inexperienced and, in some cases, dishonest
brokers and dealers registering under the Exchange Act. The activity
in the capital markets has attracted many new brokers and dealers
to the securities business. The number of registered broker-dealers
increased from 3,924 at June 30, 1949, to 4,591 at June 30, 1956.
Many of the new broker-dealers are inexperienced and unfamiliar
with the obligations owed to their customers. Some have been
drawn into the business in the hope of a quick profit rather than the
establishment of a sound business reputation built painstakingly upon
just and equitable principles of trade.
The aggregate market value of all stock on all stock exchanges,
which never exceeded $100 billion before 1946, except briefly in 1929,
increased from $111 billion at December 31, 1950, to over $250 billion
at June 30, 1956. The Dow Jones Industrial average of stock prices
on the New York Stock Exchange reached an all-time high of 521.05
on April 6, 1956. During the years 1933 to 1949 it never exceeded
220. The value of the gross national product broke through the $400
billion annual rate figure in 1956as compared with $340 billion in 1952.
The dollar value of securities which changed hands on the New
York Stock Exchange rose to $32 billion in fiscal 1956, more than
double the comparable figures of fiscal 1953, and like increases were
registered on the regional exchanges and are believed to have also
occurred in the over-the-counter market.
Attending this rapid expansion has been a favorable climate for the
marketing of new securities issues, including securities of speculative
quality, a marked increase in the number of stockholders (estimated
by the New York Stock Exchange to include 8% million domestic
individuals), including many inexperienced investors.
Capital markets such as these, which have no precedent in the
Commission's history, have been accompanied by adverse conditions
which have required intensified enforcement activities by the Commission so as to assure to the investing public the protection which the Congress intended should be provided by the securities acts. A number
of new brokers and dealers either lack adequate financial resources or
speculate unwisely, thus getting into financial difficulties which
threaten the safety of customers' funds or securities entrusted to them.

TWENTY -SECOND ANNUAL

REPORT

3

The Commission has no authority under the Exchange Act to bar a
person from registration (absent proof of earlier violations of law)
nor is there any financial or educational requirement. Expanded and
more frequent broker-dealer inspections, prompt investigations of
irregularities discovered in inspections or complaints received from
the public, and prompt and vigorous legal action in the case of violations have been the Commission's program for the protection of
investing customers.
2. The problem of "boiler rooms." The term "boiler room" is used
to refer to a securities sales organization employing high-pressure,
fraudulent, and deceptive sales techniques to "tout" highly speculative securities over the telephone. An increasing number of securities
of speculative quality have been sold to unsophisticated investors
lured by representations of large profits under present market conditions and willing to buy securities on the basis of representations
made over the long distance telephone by complete strangers. Prevention and detection of fraud in such sales has been a particularly
difficult task necessitating the careful collection of evidence from
widely scattered sources.
The Commission's program has been threefold-to
bring brokerdealer revocation proceedings against broker-dealers found to be
selling or purchasing securities by misrepresentation or fraud, to
bring injunction actions in the Federal courts to prevent such transactions, and to prevent broker-dealers from doing business in violation
of any of the Exchange Act protective provisions or the Commission's rules, such as the net capital rule, the rule against improper
extension of credit (regulation T) and the like, and, where the violation is willful, reference of the case to the Department of Justice for
criminal prosecution.
One particularly difficult aspect of the "boiler room" problem is the
gullibility of the public. The Commission has had a public information program under which Commissioners have talked at public
gatherings, particularly to professional and civic groups, to the press
and on radio and television, seeking to acquaint the public with the
dangers of stock transactions with unknown persons calling on the
long distance phone and holding out promises of riches if the person
called will only buy the stock. The public is asked to tell the person
calling to put a letter in the mail about the securities (this often
ends the call because use of the mails gives Federal jurisdiction under
the Exchange Act and the Mail Fraud Act) or to put the official
prospectus or offering circular (which in the case of a new issue is
required to be filed with, and is examined by, the Commission) in the
mail.
The press, radio and television news media have rendered great
service to the American people by helping to get this message across.

4

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

But, fundamentally, a government agency can do just so much in
protecting the public, and in the final analysis the American people
must learn to use ordinary care and prudence in investing their
money. The Commission needs the help of the investing public
which should report to us transactions in which it is believed misrepresentation and fraud have occurred and the public has been
bilked. But the public must also learn not to buy the proverbial
"gold brick." The tragedy from the standpoint of the public interest
is that the widow, the wage earner, the person of small income is
often the victim of the "boiler room" salesman. The Commission
will welcome every help from the public in reporting to us fraudulent
transactions and in using common sense in their securities transactions.
3. Sales of unregistered securities based on claimed exemptions. It
appears that a substantial but undetermined number of securities have
been sold in violation of the registration, prospectus and antifraud
provisions of the Securities Act pursuant to claimed exemptions
which, in fact, were not available. We believe that these sales have
been made in the main under claims of exemption pursuant to the
so-called "private offering" exemption 1 and the intrastate exemption,"
In most of these cases the Commission has no means to discover
facts showing the unavailability of a particular exemption until it
receives, months after sales have been made, reports or complaints
from unwary public investors who have been "taken" for substantial
sums. Further complicating the Commission's problems in this area
has been the fact that an increasingly large number of securities
claimed to have been issued pursuant to these exemptions have been
transferred to United States citizens through Canadian, Swiss,
Lichtenstein, and other foreign financial institutions, under foreign
laws which preclude the Commission from tracing the transactions
in which the securities have been publicly sold or the availability
or unavailability of the claimed exemption. The Commission has
increased its efforts to make factual discoveries of sales made without
registration at the earliest opportunity in order to determine the
availability or unavailability of these exemptions and thus to take
legal action to afford the protection to public investors contemplated
by the Securities Act.
4. The problem of illegal sales from Canada. The Commission
has been concerned about the illegal sale of issues in the securities
markets of the United States by issuers and broker-dealers located
in Canada. These transactions have appeared to reach public
investors in the United States as a result of primary distributions
effected on Canadian securities exchanges or through Canadian

brokers and dealers. Although it has not been possible, in many
instances to directly reach Oanadian issuers or broker-dealers, the
Oommission has attempted to review more closely the activities of
broker-dealer firms in this country suspected of participating in the
illegal marketing of Oanadian securities or of American securities sold
through Canadian sources in order to protect United States public
investors more effectively. Efforts are also being made through
appropriate diplomatic channels to correct the virtual nullification of
the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Canada which,
as amended in 1952, provides for the extradition of persons indicted
for securities frauds perpetrated in Canada upon persons in the United
States. This resulted from a decision of Canadian Extradition judge
in 1954,3in the first case under the 1952 treaty amendment, denying
extradition though conceding the fraud. During the year, continued
excellent cooperation on law enforcement matters by Canadian
officials, both Federal and Provincial, aided greatly our efforts to
detect, thwart and proceed against fraudulent securities sales.
5. The problem of the "front money" racket. Under the Oommission's
exemptive regulation for new issues not in excess of $300,000 in
aggregate public offering price (Regulation A) and sometimes under
registration, it has been discovered that "rings" have developed
through which groups of promoters, dealers, attorneys, and engineers
collaborate in the creation of a series of companies primarily employed
to "manufacture" securities for public sale in the guise of legitimate
promotions. Often these facts have not been developed or discovered
until after public investors have bought securities which have little
or no actual value. These various transactions frequently have
been carefully timed so that it is difficult to relate one issue with
another even though a particular issue may have been part of a
scheme of the character mentioned. Under the revised regulation
A, the Oommission now requires disclosure of the names of such
individuals in connection with the filing of Form I-A which will
greatly assist its enforcement program.
6. Evasion"iof the reqistration'srequiremente through the "no sale"
theory. By Commission Rule No. 133, certain types of corporate
mergers, consolidation, reclassifications of securities and acquisition
of assets of another person in conformity with statutory provisions
of the state of incorporation, have been deemed not to constitute a
"sale" of securities issued in the transactions for purposes of section
5 of the Securities Act. The rule, in effect, exempts such issues from
the requirement of registration under that Act. The rule has been
used by numerous issuers, domestic and foreign, to distribute securities without registration.
As in the case of the "private offering"
and "intrastate" exemptions, many transactions ostensibly exempted

COMMISSION

under the rule, in fact involve violations of the registration provisions.
The Commission recently released a notice of a proposed revision of
the rule which is designed to make exemptions unavailable in the
cases now exempted under it.4 If adoption of the proposal results, it
will involve a substantial increase in the number of registration statements filed under the Securities Act and in the annual and periodic
reports :filedunder the Securities Exchange Act.
7. The problem of promotional stocks. In addition to the problems
created by the sale of promotional uranium stocks, the Commission
has been concerned with the sale of new insurance company securities
in both exempt and registered issues. Many of these new insurance
company ventures are located in the South Central, Southwestern
and Southeastern parts of the country. A large number of these
issues have given the appearance of involving abuses or probable
violations of either the Securities Act or of the Securities Exchange
Act, necessitating thorough investigation.
8. Stop order and suspension: proceedings for new issues. For the
protection of public investors, the Commission has instituted a
substantially increased number of stop-order proceedings and suspension orders. Each of these has been preceded by an investigation, and, in many instances, has required a formal administrative
hearing. These actions have involved the establishment of facts and
the obtaining of testimony. Securities, which, if sold, would have
defrauded the public, have thus been kept off the market.
The effectiveness of the Enforcement Program depends in large
measure upon a staff, both in the headquarters and regional offices,
adequate to discharge the exacting duties which this program places
upon it, and upon the availability of travel funds necessary to give this
personnel the mobility necessary to cover the large geographical areas
in which the investigative work has to be done. Further, the Enforcement Program has been related to the complex and ever-ehanging
pattern of the securities markets and the securities industry. The facts
concerning the business, property, and financing of a security issuer
must be ascertained and related to the representations made to investors. Investors must be identified and interviewed. Books and
records of brokers, dealers, issuers and others must be examined and
analyzed. Frequently, securities must be traced, often through intricate channels, to ascertain whether they have been offered by an issuer
or underwriter in violation of the registration and prospectus requirements of the acts. The information thus obtained has had to be then
developed in a form which would permit its introduction in evidence in
legal proceedings, which is not a simple matter, where complex legal
and economic facts and theories are concerned .
â€¢ secunnes Act Release 3698(October 2,1956).

TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

Violations, however, have often been carefully concealed and, under
present conditions, frequently have involved elaborate and shrewdly
conceived schemes carried out on a large scale. Such activities could
be properly dealt with only by assigning a competent team of attorneys, accountants, analysts, and investigators to concentrate on the
particular case until it has been completed.
Careful and painstaking work usually over a period of many months
has preceded formal enforcement action by the Commission.
In some
cases the work of the Commission has led to some form of restitution
to public investors; in others, the violations have been discovered in
time to prevent serious injury to the public; and in others, the violators
have been forced out of business or prosecuted .
.As a further implementation of the Enforcement Program, and as a
means of giving greater protection to public investors, the Commission
has undertaken through the media of public speeches made to various
civic groups and other organizations, and through adequate coverage
in the press and on radio and television, to warn the American people
against hasty investments in companies whose financial and background facts have not been disclosed. Such warnings inevitably
have had a great deterrent effect and have caused companies which
are seeking to raise money in the capital markets to comply with the
registration requirements by making the disclosures so necessary to
informed investment by the public.
If the confidence and faith of the American public in the capital
markets is to be maintained so that the essential supply of capital can
be continued at the high rate of demand anticipated by present estimates of industrial production with the resultant high standard of
living, it is essential that this agency continue its Enforcement Program
by supervising the capital markets in accordance with the standards
established by the Congress in the Federal securities laws.

PART II
LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES
Statutory Amendments Proposed by the Commission

During 1956 the Commission submitted to the Committee on
Banking and Currency of the Senate and the Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, which have
the duty of exercising watchfulness over the execution of the securities
laws pursuant to section 136 of the Legislative Reorganization Act
of 1946, a proposal to adopt a number of amendments to these statutes
in order to assist the Commission in its enforcement activities.
The
proposed amendments do not alter the basic provisions and purposes
of the statutes.
Most of the proposals relate to provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
They were introduced on May 9, 1956, in the House of Representatives
as H. R. 11129, 84th Congress, by the late Representative J. Percy
Priest, then chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce. They were also introduced (by request) in the Senate on
May 23, 1956, as S. 3915 by Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman
of the Committee on Banking and Currency. No action was taken
on these bills during the remainder of the session because there was
insufficient time to consider them.
The Commission's amendment proposals were designed to strengthen
the jurisdictional provisions of the statutes, to correct certain inadequacies, and to facilitate criminal prosecutions and other enforcement activities. The various proposals would prohibit embezzlement
of money or securities of, or entrusted to the care of, a registered
broker-dealer; extend criminal liability to false statements in documents filed with the Commission under section 3 (b) of the Securities
Act of 1933, in connection with small, exempted securities offerings;
enact the antifraud provisions of the Commission's Rule X-10B-5
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in statutory form as an
aid to criminal prosecutions; make it clear that a showing of past
violations is a sufficient basis for injunctive relief; make it clear that
a registration statement under the Securities Act may be withdrawn
only with the consent of the Commission; clarify and strengthen the
statutory provisions relating to financial responsibility of brokers and
dealers; and authorize the Commission, by rule, to regulate the
borrowing, holding or lending of customers' securities by a broker or
dealer. Many other minor amendments were also proposed.

Registration of Unlisted Securities of Certain Companies Having Large
Public Investor Interest

On May 24, 1955, Senator J. W. Fulbright, chairman of the
Committee on Banking and Currency, introduced S. 2054, a bill to
extend the reporting, proxy and insider-trading provisions of sections
12, 13, 14, and 16 of the Securities Exchange Act to additional corporations.
The bill was introduced at the conclusion of the Committee's "Stock Market Study," during which the Commission had
testified and had submitted much background material for the information of the committee and for inclusion in the committee's staff
report of April 30, 1955, on Factors Affecting the Stock Market. In
its final report,' a majority of the committee expressed the view
that "as a general policy, it is in the public interest that companies
whose stocks are traded over the counter be required to comply with
the same statutory provisions and the same rules and regulations as
companies whose stocks are listed on national securities exchanges."
A minority concurred in recommending further study of over-thecounter markets, with the objective of developing specific legislation
if needed.
S. 2054 was introduced to carry out the committee's recommendation, by making sections 12, 13, 14 and 16, which now apply only to
securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges,
applicable also to certain unregistered securities that are traded in
the over-the-counter market. A similar bill (H. R. 7845) was introduced in the House on August 2, 1955, by Representative Arthur G.
Klein, chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of
the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.
Hearings were held on S. 2054 in June 1955 at which the Commission
expressed its support of the broad principles and objectives of the
bill, subject to further study," On July 19, 1955, the Commission
submitted a preliminary report in which it recommended certain
revisions in the bill, but withheld final comment pending a complete
factual study," On August 5, 1955, the subcommittee on Securities
reported favorably a revised Committee Print of S. 2054, which
included some of the changes suggested by the Commission and
certain other changes, including a new provision exempting securities
of regulated insurance companies from the coverage of the bill. As
revised, the bill would be subject to sections 7, 12, 13, 14, and 16 of the
Act corporations having 750 or more stockholders, or debt securities

of $1 million or more outstanding in the hands of the public, and

In order to determine the companies which might be affected by this
bill, the extent of their present compliance with applicable :financial
reporting requirements of the Commission, and their practices in
soliciting proxies, questionnaires were sent to 1,600 corporations
inquiring whether the company had within the past 3 years sent an
annual report to its stockholders and requesting a copy. The response
received (from approximately 90 percent of those to which requests
were sent) indicated that approximately 1,200 corporations would be
subject to the bill (of which 617 were presently filing :financial statements with the Commission). Such 1,200 corporations have estimated
assets in excess of $35 billion. Review of proxy soliciting materials
used by these corporations showed that in very few instances were
stockholders furnished with information comparable to that required
by the Commission's proxy rules and that in most annual meetings
for the election of directors stockholders received only a formal
notice of the meeting and form of proxy. Examination of the :financial
statements contained in the stockholders' reports received indicated
that approximately 21 percent were deficient by Commission reporting
standards.
These :findings were contained in a report made by the
Commission to the Committee on Banking and Currency on May 17,
1956, which report was printed and made available to the public by
the committee. In its report, and in hearings subsequently held by
the full committee, the Commission endorsed the enactment of the
:financial reporting, proxy and insider-reporting provisions of the bill,
but recommended deferral of any action on the application of section
16 (b) of the Act (providing for recovery of profits from short-swing
trading by insiders) to these companies until a further study could
be made.
The Commission considers legislation of the character embodied
in S. 2054, as demonstrated by the data contained in our report, to be
consistent with the standards expressed by the Congress in the Federal
securities laws and to be vitally necessary for the protection of public
investors in these large widely held corporations.
The committee did not take any :final action on S. 2054. However,
Senator Fulbright, chairman of the committee, requested the Commission to extend the study it had previously made so as to obtain
information about the financial reporting and proxy practices of
insurance companies, to provide a basis for further consideration by
the committee in the 85th Congress. The Commission had not previously included insurance companies in its study for the reason that
the bill as revised by the subcommittee on August 5, 1955, had contained an exemption for such companies. The Commission has
initiated the requested study, and, since the end of the fiscal year, has

sent questionnaires to more than 530 insurance companies to obtain

practices of insurance companies.
Proposals To Amend the Exemption for Small Issues

On April 20, 1955, during the previous fiscal year, Representative
John B. Bennett of Michigan had introduced a bill (H. R. 5701), to
repeal section 3 (b) of the Securities Act of 1933. Section 3 (b)
provides that the Securities and Exchange Commission may from
time to time by its rules and regulations, and subject to such terms
and conditions as may be prescribed, add to the classes of securities
exempted in section 3 (a) of the Act (such as securities issued by the
United States or other governmental organizations, commercial paper,
building and loan association obligations, securities the issuance of
which is subject to approval under the Interstate Commerce Act and
certain other specifically exempted classes) any class of securities if
the Commission finds that enforcement of the registration provisions of
the Act with respect to such securities "is not necessary in the public
interest and for the protection of investors by reason of the small
amount involved or the limited character of the public offering,"
provided no issue shall be exempted the aggregate offering price of
which exceeds $300,000.
Hearings were held on this subject by the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance, at which the Commission testified, at various dates
from July 20, 1955, through May 9, 1956, in Washington, D. C.,
New York City, Denver and Salt Lake City. The Commission f2UPplied a substantial amount of supplemental information to the committee. The Commission opposed this bill repealing the exemption
although these hearings developed a good deal of factual information
about the abuses of the public in penny stocks with which the Commission has been attempting to deal by strengthening its filing requirements under the exemptive regulations and by stepping up its enforcement activities in its field offices. The Commission opposed the
repeal of the exemption on the ground that it would adversely affect
the raising of capital by legitimate small business enterprises.
On February 16, 1956, Representative Bennett introduced another
bill (H. R. 9319) which would apply to persons associated with an
offering under the exemptive regulations the same strict civil liabilities
that pertain to persons associated with an offering under full registration, which are set forth in section 11 of the Act. The Commission
likewise opposed this bill on the ground that it would in substance
require the equivalent of full registration for small issues and that
this would have the indirect effect of repealing the exemption. The
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce favorably reported
this bill (H. R. Rept. 2513, 84th Cong., 2d sess. (1956)) and, although

it was passed over in the last days of the congressional session, it may
be introduced in the 85th Congress (102 Congo Rec., July 27, 1956, at
13820).
To meet what the Commission considered to be the objectives of
this legislation without its drawbacks, Representative Arthur G.
Klein of New York on May 17,1956, introduced a bill (H. R. 11308),
which the Securities and Exchange Commission supported. This bill
would have enlarged the civil liabilities of persons actually responsible
for misstatements or omissions of material facts, or for misrepresentation or fraud, in connection with exempt offerings, but it would not
have made the civil liabilities applicable to all persons associated
with an offering whether or not they had knowledge or were responsible for misstatements, omissions or misrepresentation or fraud. A
minority of three members of the Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives voted for the Klein
bill. The Commission is hopeful such legislation will again be considered by the Congress.
Activities Rclating to Amendment of
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
Nuclear Reactor Legislation

Several legislative proposals relating to the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 were introduced during the second session of
the 84th Congress. Two of these were embodied in S. 2643 and its
companion bill, H. R. 6294.4 Section 4 of this bill would have
amended the Public Utility Holding Company Act so as to exclude
from the definition of "electric utility company" in section 2 (a) (3)
a nuclear reactor company, even though the heat produced by the
reactor is used for the generation of electricity. Section~5 of the bill
would have amended section 2 (a) (7) of the Act so as to exclude from
the definition of "holding company" a company whose'jsubsidiary is
a generating company which meets certain requirements including a
requirement that all of its stock be owned by electric utility or holding
companies which either directly or through operating subsidiaries
purchase all of its output.
Section 5 was designed in the first instance to meet the desires of
four electric utility companies which operate in the Pacific Northwest

region and are the parents of Pacific Northwest Power Co., which in
turn is seeking permission under the Federal Power Act to construct
two hydroelectric projects on the Snake River, known as the "Pleasant
Valley" and "Mountain Sheep" projects. An earlier version of this
proposal had appeared in H. R. 9043, 83d Congress, but in that form
had never reached the floor of the House. The sponsoring companies,
the Montana Power Co., Pacific Power & Light Co., Portland General
Electric Co., and the Washington Water Power Co., sought the
amendment to enable them to construct these projects through a
common subsidiary without themselves becoming holding companies
required either to register or to qualify for an exemption from the Act.
In our written comments on the bill," and in the testimony of the
Chairman and the Director of the Division of Corporate Regulation
before the special subcommittee which conducted hearings on the
bill," the Commission opposed the enactment of section 5. We took
issue with the assertions that the Public Utility Holding Company
Act retarded the development of worthy projects and that the Act
was not intended to apply to such situations as Pacific Northwest
Power Co. and its sponsors and did so only by an accident of definition.
We asserted, rather, that Holding Company Act regulation had been
wholesome and beneficial in its effects upon companies subject to it,
and that the Pacific Northwest situation was clearly within the intent
and purposes of the Act. We said, in part:
Neither the purpose nor the effect of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 is the impeding of the development of low-cost electric energy in ample
and growing supply to meet the needs of consumers. Rather, the act serves to
channel such development so as to prevent concomitant evils and abuses whieh
Congress found to exist in the organization, control, and financing of pubIicutility holding companies and their subsidiary companies. It is corrective but
not punitive or merely repressive. Its standards are flexible, and it has been
flexibly administered to permit and encourage healthy growth of the utility
industry to serve our expanding economy. The Commission believes the act has
had the desired result,"

Subsequently we submitted a written Supplementary Statement 8
and further testimony 9 in response to points raised and questions
asked during the hearings. Our written rna terial undertook to summarize the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission by demonstrating
that the Pacific Northwest Power Co. situation was within the purposes
of the Act and that regulation by this Commission would not be
merely repetitive of State regulation or that of some other Federal

agency. vVe also examined the sponsors' apparent standing as to
qualifications for exemption under any of the subparagraphs of section 3 (a). Certain obvious difficulties appeared with regard to one
or more of the sponsors because of foreign incorporation or combined
electric and gas operation, although the latter would be more of a
problem for a registered company than an obstacle to exemption.
As a principal illustration of an aspect of the Pacific Northwest
Power situation upon which the Holding Company Act might come
to bear, we analyzed the capital structures of the four sponsors and
the adverse effect upon their debt-equity ratios which would result
from their announced plans for financing the hydroelectric projects.
This was followed by an exposition of the importance of capitalization
ratios to sound financing and of the Commission's concern with these
ratios.
On May 24, 1956, Senator Pastore, chairman of the Subcommittee
of the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce conducting hearings on the bill, announced that he and Senator Potter
had agreed to delete section 5 from their bill. This was done, and
the amendment proposed in section 5 was not revived.
Whereas section 5 was proposed to meet the desires of the Pacific
K orthwest Power group, section 4 was designed to satisfy the sponsors of Power Reactor Development Co., sometimes referred to as
the Detroit Edison Co. project. The section was substantially revised in the form of a "substitute bill." which was then reported out
favorably by the subcommittee, referred by the full committee to the
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, and reported out favorably to
both houses as part of a three-unit program to further the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
The first of these units was a revised version of the Gore bill, which
would have directed the Atomic Energy Commission to construct
power reactors on its own installations. The second would have provided for government insurance to private owners of licensed power
reactors against public liability arising from a major catastrophe.
The third unit was the revised section 4 of S. 2643. When the first
unit failed to be adopted by the Congress, the other two units failed
with it.!"
The Commission's position toward section 4 of S. 2643 consisted of
two elements. First, in commenting upon the proposed granting of
an automatic and permanent exemption for nuclear reactor companies
and their sponsors, the Commission took the position that the bill
went further than any demonstrable need to accomplish the objective
of nuclear power development. In our opinion, there was in fact no
just need for exemption from the Act's provisions which could not be

our written comments we observed:

15
In

No atomic power project has been impeded by the act as it is presently in
effect. The only such project to date which has been submitted to the Commission for action has been granted the desired appro, als and exemptions by
reasonable application of the present statute and the established standards and
policies thereunder.U

The reference was to Yankee Atomic Electric GoY wherein we permitted, under the present statutory standards, joint participation
by a large group of utility companies in atomic reactor development
on a regional basis.
The Commission recognized, of course, that where a reactor project
was sponsored in part by industrial companies and in part by utility
companies remote geographically from the reactor site, the approach
of Yankee Atomic Electric Co. would not be available. In such a
situation the Commission believed that, although the substantive effect
of exemption would be consistent with the principles of the Act, the
exemption should be available only on Commission order, and it should
be terminable upon expiration of the research and development phase
of the proj ect.
Secondly, the Commission called attention to two other important
aspects of the proposed legislation. Since Power Reactor Development Co. is a nonprofit corporation whose approximately 25 sponsors
hold 1 membership apiece, with 1 vote, instead of stock, no one company will have 10 percent or more of its voting securities, as required
to qualify as a prima facie holding company under section 2 (a) (7)
(A) of the Act. Accordingly, no member company can be a holding
company with regard to Power Reactor unless the Commission first
finds actual control or controlling influence after a formal proceeding
with full opportunity for hearing and judicial review. It also appeared that the Commission could declare, by rule or order, that a
company like Power Reactor is not an electric utility company, pursuant to the last sentence of section 2 (a) (3) of the Act. The Commission proceeded to draft such a rule and published it for public
comment on June 15,1956.13 After studying the comments submitted
and incorporating several of their suggestions in a revised version, the
rule was adopted as an amendment to rule U-7 on July 13, 1956Y
Despite this demonstration of what could be achieved under the
present Act in furthering the development of nuclear energy projects
for peaceful purposes, the Detroit Edison group persisted in the
view that its reactor project was feasible only if the sponsors had

an express exemption from the Act which was not based upon Commission action or discretion. The revised, or substitute, bill, however, as ultimately approved by the Senate Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce and the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy,
did limit the exemption to a nonprofit corporation and provided for
termination of the exemption upon a finding by the Atomic Energy
Commission that the project was no longer primarily devoted to
research and development." Although the Commission still believes
that such legislation is unnecessary, it did not object to its adoption
in the revised form. As noted above, however, the proposed legislation failed.
In addition to testifying twice on this matter before Senator
Pastore's subcommittee, and submitting three written statements,
the Commission also appeared before the Subcommittee on Public
Works of the House Committee on Appropriations, to explain its
views on the proposed legislation. The Chairman, the General
Counsel, and the Director of the Division of Corporate Regulation
appeared on behalf of the Commission.
The Commission believes that its opposition to section 5 of S. 2643
in its original form was instrumental in dissuading the Congress from
what would have been the first serious encroachment upon the principles and policies embodied in the Public Utility Holding Company
Act." We believe that these principles and policies, established by
the Congress and administered by the Commission, have been of
vital influence in the rehabilitation of the financial condition of large
segments of the electric and gas utility industry, thus permitting
them to obtain from the investing public the large amounts of new
capital needed for their huge expansion programs. We believe that
these principles and policies have been beneficial to investors, consumers and the public, and have also served to enhance the effectiveness of the state regulatory agencies. We believe the Congress should
be slow to permit departure from these principles and policies and
we are certain, so far as any privately sponsored nuclear reactor
project that has as yet been brought to our attention, that they do
not interfere with the development of nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes. Rather, we believe that the Commission has made a
significant contribution, consistent with the policies of the Congress
expressed both in the Atomic Energy Acts and the Public Utility
Holding Company Act, to the development of nuclear power for
peaceful purposes in our Yankee Atomic Electric Co. decision and in
our amendment to rule U-7.

Exemption for General Public Utilities Corp.

H. R. 10624, introduced by Representative Arthur G. Klein, chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives provided that no law of the United States shall be held to
require the General Public Utilities Corp., a holding company registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to
divest itself of any interest in the Manila Electric Co., a company
engaged in the production and distribution of electricity in the
Republic of the Philippines. The purpose of the bill was to exempt
these companies from section 11 (b) (1) of the Holding Company
Act, which requires that each public utility holding company system
be geographically integrated. The Philippine Government had expressed apprehension that less favorable management might result
from divestment of control of the Manila Electric Co. by the General
Public Utilities Corp. and had expressed an interest in a tentative
suggestion of GPU for the construction of a nuclear power generating
plant in the Philippines by the American Company.
In its memorandum on the bill," the Commission stated:
The Commission opposes enactment of H. R. 10624 because it will permit
General Public Utilities Corp. (GPU) to retain its Philippine subsidiaries in
addition to its integrated domestic electric utility system. This would be
inconsistent with the principles stated by the Congress in the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1!l35 and the Commission has not been presented with
any considerations which would justify departing from those principles in this
particular situation.
It is the Commission's opinion that the reasonable needs
of all persons and interests concerned can be well served by divestment from
GPU of its Philippine properties in an appropriate manner.

We summarized the history of GPU with respect to its Philippine
subsidiaries. Our original order of divestment was entered against
the bankruptcy trustees of GPU's predecessors, Associated Gas &
Electric Corp. and Associated Gas & Electric Co., in 1942 as a result
of the section 11 (b) (1) proceedings commenced the previous year. IS
Later, in 1945, the two Philippine subsidiaries were removed from the
list of companies to be divested because of the extensive war damage
to the physical properties and the urgent need for rehabilitation."
In 1951 the Commission reopened the proceedings and reinstated the
divestment order." Under the provisions of section 11 (e) of the
Act, GPU was required to comply with the divestment order within
1 year from December 28, 1951, but it had not done so.

Our memorandum also traced the legislative history and purpose of
section 11 (b) (1) and its effect on foreign properties. We concluded
that the Act embodied a deliberate policy against combining domestic
and noncontiguous foreign utility properties in a single holding company system. This policy was based upon the disruptive effect that
foreign properties have on the market performance of the system's
publicly held securities and the diversionary effect upon management
of having foreign as well as domestic commitments and responsibilities.
We stated that GPU had financed the rehabilitation of the Philippine
properties from retained earnings and borrowings in the Philippines
and in recent years had been able to take up substantial profits. On
the other hand, if GPU did advance its own funds to the Philippines
it would to a degrce be causing its domestic customers to help finance
Philippine development. This appeared to demonstrate the wisdom
of Congress in 1935 in prohibiting such combinations of properties.
In response to certain fears expressed by GPU's management, the
Commission pointed out that the divestment could be accomplished
by the creation of a new corporation to hold the stock of the Philippine
subsidiaries and whose stock would be distributed to GPU's stockholders. This device would give GPU's stockholders the protection
of domestic supervisory management, would do much to assure continued responsible management, and would provide an American
entity for assistance in obtaining financial and technical assistance.
The Commission acknowledged, however, that whatever significance
this matter had for United States foreign relations was within the
special competence of other Government departments and agencies.
Nevertheless it believed that divestment could be achieved in a manner
which would protect such interests.
The Department of State advised the subcommittee that in the
opinion of the Philippine Government a new holding company similar
to the one suggested by the Commission would not have sufficient
credit or technical expertness, that GPU's background, experience,
and knowledge of the Philippines might be lost, and that divestment
might cause abandonment of GPU's tentative plans for a nuclear
power project in the Philippines. The committee therefore concluded:
While the Commission has suggested that these objectives which are without
the competence of its [ursidiction, as well as the purposes of the Utility Act,
might be met by the stock of Manila being transferred to a newly created American
holding company, and the stock of that company in turn distributed to the stockholders of General Public Utilities, we do not find on the record that this will
assure to the degree of satisfaction necessary, the attainment of the objectives of
rendering the maximum firaneial and managerial assistance possible to this
highly important utility in the Philippines, with which country we have been
and are bound with such ties of friendship and amity and which appears to favor
continued ownership of the Manila Electric Co. by the General Public Utilities
Corp.

The committee is opposed to legislation which would amend the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 and which would be construed as a precedent for
opening up that act to exceptions in other situations.
The committee believ es
that enactment of H. R. 10624 is desirable under the special circumstances which
prevail in this particular situation and the committee, accordingly, recommends
early action on this legislation."

The Senate committee, while stating that it did not desire to create
a precedent for legislation exempting particular holding companies
from provisions of the Act, noted that GPU was now the only integrated domestic system with a separate foreign subsidiary, and
concurred in the views of the House committee." The bill became
law on August 9, 1956.23
Other Legislative Proposals

A substantial amount of time of the Commission was also devoted to
matters pertaining to legislative proposals referred to the Commission
for comment and to congressional inquiries. During fiscal year 1956,
19 legislative proposals were analyzed and reports submitted on them
to the appropriate congressional committees at their request, as compared with ten in the prior fiscal year. In addition, numerous congressional inquiries were received and answered relating to matters
other than specific legislative proposals.

formed to the standards set forth in the Act. In this connection, allegations were made that the Commission had prejudged this matter
because prehearing conferences had been held with other interested
governmental agencies and the companies which were parties to the
contract. As was explained to the subcommittee these conferences
were in accord with long-established and publicized procedures of the
Commission 26 which have been recognized as a desirable part of the
administrative process. Thus, in a motion filed during the Commission proceedings, counsel for the State of Tennessee, et al. stated:
The parties making this motion in no way suggest that any impropriety would
attach to such informal discussions on the part of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and its staff, if such informal discussions have taken place. Indeed,
the published procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission expressly
make provision for informal advice and assistance (17 C. F. R. ~~202.1-202.3),
and it is recognized that this is a desirable part of the administrative process.
Moreover, in past decisions the Securities and Exchange Commission has referred with approval to the helpful practice of its staff in making itself available
for informal conferences at the instance of interested persons. See The United
Corporation, Holding Company Act Release No. 10614 (1951), pp. 54-55, and
cases cited.

The Commission representatives also pointed out to the committee
that similar conferences were had with the Atomic Energy Commission
and others in 1952 in connection with the Ohio Valley Electric Go.
proceeding, which raised questions under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act similar to those involved in the Mississippi Valley
Generating Co. case. Similar conferences were held in the Electric
Energy, Inc. matter, which included similar questions.
The fact that prehearing conferences are held for the purpose of
explaining standards which must be met under the Act in no way alters
the fact that the Commission ultimately decides cases solely on the
record developed in public hearings. This fact was made clear by the
testimony of the Chairman of the Commission and staff members who
appeared before the subcommittee and by contemporaneous memoranda submitted to the subcommittee covering the conferences involved. These memoranda stated that it was impossible to state
what the Commission's position would be with respect to various
questions involved until the Commission had acted after a hearing in
its quasi-judicial capacity.
The subcommittee also questioned the Commission's sitting en banc
in the equity financing proceedings. As the committee was informed,
the Atomic Energy Commission's power contract with the Mississippi
Valley Generating Co. contained a deadline date of February 15, 1955,

and failure of the Commission promptly to process the application
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act might have deprived
the parties of their rights to a timely legal determination under the
statute. Accordingly, the decision to sit en bane was made in an effort
to provide the parties with an expeditious statutory hearing.
The Commission from the very inception of its administration under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act recognized the importance of
speed in disposing of financing applications brought before it. As the
Commission pointed out in July 1945 in its comments to the Congress
on the then pending Administrative Procedure Act:
It should be emphasized that time is frequently of the essence in dealing with the
financial transactions which are subject to the licensmg jurisdiction of the Commission under the Holding Company Act and, as pointed out in the appendix,
it may not always be possible to distinguish or to separate licensing from nonlicensing proceedings.
* * * The need for speed in the typical cases under the
Holding Company Act, such as security issues, acquisitions and sale of properties,
declarations of dividends and the like is inherent in the nature of the transactions
involved and the risk of changing conditions in the market.
It is necessary to
meet the needs of the parties before the Commission, not to satisfy any predilection of the Commission for hasty decision. In most of such cases delay would be
equivalent to a denial of the agency clearance sought.

En bane hearings by the Commission also were specifically contemplated by the Congress. Both the Holding Company Act, section 19,
and the Administrative Procedure Act, section 7 (a), make provision
for full Commission hearings."
The subcommittee also inquired into the reasons for the Commission's ordering a 3-day adjournment of the then pending Mississippi
Valley Generating Co. debt financing proceedings. As made clear by
the testimony of the Chairman (given on the basis of an opinion of the
Attorney General as to the propriety of his testifying about the request
of the Assistant to the President for the adjournmentj-" in granting
the temporary adjournment the Commission acted solely in an effort to
provide the United States Government with a reasonable opportunity
to consult with its counsel.

published by this subcommittee on November 1, 1955. Thereafter,
the Commission submitted supplemental material to the subcommittee
from time to time, and the Chairman, other members of the Commission and staff members appeared and testified at its hearings on J anuary 31, 1956. The Commission's general counsel also participated
in a panel discussion held by the subcommittee in June 1956 on legal
questions raised by the subcommittee in connection with the availability of such information.
The Commission advised the subcommittee that the statutes it administers are concerned largely with making information available to
the public. The great bulk of the information on file with the Commission is public information. In addition, there is a limited amount
of information which cannot be made generally available for the public.
This includes information in the Commission's files which Congress
specifically provided should be kept confidential where disclosures
would be contrary to the public interest, as in the case of trade secrets
and similar material." The remaining nonpublic categories of information in the Commission's files consist primarily of two kinds: (1) the
files of internal Commission documents and memoranda and correspondence, and (2) the Commission's investigation files developed as
a result of information received by the Commission indicating violations of the statutes administered and enforced by the Commission.
In the latter respect, the Commission's enforcement functions are the
same as those performed by the other Federal law enforcement agencies
in their respective fields, such as the Intelligence Unit of the Treasury
Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice, and the courts have equated the Commission's enforcement functions to those performed by a grand jury, which are
not open to the public.
Even with respect to information which is not generally available
to the public, the Commission carefully considers every request therefor and, to the extent compatible with the public interest and the
performance of the highly important enforcement functions entrusted
to the Commission, makes every effort to make available all the
information that it possibly can. In those instances where full public
disclosure would be inappropriate, the Commission nevertheless generally makes this information available to congressional committees
to the fullest extent possible consistent with the statutory duties
imposed upon it by the statutes it administers and appropriate safeguards by the Congressional Committees to assure against the harm
to the public interest from general public release of such information.
One of the basic purposes of the privacy of this data is to provide

against exposure to the public of persons entirely innocent of wrongdoing.
All of the Commission's releases covering its decisions, rule making
activities, and other matters are currently sent to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency and the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, the committees having jurisdiction with
respect to the statutes administered by the Commission under the
Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. The Commission's published
statistical reports on plant and equipment, savings, securities offerings,
and working capital, together with related information are supplied
to the Joint Committee on the Economic Report. The Quarterly
Financial Report for Manufacturing Corporations, published jointly
with the Federal Trade Commission, is supplied to the Joint
Committee on Taxation. Much other information is supplied from
time to time to Congressional Committees.
As the Commission advised the subcommittee, it attempts to
cooperate in every way with the press and general public to make
information conveniently available. The Commissioners and the
Commission's Secretary, who serves also as public information officer,
are available for discussion with the press in Washington, D. C., at
all times. In addition to answering inquiries about all phases of the
Commission's activities, the Commission's Secretary prepares daily,
for the information of the press and the public, announcements of
Commission action, a daily digest or summary of all important Commission decisions, orders, and regulations and of all financing proposals
filed with the Commission; and his office prepares a "gist" of Commission decisions and orders (releases) which are distributed to its
mailing lists. The members of the Commission and our regional administrators frequently hold conferences with the prCRSin cities away
from Washington in order to keep the public throughout the country
advised of the Commission's activities. In all, hundreds of press contacts are had by Commission personnel in the course of a year and we
consider this a vital part of our program of information and protection
for the investing public.
The Chairman, the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance,
the General Counsel and other members of the Commission and
staff members also testified before the subcommittee with regard
to questions which had been raised concerning the Commission's
proxy rules and the assertion that the Commission's processing
of proxy soliciting material in the form of speeches, press releases,
newspaper advertisements, and radio and television scripts constituted an infringement upon the constitutional guarantees of freedom
of speech and press. It was made clear to the subcommittee that
the purpose of these rules is to make information available to security

COMMISSION

holders in reliable form so that they may make an informed judgment in exercising their voting rights in corporate matters. The
Commission also submitted to the committee various statements
which it had received from the press endorsing the purpose and
operation of proxy rules, including expressions of approval by responsible press representatives of the revision which provided that press
releases, prepared radio and television broadcasts and speeches need
not be filed with the Commission prior to their use, although they
remain subject to the requirement that they must not be misleading.
The Commission pointed out that its proxy regulations were wholly
in accord with its statutory powers and responsibilities and Congressional policy and that this position was fully sustained during the
past year by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in S. E. O.
v. May et al., 229 F. 2d 123 (1956). In this landmark case, the
Court, in affirming the judgment of the District Court," squarely
rejected the contention that the proxy regulations were unconstitutional and also rejected the argument "that stockholder disputes
should be viewed in the eyes of the law just as are political contests,
with each side free to hurl charges with comparative unrestraint, the
assumption being that the opposing side is then at liberty to refute
and thus effectively deflate the 'campaign oratory' of its adversary."
The Court stressed that this "was not the policy of Congress as
enacted in the Securities Exchange Act * * * (and that) Congress
has clearly entrusted to the Commission the duty of protecting the
investing public against misleading statements made in the course of
a struggle for corporate control." 30
The subcommittee inquired into the Commission's handling of
classified information and its use of the term "confidential" as a
restriction on the diselosure of information. Executive Order 10501,
issued Nov. 5,1953, 3CFR 115(1953),withdrew the Commission's power
to classify information and limited the use of the terms "confidential,"
"secret," and "top secret." On September 8, 1955, the Commission,
pursuant to this Executive order, amended its rule 171 under the
Securities Act of 1933, rule X-24B-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934,and rule U-105 under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, to provide that confidential information should no longer
be filed with it. It also amended various rules so that the term
"confidential" would no longer be used, without qualification, as a
designation of nondefense information." The Commission has provided administratively for the use of the term "nonpublic," or other
appropriate terms, on investigation and other files that are not

Senate Subcommittee on Welfare and Pension Funds of the Committee on
Labor and Public Welfare

On July 20, 1955, at the request of the Subcommittee on Welfare
and Pension Funds of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public
Welfare, Commissioner A. Jackson Goodwin, Jr., and members of the
Staff appeared on behalf of the Commission before the subcommittee
to testify in connection with the subcommittee's investigation of
welfare and pension plans."
The testimony given by the Commission member and staff covered
the survey of pension plans then being made by the Commission, the
registration experience which the Commission had with certain pension
plans under the Securities Act of 1933, an explanation of the Commission's securities registration procedures, and a comparison between
the operation of a pension fund and an investment company registered
with the Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
After this testimony was given, the Commission's survey of pension
funds operated by companies registered with the Commission was
completed."
The survey, which covered about 2,000 self-operated
pension funds, was based upon questionnaires distributed to the companies involved. The subcommittee was particularly concerned with
the extent to which self-operated funds were invested in the company's
own stock.
It was pointed out to the subcommittee that the Commission has
had registration experience over the past several years with some
pension plans. These plans, which usually involve either a stock
purchase plan or a stock option plan, are registered pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933.
The Subcommittee on Welfare and Pension Funds prepared and
filed a final report to the Congress in which the subcommittee recommended the adoption of legislation to bring about the correction of
abuses which it had uncovered among welfare and pension funds."
The subcommittee further recommended that the Securities and
Exchange Commission be designated as the governmental agency to
administer the proposed legislation.
The final report states, at page 75:

experience and its organizational setup.

Senator Paul Douglas, chairman of the subcommittee, introduced
S. 3873 in the Senate on May 17, 1956. This bill, which is called the
Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, provided for the Securities
and Exchange Commission to administer the statute.
The Congress
adjourned without taking any action on this bill.

PART III
REVISIONS

OF RULES AND FORMS

During 1956, as in the two preceding years, great effort was devoted
to the Commission's program of revising its rules and forms to keep
abreast of constantly changing techniques and conditions in the
dynamic securities markets. This is part of an over all program of
rule and form revisions undertaken by the Commission in 1953.1
Now, for the first time, the Commission's promulgated changes in its
Forms S-l, 10, 8-B, 8-0, and Regulation X-14, have coordinated and
made uniform, so far as possible, the information required in the basic
registration forms for new issues under the Securities Act and for issues
to be listed and traded on national securities exchanges under the
Exchange Act, and for proxy statements under the Exchange Act.
The object of this program has been the simplification of forms to
eliminate duplicate filings arising under different provisions of the
Federal securities laws, and relieve persons subject to these laws of
unnecessary burdens and costs without the sacrifice of any safeguards
necessary for the protection of investors.
Soon after the conclusion of the fiscal year on June 30, 1956, the
Commission has undertaken to bring up to date additional forms used
for registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Such proposals
include the revision of Form S--4 used by closed-end management
investment companies; 2 Form S-3 used by certain exploratory mining
companies and incorporation of Form 8-11 therein which is also prescribed for mining companies in the development stage, 3 and Form 8-6
used by unit investment trusts currently issuing securities including
periodic payment plan certificates. The Commission also has adopted
a summary prospectus rule which could be used by registrants using
Forms S-l and S-9.4 Because of the legal and technical complexities
of the subject matter, this program has engaged a large amount of
the time of the commissioners and its senior professional staff. Many
of these revisions arc outlined below. Others, which arc of primary
interest to special groups, such as brokers and dealers and public
utility holding companies, arc described in the parts of this report
dealing with the regulation of the activities of such persons and
companies.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

THE SMALL ISSUES EXEMPTION-NEW

COMMISSION

ISSUES OF $300,000 OR LESS

The special concern of the Securities and Exchange Commission
with small business is in the area of public financing. Under the
Securities Act any company which desires to raise capital by means
of a public offering of its securities where the mails or instruments
of interstate commerce are to be used must register the securities
with the Securities and Exchange Commission unless a specific
exemption from registration is available. Certain specific exemptions
are provided by sections 3 (a) and 4 of the Act. In addition, section
3 (b) of the Act provides that the Commission may from time to
time by its rules and regulations, and subject to such terms and
conditions as may be prescribed, add to the classes of securities
exempted in section 3 (a) of the Act (such as securities issued by the
United States or other governmental organizations, commercial paper,
building and loan association obligations, securities the issuance of
which is subject to approval under the Interstate Commerce Act,
and certain other specifically exempted classes), any class of securities
if the Commission finds that enforcement of the registration provisions
of the Act with respect to such securities "is not necessary in the public
interest and for the protection of investors by reason of the small
amount involved or the limited character of the public offering,"
provided no issue shall be exempted the aggregate offering price of
which exceeds $300,000.
The most important regulation adopted by the Commission specifying the terms and conditions on which such exemption from registration would be available is called regulation A. On July 23, 1956,
this exemptive regulation was substantially revised by the Commission
to increase the legal protection it affords the investing public and
make it clear and simple for companies to qualify under it.
The problem presented to the Commission in promulgating a
workable regulation spelling out the terms and conditions upon which
an exemption from registration is available for small issues of securities
is twofold. First, it is important not to place such burdensome requirements upon small business as to discourage the raising of a limited
amount of capital. On the other hand, the statute places the responsibility upon the Commission to protect the public from misrepresentation and fraud in the offer and sale of securities.
A number of changes effected by the revision are as follows.
1. The revised regulation as adopted on July 23, 1956, provides
that Canadian issues, formerly exempted under a separate regulation,
regulation D, are now treated the same as domestic issues insofar
as the terms and conditions for the exemption are concerned, except
that Canadian issues of companies without a net earnings record now
have to be qualified for offering in the Canadian Province in which

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

29

the company has its principal place of business. This provision has
the effect of consolidating the old regulation D with the new regulation A and adds to the public investors' protection by requiring the
Canadian promotional issuer to meet the standards of the applicable
Provincial securities laws.
2. The Commission is vitally concerned with the problems presented by promotional companies in offering securities to the public.
It has found that certain underwriters and promoters appear to be
the organizing force behind many new issuers and the new revision
was designed to eliminate this condition. Previously, no exemption
was available if any of the directors, officers, affiliates, predecessors,
promoters, or principal underwriters of the issuer had been convicted
within 5 years previously of a crime involving securities transactions
or had been enjoined in connection with securities transactions.
Under the revised regulation, the exemption is not available if any
such conviction within the previous 10 years or injunction exists as
to any underwriter of the issuer or any partner, director or officer
of such underwriter. In addition, the exemption is not now available if the Commission, a national securities dealers association,
or a national securities exchange has issued a disciplinary order
against any underwriter of the issuer or any partner, director or
officer of any such underwriter. Furthermore, no exemption is now
available if any underwriter of the issuer, or any partner, officer
or director of such underwriter was the underwriter of any other
issue which is the subject of a pending suspension order proceeding
or is the subject of an outstanding suspension order issued by the
Commission within the past 5 years.
3. Another problem the present revision seeks to correct is the
threat of the "bail-out" by the promoters and insiders of their securities holdings. Regulation A as revised now provides that offerings
by companies newly organized and those without a net income for
at least one of the last two fiscal years are subject to special requirements insofar as the exemption is concerned. Only the issuer itself
in such a case may use the exemption, which means that an offering
by a security holder of his own securities in such a company cannot
be made under the regulation. An offering circular must be used
by such a company even if the amount of the offering is less than
$50,000, whereas other issuers need not use an offering circular for
any offering below that amount. In computing the maximum
amount of $300,000 under the exemption, such a company has to
include all securities previously issued for assets or services and all
securities issued or proposed to be issued to directors, officers, promoters, or underwriters unless such securities are effectively kept off
the market, by escrow or otherwise, for 1 year after the commencement of the offering under the regulation.

30

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

4. The notification to be flied by an issuer on Form I-A with the
appropriate regional office of the Commission was revised to require
certain additional information which will assist the Commission staff
in its determination as to the availability of the exemption and in its
review of the offering circular for the detection of false and misleading
statements. In addition to the previously required filing of any
underwriting contract and the consent of the underwriters to be
named in the offering circular, there are now required to be filed as
exhibits copies of the instrument describing the rights of holders of the
securities being offered and consents by engineers, geologists, appraisers, accountants, and other experts to be named in the notification or offering circular where reference to them as experts or to their
opinions is made.
5. The exemptive regulation includes a guide (schedule I of Form
I-A) to a company in the preparation of an offering circular, and limits
the information required to be set forth in an offering circular to what
may be called "bare bones" facts concerning the company and the
securities to be offered. Thus the offering price per share to the
public, underwriting commissions and proceeds to the company are
to be set forth on the outside front cover page. A brief description
is required of the proposed manner of distribution, whether by or
through underwriters or otherwise. The purposes for which the
proceeds will be used must be stated. The significant terms of the
securities including dividend rights in the case of equity securities and
interest rate in the case of debt securities are to be set forth. A
brief description of the business or proposed business to be done and
the names and addresses of -directors and officers and any persons
controlling the issuer must be given; so must the aggregate remunera-

tion paid or to be paid to directors and officers as a group, annual
remuneration of the three highest paid officers and the interest of all
such persons in material transactions with the company. Options
or warrants outstanding or proposed to be granted to purchase
securities of the issuer must be revealed. Appropriate financial
statements are called for but at the present time these statements
need not be certified by independent public accountants. All of the
information required in the notification and offering circular is readily
available to the company desiring to use the regulation.
Rule 256 (e) further specifies that in no event shall an offering
circular be used if it is false and misleading under the circumstances
then existing.
Although most businesses will find it expedient to employ an
attorney to prepare the filing, the instructions are sufficiently explicit
that many small enterprises can prepare their own filing without the
employment of counsel. These more complete instructions in large

TWENTY-SECOND

31

measure set forth the administrative practice of the Oommission in
reviewing filings under the previous regulations.
6. Unless the offering terminate's sooner, the offering circular now
has to be revised every 9 months except that offering circulars for
employee purchase plans must he revised every 12 months.
7. A report of sales on Form 2-.\.. now must be made within 30
days after the end of each 6-month period following the date of the
original offering circular until tho offering has been terminated.
Formerly, such report was duo on a date computed with reference to
the commencement of the offering which date was not known in advance to the Commission staff. Form 2-A has bCPIl revised to call for
additional information which will assist the Commission staff in its
enforcement of the regulation and supply information us to use of the
proceeds for the public investor.
8. There was added as a ground for suspension of the exemption
any failure by the issuer or any of its promoters, officers, directors or
underwriters, to cooperate in any investigation by the Commission
of an offering under the regulation."
Proposed

Further

Amendment

of Regulation

The Oommission also announced its belief that further consideration should be given to revisions which would make the exemption
available only to issuers and offerings meeting specified standards
based either upon a record of net earnings on the part. of the issuer or
upon a limitation of the number of units of securities that might be
issued pursuant to the exemption, as distinct from the aggregate
offering price of the' securities to be' offered. The Commission's
announcement discussed alternative bases and invited public comment
thereupon."
The Oommission also has under consideration a proposed amendment to regulation A which would provide that the financial statements required to be contained in offering circulars be certified by
independent public or certified public accountants and would also
require that the certifying accountant consent to the use of his name
on the certificate.?

COMMISSION

Exchange Act of 1934, was withdrawn July 2, 1956. By reason of
the Commission's general simplification of its forms and procedures
for registration under the Securities Act and because class registration
of securities on an exchange has been provided under the Exchange
Act the need for adoption of the proposal in the public interest was
removed."
Form S-l.-As noted above, the Commission's program begun in
1953 directed to the simplification of forms and the elimination of duplication in filings has resulted in the revision of Form S-1. This
form, the basic form generally used for compliance ;by commercial
and industrial companies with the registration provisions of the
Securities Act, was revised effective October 25, 1955, in order to conform its requirements to those of the Commission's proxy rules, and
the registration and annual reporting forms for securities registered
for trading on securities exchanges and to clarify the disclosure requirements in the light of the Commission's experience in reviewing
registration statements and of the practice of registrants using the
form. In conjunction with this revision of Form S-l, the Commission adopted revisions of Forms 10, 8-B and 8-C, rescinded Forms 12
and 12-A, and amended rule X-12B-2, all of which were concurrently
promulgated resulting in conforming these filing processes, thus completing the Commission's objective under the proxy rules and registration statements and eliminating costly and time-consuming duplication in these areas. In the revised form, those items which
experience demonstrated had not been fully understood by registrants
are required to be stated more clearly and in more detail and the
treatment of stock options was revised to obtain more complete information as to the aggregate amount of options outstanding.
At
the same time, an amendment was made to rule 405, which added
the definition of the terms "associate" and "voting securities." Rule
424 (e) was also amended to provide for the filing of three copies of any
prospectus used before the effective date and provision was made for
additional copies of the registration statement to be filed to facilitate
examination thereof by the Division of Corporation Finance."
Forms 10, 8-B and 8-C.-The
revision of Form S-l was accompanied on October 25, 1955, for the reasons stated in the discussion
thereof above, by corresponding revisions of Form 10, the principal
form for the registration of securities on an exchange under the
Securities Exchange Act; Form 8-B which is used for such registration
by certain successor issuers; and Form 8-C for registration of securities on an additional exchange.P

Forms 12 and 12-A; and Supplement S-T.-As a further part of
the program of coordination and clarification of forms made effective
October 25, 1955, Forms 12 and 12-A were rescinded and incorporated
in revised Form lOY Forms 12 and 12-A were available for issuers,
subject to the annual reporting requirements of the Interstate Commerce Commission or Federal Communications Commission, which
were registering or amending their registration for listing of securities
on a national securities exchange.
At the same time, supplement S-T, which it had been necessary to
file for the qualification of trust indentures under the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939 in cases where the indenture securities were required to be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, was rescinded because the
significant information called for by this supplement is now included
elsewhere in the registration statement and otherwise made available
to the Commission."
REVISION OF PROXY RULES

Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, generally speaking,
makes it unlawful for any person to solicit by the use of the mails, the
facilities of interstate commerce or of a national securities exchange or
otherwise, a proxy, consent, or authorization in respect of securities
listed on a national securities exchange in contravention of rules and
regulations promulgated by the Commission for the protection of
investors.
Pursuant to this authority, the Commission since 1938 has had in
effect its regulation X-14, usually known as the "proxy rules." This
regulation has been amended from time to time, as the Commission's
experience has suggested the necessity to make the rules more consonant with changes and developments in corporation practices or for
the protection of investors. The basic purpose of the regulation has
been to protect investors by means of disclosures of material facts
important to an analysis of matters presented to shareholders for their
vote. The theory of the rules is that if all such facts are clearly presented to the investor or shareholder he will be capable of arriving at
his own decisions.
In general structure, the rules require specific disclosures in respect
of specific corporate matters, including the election of directors. The
specified disclosures must be embodied in a "proxy statement" to be
furnished to every security holder whose proxy is solicited. The
cardinal requirement of the rules is that there be no misleading statements of facts nor any omission of material facts necessary to make the
facts stated not misleading under the circumstances.

Compliance with the rules is enforced!by requiring the proxy statement in preliminary form to be filed with the Commission and withheld from use for 10 days unless the Commission permits its prior
issuance to the shareholders. Supplemental soliciting material is
also required to be filed but may be used within two business days after
the filing.
Recent History

Principally the revisions involve an expansion of the rules to deal
more specifically with proxy contests for the election of directors of
listed companies. Prior to the adoption of these revisions their
general scope had been the subject of testimony by the Commission's
representatives before the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency in connection with its study of the stock market 13 and before
the subcommittee on securities which had been investigating proxy
contests. U In addition, the proposed rules were submitted for comment to all interested persons and companies. As a result of the
comments received, the proposals were again revised and finally
adopted .â€¢
Subsequent to their adoption, the revised rules were reviewed by
the subcornmittee." It is the Commission's opinion that the revised proxy rules as they now deal with proxy contests have worked
well and that they have been of material benefit to investors by providing them with the material to make an intelligent analysis of the
possible effects upon their investment of the purposes and motivations
of the contending forces in a proxy contest.
During the last 3 fiscal years there has been a rising frequency ill
the number of proxy contests for control of listed companies. In
part, these struggles derive from the increasing prosperity of the
country and the rise of new financial personalities who wish to obtain
control of listed companies. The source material upon which the
issues created by the opposing forces is usually based is almost invariably derived from the disclosures, financial, statistical and otherwise,
required by the reporting provisions of the Securities Exchange Act
in respect of listed companies. These required reports permit the
direct comparison of companies in like industries and comparisons of
managerial abilities and results. Because of the fact that the issues
are almost always derived from the reports filed with the Commission
by listed companies, our staff is in a unique position quickly to appraise
the accuracy and fairness of statistics and other financial comparisons
which almost universally are one of the important aspects of the
conduct of a proxy contest.

Perhaps more importantly, the many proxy contests have caused
a reexamination by the Commission of the efficacy of its rules in such
contests and a reaffirmation by the Commission and by the courts
of the necessity for Commission regulation of such contests to the
extent provided by section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Finally, during the course of the last 3 fiscal years the Commission has been faced with the problem of the extent to which its rulemaking power granted to it by section 14 (a) may, in the case of proxy
contests, be in conflict with the first umondrnent/s guarantees of
freedom of speech and of the press.
Use of Press, Television,

and Radio

A distinguishing feature of the proxy contests of the last 3 fiscal
years from those' in the' past has been the extensive use by the contending parties of all modern media of opinion formation and communication. Public relations experts are frequently retained to determine
the general strategy of the campaigns.
The appeal for the shareholder's votes has been increasingly made by means of radio, television,
and the public press. The press release, the press conference, and
speeches before shareholders themselves and before groups having
important influence upon shareholders have been a normal part of the
apparatus of the contests. Reprints of published material tending to
favor one group or the other have also been utilized. Furthermore,
the opposition groups in many cases have engaged in concealed financing devices in connection with the purchase of shares both by themselves and by others whose vote they seck. Specifically, such agreements include arrangements by the contestants to purchase shares of
others after they have been voted, agreements to guarantee profits
on the purchase of shares by those willing to vote for such group,
agreements to protect against loss and other contractual arrangements
for financing. Disclosure of these financing procedures is necessary
to enable shareholders properly to appraise the motivations of the
group which engages in them. Our new rules now req uire disclosure
of these financing arrangements, if any exist.
The intensity with which recent proxy contests have been fought
and the resort by the contestants to all possible media of communications have aroused a general public interest in such contests. As a
result, the interest of the press in these contests has been intense,
particularly because of the prominence of the companies control of
which has been the subject of the disputes.
The companies involved
have included the Nation's largest woolen manufacturer, its second
largest railroad, its second largest mail-order and morcliandising system, several other important railroads and a number of companies
of significance in their industries.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Legislative History

It is clear from the legislative history of section 14 (a) that the
Congress intended the Commission to insure adequate disclosure to
investors, not only in the case of the usual unilateral solicitations by
management but also in the case of proxy contests. The legislative
history of section 14 (a) indicates a specific concern by Congress with
the possibility that opposition groups might unseat management by
the use of unfair and misleading statements to procure shareholders'
votes. The overriding purpose of both the Securities Act and the
Securities Exchange Act is that our economy is best served only if
shareholders have information which is adequate and accurate so tha.t
decisions may be intelligent. Clearly, the decisions made by shareholders in the area of the selection of management for their companies
are as important to them and to the economy as the decisions they
make in connection 'with the purchase and sale of the securities they
hold. This view is not only sustained by the legislative history of
section 14 (a); the Commission has been vigorously affirmed in its
own judgment on this point by a recent decision of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit."
Misrepresen tations

Furthermore, there are important practical reasons why it is
essential in the interest of stockholder protection that the Commission
impose disclosure requirements to prevent misleading statements and
to insure a truthful exposition of material facts. If the Commission's
regulation is abandoned, experience teaches that misrepresentation of
fact will be countered by further misrepresentation of fact and distortion by distortion, the ultimate effect of which may be to deceive and
mislead the shareholder. a result completely antithetical to the basic
purpose of the Securities Exchange Act.
Patterns of attempted misrepresentation occur and reoccur in
proxy contests which focus upon the primary issue of the comparative
managerial ability and integrity of the two groups. Arguments are
made from complex financial statistics and other data, the analysis of
which is not too familiar to most investors. Statistical comparisons
are made purporting to show superiority or inferiority of management
to other groups or other companies supposed to be engaged in the same
general line of business. In short, statistics can be used to distort.
Illustrations of the type of misrepresentations which may prevail
in the absence of Commission regulation can be derived from those attempted in recent proxy contests. In a recent campaign for the control of the board of directors of a railroad, the group opposing management sought to illustrate the existing management's lack of ability
by means of an income account which included a sinking fund payment
II

S. E. C. v. Mau tf al., 229 F. (2d) 123 (C. A. 2d 1956).

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

37

as a charge against income, an accounting procedure totally opposed
to acceptable accounting practice. The result of this was to indicate
a loss in railroad operations for 6 years when, in fact, if the income
account was depicted in accordance with accepted accounting principles, losses occurred in only 2 of such years. The Oommission objected to this improper presentation.
In another case, misleading comparisons were sought to be made
by an opposing group in a contest for control of a railroad that the
company's stock had sold in 1929at $250 a share in contrast to its then
market price of about $25 per share. This statement was coupled
with the assertion that if the opposition group succeeded in its efforts
the stock would go to $100 and pay an $8 dividend. In view of the
pronounced changes that have occurred in our economy since 1929,
particularly in the growth of strongly competitive forces in the transportation industry such as automobiles and trucks, plus the fact that
the company had earned $8 a share only three times in its history, the
Oommission insisted upon the deletion from the solicitation material
of these comparisons.
In addition to the use of distorting statistics, two other misleading
devices have been attempted. These devices are totally at variance
with the tradition of the common law, with its insistence over the
centuries on a requirement of probative evidence subjected to intense
and objective tests as to veracity and accuracy. One is that of imputing guilt by association-often the most remote type of association.
The other, a corollary device, is the rhetorical question based on any
assumption for which there is no foundation in fact laid. This is the
"When did you stop beating your wife" question. This type of misrepresentation in proxy contests has been condemned by the courts
in an action brought by the Oommission as a violation of the Commission's rules forbidding misleading statements."
For example, a magazine which had published articles favorable
to the management was sought to be disparaged by the opposition
group, not on the ground of any illegal or immoral act which the magazine had committed but on the ground that it employed a law firm
one of the partners of which had been accused, although never convicted, of bribery of a Federal court. Similarly, an opposition group
soliciting requests for authority to call a special meeting to elect
directors was attacked' because two of the stockholders signing the
request who owned insignificant amounts of shares and who had
no connection with the formation and activities of the opposition
group, had been indicted for alleged tax violation. Similarly, a member of an opposition group has been attacked because he allegedly
joined with certain other persons of whom the management was critical

in contributing large sums to the political campaign of a candidate for
a public office.
The Commission, in carrying out the standards established by the
Congress against false and misleading statements in the use of proxy
soliciting material under the Exchange Act, objected to such misrepresentations. As a result they were not made.
Finally, if the parties are left to themselves free of Commission
regulation, their recourse to remedy misleading statements by their
opponents will be to the courts. This is a more cumbersome, costly
and dilatory procedure than the continuous administrative processing
of soliciting material by the Commission and its staff, a procedure
which tends to prevent, although it cannot guarantee, the presentation
of misleading statements.
This administrative procedure provides
for the correction of misleading statements and omissions discovered
to have been in subsequent material or by resolicitation. The staff's
corrective suggestions are almost invariably followed by the parties
with a minimum of disruption of the course of the campaign. The
Commission believes that its administrative procedure for resolving
these problems before corporate meetings are held is manifestly more
in the interest of the stockholder and the public interest than the more
cumbersome court proceedings.
Constitutionality

of the Proxy Rules

Of greater concern to the Commission has been the charge that its
regulation of proxy contests is violative of the constitutional guarantee
of freedom of speech and of the press. This charge arises out of the
fact that the rules, prior to the revision in January 1956, required
submission of all proposed soliciting material to the Commission prior
to its use in order to enable the Commission to determine whether the
material complied with the disclosure and other requirements of the
proxy rules. This problem, as has been indicated, has become increasingly important in recent proxy contests because of the use which
has been made by contending parties of press releases, press conferences and paid advertisements.
In answer to this charge it must be emphasized that neither the
Act nor the rules, in the Oommission's opinion, confer upon it the power
to restrain argument, debate, rhetoric or legitimate inference from
undisputed facts. Nor do the proxy rules contain any such restraints.
On the contrary, the courts have required the Commission to permit
a substantial degree of "contentious advocacy" in areas where underlying facts are not clear or arc subject to legitimate dispute and
argumentation.
The Oommission does not take sides in proxy
contests. It is not concerned with their outcome.
The Oommission, however, is concerned that statements presented
to stockholders be not misleading. Its rules specifically provide that

TWENTY -SECOND AN1\"'UAL REPORT

39

such facts as are asserted to exist by the contending parties must be
accurate and that factual statements made do not omit other facts
which are material to an intelligent determination of the meaning of
the disclosed facts. In this limited area it is clear that the Commission's activities do not contravene the first amendment. The Supreme
Court, in fact, in a recent case has clearly indicated that the first
amendment places no inhibition on legislation, such as the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (to which the Court specifically referred),
designed to prevent fraud or deceptions of the public in connection
with securities or otherwise."
Moreover, in its revised rules the Commission has expressly provided
that press releases, prepared radio and television broadcasts and
speeches nced not be filed with the Commission prior to their use,
although they remain subject to the cardinal requirement of our rule
that they must not be misleading. They must also be filed promptly
with the Commission after their use. Such material, of course, may
be submitted to the Commission prior to its use, if the contestant so
desires. A practical reason for this change in our rules, in addition
to the importance of safeguarding freedom of speech and freedom of
the press, is that time limitations and pressures of a proxy contest
frequently necessitate the use of these documents as quickly as possible. The Commission is gratified to report to the Congress on this
aspect of the thrust of its rules that responsible elements of the press
are now completely satisfied that our rules do not impinge upon the
freedom of the press or freedom of speech, particularly in view of the
fact that they impose no "prior restraints" on press releases, press
conferences and radio and television broadcasts and speeches."
Solicitation

Prior to the Formal Proxy Statement

Under the prior rules no solicitation could be made prior to the
actual dissemination to shareholders of the "proxy statement" required by the rules. However, ex...pcricnce in proxy contests has
demonstrated that discussion over as long a period of time as possible
is desirable and important from the point of view of the shareholders
and their ultimate understanding of the issues involved in the contests.
Therefore, in view of this obvious public interest, the Commission's
new rules for the first time permit pre-proxy statement solicitation,
but subject such solicitation to compliance with the rules, particularly

with a requirement that the interest and background of the participants
must be disclosed in such solicitation material and that such material
must not be misleading.
Disclosure of Identity of Participants

Another of the important purposes of the new rules is to bring all
of the participants in a proxy contest out on the stage to be gazed
upon by the shareholders; no participants may be left lurking in the
wings. In a proxy contest, no solicitation of proxies by an opposition
group may be commenced unless a statement concerning each participant in that solicitation is first filed with the Commission and each
national securities exchange with which any security of the corporation
is listed. This statement must set forth the detailed information
required by a new schedule provided by the rule (schedule 14-B).
If the solicitation is by management in opposition to another group
or in anticipation of opposition by another group, the information
required by the new schedule 14-B with respect to management
participants must be filed promptly after the first solicitation. The
term "participant" includes, in addition to the corporation and its
directors and nominees for directors, all persons and groups primarily
engaged in, financing and responsible for, the conduct of the proxy
solicitation. Those taking the i ritiative in organizing a stockholders'
committee or group or contributing more than $500, or lending money
or furnishing credit for the purpose of financing or otherwise influencing the contest, are included in the definition of participant. These
provisions should make available to the security holders information
about the background and the financial and other interests not only
of all persons who are nominees for election as directors, but also of
all persons who may represent the real interest behind the formal
nominees, and should reduce substantially the difficulty the Commission has had in the past with undisclosed principals, or "fronts."
Each participant is required to disclose, in the document filed in
response to schedule 14-B, his occupational background and personal
history, his criminal record, if any, the extent of his participation in
other proxy contests involving any corporation, the amount of the
corporation's securities he owns, the transactions in which the securities were acquired, the circumstances under which he became a particinant in the solicitation, and any arrangement or understanding respect.ing future employment or other transactions with the corporation.
A summary of this information concerning participants must be included in the respective "proxy statements" of the contesting groups.
In the past, participants in proxy contests have sometimes attempted
to conceal their background, financial interests in the corporation
and activities in the solicitation for proxies. This the courts have
condemned as misleading under the Commission's previous rules."

Solicitation Methods and Costs

In contests for the election of directors, the proxy statement is also
required to include a description of the methods of solicitation and the
material features of solicitation contracts, the anticipated expense of
solicitation, and whether reimbursement for soliciting expenses will
be sought from the corporation. In the past expenditures made by
the contending parties have been substantial, in some cases exceeding
$1 million 01'_ more. It is imperative that stockholders be informed
during the course of the campaign of the contemplated expenditures
to be made to both sides, particularly where the management is using
corporate funds on its behalf and it is the intention of the opposing
group to reimburse itself out of the corporate treasury, if successful.
Disclosure on these points is now compelled by the revised proxy
rules.
Stock held in "Street Name"

Many of the more difficult problems in any proxy contest spring
from the fact that a considerable portion of the corporation's outstanding shares are often held in street names and their ownership is
constantly changing. Participants in a proxy contest no longer can
rely on being able to communicate with the beneficial owners indirectly through solicitation of the stockholders of record. Therefore,
the widespread use of paid advertisements, prepared press releases,
press interviews, and radio and television broadcasts, has become
common in attempting to reach security holders and to sway the
opinion of the public and persons who may ad vise security holders
with respect to giving, revoking or withholding proxies. Whether
statements are written or oral, are prepared in ad vance or are spontaneous they nevertheless constitute part of a continuous plan to
influence stockholders and are deemed subject to the Commission's
standards of fair disclosure and, specifioallv, to the rule prohibiting
false and misleading statements.
This proposition is now clearly
embodied in the new proxy rules."
Filing of Soliciting Material

The new rules continue to require that all advertisements used as
soliciting material in a proxy contest be filed with the Commission
prior to publication. Reprints or republications of anv previously
published material used in soliciting proxies also must be filed prior
to use, together with a statement identifying the author and any
person quoted in the article and disclosing whether the consent of the
author and of the publication to use the materia! has been obtained,
and if an V consideration has been, or will be, made for its republication.
The annual financial report of a corporation to its security holders
is not usually considered to be proxy soliciting material and is not

treated as a "filing" with the Commission. However, if any portion
of the annual report discusses the solicitation of an opposition group,
that portion is made subject to the proxy rules by the 1956 amendments and must be filed with the Commission prior to distribution.
Rule X-16B-3.-The
exemption covers any acquisition of nontransferable options or of shares of stock, including stock, acquired
pursuant to such options, by a director or officer of the issuer of such
stock provided the stock or option was acquired pursuant to a bonus,
profit-sharing, retirement, stock option, thrift, savings, or similar
plan meeting all of certain conditions specified in the rule. These
conditions provide, in general, that the plan must have been approved
by a majority of the voting security holders of the issuer and limits
the aggregate amount of funds or securities which may he allocated
to the plan by a fixed amount, earnings formulas, dividends, compensation of the participants, percentages of outstanding securities,
or similar factors."
This rule was amended on May 21, 1956, to clarifv its provisions
in accordance with the considerable body of administrative interpretation which the Commission had built up over the years since the
rule was adopted in 1935. Briefly stated, the rule provides under the
Securities Exchange Act a complete exemption from section 16 (b)
liability for profits derived from certain acquisitions of securities
under incentive plans.
Form S-12.-This
new registration form under the Securities Act
of 1933, for American Depositary Receipts against outstanding foreign
securities, was adopted effective N overnber 17, 1955. Its purpose is
to provide a simple procedure for such registration where there is no
person who performs the acts and assumes the duties of depositor or
manager. The form proposes that the prospectus information,
which consists of only four items, might be embodied in the receipts.
The form may be used, provided that the holder of the receipts may
withdraw the deposited securities at any time, subject to temporary
delays of a specified nature, the payment of fees, taxes and similar
charges and to compliance with any laws or governmental regulations
relating to the withdrawal of deposited securities and that the deposited securities, if sold in the United States or its territories, would
not be subject to the registration provisions of the Securities Act of
1933.23
Since the early days of the Securities Act of 1933 the Commission
has had before it the question whether the issuance by banks of
American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs") for shares of foreign issuers
are exempt from registration under the Act. In the case of ADRs
which were outstanding at the time of the passage of the Act, the

Commission took the position that they were exempt from registration
by reason of section 3 (a) (1) of the Act. As to ADRs issued afterwards, the position was sometimes urged that an exemption was
available under section 3 (a) (2) of the Act. This section exempts
among other things securities issued by a national bank and securities
issued by any banking institution organized under the laws of any
State or Territory, the business of which is substantially confined to
banking and is supervised by a banking commissioner or other
similar official. Section 2 (4) of the Act defines an "issuer" with
respect to a certificate of deposit to mean "the person or persons
performing the acts and assuming the duties of depositor or manager
pursuant to the provisions of the trust or other agreement or instrument under which such securities are issued." The question presented, therefore, was whether the bank performed tho acts or assumed the duties of depositor or manager so as to be deemed an issuer
within the above definition and, if the bank should be deemed to
perform such functions, whether it would be entitled to the exemption
provided by section 3 (a) (2).
After extended consultations with representatives of a number of
banks, the Commission concluded that section 3 (a) (2) was intended
to provide an exemption only for a bank's own securities. To permit
a bank to claim this exemption for any trust or similar entity that it
might devise would permit the creation of voting trusts, investment
trusts and a variety of other securities for which the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 could be avoided. Furthermore, the concept of supervision by banking officials included in
section 3 (a) (2) did not appear to embrace the issuance of ADRs so
as to afford purchasers the protection intended by that section.
Accordingly, the Commission, again in consultation with representatives of the banks concerned, evolved a form to be used for
registration in such cases. The new form provides a simple procedure for registration.
The prospectus which consists of only four
items may be embodied in the depositary receipts themselves. The
form may be used only where the holder of receipts may withdraw
the deposited securities at any time, subject to temporary delays of
a specified nature, the payment of fees, taxes, and similar charges
and compliance with any laws or governmental regulations relating
to the withdrawal of deposited securities. The form also applies only
where the deposited securities, if sold in the United States or its
Territories, would not be subject to the registration provisions of the
Act.24
The form therefore provides for disclosure of facts not heretofore
required by prior Commission interpretation.

vides greater investor protection in conformity with the standards of
the Securities Act of 1933.
Rule 434.-This rule, made effective November 10, 1955, specifies
the conditions under which a bulletin or card prepared by certain
independent statistical services, primarily engaged in publishing statements and financial information for distribution to subscribers and
summarizing information contained in a preliminary prospectus, might
be deemed a summary prospectus meeting the requirements of section
10 of the Act prior to the effective date of the registration statement.
This rule implements section 10 (b) of the Act under the amendment
made in 1954 by Public Law 577, 83d Congress, which authorizes the
Commission to adopt rules and regulations deemed necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to
permit the use of a summary prospectus which omits in part or summarizes information in the preliminary prospectus filed as part of the
registration statement."
Bulletins and cards of the type covered by this rule have been
published since the early days of the Securities Act. Prior to the
1934 amendments to the Act the use of such materials was deemed
to be permissible as a means of disseminating information contained
in the registration statement.
Of course, such bulletins and cards
could not be used in the actual offering or sale of securities since they
did not meet the prospectus requirements of the Act.
Rules 171, 485, 486, X-6, and U-I05.-These rules govern applications for confidential treatment of certain information filed with the
Commission which would otherwise be disclosed to the public. Rule
486 was repealed and the others were amended in minor respects to
be consistent with Executive Order 10501, 18 F. R. 7049, which withdrew from the Commission any power to classify information in the
interests of national defense, and to minimize any confusion between
the word "confidential" as used in national defense classifications and
elsewhere."
The revision of rule 485 was made in compliance with the authority
granted to the Commission pursuant to section 19 (a) of the Securities
Act of 1933. Rule 485 provides that "confidential treatment" of
material contracts or parts thereof be permitted where disclosure of
the facts contained therein are not "necessary for the protection of
investors" and disclosure of which would impair the value of the
contract. The Commission in promulgating the rule, as amended,
has considered the basic statutory mandate of Congress and the rule
merely permits a registrant to request nondisclosure of matters such
as trade secrets, patents, designs, and so forth."

Rule 434A.-Tbis rule was adopted on November 23, 1956, pursuant to section 10 (b) of the Act, as amended in 1954, which authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and regulations permitting the
use in making offers of securities of a prospectus which omits in part
or summarizes information required to be set forth in the most recent
prospectus required to be used in connection with the sale of securities.
Under the rule the use of summary prospectus is limited to issuers
whose securities are registered on Forms S-1 or 8-9 and which are
required to file reports with the Commission under section 13 or 15 (d)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The new rule provides that
summary prospectuses will contain substantially the same information as previously specified for newspaper prospectuses relating to
securities registered on such forms. Such summary prospectus may
be published in a newspaper or other periodical or be printed in a
form suitable for distribution by hand, through the mails or
otherwise."
Forms 4, U-17-2, and N-30F-2.-These
forms are used by directors, officers, and principal stockholders for the monthly report of
their security transactions, and holdings pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, and the Investment Company Act of 1940. In recent years
there has been a marked increase in the amount of shares sold to
insiders under restricted stock options and similar arrangements.
Accordingly, any analysis of insider transactions as reported to the
Commission is impeded if the source of acquisitions through the
exercise of options is not indicated. Similar problems arise where
the transactions are not otherwise effected upon the open market.
The amendments to Form 4 (and related forms) provide for identification of purchases made through the exercise of options and private

REVISIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION

The Commission devoted much study during 1956 to other important changes in its rules, regulations, and forms. Definitive action
in regard to these matters is, in general, awaiting receipt and evaluation of comments from the public and, in some instances, the holding
of a public hearing. The principal proposals are as follows:
(I) A Proposed

Revision

of Rule 133

This rule as currently in effect defines the terms "sale," "offer,"
"offer to sell," and "offer for sale" so as to make the registration and
prospectus requirements of the Act inapplicable to certain corporate
IS Securities Act Release No. 3722(November 26,1956) .

mergers, consolidations, reclassifications of securities and acquisitions
of assets of another person, in conformity with the statutory provisions of the state of incorporation or the organic instruments. For
many years the Oommission has taken the position that such transactions did not involve the offering or sale of securities, and hence
registration of the new securities resulting from such transactions was
not required under the Act. With the passage of time, this interpretation commonly referred to as the "no sale" theory has been
administratively narrowed by the Oommission. Moreover, the Commission does not extend the theory to the other statutes which the
Oommission administers. As a result of the "no sale" theory, a
large number of transactions have been effected without registration
in situations where security holders have, in effect, been traded out
of their holdings into new securities of an entirely different company
or business without the legal protection afforded by the registration
provisions of the Act and often without proper information as to the
nature of the enterprise into which they were going. Also the rule
has facilitated distributions of securities to the public for cash without compliance with the registration requirements of the Act. The
Oommission felt that this situation was of sufficient gravity to warrant
a thoroughgoing reexamination of the "no sale" theory.
(2) Cert a in Alternative Proposals for Limiting the Availability of the Exernpuion from Registration Provided by Regulation A

This proposal arose out of the Oommission's concern with the
problems presented by promotional companies in offering securities
to the public. One of the proposals is to restrict the use of regulation A to companies which have had at least 1 year's record of
net earnings within any 5 preceding fiscal years. Another alternative proposal would restrict the number of units of securities that
could be issued under the regulation. The suggested maximum
number of shares of stock is 100,000, which would, of course, eliminate
the issuance and sale of so-called "penny stocks" under this regulation
and the number of units of debt securities that could be offered
to be 3,000 which would require the price to be $100 per unit if the
full $300,000 under the exemption is to be raised.
(3) Proposed Note To Rule 460 Which Would Specify Certaiu of thc More Common Situations
Where It Is the Policy of the Commission To Deny Acceleration of the EfI'ect;i\.eDate of a
Registration Statement Under the Standards of Scction 8 (a) of the Act

Section 8 (a) of the Act provides that the effective date of a registration statement will be the 20th day after filing (or after the filing
of an amendment) or such earlier date as the Oommission may
determine, having due regard to the adequacy of the information
respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, to the facility

with which the nature of the securities to be registered, their relationship to the capital structure of the issuer and the rights of holders
can be understood, and to the public interest and the protection of
investors. In passing upon requests for acceleration of the effective
date the Commission acts on a case-by-case basis after consideration
of all pertinent factors. However, certain of the principal areas
in which the Commission has refused acceleration have formed a
pattern and the decisions in these areas are reflected in the proposed
note.
The proposed note would represent a major step in rounding out
the program of publishing the Commission's major administrative
policies as a part of the general rules and regulations under the Act
and would facilitate administration of the long-standing policy of the
Commission to cooperate with registrants in order that the effectiveness of registration statements filed under the Act may be expedited
as much as possible consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
(4) Revisions of Forms 8-2 and 8-3

Forms S-2 is prescribed for commercial and industrial companies
in the promotional or development stage. Form S-3 is a similar
form for mining companies in the exploratory or development stage.
It is proposed to merge another form, Form S-11, into the revised
Form S-3. The purpose of these revisions is to bring the forms up
to date in the light of the Commission's experience and current
administrative practice.

bring its requirements into line with those of certain amended forms
. under thc Investment Company Act.
(6) Proposed Amendments

to the Commission's Statf"mf"ntof Policy n('latin~
Company Sales Literature

to In\,('8tment

The statement of policy was adopted in 1950 and was amended in
January 1955. It is designed to serve as a guide in the preparation
of investment company sales literature so as to avoid violation of the
anti-fraud provisions of section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933. The
Commission's observation of the operation of the Statement of Policy,
as amended in 1955, has aroused concern as to the propriety of certain
types of presentation of information in tabular or chart form. The

48

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

purpose of the proposed amendments is primarily to establish clear
standards for the fair and accurate presentation of statistical and
financial data concerning investment company operations in sales
literature and prospectuses. As a part of this program, the Commission is also considering proposed revisions of its forms N-8B-2
under the Investment Company Act and S-6 under the Securities
Act. These forms are used by unit investment trusts and companies
issuing periodic payment plan certificates.

PART IV
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to
investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale by use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit or other fraudulent practices
in the sale of securities. Disclosure is obtained by requiring the
issuer of such securities to file with the Commission a registration
statement, and related prospectus, containing significant information
about the issuer and the offering. The registration statement must
become "effective" before the securities may be sold to the public.
These documents are available for public inspection as soon as they
are filed. In addition the prospectus must be furnished to the purchaser at or before the sale or delivery of the security. The registrant
and the underwriter are responsible for the contents of the registration
statement. The Commission has no authority to control the nature
or quality of a security to be offered for public sale or to approve or
disapprove its merits or the terms of its distribution.
DESCIUPTION
Registration

Statement

OF THE REGISTRATION

PROCESS

and Prospectus

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may be
secured by filing with the Commission a registration statement on the
applicable form containing prescribed disclosures. Congress provided
that a registration statement must contain the information and be
accompanied by the documents specified in Schedule A of the Act,
when relating to a security issued, generally speaking, by a corporation
or other private issuer, or those specified in Schedule B, when relating
to a security issued by a foreign government. Both schedules specify
in considerable detail the disclosures which Congress considered an
investor should have available in order to make an informed decision
whether to buy the security. In addition, Congress added flexibility
to the administration of the statute by empowering the Commission to
classify issues and issuers, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to
increase or in certain instances vary or diminish the particular items of
information required to be disclosed in the registration statement as
the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors. Similar legislative treatment applies to
prospectuses, with respect to which additional power was granted the
Commission by the 1954 amendments adopted by the 83d Congress.
In general the registration statement of an issuer other than a foreign
government must describe such matters as the names of persons who
participate in the direction, management, or control of the issuer's
49

business; their security holdings and remuneration and options or
bonus and profit-sharing privileges allotted to them; the character and
size of the business enterprise; its capital structure and past history
and earnings; its financial statements, certified by independent accountants; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made
within two years or intended to be made; acquisitions of property not
in the ordinary course of business, and the interest of directors, officers
and principal stockholders therein; pending or threatened legal proceedings; and the purpose to which the proceeds of the offering are to
be applied. The prospectus constitutes a part of the registration
statement and presents in summary the more important of the required
disclosures.
Examination

Procedure

The Commission is responsible for preventing the sale of securities
to the public on the basis of statements which contain inaccurate or
incomplete information.
The staff of the Division of Corporation
Finance examines each registration statement for compliance with
the standards of disclosure and usually notifies the registrant by an
informal letter of comment of any material rc spects in which the
statement on its face apparently fails to conform to these requirements. The registrant is thus afforded all opportunity to file an
amendment before the statement becomes effective. In addition, the
Commission has power, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to
issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement.
Information about the increased use of this stop-order power during
1956 in 8 new cases as compared with 3 in 1955 appears below under
"Stop-Order Proceedings."
Time Required

to Complete

Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission completes its analysis in the shortest
possible time. Congress provided for 20 days in the ordinary case
between the filing date of a registration statement or of an amendment
thereto and the time it may become effective. This waiting period
is designed to provide investors with an opportunity to become familiar
with the proposed offering. Information disclosed in the registration
statement is disseminated during the waiting period by means of the
preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission is empowered to
accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period
where the facts justify such action. In exercising this power, the
Commission is required by statute to take into account the adequacy
of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the
public, to thÂ« facility with which the nature of the securities to be
registered, their relationship to the capital structure of the iSSUErand
the rights of holders thereof can be understood, and to the public
interest and the protection of investors,

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

51

The median time which elapsed between the date of filing and the
effective date with respect to 715 1 registration statements that became effective during the 1956 fiscal year was 23 days, 1 day more
than the corresponding figure in the preceding year. Despite this
average increase of a day, in no case, involving any major financing
absent some serious disclosure problem, did the Commission fail to
meet the date requested by the issuer for effectiveness or cause delay
of financing plans. This time was divided among the three principal
stages of the registration process approximately as follows: (a) from
date of filing registration statement to date of letter of comment, 13
days; (b) from date of letter of comment to date of filing first material
amendment, 6 days; and (c) from date of filing first amendment to
date of filing final amendment and effective date of registration, 4
days. All these days are calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. In 1956, to meet the financing requirements of
industry, in cases where the public interest was adequately protected,
the Commission granted effectiveness in less than 20 days for 1742
registration statements.
It is not the function of the staff of the Commission to prepare or
rewrite registration statements.
The members of the staff are ready
to assist registrants when it appears that a bona fide effort has been
made to prepare a registration statement meeting the standards of
the Act and are as helpful as possible in suggesting whatever may be
needed by way of additional information if the registration statement,
as filed, is not entirely complete. But the Commission's policy, in
the public interest and for the protection of investors, is immediately
to commence stop-order proceedings in those cases in which the issuer
and underwriter refuse to comply with, or ignore, the disclosure standards of the law or where the registration statement appears on its
face to be false and misleading. As pointed out under the heading
"Stop-order Proceedings," the Commission instituted eight such stoporder proceedings during the 1956 fiscal year, and two were pending
at the beginning of the year. In addition, it has several investigations under way with respect to a number of other registration statements.
There are several policies regarding acceleration which have been
developed in the last year. These pertain to the Commission's unwillingness to grant acceleration where during the prefiling or postI Not included III this elapsed time study were 73 regtstraticn statements for Arnoricnn Depositary
Receipts on Form 8-12 and 127 effective registrations of investment company securitros pursuant to posteffeetrve amendments permitted under the soounttcs Act of 1933by sec 24 ee) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended. The median number cf calendar days of total elapsed tune III registration for the
73 registration statements on Form S-12 was 4; and for the 127 posteffeenve amendments of investment
companies it was 18.
I ThIS figure of 174excludes 51 registration statements for American DepOSItReceipts and 68 for additional
amounts of securities of investment eomparues which also became efleeuve in less that 20days after the date
of original filing. Therefore, a grand total of 293statements became effective in less than such 20days, constitntmg 32 percent of the 915statements that became effeeti\'e ill the 1956fiscal year.

52

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

filing but preeffective period there is evidence of "gun jumping," that
is, preeffective sales which are illegal. Also, the Commission has been
withholding acceleration where one or more of the underwriters does
not meet the test of financial responsibility required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and, most important, it has been withholding acceleration where, apart from the processing of the registration statement itself, it has been making an investigation of the issuer
or the underwriter for illegal or fraudulent activities.
Attention should also be called to the fact that of the 67 registration
statements withdrawn during the 1956 fiscal year for a variety of
reasons, as tabulated under "Number and Disposition of Registration Statements Filed," 34, or 50 percent, were withdrawn because
the registration statement was materially misleading and would otherwise have become subject to stop-order proceedings.
VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED

Securities effectively registered under the Securities Act during 1956
totaled $13.1 billion, the highest volume for any fiscal year in the 22year history of the Commission. For each of the past 3 years the
dollar amount of effective registrations has increased 19 percent or
more over the amount effective in the previous year. From the
$7.5 billion for 1953 the amounts have increased to $9.2 billion for
1954 to $11 billion for 1955 and to $13.1 billion for 1956. The chart
below shows graphically the dollar amounts of effective registrations

other than cash sale, such as exchange transactions and issues reserved
for conversion of other securities.
Of the dollar amount of securities registered in 1956, 70.3 percent
was for account of issuers for cash sale, 21.5 percent for account of
issuers for other than cash sale and 8.2 percent was for account of
others, as shown below. Most of the registrations involving issues
not to be sold for cash cover securities offered in exchange for other
securities and securities reserved for conversion of other registered
securities.

The most important category of registrations, new issues to be sold
for cash for account of the issuer, amounted to $9.2 billion in 1956 as
compared with $8.3 billion in 1955. For 1956, 45 percent of the total
volume was made up of debt securities, 49 percent common stock and
6 percent preferred stock. Approximately 60 percent of the volume
of common stock represented securities of investment companies.
Figures showing the number of statements, total amounts registered,
and a classification by type of security for new issues to be sold for

Of the net proceeds of the corporate securities registered for cash
sale for account of issuers in 1956, 62 percent was designated for new
money purposes, including plant, equipment and working capital, 2
percent for retirement of securities, and 36 percent for other purposes,
principally the purchase of securities by investment companies and
employee participation plans.
Activity and prices in the securities markets have reached highs
unprecedented in the Commission's experience. Furthermore, this
upsurge has taken place in a relatively short period of time. For
example, the dollar amount of securities effectively registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 increased by 75 percent from $7.5 billion in
fiscal 1953 to $13.1 billion in fiscal 1956. This figure had never exceeded $5 billion during the period 1935 to 1945. The aggregate
market value of all stock on all stock exchanges increased from $135.4
billion at the end of calendar 1953 to $238.8 billion at the end of calendar 1955 and had never exceeded $100 billion between 1933 to 1945.
The Dow Jones Industrial average of stock prices on the New York
Stock Exchange reached an all-time high of 521.05 on April 6, 1956.
During the years 1933 to 1949 it never exceeded 220. The value of
the gross national product broke through the $400 billion figure III
1956 as compared with $340 billion in 1952.

During 1956, 981 registration statements were filed for offerings
aggregating $13,097,787,682, compared with 849 statements covering
offerings of $11,009,757,143 in 1955.
Of the 981 statements in 1956, 415, or 42 percent, were filed by companies that had not previously registered any securities under the
Securities Act of 1933 compared with 297, or 35 percent of the corresponding total during the previous fiscal year.
The growth in volume of proposed financing under the registration
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 is shown by the following
tabulation which reflects a 3-year increase of nearly 77 percent in 1956
compared with 1953 in the aggregate dollar amount proposed to be
offered as filed.

Under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act the Commission is empowered from time to time by its rules and regulations, and subject to
such terms and conditions as it may prescribe therein, to add any class
of securities to the securities specifically exempted by section 3 (a) of
the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the registration provisions of
the Act with respect to such additional securities is not necessary in
the public interest and for the protection of investors by reason of the
small amount involved or the limited character of the public offering.
The statute, as amended in 1945,3imposes a maximum limitation of
$300,000 upon any exemption provided by the Commission in the
exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority the Commission has adopted the types
of exemption identified below:
Regulation A:
General exemption for small United States and Canadian issues up to
$300,000.
Regulation A-M:
Special exemption for assessable shares of stock of mining companies up
to $100,000.
Regulation A-R:
Special exemption for notes and bonds secured by first liens on family
dwellings up to $25,000.
Regulation B:
Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights up to
$100,000.
Regulation B-T:
Exemption for interests in oil royalty trusts or similar types of trusts or
unincorporated associations up to $100,000.

The revision and consolidation of regulations A for United States
issuers and D for Canadian issuers into a new regulation A, just after
the close of the 1956 fiscal year, is discussed under "Revisions of Rules
and Forms" above.
Exemption from registration under section 3 (b) of the Act does not
carry exemption from the civil liabilities for material misstatements or
omissions imposed upon any person by section 12 (2) or from the
criminal liabilities for fraud imposed upon any person by section 17.
The Commission's regulation A implements section 3 (b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and permits a company to obtain not exceeding
$300,000 (less underwriting commissions) of needed capital in anyone
year from a public offering of its securities if the company complies
with the regulation. Upon complying with the regulation a company is
exempt from the registration provisions of the Act. A regulation A
filing consists of a notification supplying basic information about the

company, certain exhibits and an offering circular which is required
to be used in offering the securities except in the case of a company
with an earnings history and the offering is not in excess of $50,000in securities.
As a convenience to the public, the processing of such filings has been
decentralized to the Oommission's nine regional offices. Ten business
days must elapse between the filing with the regional office and the
commencement of the offering unless the Oommission authorizes a
shortening of this period. During this period the staff of the regional
office reviews the filing to determine whether the conditions to the use
of the exemption have been met and whether any deficiencies exist
which should be corrected before the offering commences.
One objective of the Commission's newly established Branch of
Small Issues within the Division of Corporation Finance in Washington is to develop uniform procedures to be followed by the regional
offices in their processing of regulation A filings and to coordinate the
enforcement activities of the field offices in the administration of the
exemption. Oompanies of the same type and offering the same type
of securities should, to the extent possible, be treated uniformly regardless of the local office in which they file. By assigning to the Branch
of Small Issues the duty to supervise the administrative procedures
used by the regional offices the Oommission is providing a valuable
safeguard for small business as well as the interest of investors.
A second broad objective to be accomplished by the Branch of
Small Issues is to assist the Commission in its determined effort to
protect the public against fraud in the sale of small issues without
unduly burdening small business. Regulation A is designed to assist
legitimate small business and new ventures in bringing to market a
small issue of securities. Regulation A was not designed as a shield
for the perpetration of fraud on the investing public. One problem in
this area is to detect as quickly as possible those filings which are
schemes to obtain so-called "front money" to line the pockets of the
promoters rather than to obtain funds for the conduct of bona fide
business. Another problem is to detect those offerings under the
regulation which are sold without use of the required offering circular,
but rather are sold by false and misleading sales talk by high pressure
salesmen often operating out of "boiler-rooms."
Regulation A itself disqualifies an issuer from offering securities
under the exemptive regulation if the issuer or any person connected
with the proposed offering (including any promoter, officer, director,
major stockholder, or underwriter) has previously run afoul of any
State or Federal securities law (through criminal conviction, injunction, or certain enumerated administrative proceedings). The Branch
of Small Issues examines the Commission's comprehensive records of
securities violations for each filing as it is made, to determine promptly

58

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

if any ground for disqualification from the exemption exists. If so,
the Commission by order suspends the exemption for that issuer.
This procedure effectively prevents persons who have been guilty
of fraudulent practices in the past from using the regulation A exemption. However, this reaches only a relatively few cases and the major
problem remains of developing a follow-up program to detect fraud
in regulation A filings bv persons with no past history of securities
violations. Toward this end the Branch of Small Issues will determine, in consultation with regional offices, those filings which on
their face are open invitations to fraud, either because the properties
of the company do not appear valuable; because the background
and experience of the promoters appeal' dubious in light of the business
proposed to be done; or because the venture is rank speculation.
Such filings will be investigated under the direction of the Branch
of Small Issues to determine the selling practices actually used.
Furthermore, it is hoped that a program of "spot-checking" of filings
can be inaugurated in each regional office under the supervision of
the Branch which would involve inspecting the books and records
of a selected number of issuers and their underwriters and interrogating, on a sampling basis, the purchasers of such securities as to
representations made to them in connection with their purchases.
If the "boiler-room" stock salesman and the "front money"
racketeer are promptly dealt with and denied use of the regulation A
exemption, we will do much to build public confidence in the bona
fides of issues made under the regulation which 'will redound to the
benefit of legitimate small business seeking capital from the public
for business growth. It is the Commission's expectation that the
new Branch of Small Issues will make a. significant contribution toward
the attainment of this goal. Not only will the Branch maintain
close liaison with our field offices but the Branch together with other
Commission staff members will maintain liaison with the staff of the
Small Business Administration on matters of common concern.
Exempt

Offerings Under Regulations

A and D

During the 1956 fiscal year 1,463 notifications were filed under
regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $273,471,548, compared
with 1,628 notifications covering proposed offerings of $296,267,000
in the 1955 fiscal year. Included in the 1956 total were 75 notifications covering stock offerings of $14,420,545 with respect to companies engaged in the exploratory oil and gas business, and 349 filings
covering offerings of $72,303,567 by mining companies. These 349
filings by mining companies included 275 by uranium companies
with proposed offerings aggregating $58,211,812 and 74 offerings by
other mining companies aggregating $14,091,755. In addition, there

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL

REPORT

were 44 filings by companies exploring for both uranium and oil and
gas with stock offerings aggregating $10,866,382. Thus there was a
total of 319 filings by companies who proposed to usc all or a part of
the proceeds for exploration and development of uranium properties.
Three hundred and two of these companies were less thun 2 years
old at the date of filing. There was a total of 119 filings by companies which proposed to use all or a part of the proceeds for exploration and development of oil and gas properties.
It is significant that most use of this exemption was made b.v newly
organized enterprises. During 1956, approximately two-thirds of
the filings and the offerings thereunder were made bv companies
less than 2 years old. Such new companies filed 843 of the year's
notifications for aggregate offerings of $167,485,970, representing
approximately 58 percent of all companies filing notifications under
regulation A and approximately 61 percent of the total amount of
proposed offerings thereunder.
A breakdown of these filings made
by new companies shows that uranium ventures accounted for 302
filings covering proposed offerings of $67,602,676, and new companies
in all other lines accounted for 541 filings covering proposed offerings
of $100,483,294.
Certain facts regarding these offerings are set forth in the following

In general, the reasons for the issuance of these orders included
failure to comply with certain conditions of the exemption (such as
failure to file reports of sales and use of proceeds) or, in certain cases,
the perpetration of outright fraud and deceit (involving misstatements
of material facts either in the offering circular or in oral communioation). A few actual cases are summarized below to illustrate specific
charges of misrepresentations occurring in suspension proceedings
brought by the Commission.
Coastal Finance Corp---This small loan company filed a regulation A notification with the Commission on July 31, 1955, for the
purpose of obtaining an exemption from registration with respect to
a proposed public offering of 5,669 shares of class A common stock
($10par) at $28.50 per share. According to the offering circular, the
offering was to be made to holders of outstanding class A shares at

66

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the rate of 1 additional share for each 6 shares held of record on
August 5, 1955. Unsubscribed shares were to be offered for public
sale on a best efforts basis by an underwriter. Although not required
to do so by regulation A, the financial statements included in the
offering circular were certified by independent public accountants.
All of these securities were sold.
After being advised by the certifying accountants, who discovered
falsified accounts shortly after the offering and immediately reported
it to the Commission, the Commission issued an order temporarily
suspending the regulation .A. exemption and, alleged that there was
reason to believe that the offering circular was misleading, and directed
that a public hearing be held to determine whether the suspension
order should be vacated or made permanent. In its order, the
Commission asserted that it had reasonable cause to believe that the
terms and conditions of regulation A were not complied with by
Coastal, in that the notification and offering circular were false and
misleading because, among other things, the offering circular represented that Coastal had purchased the assets of another finance
company after its management had made an appraisal, whereas no
appraisal was made by tho Coastal management in accordance with
the normal and customary techniques followed in the loan industry;
the company did not write off all past due loans known to be uncollectible and the charges against current income as a provision for bad
debts, and the reserves provided therefor, were inadequate; and the
summary of earnings contained in the offering circular represented '
income figures greater than those actually realized. This case was
awaiting decision by the Commission on tho evidentiary record at the
close of 1956.
Prior to the hearing Coastal filed a petition for reorganization under
chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act in the United States District Court
at Baltimore, Md. This rase was also pending, with the Commission
participating as a party to assist the court as provided in chapter X,
at the close of the year.
Cherokee Uranium .Mining Corp.-Two
offerings of this issuer
were temporarily suspended. The orders charged on the basis of
information supplied by the staff that false and incomplete statements
were made concerning the sale of unregistered securities of the issuer
and affiliates within the previous year. It was also asserted that the
offoring would operate as a device, scheme and artifice to defraud
because the issuer was insolvent, and that there was a failure to
disclose in connection with a debenture offering that there might not
be sufficient funds available for a profitable business operation and
the issuer might not be in a position to satisfy the interest requirements
on the debentures.
Insured Savings Life Insurance Co.-The
issuer restricted the
offering to purchasers of insurance policies of an affiliated insurance

67

TWENTY -SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

company. The Commission temporarily suspended the offering
asserting that a fraud or deceit would be involved in the offering in
that false and misleading statements were being made concerning the
amount and source of earnings and dividends of both companies, an
anticipated increase in value of the securities, and the safety of the
investment. It was also alleged that the required offering circular
was not given to purchasers. The issuer consented to the entry of
a permanent suspension order.
San Juan Uranium Corp.-In its order suspending the exemption,
the Commission asserted that the offering operated as a fraud or
deceit upon the purchasers in that the proceeds were not used for the
purposes set forth in the offering circular but instead were used to
make advances to, and to defray personal expenses of, a promoter
and to finance the promotion of another of his corporations. It was
also asserted that the offering circular contained material misstatements and omissions concerning affiliations and identity of promoters,
and their receipt of consideration for properties; and that misleading
sales literature was used concerning equipment acquired and the
progress made on the properties.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During 1956, the Commission received 114offering sheets filed under
regulation B, compared with 71 in 1955. These filings, relating to
exempt offerings of oil and gas rights, were examined by the Oil and
Gas Unit of the Division of Corporation Finance which assists the
Commission on technical and complex problems peculiar to oil and
gas securities.

RESULTS

OBTAINED BY THE REGISTRATION

PROCESS

Results secured by the staff's examination of registration statements
during 1956 are illustrated by the following examples of corrections
made by registrants as a result of comments to registrants by the
staff of the Division of Corporation Finance.
Revision of representations as to profit potentialities of uranium
investment.-A
uranium mining venture filed a registration statement covering $900,000 8 percent convertible subordinated debentures
due May 1,1976, to be offered initially to stockholders. Unsubscribed
debentures were to be offered to the general public through an underwriter who had agreed to act on a best efforts basis. Proceeds were
to be used to complete acquisition of mining claims and a producing
uranium mine. As a result of the staff's review the prospectus was
revised to show that the properties being acquired for $1,000,000 in
cash and stock from the company's president and his associates were
acquired by them at no cost other than nominal expenses involved in
locating the claims; that in connection with a table setting forth total
receipts of $358,289 from sales of ore from the mine, net receipts for
registrant's account after direct mining costs and excluding depreciation were $8,462; and that proven and probable ore reserves totaled
7,154 tons rather than 76,335 tons as originally claimed.
Withdrawal of registration statement failing to justify claimed
sulphur reserves and to show stock dilution.-A
sulphur mining
company filed a registration statement for the purpose of registering
600,000 shares 6 percent convertible noncumulative preferred stock,
par value $2. Such shares were to be offered through an underwriter
to the general public at $2 per share. Part of the shares (25,000)were
to be underwritten on a firm basis and the balance on a best efforts
basis. The preferred stock was convertible into common stock, par
value 1 cent, initially share-for-share and subsequently at ratios of
two-thirds and one-half share common respectively, for one share

pre

ANNUAL REPORT

.1. Directors, offlcere, Â«nd promoters had acquired from the

camp .... .' 300,000 shares (48 percent) of the outstanding common at
1 cent pe,: snare.

The proceeds were to be used to construct a sulphur extraction
plant on land held by the company under leases. As a result of the
staff's review, it appeared that a person preparing the geological report
with respect to the company's properties was not competent to act in
the sulphur mining field; the claimed sulphur reserves were substantially overstated; there was a serious question as to whether the
project was economically feasible, as claimed, in view of the limited
extent of the sulphur reserves; and there was a failure to disclose
that purchasers of the preferred stock were given no protection against
dilution of their equity through issuance of common stock at less than
the purchase price of the preferred.
When the above matters were called to the company's attention it
determined to withdraw the registration statement.
Disclosure of unprofitahility of life insurance venture.-A
company engaged in the business of life, accident and health insurance
filed a registration statement covering 48,108 shares of capital stock
to be offered to its stockholders. The offer was not underwritten.
Proceeds were to be used to purchase life insurance in force and assets
from other life insurance companies and, to the extent not so used, to
invest in assets which would constitute a part of its reserves for life
insurance policies.
As a result of the staff's analysis and comments, the company
revised its prospectus to disclose prominently therein that the company
expected to operate at a loss during 1956 and the next 4 years and was
unable to predict when its operations would result in a net profit; the
losses from operations frOID1952 through 1955 resulted in part from
lapses of insurance in force at a rate substantially higher than is
considered normal for the industry; no dividends had been paid and
no earned surplus was available for payment of dividends, there being
an earned deficit of $797,178; and total contributions of stockholders
to unassigned surplus amounted to $2,162,953, whereas the unassigned
surplus was $755,864.
Revision of accounting for property acquired from promoters in
exchange for stock.-Accounting
for property received from promoters in exchange for shares of stock has been a problem recurring
since the early days of the Commission. It has been the subject of
Commission opinions and special accounting treatment has been
prescribed in the Commission's forms and accounting regulations.
These forms and regulations apply to the promotional period of the
company and prescribe that when shares are issued for property no
dollar values may be extended in the statement of assets and capital
shares. Problems develop, however, when these companies reach an

70

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COl\:IMISSION

operating status and balance sheets and operating statements must be
prepared,
A representative situation may be cited from the past year. In the
initial offering of 'shares the financial statements included a statement
of assets and capitalized expenses which disclosed that the consideration for certain properties turned over to the registrant by the promoters was 52,000 shares of the company's common stock of $10 par
value per share. Approximately 1 year after the offering was made a
posteffective amendment was filed. At this time the company was in
operation and consequently the financial statements furnished included
balance sheets and statements of earnings.
With respect to the balance sheets the staff questioned the propriety
of including in the value of land an amount of $415,000, being the
excess of the par value of 52,000 shares ($520,000) issued to the promoters over the cash cost, $105,000, to them for options and contracts
for the purchase of property to be acquired by the registrant.
The
prospectus disclosed that the determination of the amount of the
interests of the various promoters and the amount of stock to be issued
in exchange therefor was made by the promoters themselves, and that
this determination was essentially arbitrary in character.
It was further disclosed that the shares were held in escrow and
while so held could not be sold, transferred or encumbered without the
express approval of a state corporation commission. The escrow
agreement provided that the stock did not entitle the owners to
participate in any distribution of assets until after the owners of all
other securities are paid in full. Under the circumstances, the
balance sheet was amended to reduce the item of land, leasehold and
improvements by $415,000 and to show this amount as a deduction
from the stated value of the capital stock with the explanatory caption
"Excess of par value of capital stock issued to promoters over cost of
acquired land."
Adjustment of income statement to reflect impact of differences
between depreciat.ion for income tax and accounting purposes.-

Differences between income tax and book provisions for depreciation
may, because of special circumstances in a company's operations, have
a marked effect upon currently reported earnings. An instance arose
in the case of a rapidly expanding trucking and truck leasing company.
The financial statements of a company as initially filed for the 11
months ended K ovember 30, 1955, showed a net income approximating
$958,000, or $2.56 per share on the shares outstanding on November
30, 1955. Notes to the financial statements and the summary of
earnings, taken together, indicated that Federal income taxes for the
11 months had been reduced by approximately $185,000 as a result
of the deduction of approximately $356,000 more depreciation for
income tax purposes than was deducted for book or accounting

TWENTY-SECOND

A!\"'NUAL REPORT

71

purposes. The explanation lies in the fact that for accounting purposes
depreciation on trucking units was computed on a straightline basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, whereas for income tax
purposes the "sum of the years-digits" method had been used for 1954
and 1955 property additions as provided by the Internal Revenue
Code. It so happened that the 1955 acquisitions of trucks had been
very large in relation to those on hand at the beginning of 1955. The
staff took the position that under such circumstances a fail' statement
of net income would require that provision be made for the deferred
taxes which would otherwise be chargeable against income in future
years. After discussion with the staff of various phases of the deferred
tax effect, the registrant adjusted its income statement by a provision
for deferred taxes approximating $185,000, thereby reducing reported
net income to approximately $773,000, or $2.07 per share.
STOP-ORDER

PROCEEDINGS

Section 8 (d) provides that if it appears to the Commission at any
time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
the Commission may institute proceedings looking to the issuance of
a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.
Where such an order is issued, the offering cannot lawfully be made,
or continued if it has already begun, until the registration statement
has been amended to cure the deficiencies and the Commission has
lifted the stop order. During 1956 8 new proceedings were authorized
by the Commission under section 8 (d) of the Act and 2 such proceedings were continued from the preceding year. In connection with
these 10 proceedings, 3 stop orders were issued during the year and
the 7 remaining cases were pending as of June 30, 1956.
The Commission is also authorized by section S (e) of the Act to
make an examination in order to determine whether a stop order
should be entered under section 8 (d). For this purpose the Commission is empowered to subpena witnesses and require the production
of pertinent documents. During 1956 the Commission authorized 4
private examinations pursuant to this section of the Act. As of June
30, 1956, 1 of the examinations was still pending, 2 had resulted in the
withdrawal of the statements by the registrants, and 1 had been
disposed of insofar as section 8 (e) is concerned by action of the
Commission in ordering that the case proceed to a public hearing
under section 8 (d).

International Spa, Inc.

Proceedings against registration statement filed by this company,
described in the 21st Annual Report at pages 16-17, were terminated
during the 1956 fiscal year by issuance of a stop order.'
International Spa proposed to construct and operate a luxury hotel
together with a shopping center, theater, swimming pool, and other
facilities near Las Vegas, Nev., emphasizing the interracial aspects of
its proposed development. It proposed not only to offer publicly
12,000 common shares at $500 per share, but to issue an equal number to the promoters "in payment for services rendered and to be
rendered during the sale and distribution of the registrant's stock."
After holding hearings the Commission issued a stop order. The
Commission found that the registration statement was grossly inaccurate and misleading. The description of registrant's proposed
bnsiness was materially deficient in failing to reveal that registrant
had no information about possible patronage for its project, and
failed to disclose the facts regarding potential competition with its
project even though three other hotels which intended to operate on
an interracial basis were being constructed or planned at sites closer
to the business area of Las Vegas than registrant's site. The registration statement also contained untrue statements and omitted to
state material facts regarding registrant's interest in the tract of land
upon which it proposed to construct its development. VVhilethe
registration statement said that registrant was not acquiring such
tract of land from any person having a material relationship with it,
and that no commissions were being paid, the Commission found such
statements were untrue, and that the seller of the property originally
acquired it on instructions from the principal promoters of registrant;
that the seller would receive, in addition to his acquisition cost
$48,000 in cash and 870 shares of registrant's stock; and that the
trust deed for the bulk of the original purchase price paid by the
sellers was in default. The Commission also found that statements
in the registration statement that registrant had issued no securities
or options to purchase securities were untrue, in that registrant was
under an obligation to issue stock to certain persons and that such
persons had options to acquire stock.

The Sans Souci Hotel, Inc.

This registrant was organized in Nevada in 1054 for the purposes
of acquiring property and operating ana constructing additional facilities for the Sans Souci Hotel located IH'l1rLas Vegas, Nev. It
proposed an offering of 1,428,000 shares of its common stock at $1
per share. Of the total offering 300,000 shares were to be for the account of George E. Mitzel, president of registrant, and 30,471 shares
were to be offered to creditors in payment of certain outstanding obligations. The balance of the offering was to be made to shareholders
on a preemptive basis and any unsubscribed shares were to be offered
to the general public.
Included among the allegations made with respect to the hearings
brought under section 8 (d) were questions l1Sto the adequacy and
accuracy of disclosures with respect to the use of proceeds to be derived from the public sale of stock in the event less than all of the
registered shares were sold; the description of the business proposed
to be conducted by the registrant, in particular the cost of the additions to the hotel to he constructed, the contemplated negotiations of
a lease covering the operation of the gambling casino, the regulations
of the State of Nevada governing the granting of a gambling license
and the effect thereof on the business intended to be done, and the
competitive conditions in the area and the effect thereof upon its
business; the option to purchase certain real estate, the price to be
paid therefor, the nature of the title thereto, the defects and liens
thereon, and the terms and conditions of the option; the identity of
all affiliates of registrant and persons with whom its officers and directors have a material relationship, transactions with such persons;
and the financial statements, including writeups resulting from appraisals, failure to amortize certain expenses and provide depreciation, incorrect statement of net profits, omission of notes and schedules
applicable to financial statements as required by applicable Commission rules.
After the hearing was commenced and testimony was taken, registrant submitted a written stipulation and consent to the entry of an
order by the Commission pursuant to section 8 (d) suspending the
effectiveness of its registrant statement, and such order was duly
entered."
Thc Sun Hotcl, Inc.

The Commission instituted proceedings under section 8 (d) with
respect to the registration statement filed hy the Sun Hotel, Inc.,
Las Vegas, Nev., which proposed the public offering of 3,750,000
shares of its common stock at $2.50 per share, aggregating $9,375,000,

through Golden-Dersch & Co., Inc.," of New York, and Coombs &
Company of Las Vegas. 7 Proceeds from the sale of the company's
stock were to be used to acquire title to certain property and to construct a luxury hotel estimated to cost $7,000,000. Robert Brooks
of Los Angeles was listed as president and one of the principal
promoters.
In its order and notice of proceedings, the Commission raised questions as, to the adequacy and accuracy of disclosures with respect to
the description of the business intended to be carried on by Sun Hotel,
in particular the size of the hotel to be constructed, the sites on which
it would be constructed, the contemplated negotiation of a lease
covering a gambling casino, and competitive conditions and the effect
thereof upon the company's business; the lease for and the options to
purchase certain real estate, the price to be paid therefor, the nature
of the title thereto, the defects and liens thereon, and the terms and
conditions of the lease and options; the use of the proceeds to be derived from the public sale of the stock; statements as to the identity
of persons who had given options on real estate to the company and
the transactions between such persons and the company; and the
statement regarding the business experience of the officers, particularly with respect to any business owned or operated by Robert
Brooks and any convictions or other litigation that had arisen with
respect thereto.
Prior to the holding of the public hearing in this matter, the registrant consented to the issuance of a stop order suspending effectiveness of the registration statement, and such order was issued,"
American Republic Investors, Inc.

This proceeding concerned a registration statement filed by American Republic Investors, Inc., of Dallas, which proposed the public
offering of 800,000 shares of $1 par common stock at $10 per share
with a $2 per share maximum underwriting commission.
According to the registration statement and prospectus, the company was organized under Maryland law on March 28, 1955, for the
purpose of offering its stockholders an opportunity to become charter
members of a new legal reserve stock life insurance company, American Old Line Life Insurance Co. (organized under Texas law) and to
seek capital gains and dividends through long-term appreciation in
common stocks of old line legal reserve life insurance companies. Of

the proceeds of the stock sale, 60 percent was to be used to organize,
own, and operate the Life Insurance Co. and the balance was to be
invested in a fund for the acquisition of other insurance company
stocks.
After the holding of hearings the Commission, shortly after the
close of the fiscal year, issued its findings and opinion and a stop
order." The Commission found that the registration statement covered a proposed offering of stock in an enterprise that was so potentially hazardous for public investors that only the most scrupulously
fair and complete disclosure could have afforded them adequate protection; that the registration statement contained numerous false
statements and omitted information of the most important and significant nature. The Commission found that the promoters, officers,
and directors had no substantial experience in operating a business
similar to that proposed by registrant. Notwithstanding this fact
and without adequate disclosure thereof registrant proposed to offer
800,000 shares of stock to the public at $10 a share, a total of
$8,000,000. In contrast, registrant issued 222,815 shares to friends
and close business associates at a stated value of $1 per share and
optioned 377,185 shares to the 3 directors and officers at $1 per share,
a total of 600,000 shares. Of the stock issued to friends and associates it was found that only 71,850 shares were sold for cash, the
remainder having been issued for portfolio securities, some of which
had been illegally issued and none of which had any market value,
and that the securities received in exchange were arbitrarily priced
by the directors of registrant.
Uranium Properties, Ltd.

This registrant was a joint venture which proposed the public
offering of $600,000 of "Grubstake loans" by the joint venture in
minimum amounts or multiples of $25.
Registrant was created by Hubert W. Sharpe and Reyburn F.
Crocker for the purpose of exploration for, acquisition of, and development of mineral deposits, in particular uranium and other rare and
valuable minerals and metals. The exploration for uranium was to
be conducted by means of aircraft equipped with electronic and radiation detecting devices. The securities to be offered were in the form
of agreements providing that with 75 percent of the principal sum
delivered by investors the joint venture would purchase for, and in
the name of, the investor a United States savings bond, series E, of a
face value equal, at maturity to the principal sum advanced, and the
balance of the funds would be used for the exploration and other
purposes of the joint venture. The agreements further provided that
the joint venturers would hold in trust for the benefit of investors

one forty-eighth thousandth (1/48,000th), for each $25 advanced, of
all such uranium or other mineral deposits and a like proportion of
the rents, issues and profits thereof, and would convey to the investors such fractional interest or pay such rents, issues or profits to
investors upon demand.
After the holding of hearings the Commission, shortly after the
close of the fiscal year, issued its findings and opinion and a stop
order." The Commission found that the attempted tie-in between
the sales of the extremely speculative interests in an exploration
project with sales of United States savings bonds was seriously misleading, that there was no relationship whatever between the two
investments and that the attempt to tie them together was purely
a sales device giving rise to a false implication that the investor
could not lose the part of his investment relating to the exploration
adventure. The Commission also found that registrant failed to disclose that it had only the most rudimentary plans for engaging in
business, that the joint venturers had no experience in exploring for
minerals and did not propose to employ geologists or other trained
personnel, that registrant had selected no area for explorations, and
that it had no plans for developing or otherwise realizing upon any
mineral prospects it might locate.
Wyoming-Gulf Sulphur Corp.

The Commission instituted proceedings under section 8 (d) with
respect to the registration statement :filedby Wyoming-Gulf Sulphur
Corp. of Jersey City, N. J., which related to a proposed public offering by the corporation of 700,000 shares for its own account, and
226,000 shares for the account of two stockholders. The offering
was to be made at prices prevailing in the over-the-counter market
but in no event at less than $2 per share. Proceeds of the sale of the
company stock were to be used to furnish auxiliary equipment at its
Cody, Wyo., plant, to acquire an additional site near Thermopolis,
Wyo., and erect a plant thereon, to explore, develop and merchandise
agricultural products, and to make additional acquisitions.
The Commission announced that consideration would be given at
the hearing to questions about the adequacy and accuracy of statements concerning the history and development of the company's
business, in particular the omission of information concerning its property in Cody, Wyo., information concerning the purchase of property
in Thermopolis, the terms of such acquisition, the relationship of the
parties to the purchase agreement, and the material mining facts
concerning such properties; the cost of processing and of marketing
the product of the issuer, the marketability thereof, competitive factors, and related facts; the proposed plan of distribution of company

the accounting firm which prepared the financial statements was not
in fact independent because of its ownership of stock of WyomingGulf Sulphur.
The matter had not been determined at the close of the 1956 fiscal
year. 11
Columbia General Investment Corp.

Another case brought during, and pending at the close of, the 1956
fiscal year, related to the registration statement filed March 29, 1956,
by Columbia General Investment Corp., of Houston, Tex., which
proposed the public offering of 100,000 shares of its common stock to
stockholders at $4.50 per share.
According to the prospectus, proceeds of the proposed stock offering were to be used for the purpose of making investments similar to
those which Columbia General had in mortgage loans, real estate,
stocks, bonds and other securities, including the common stock of
Columbia General Life Insurance Co. The prospectus further listed
Thomas E. Hand, Jr., and J. Ed Eisemann, III, both of Houston, as
board chairman and president, respectively, and principal stockholders
of the company.
The Commission also ordered a public investigation into past sales
of Investment Corp. and the Insurance Co. stock, by the two companies and by Columbia Securities Co., Hand and Eisemann, to determine whether provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Company Act of 1940
had been violated. The Commission was advised by the staff that
stock of the two companies had been offered and sold by means of
false and misleading representations with respect to the general history and development of the companies and the valuation of their
assets; practices followed in connection with the offer and sale of their
shares; and activities, transactions and interests of Hand and Eisemann
in the formation of the companies and the sale and distribution of
their securities. Also involved in the proceedings was an effort to
determine whether Investment Corp. held itself out as being engaged
primarily, or proposed to engage primarily, in the business of investing and reinvesting in securities and, therefore, was required to register
under the Investment Company Act.
With respect to the Investment Corp. registration statement and
prospectus, involved in the proceedings was an effort to determine,
among other things, the adequacy or accuracy of information concernn The Commission issued a stop order on September 18, 1956,finding that the registration statement
contained materially mlsleadlng statements and omlsslons wltb respect to, among other things, the potentIal market for registrant's products, the extent of mineral reserves, and the terms of the offering and plan
of distribution of securities. Securities Act Release No 3690(September 18.1956).

the proceeds thereof; the description of the company's business; the
history of the company's organization and the interests of management and others in certain transactions; the capital stock being registered; and the financial statements.P The matter had not been
determined at the close of the fiscal year.
IDtrasonic Corp.

As a result of an investigation of the Ultrasonic Corp., a stop order
proceeding was instituted by order of the Commission on November
4, 1955, against a registration statement filed by Ultrasonic Corp.
This registration statement became effective on July 22, 1954, and an
amendment was filed which became effective August 25, 1954. The
filing covered a public offering of 200,000 shares of common stock
priced at $12.75, with net proceeds to the company of approximately
$2,300,000.
The staff of the Commission alleged that the registration statement
was false and misleading because, among other things, the statement
of income for the 6 months ended March 31, 1954, reported a small
income instead of a substantial loss amounting to approximately
$900,000 for that period, which amount should have been added to
the deficit reported in the balance sheet as at March 31, 1954. Similarly, it was alleged that the assets set forth in this balance sheet were
overstated and that liabilities stated therein were understated by an
equivalent amount of approximately $900,000.
The Commission's staff based these allegations on the grounds that
net income for the 6 months ended March 31, 1954, had been overstated in the registration statement because cost of goods sold had
'been determined improperly; because losses on government contracts
and price redetermination thereunder had not been sufficiently provided for; and also because certain expenses were deferred improperly
as assets. As a consequence, inventories, plant account and deferred
assets had been overstated and liabilities and reserve for losses and
price redetermination had been understated in the balance sheet as of
March 31, 1954.
It was also alleged by the staff that substantial additional operating
losses subsequent to March 31, 1954, amounting to approximately
$486,000 to June 30, 1954, were not disclosed in the registration statement as it became effective, and approximately $800,000 to July 31,
1954, were not disclosed in the posteffective amendment.
The item in the registration statement relating to "Use of Proceeds,"
which indicated that the proceeds were required for the company's

increased working capital requirements, was charged to be false and
misleading in the light of the undisclosed operating losses.
The Commission had this matter under advisement at the close of
the fiscal year.
Universal Service Corporation, Inc.

On July 8, 1955, this company filed a registration statement covering
a proposed public offering of 500,000 shares of its common stock,
$0.002 par value, at $2.50 per share, or a total of $1,250,000. The
company had been organized in September 1954 for the purpose of
financing the exploration and, if warranted, the mining of uranium,
quicksilver and other minerals as well as gas and oil. In October of
1954, a subsidiary, Universal Service Mining Corp., was organized for
the purpose of exploring potential mining properties. This latter
corporation eventually acquired acreage located in Brewster and
Presidio Counties in the State of Texas from promoters of the enterprise and it was for the exploration and development of this property,
among other things, that the proceeds from the proposed sale of the
500,000 shares of common stock were to be used.
In a radio broadcast on February 13, 1955, a commentator stated
that Universal Service Corp. had discovered uranium ore in the Big
Bend area of Texas, and that the stock of the company was being
sold to the public in large quantities. Since registration of the securities of the company had not been effected under the Securities Act
of 1933, the Commission, on February 21, 1955, directed its Fort
Worth office to conduct an investigation to determine whether unregistered securities were being offered interstate in violation of section
5 of the Act.
In connection with the registration statement the Commission
issued an order for a hearing pursuant to section 8 (d) of the Securities
Act to determine whether the company's registration statement complied with the disclosure provisions of the Act. The Division of
Corporation Finance charged, among other things, that the registration statement was deficient in that it failed to disclose the identities
of the real promoters of the company, together with the interests
these persons had retained in the property, and the amount of stock
they had acquired and resold. It was further contended that the
geological reports and other information given in the registration
statement concerning the property raised serious questions as to the
accuracy and completeness of data given concerning the geology, the
assays reported, and the outcome of the work done, and that the claim
in the prospectus to excellent possibilities for finding oil in the company's properties appeared highly questionable. It was also alleged
that the registration statement failed to point out that the price of
the stock had been arbitrarily established from time to time by the

TWENTY -SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

81

company's board of directors, that sales had been made at prices ranging from 40 cents to $10 per share, and that the proposed offering price
of $2.50, after a 5 for 1 stock split, was equivalent to $12.50 per share
before the split.
The hearings were concluded on October 14, 1955, and the report of
the hearing examiner was filed on July 27, 1956. Subsequently, counsel have filed briefs and oral argument has been heard by the Commission pending its determination of whether a stop order should issue.
LITIGATION

UNDER THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

Injunctive Actions

In order to protect the public from the damage which might result
from threatened violations of the Securities Act, the Commission is
authorized to apply to the courts for injunctions to restrain conduct
in violation of the Act. As in former years, the Commission again
found. it necessary in the fiscal year to invoke such sanctions as a
result of investigations.
illegal oil and gas promotions again claimed the Commission's
attention and required the institution of injunctive action. The
complaint filed in S. E. O. v. Eldon L. Jewett & Perr Oil 00,13 charged
that in the sale of fractional undivided interests in oil leases, the
defendants falsely represented that the defendant Jewett was a substantial investor in these securities and that he was realizing an
annual income of $60,000 to $84,000. The Commission also alleged
-
 that the defendants' representations that no person purchasing these
oil interests had ever lost money and that the money received from
investors would be used for the purpose of drilling and completing oil
wells were false. The defendant Jewett filed an answer to the Commission's complaint in this action and the defendant corporation
consented to the preliminary injunction against further violations of
the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
Fraudulent uranium promotions also required attention in the
Commission's enforcement efforts. In S. E. O. v. Oolotex Uranium &
Oil, Inc., W. H.Keasler,J. Wesley Puller and J. O. Paul,14 the Commission charged that the defendants not only violated the registration
provisions in offering and selling temporary receipts representing a
right to obtain shares of the common stock of the defendant corporation, but also that the defendants falsely stated that the defendant
corporation was the owner of mineral interests or properties in
Wyoming and that the proceeds from the sale of these securities
would be transferred to the defendant corporation and used for
expenses. By consent of the defendants the court issued a preliminary
W. D. Wash. No. 1989 (February

injunction enjoining them from'rfurther violations of the registration
and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
Fraudulent promotions were not limited to oil and mining ventures.
In S. E. O. v. Oentral Finance Service, Inc., Oouncil Mayo Forsyth,
Roy W. Adams and J. L. Hathcoat 16 the Commission had occasion to
ask the court to enjoin those defendants from further violations of the
registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in
connection with the offering and sale of the defendant corporation's
common stock. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the
defendants employed a scheme and device to defraud, and falsely
represented that the stock of the defendant corporation held by
stockholders of that company before September 15, 1955, would
increase or had increased in value more than five times as a result of
the corporation's action in issuing a 10 percent stock dividend and
splitting its stock 5 for 1. Other fraudulent representations which
were charged included references by the defendants to the fact that
the corporation would return to the stockholders all of the money
invested in its stock if such return were desired and that the company
was planning to pay a 20 percent cash dividend and split its stock 10
for 1 in 1956, with the result that $1,000 invested in 1955 would be
worth $10,000 in less than a year. The complaint further charged
the defendants with omitting to tell purchasers that the stock being
sold was that owned by the defendant Forsyth and that he was using
the purchasers' money for his own benefit. Other allegations in the
complaint were to the effect that the defendant corporation had
operated at a loss throughout its entire existence and that the stock
which was being acquired by the public at the price of $10 and $20
per share had been purchased by the defendant Forysth at 16 cents
and 81 cents per share. A final judgment by consent was obtained
against the defendants in this action.
In S. E. O. v. Bertil T. Renhard 16 the Commission's complaint
alleged that the defendant had been offering and selling stock of a
certain company through use of misleading statements and omissions
relating, among other things, to the solvency and precarious financial
condition of the company, the company's inability to pay its rent,
and the market price and ownership of the shares being sold by the
defendant. By consent of the defendant a decree of permanent
injunction was issued enjoining him from further violations of the
antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
Another case involving fraudulent representations was that of
S. E. O. v. John Robert Fish &: Fish Carburetor Oorp.17 There the
Commission charged that the defendants made untrue statements of

company's stock, the profits investors could expect from investments
in the defendant corporation's securities, and the stage of development, marketability and performance of the carburetors to be produced by the defendants. A preliminary injunction by consent was
entered against the defendants to enjoin further violations of the
registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
The Commission also filed a complaint against Mitchell Securities,
Inc., and C. Benjamin Mitchell and Russell P. Dotterer l" officers and
controlling persons of the corporation a registered broker-dealer,
to enjoin them from further violations of the antifraud provisions of
the Securities Act. The complaint charged that the defendants had
been selling debt securities of the defendant corporation by use of
untrue statements and omissions concerning, among other things, the
financial results of the operations of the defendant corporation and its
inability to make payments of interest on the debt securities being
sold. The defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment, and
the permanent injunction which had been sought by the Commission
was entered by the court.
In the first action of such nature brought by the Commission in
the Territory of Alaska, the Commission filed a complaint in the
United States District Court for the Territory of Alaska against the
Alaska Chrome Corp. and Oorneii A. Sherman,19 for an injunction
against further violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. A permanent injunction was issued by the court after the
defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment against them.
In S. E. C. v. Thomas L. North, doing business as North's Neiosletser."
the complaint charged that the defendant, an investment adviser, in
advance of distribution to clients of reports, solicited, received, and
accepted compensation from issuers of and dealers in particular securities to disseminate and distribute copies of the reports to several mailing lists maintained by him in order to attract and spread interest in
the securities so described among brokers and dealers, securities traders
and among persons with the specific objective of attracting and stimulating trading in such securities, without disclosing the receipt and
amount of such compensation. Upon the defendant's consent to the
entry of judgment the court issued a decree of permanent injunction
against further violations of section 17 (b) of the Securities Act by the
defendant.
In addition, injunctions against further violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act were obtained in many other cases.

One of these involved the sale of stock in the United States of Camoose

registration provisions of the Securities Act in selling in the United
States securities which were not registered as required. The corporation and Philip M. King, Sr., consented to the entry of a permanent
injunction."
The action was dismissed as to two other individual

violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the Act, and
the Commission dismissed its complaint against the defendant corporation.
Participation as Amicus Curiae

The Commission participated as amicus curiae in Whittaker v. Wall,29
a private action under section 12 (1) of the Securities Act of 1933 to
recover the consideration paid for securities sold in violation of the
registration requirements of that Act. Defendants denied that,
under section 22 (a) of the Act, venue properly lay in the district in
which the action was brought because no "sale," in the sense of a
consummated transaction, had taken place there. Agreeing with the
view of the Commission, the Court of Appeals held inter alia that the
broad definition of "sale" in section 2 (3) of the Act, which included
solicitations of an offer to buy such as had taken place in the district
in question, applied notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff sought

LITIGATION

CONCERNING DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION'S
CONFIDENTIAL FILES

During the fiscal year the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
handed down a landmark decision upholding the confidential nature
of the Commission's investigation files and internal staff and Commission deliberations, and sustaining the validity of the Commission's
rules which prohibit Commission employees from divulging such information without specific Commission authorization.
Sustained also
was the position of the Commission that its employees who decline
to divulge information of this character in obedience to these rules
cannot be properly held in contempt of court. In re Appeals of
S. E. O. and William H. Timbers, its general counsel."
These questions arose in a private lawsuit in a Federal district
court in Detroit to which the Commission was at no time a party."
Plaintiffs' allegations of corporate mismanagement included, inter alia,
a charge that the defendant management had violated the Securities
Act in failing to register an issue of voting trust certificates designed
to prevent the plaintiffs from obtaining control of the company.
Early in the litigation consummation of the voting trust was barred
by stipulation of the parties and by injunctive orders.
After the institution of the lawsuit, the Commission commenced its
own private investigation of the alleged violation. During the trial
the plaintiffs' attorney, at the suggestion of the district judge, served
a subpena upon the attorney in charge of the Commission's Detroit
branch office calling for the production of the Commission's investigation file and for testimony on matters covered by the investigation.
In an effort to cooperate and on the representation of plaintiffs'
counsel that this would fully satisfy his needs, the Commission released its correspondence with the parties to the litigation and authorized the subpenaed Commission employee to testify on interviews
and conversations which he may have had with the parties or their
representatives.
Thereafter, upon the further request of plaintiffs'
counsel, the Commission voluntarily sent to Detroit two staff officials

from its Washington office for the limited purpose of testifying on
other conferences held in Washington with defendants' attorneys.
The questioning of Commission employees in Detroit, however, went
far beyond these conferences. Information was sought on intraagency communications, reports, recommendations and internal administrative determinations with respect to the investigation and the
action to be taken as a result thereof. Also sought were the identities
of, and information obtained from, confidential informants other than
the parties to the litigation. The staff witnesses, obeying the Commission's rules and specific Commission instructions, declined to
divulge the information. The district judge having indicated that
he might hold the staff witnesses in contempt, the Commission's
General Counsel, William H. Timbers, went to Detroit to represent
them. After several days of examination of Commission employees,
the district judge summarily ordered Timbers himself, over his protest,
to take the witness stand. When Timbers refused to produce unconditionally a preliminary report of investigation in the Commission's file, he was summarily held in contempt, committed to the
custody of the United States Marshal, and sentenced to 60 days' imprisonment unless he sooner purged himself of the alleged contempt.
An appeal was filed immediately and a stay of execution obtained from
the Court of Appeals.
In reversing and setting aside the contempt order and in directing
that Timbers be "completely absolved" from any "alleged contempt,"
the Court of Appeals also held that the district judge had "overstepped
appropriate judicial bounds" in seeking to conduct "a searchmg
inquisition" into the way in which the Commission was carrying out
its statutory responsibilities in the particular matter. The appellate
court also ruled that the district judge had abused "all justifiable
discretion" in his conduct of the case and in his treatment of the
Commission's general counsel.
The Department of Justice supported the position of the Commission and presented the matter to the appellate-court."
32 It Is of interest to note that ill an appeal by the defendant in the prrvate lawsuit, the Court of Appeals
for the SIXth Oireuit (232 F. 2d 458 (1956))referred to the facts ill the 'limbers case as "an Important background to the question now presented"
The court agreed with appellant that the district judge "figuratively speaking, stepped down from the bench to assume the role of advocate for the plaintiff." The
judgment was reversed and the case remanded for retrral before another Judge.

OF TIlE SECURITIES
OF 1934

EXCHANGE ACT

I

I

I
I,
,

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides for the registration
and regulation of securities exchanges, for the registration of securities
listed on such exchanges and establishes, for issuers of securities so
registered, financial and other reporting requirements, regulation of
proxy solicitations, and requirements with respect to trading by
officers, directors and principal security holders. The Exchange Act
also provides for the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers
doing business in the over-the-counter market in interstate commerce,
contains provisions designed to prevent acts and practices deemed to
be fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative either on the exchanges or
in the over-the-counter market, authorizes the Federal Reserve Board
to regulate the use of credit in securities transactions, and contains
other related provisions. A stated purpose of these statutory requirements is to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in
securities transactions.
Regulation under the Exchange Act reflects the distinction between
the exchange market and the over-the-counter market. In the exchange market, the exchange itself, which is the focal point of the
market, is required to register, and, in order to do so, must demonstrate that it is able to comply with the statute and the rules and
regulations thereunder and that its rules are just and adequate to
insure fair dealing and to protect investors. Registered exchanges
must provide for the discipline of any member for conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade and for willful
violations of the statute and the rules and regulations. Issuers of
securities listed on exchanges become subject to provisions of the
statute and the rules requiring the filing of reports, including annual
financial reports certified by independent certified public accountants,
and semiannual reports of sales and earnings, which need not be
certified; the requirement that proxies be solicited in accordance with
the proxy rules, including the furnishing to stockholders from whom
proxies are solicited of information necessary to the intelligent exercise of their voting rights, and the requirement that officers, directors,
and 10-percent stockholders report currently changes in their holdings
and account to the issuer for profits from short swing trading in their
companies' stock.
87

88

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In the over-the-counter market there is no such organized center of
trading as the exchange upon which regulatory activities may focus
and, under present law,' the issuers of securities traded in that market
do not thereby become subject to the regulatory provisions of the
statute, except for those subjected to financial reporting requirements
pursuant to section 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, by reason of their
registration under the Securities Act of securities of a class the aggregate value of which amounts to $2,000,000 or more.
In the over-the-counter market, brokers and dealers using the
facilities of interstate commerce or the mails are generally required
to register with the Commission and are subject to many statutory
provisions and Commission rules designed to prevent fraudulent,
deceptive or manipulative practices and to protect their customers .
Any person may register as a broker or dealer unless subject to disqualifications specified in section 15 (b) of the Exchange Act. These
disqualifications are all based on specified types of prior misconduct
on the part of the applicant such as convictions or injunctions involving securities transactions or willful violation of the Federal
securities laws.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING
Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

At the close of 1956, 15 stock exchanges were registered under
the Exchange Act as national securities exchanges:
American Stock Exchange.
Boston Stock Exchange.
Chicago Board of Trade.
Cincinnati Stock Exchange.
Detroit Stock Exchange.
Los Angeles Stock Exchange.
Midwest Stock Exchange.
New Orleans Stock Exchange.

New York Stock Exchange.
Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange.
Pittsburgh Stock Exchange.
Salt Lake City Stock Exchange.
San Francisco Stock Exchange.
San Francisco Mining Exchange.
Spokane Stock Exchange.

The following four exchanges have been exempted from registration
by the Commission pursuant to section 5 of the Exchange Act upon
the ground that registration was impracticable and not necessary or
appropriate by reason of the limited volume of transactions effected
on such exchanges:
Colorado Springs Stock Exchange.
Honolulu Stock Exchange.

Richmond Stock Exchange.
Wheeling Stock Exchange.

These exemptions are, however, subject to conditions which subject
such exchanges, their members and the issuers of securities listed
thereon to most of the requirements which would be applicable if
I S-2054,84th Cong., 1st sess., and predecessor bills would make certain larger Issuers In the over-the-counter
market subject to substantially the same requirements as Issuers of listed securities. For eurther disclIsslon
of this Bill, see the chapter on Legislative Activities In this report.

TWENTY -SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

89

they were registered, except for the proxy requirements of section 14
and the provisions of section 16 regarding transactions by officers,
directors, and principal stockholders. Since 1935, companies listing
additional classes of securities on exempted exchanges must comply
with the reporting provisions of sections 12 and 13 of the Exchange
Act.
Exchange Rules and Disciplinary Actions

Under section 19 (b) of the Exchange Act the Commission, after
appropriate notice and hearing, may impose changes in exchange rules
dealing with 12 enumerated topics ranging from the listing or delisting
of securities to the hours of trading. The Commission has rarely
found it necessary to exercise this power, the only instance to date
having occurred in 1940. All exchanges are required to :filecopies of
their rules and amendments thereto with the Commission and any
significant changes are in practice discussed with and considered by
the staff of the Commission prior to their formal adoption and the
Commission may be consulted with respect thereto. Consideration
of any problems which may arise from such proposals at this stage
has largely obviated, up to now, the necessity for formal proceedings
under section 19 (b).
Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission disciplinary action taken against members for violations of the Securities Exchange Act or exchange rules. During the year 6 exchanges
reported 37 cases of such disciplinary action. The actions taken
included fines in 18 cases, expulsion of 1 individual from exchange
membership, suspension of 6 individuals, and censure of individuals
and firms.
REGISTRATION

OF SECURITIES

ON EXCHANGES

It is unlawful for a member of a national securities exchange or a
broker or dealer to effect any transaction in a security on such exchange
unless the security is registered on that exchange under the Securities
Exchange Act or is exempt from such registration.
In general the
Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a
State or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or agencies
thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and regulations
exempting such other securities as the Commission may find it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors to exempt. Under this authority the Commission has

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Section 12 of the Exchange Act provides that an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. An application requires the
furnishing of information in regard to the issuer's business, capital
structure, the terms of its securities, the persons who manage or
control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officers and directors,
the allotment of options, bonuses and profit sharing plans, and
financial statements certified by independent accountants.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit,
securities of foreign governments, etc.
Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration.
These periodic reports
include annual reports, semiannual reports, and current (monthly)
reports. The principal annual report form is Form lO-K which is
designed to keep up to date the information furnished on Form 10.
Semiannual reports required to be furnished on Form 9-K are devoted
chiefly to furnishing mid-year financial data. Current reports on
Form 8-K are required to be filed for each month in which any of
certain specified events have occurred. A report on this form deals
with matters such as changes in control or the registrant, important
acquisitions or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination
of important legal proceedings, and important changes in the issuer's
capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding.
As of June 30, 1956, a total of 2,253 issuers had 3,686 securities
issues listed and registered on national securities exchanges of which
2,659 were stocks and 1,027 were bonds. Of the 2, 253 issuers, 1,275
had 1,513 stocks and 985 bonds listed and registered on the New
York:Stock Exchange. On a percentage basis, the New York Stock
Exchange had 57 percent of both issuers and stocks and 96 percent of
the bonds.
During the fiscal year, 109 issuers listed and registered securities
for the first time on a national securities exchange and the listing
and registration of all securities of 75 issuers was terminated during
the year. Of the 109, the securities of 18 were listed and registered
on the N ew York Stock Exchange and of the 75 whose listing and
registration was terminated, 30 had had securities listed and registered:on the N ew York Stock Exchange during the year.
The number of applications filed for registration of classes of securities on national securities exchanges during the fiscal year was 232.

New York Stock Exchange reported a previous high market value of
$89.7 billion in September 1929 and a low of $15.6 billion in July 1932.
The number of shares of stock admitted to trading on the exchanges
was approximately 5,476,000,000 as of December 31, 1955, including
152,300,000 preferred and 5,323,700,000 common. Of the total, approximately 5,000,000,000 shares were listed on registered exchanges,
including 142,600,000 preferred and 4,866,000,000 common shares.
Comparative Over-the-Counter Statistics

There are no overall statistics with respect to over-the-counter
securities comparable to those available from the exchanges. Certain data can be derived from registrations and other filings with
the Commission under the Acts which it administers. For example,
357 issuers with about $13 billion assets registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 have exclusively over-the-counter mar-

TWENTY-SECOND

kets for their securities. 971 additional issuers reporting pursuant
to section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had stocks
exclusively in over-the-counter markets with an aggregate value of
over $17 billion as of December 31, 1955.
Recent studies have furnished increasing evidence as to the relative size of the over-the-counter market. With respect to bonds,
the over-the-counter market is undoubtedly larger than the exchange
market, since the principal market for bonds of the United States
Government, States and municipalities and for high-grade corporate
bonds is over the counter. With regard to stocks, there are many
thousands which are quoted over the counter. The smaller issues
among these, however, shade rapidly into substantially or completely
privately owned issues with respect to which public bids and offers
are rarely available. The studies conducted by the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylvania 2 indicate that during the period
covered only 3.2 percent of the aggregate value of transactions over
the counter in outstanding common stock was in issues with a market value of less than $1,000,000 and that only 5.1 percent of such
value was in issues with 500 or less stockholders,"
A study by the
N ew York Stock Exchange 4 included stocks owned by at least 300
stockholders and finds 3,723 issues with 2,540,000,000 shares over
the counter compared with 2,956 issues with 5,372,000,000 shares on
exchanges. It also states that the number of holders of record of
these over-the-counter stocks is 8,671,000 against 22,567,000 for the
stocks on the exchanges. These figures as to holders of record are
duplicated, each holder of record being counted once for each issue
he owns. The number of domestic individual holders of 6,679 stocks
covered by the study after elimination of duplication is stated to be
about 8,630,000. The New York Stock Exchange study in addition
concludes that 8 of 10 shareholders own stock listed on that Exchange.
The Wharton School study indicates that the dollar volume of
transactions in outstanding stocks over the counter is only a moderate fraction of the total volume of transactions, including those on
stock exchanges." One of the larger investment firms, which has
well over 100 offices scattered throughout the country, has for years
constantly reported that less than one-quarter of its income from the
securities business is derived from unlisted securities, retail sales,
and underwriting."

Report, indicates that there were about 1,200 domestic corporations
(excluding insurance companies, investment companies, and banks)
which appeared to have $2 million or more of assets and 750 or more
stockholders and whose securities were traded in the over-the-counter
market or admitted to unlisted and unregistered trading on exchanges.
About 500 corporations would be added to this group if the test as to
the number of stockholders was reduced to 300.
It thus appears from these studies that the exchange market for
stocks is larger in terms of the number of shareholders and volume
of trading and that, although there are many more stock issues in
the over-the-counter market, the bulk of activity and of public stockholder interest is concentrated in larger issues, the number of which
probably does not exceed the number of issues on exchanges.
The National Quotation Bureau reports about 20,000 stocks carrying over-the-counter quotations in its October 1956 Summary, which
is a cumulative record extending over a period of years. This Bureau's
daily quotation sheets carry about 6,000 stocks. About 10 percent
of the stocks shown are listed on domestic or Canadian stock exchanges.
The Commission estimates that there are about 3,500 domestic issuers
with 300 or more stockholders each, whose stocks are traded only
over the counter and which had an aggregate market value of around
$45 billion on December 31, 1955, these figures being exclusive of
issuers registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1956, the Commission
granted 12 applications filed by exchanges or issuers to remove securities from exchange listing and registration pursuant to section 12 (d)
of the Exchange Act. The applications included 6 by exchanges
covering 8 stocks and 6 by issuers covering 6 stocks. The applications
by exchanges were with respect to 2 stocks where shares and holders
were stated to be insufficient for further exchange trading, 5 where a
merger, sale of assets or liquidation was involved and 1 where the
listing and registration was transferred to another exchange. The
applications by issuers were with respect to 4 stocks which remained
listed and registered on other exchanges and 2 which were stated to
have insufficient shares and holders for further exchange trading.
At the close of the fiscal year, 5 applications were pending, of which
3 were made pursuant to a policy adopted by the New York Stock
Exchange that it will consider delisting a common stock where the
size of a company has been reduced to below $2,000,000 in net tangible
assets or aggregate market value of the common stock and the average
net earnings after taxes for the last three years is below $200,000.

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

This policy of the New York Stock Exchange reflects an attempt to
make more congruent the standards for original listings and the
standards for continuance and maintenance of listing.
Under section 12 (d) of the Exchange Act if the Commission finds
that an exchange seeking to remove a security from listing and
registration has complied with its own rules the Commission may
not deny such an application but is limited to imposing such terms as
it may find necessary for the protection of investors. In two recent
delisting cases filed by the N ew York Stock Exchange, Atlas Tack
Corp. and Exchange Buffet Corp.,? hearings were held to determine
whether exchange rules had been complied with and whether any
terms should be imposed for the protection of investors. The Commission found that there had been compliance with exchange rules
and that the delisting applications should be granted without the
imposition of any terms or conditions.
UNLISTED

TRADING PRIVILEGES

ON EXCHANGES

Volume of Unlisted Trading in Stocks on Exchanges

Under the provisions of section 12 (f) of the Act, the Commission
may approve an application by a national securities exchange to admit
a security to unlisted trading privileges even though the issuer has
not agreed to list the security on the particular exchange. Section
12 (f) provides for three categories of unlisted trading privileges.
Clause (1) securities are the residue of those admitted to unlisted
trading privileges prior to March 1, 1934. Clause (2) securities are
those admitted to unlisted trading privileges following their full listing
and registration on another national securities exchange. Clause (3)
securities are those admitted to unlisted trading privileges conditioned
upon the availability of information substantially equivalent to that
filed in the case of listed issues. Securities admitted to unlisted
trading privileges consist primarily of issues listed on other exchanges
and the residue of issues which were already admitted to unlisted
trading privileges when the statute was enacted.
The reported volume of shares traded on an unlisted basis on the
stock exchanges during the calendar year 1955 included approximately
37.9 million shares in stocks admitted to unlisted trading only and 33.9
million shares in stocks listed and registered on exchanges other than
those where the unlisted trading occurred. These amounts were
respectively about 3.1 and 2.8 percent of the total share volume
reported on all exchanges. Appendix table 8 shows the distribution
of share volumes among the various categories of unlisted trading
privileges on exchanges.

The Commission's rule X-12F-2 provides that when a security
admitted to unlisted trading privileges is changed in certain minor
respects it shall be deemed to be the security previously admitted to
unlisted trading privileges, and if it is changed in other respects the
exchange may file an application requesting the Commission to
determine that notwithstanding such change the security is substantially equivalent to the security theretofore admitted to unlisted
trading privileges. During the year to June 30, 1956, the Commission
granted 2 applications by the American Stock Exchange and 1 by the
New Orleans Stock Exchange for a determination that changed
securities were the substantial equivalent of the securities previously
admitted to unlisted trading privileges. Two bond issues and two
stock issues were involved.
BLOCK DISTRIBUTIONS REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

Rule X-lOB-2, in substance, prohibits any person participating
or interested in the distribution of a security from paying any other
person for soliciting or inducing a third person to buy the security
on a national securities exchange. This rule is an antimanipulative
rule adopted under section 10 (b) of the Act which makes it unlawful
for any person to use any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of Commission rules prescribed in the
public interest or for the protection of investors. Paragraph (d)
of the rule provides an exemption from its prohibitions where compensation is paid pursuant to the terms of a plan, filed by a national
securities exchange and declared effective by the Commission, authorizing the payment of such compensation in connection with the
distribution.
At the present time two types of plans are in effect to permit a
block of securities to be distributed through the facilities of a national
securities exchange when it has been determined that the regular
market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb the particular
block within a reasonable time and at a reasonable. price or prices.

TWENTY-SECOND

97

ANNUAL REPORT

These plans have been designated the "Special Offering Plan," essentially a fixed price offering based on the market price, and the "Exchange Distribution Plan," which is a distribution "at the market."
Both plans contemplate that orders will be solicited off the'floor but
executed on the floor. Each of such plans contains certain antimanipulative controls and requires specified disclosures concerning
the distribution to be made to prospective purchasers.
In addition to these two methods of distributing large blocks of
securities on national securities exchanges, a third method is commonly employed whereby blocks of listed securities may be distributed
to the public over the counter. This method is commonly referred
to as a "Secondary Distribution" and such a distribution usually
takes place after the close of exchange trading. It is generally the
practice of exchanges to require members to obtain the approval of
the exchange before participating in such secondary distributions.
More complete details concerning these three types of plans are
contained in previous annual reports of this Oommission (see e. g.,
pp. 29-30 of the 20th Annual Report). The following table shows
the number and dollar volume of special offerings and exchange
distributions reported by the exchanges having such plans in effect,
as well as similar figures for secondary distributions which exchanges
have approved for member participation and reported to the
Oommission.

AND STABILIZATION

Manipulation

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity in securities registered on a national securities exchange.
The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched orders, if
effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance
of trading activity or with respect to the market for any such security i
a series of transactions in which the price of such security is raised
or depressed, or in which the appearance of active trading is created,

98

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales by others; circulation
by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer, or by a person who receives
consideration from a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer, of information
concerning market operations conducted for a rise or a decline; and
the making of material false and misleading statements by brokers,
dealers, sellers, or buyers, or the omission of material information
regarding securities for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales.
The Act also empowers the Commission to adopt rules and regulations to define and prohibit the use of these and other forms of manipulative activity in securities whether or not such securities are registered on an exchange or traded over the counter.
The Commission's market surveillance staff in our Division of
Trading and Exchanges in Washington and in our N ew York Regional
Office and other field offices observes the ticker-tape quotations of the
N ew York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange
securities, the sales and quotation sheets of the various regional
exchanges, and the bid and asked prices published by the National
Daily Quotation Service for about 6,000 unlisted securities to see if
there are any unusual or unexplained price variations or market
activity. The financial newsticker, leading newspapers, and various
financial publications and statistical services are also closely followed.
When unusual or unexplained market activity in a security is
observed, all known information regarding the security is evaluated
and a decision made as to the necessity for an investigation.
Most
investigations are not made public so that no unfair reflection will
be cast on any persons or securities and the trading markets will not
be upset. These investigations, which are conducted by the Commission's regional offices, take two forms. A preliminary investigation or "quiz" is designed rapidly to discover evidence of unlawful
activity. If no violations are found, the preliminary investigation
is closed. If it appears that more intensive investigation is necessary,
a formal order of investigation, which carries with it the right to
issue subpenas and to take testimony under oath, is issued by the
Commission. If violations are discovered, the Commission may
suspend or revoke the registration of a broker-dealer or it may expel
him from the National Association of Securities Dealers. Similarly,
a member of a national securities exchange may be suspended or
expelled from the exchange. The Commission may also seek an
injunction against any person violating the Act and it may recommend to the Department of Justice that any person violating the
Act be criminally prosecuted. In some cases, where State action
seems likely to bring quick results in preventing fraud or where
Federal jurisdiction may be doubtful, the information obtained may
be referred to State agencies for State injunction or criminal prosecution.

When securities are to be offered to the public their markets are
watched very closely to make sure that the price is not artificially
raised prior to or during the distribution.
Eight hundred and thirtythree registered offerings having a dollar value of $13,095,000,000
and 1,478 offerings exempt under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act,
having a value of about $277,000,000 were so observed during the
fiscal year. About 300 other small offerings, such as secondary
distributions and distributions of securities under special plans filed
by the exchanges, were also checked and many were kept under
special observation for considerable lengths of time.
Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a
distribution.
It is permitted by the Exchange Act subject to the
restrictions provided by the Commission's rules. These rules are
designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary for purposes
of the distribution, to require proper disclosure and to prevent unlawful manipulation.
During 1956 stabilizing was effected in connection with stock
offerings aggregating 32,174,925 shares having an aggregate public
offering price of $1,124,596,781. Bond issues having a total offering
price of $208,222,619 were also stabilized.
To accomplish this,
678,122 shares of stock were purchased in stabilizing transactions
at a cost of $18,488,813 and bonds costing $4,881,171 were also bought.
In connection with these stabilizing transactions more than 8,900
stabilizing reports which show purchases and sales of securities
effected by persons conducting the distribution were received and
examined during the fiscal year.
In order more closely to police stabilizing activities, the Commission revised the rule requiring the filing of stabilizing reports', effective

100

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

July 1, 1956.1 Hitherto such reports were required only when registered offerings were stabilized. The present ru1e requires reports
not only on registered offerings, but also offerings exempt from registration under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act and any other offering
having a value of at least $300,000. While these revisions were
being made, the stabilizing report form was simplified, also effective
July 1, 1956.2 Hereafter only the managing underwriter must file
daily reports. Other members of the syndicate may file a summary
report after stabilizing is discontinued. In addition, many transactions at the same price level may be "bunched" and only certain
key transactions need be timed. The changes will continue to give
the investor adequate protection, but they will greatly relieve the
reporting burden on the securities industry. It is felt that in spite
of the greater area to be covered, the number of reports necessary to
be filed with the Commission will be reduced by about a half.
INSIDERS' SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND HOLDINGS

Every person who owns more than 10 percent of any class of equity
security which is listed on a national securities exchange, or who is an'
officer or director of the issuer of any such security, is required by
section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to file with the
Commission and the exchange a report disclosing his ownership of each
class of the issuer's equity securities and an additional report for each
month in which any subsequent change in his ownership occurs, setting
forth information as to the transactions involved. Officers and
directors of registered public utility holding companies and officers,
directors and 10 percent stockholders of registered closed-end investment companies are subject to similar requirements under section 17
(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act and section 30 (f)
of the Investment Company Act.
These reports are available for public inspection at the Commission's
office and at the exchanges. In order to make the information contained therein more readily available to interested persons throughout
the country it is summarized and published in the Commission's
monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings,"
which is distributed on a subscription basis by the Government Printing Office. The widespread public interest in transactions reported
by insiders is evidenced by the fact that the circulation of this publication exceeds 4,000 copies a month.
The number of reports filed continues an upward trend, 32,001 during the 1956 fiscal year, as compared with 28,975 during the 1955
fiscal year, 23,199 during the 1954 fiscal year, and 22,333 during
the 1953 fiscal year. The following tabulation shows details concerning the reports filed during the 1956 fiscal year.

Recovery of Short Swing Trading Profits by or on Behalf of Issuer

For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which
may have been obtained by an officer, director or 10-percent stockholder by reason of his relationship to his' company, sections 16 (b)
of the Securities Exchange Act, 17 (b) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act, and 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act provide for
the recovery by or on behalf of the issuer of any profit realized by the
officer, director or lO-percent stockholders from certain purchases and
sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within any
period of less than 6 months.
The Commission is not charged with
the enforcement of the civil remedies created by these provisions, which
are matters for determination by the courts in actions brought by the
proper parties.
REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

The scope and character of the Commission's regulation of the solicitation of proxies-written
authority from a shareholder to another to
act in the shareholder's place-is more fully described in this report
under "Revision of Forms, Rules, and Regulations" at page 33.
Under sections 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12 (e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 the Commission has adopted Regulation X-14 requiring the disclosure of pertinent information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, consents and authorizations
in respect of securities of companies subject to those statutes.
The

102

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

regulation also provides means whereby any security holders so desiring may communicate with other security holders when management is soliciting proxies, either by arranging for the independent
distribution of their own proxy statements or by including their proposals in the proxy statements sent out by management.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to avoid such
defects in the preparation of the proxy material in the definitive form
in which it may be furnished to stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1956 fiscal year 2,016 solicitations were made pursuant
to regulation X-14, of which 1,995 were conducted by management
and 21 by nonmanagement groups. The 1,995 solicitations by management related to 1,711 companies, more than one solicitation having
been made with respect to some of the companies.
The purpose for which proxies are most often sought is the voting
for nominees for directors. In fiscal 1956 this was an item of business
in 1,705 stockholders' meetings, while at 288 meetings the election
of directors was not involved. The remaining 23 solicitations, which
did not involve any meeting of stockholders, sought consents or
authorizations from stockholders with respect to certain proposals
other than the election of directors.
In addition to the election of directors, stockholders' decisions
were sought in the 1956 fiscal year with respect to the following types
of matters:
Nature of buslnus other than electIOn of directors

Mergers, consolidations, acquisition of businesses, purchases and sales
of property, and dissolution of companies___________________________
Issuance of new securities, modifications of existing securities, and recapitalization plans other than mergers and consolidations

Stockholders' Proposals

One of the most important provisions of the proxy rules is the
principle adopted by the Commission as early as 1939 and codified
in the rules in 1942 (now rule X-14A-8) by which a qualified security
holder may require the management of a company to include in the
management's proxy soliciting material a proposal which he desires

TWENTY -SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

103

to submit to a vote of his fellow security holders. As revised over
the years, the rule provides that, if the management opposes the
proposal, it must, at the request of the security holder, include in
the proxy statement the name and address of the security holder and
a statement of the security holder in not more than 100 words in
support of the proposal. The rule also requires that the proposal be
submitted to the management a reasonable time before the solicitation
is made and that it be a proper subject for action by the security
holders under the law of the State where the company is incorporated.
It cannot be submitted primarily for the purpose of enforcing a
personal claim or redressing a personal grievance against the company or its management or for the purpose of promoting general
economic, political, racial, religious, social, or similar causes. In
conformance with State laws, the proposal may not be a recommendation or request that management act with respect to a matter
relating to the conduct of the ordinary business operations of the
company. The rule also contains provisions to limit the introduction
year after year of proposals which receive little or no support from
other security holders by providing that certain percentages of the
vote must be obtained to require the management to include the
proposal again in its proxy material within certain periods of time.
During the 1956 fiscal year, 19 stockholders of 65 companies submitted a total of 102 proposals to a vote of security holders in the
management's proxy soliciting material under rule X-14A-8.
Typical of matters thus submitted to a vote of all security holders
on the initiative of individual stockholders were such proposals as
the following: to restrict the sale of stock to employees; to require
participants in employee stock purchase plans to hold their stock
for three years; to provide for cumulative voting in the election of
directors; to require the election of all directors; to require the election
of all directors annually; to place a ceiling of $25,000 on pensions to
employees; tD require ownership of a certain number of shares of a
company as a qualification for a director; to increase the number of
members on the board of directors of a company; to require that
auditors be elected by the stockholders and be present at the following
annual meeting of the company for questioning by shareholders; to
furnish all stockholders with a postmeeting report; to resubmit
incentive compensation plans to stockholders' approval every 5 years
and to make no payment under the plans in any year that common
dividends are passed; and to terminate a company's stock option plan.
The management of 20 companies omitted from their proxy statements, under the conditions specified in rule X-14A-8, a total of 41
additional stockholder proposals tendered by 26 individual stockholders. The reasons why these 41 stockholder proposals were omitted

104

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

from management's proxy statements are enumerated below with a
parenthetical indication of the number of times each reason was
operative; the proposal was withdrawn by the stockholder concerned
(6); did not involve a proper subject matter for shareholders' action
under State law (16); was not submitted to the management within
the time prescribed by the proxy rules (6); proposal gained insufficient
votes at previous meeting (2); involved the conduct of the ordinary
business operations of the company (6) ; involved a personal grievance
(4); and did not really constitute a proposal within the meaning
of the rule (1).
Ratio of Soliciting to Noneollcitfng Companies

Generally speaking, section 14 (a) and the Commission's proxy
rules are operative only if a solicitation is in fact made. The statute
and the rules do not in terms compel corporations to solicit proxies if
they do not wish to do so. During the last fiscal year the Commission
was requested by a subcommittee of the Senate Banking and Currency
Committee to make a report as to whether or not solicitations of proxies in respect of the election of directors of corporations should be
made mandatory by statute. The Commission has not formulated its
views for presentation to the Congress. It expects, however, to do so
before the next session of the Congress. To aid it in making its report
the Commission, among other things, has conducted a special study
to ascertain the proportion of listed companies which solicit proxies
from their security holders. Out of 2,253 companies with securities
listed and registered on a national securities exchange as of June 30,
1956, 120 were foreign issuers exempt from regulation X-14 under
rule X-3.A.12-3; and 128 were domestic issuers (including for classification purposes Canadian, Cuban, and Philippine issuers) whose
listed securities were nonvoting. Of the remainder, 519 domestic
companies did not solicit proxies for the election of directors during
the 1956 fiscal year, but these included 42 companies which initially
registered voting securities after their 1956 annual meetings had been
held, thus, 477 companies that did not solicit proxies for the election
of directors although such companies had voting securities listed and
registered at the time of the annual meeting. The remaining 1,486
(76 percent) domestic companies did solicit proxies for the election of
directors.
I"roxy Colltests

As more fully described under the heading "Revision of Forms,
Rules and Regulations" in this report at page 33, the Commission has
been concerned in recent years with the efficiency of its proxy rules
as applied to proxy contests-struggles
between management and
opposition groups for control of a company by means of obtaining
sufficient proxies from shareholders to elect at least a majority of the

105

TWENTY -SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

directors. As indicated in the discussion at page 33 of this report,
during the last fiscal year the Commission extensively revised its
proxy rules in order to obtain important detailed disclosures for shareholders in connection with such contests. A feature of the revised
rules is a requirement that each participant in the proxy contest,
existing directors as well as the nominees for directors and the promoters of opposition groups, must file with the Commission a detailed
statement (schedule B of the revised proxy rules) covering his background, business experience, criminal record, if any, participation in
other proxy contests of any corporation, share ownership, and the
sources of funds used to purchase such shares. In addition his proposed position with the company and any other transactions he contemplated in which the company or its subsidiaries will be involved
must be described. All of this information must be made available
to shareholders in the course of the contest.
In 1956 there were 17 companies involved in proxy contests, of
which 8 were for control and 9 were for representation on the board
of directors. In these contests 218 individual participants filed the
detailed statements required by schedule 14B. Of the 8 contests for
control, 5 were won by management, 2 were won by the opposition,
and 1was pending in the courts; while of the 9 proxy contests in which
opposition groups were seeking representation on the board, 3 were
won by management, 4 were won by the opposition, and 2 were settled
through negotiation whereby opposition was given a place on management's slate and no opposition solicitation was made.
REGULATION OF BROKER~DEALERS AND
OVER-TIlE-COUNTER MARKETS
Registration

Section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires
registration of brokers and dealers using the mails or instrumentalities
of interstate commerce to effect transactions in securities on the overthe-counter market, except those brokers and dealers whose business
is exclusively intrastate or exclusively in exempt securities. The
tabulations below reflect certain statistical data with respect to
registration of brokers and dealers and applications for such registration during the fiscal year 1956.

Administrative Proceedings

Under section 15 (b) of the Exchange Act the Commission may
deny registration to a broker-dealer or revoke such registration only
if it finds such action to be in the public interest and that the applicant
or broker-dealer or any partner, officer, director, or other person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by such broker-dealer,
has been guilty of one or more of 4 specified types of misconduct.
In general, such types of misconduct comprise the willful making of
false or misleading statements in the application and related proceedings, conviction within 10 years of a crime involving the purchase or
sale of securities or the conduct of the business of a broker-dealer,
injunction by a court from engaging in any practice in connection
with the purchase or sale of securities, or willful violation of the
Federal securities laws or the Commission's regulations thereunder.
The Commission may not deny to any person the right to register
and engage in business as a broker-dealer in interstate commerce,
absent misconduct of the specified types enumerated in the Act, and
irrespective of whether such individual has had any experience in the
brokerage business.

In a proceeding against Robert Dermot French, doing business ae
French & Co.8 the Commission denied an application for registration
as a broker-dealer after :finding that the applicant had effected transactions as a broker and dealer without registration, had sold securities
which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and had
been enjoined from sales of unregistered securities. In addition, the

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Commission found that the applicant had filed a false and misleading
financial statement in support of his application for registration.
A proceeding against A. M. Kidder &: 00.9 was based upon violations
of the registration provisions of the Securities Act in connection with
the sales of the stock of a Canadian corporation. A. M. Kidder & Co.
made offers of rescission to all persons and firms to whom it or one of
its partners in charge of its branch offices had sold shares of the Canadian corporation's stock. The Commission decided that it was not
in the public interest to impose any penalty against the registrant,
although it did find that a violation of the registration provisions of
the Securities Act had been committed both by the firm and by one
of its partners. A. M. Kidder & Co. as a result of its offer of rescission
repurchased a total of 206,500 shares at a cost of approximately
$216,500.
In another proceeding which was instituted against Haley &: Company, Inc.lO the Commission denied the application for registration,
finding that Haley, its president, sold the applicant's preferred stock
in violation of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
by representing to purchasers that they would receive dividends of
8 percent, and that Haley had invested money in the applicant's stock
while failing to disclose that the applicant corporation was operating
at a deficit, and dividends were paid out of capital, and that Haley
did not in fact contribute cash to the applicant's capital; that Haley
induced certain of his customers who had purchased the applicant's
preferred stock to lend him money and to accept his notes, without
disclosing that he was financially unable to repay the notes, as well as
the fact that he intended to have the applicant use the money to repurchase its preferred stock from certain other customers; and that
Haley also sold to four customers, all of whom were widows and inexperienced in securities matters, stock in a company that did no business
and had no income.
In denial proceedings instituted against Professional Imesiors, Inc.ll
the Commission found that the applicant had delivered unregistered
shares of its stock in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, had violated the antifraud provisions of that Act by publishing and circulating
a magazine article describing certain securities without disclosing the
compensation paid for such article, and had effected securities transactions as a broker and dealer in the over-the-counter market without
being registered as such. The Commission denied the application for
registration.
The registration of Gabriel Sanders, doing business as Gabriel Securities,12 was revoked on charges that the registrant had appropriated

money and securities to his own use from customers who desired to
purchase other securities. The record of proceedings disclosed that the
registrant obtained from 35 customers a total of approximately $27,000
for the purchase by it of securities and that the registrant failed to
deliver such securities and appropriated the money for his own use.
In one instance a customer turned over to the registrant almost $6,000
in money and securities to pay for other securities which were to be
purchased by the registrant. The registrant not only failed to deliver
such securities but appropriated the money and the proceeds from the
sale of the customer's securities.
The Commission also rev'oked the registration of four broker-dealers
after proceedings were instituted on findings that the registrants had
been permanently enjoined from engaging in or continuing certain
conduct and practices in connection with the purchase and sale of
securities.
The registration of East Coast Securities Corp," was revoked after
consideration was given to a record which disclosed that the registrant
had been permanently enjoined by the State of New York ia an
action based on allegations that the registrant falsely represented in
connection with the offering of an oil company's securities that the
oil company had struck a producing gas well, was drilling a second
well, and that most of the stock had been sold with very little remaining
for the public. There were also allegations that the registrant
falsely represented that members of the stock exchange were interested in acq uiring all available shares of that oil company, that
the stock would be listed on one of the exchanges and would double in
price.
The revocation of Kaye Real &: Oompany, Inc.14 was based upon two
injunctions against the firm, one obtained by State authorities in a
New York State court and the other obtained by the Commission
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York. The State court action charged insolvency, failure to
comply with the Commission's net capital rule, and shortage in
securities and money due or belonging to customers. The Commission's injunctive action was based upon violations of the registration
and fraud provisions of the Securities Act.15 After the entry of the
revocation order, the registrant appealed to the Circuit Court of
Appeals, which appeal was later dismissed by the court."
The injunction against Atlas Securities Corp:" which the Commission considered in its revocation proceedings against that registrant was issued by a State court of New York on a complaint filed

by the State alleging that the registrant engaged in business while
insolvent.
Revocation proceedings against Kelleher Securities Corp. IS involved,
among other things, an injunction issued upon the Commission's
complaint. The complaint alleged among other things that the
registrant had made false and misleading statements in the sale of
certain securities concerning the identity and ownership of such
securities, the use of the proceeds derived from the sale of such securities, the financial position of the issuer of the securities, and the
advantages to be gained by canceling purchases of one security which
the registrant was unable to deliver and investing the proceeds in
another security. Further violations were alleged in the complaint
regarding the sale by the registrant of certain securities at a price
bearing no reasonable relation to prevailing market prices without
disclosure of each market prices.
The registration of R. H. Johnson &: ['0./9 a partnership, was revoked upon a finding by the Commission, following a lengthy healing,
that there had been violations of the fraud provisions of the Securities
Act and the Securities Exchange Act. The order also revoked the
registration of R. H. Johnson, Inc., since R. H. Johnson was in control of both registrants.
The Commission found that Johnson and
five employees were each the cause of the order of revocation." The
firm, formed in 1935, had its principal office in New York with 2
branch offices in Boston and Philadelphia, and about 12 sales offices.
At times it had over 100 salesmen servicing several thousand accounts.
The customers in whose accounts the transactions forming the basis
for the proceedings took place were uninformed or inexperienced in
securities matters, and generally relied upon the salesman's advice
with respect to their transactions.
The Commission found that the
salesmen used this relationship of trust and confidence to cause an
excessive number of transactions in the accounts, which frequently
involved multiple trading in the same security and switches from
one security to another, evidently motivated by a desire to produce
income for themselves, as well as the registrant, without regard to
the customers' best interests and in violation of a fiduciary duty owed
to the customers. The Commission also found that despite notice
of the fraudulent activities disclosed by the record of the hearing, the
registrant failed adequately to supervise the salesmen, thereby permitting the practices to continue over a long period of time. The Commission's decision was later affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, and a petition for writ of certiorari to the
Supreme Court was denied."

Financial Statements

Every registered broker-dealer is required by rule X-17A-5 to
file with the Commission during each calendar year a report of financial
condition. During the fiscal year 3,968 such reports were filed.
These reports are analyzed by the staff to make certain that the
registrant is in compliance with the net capital requirements preIf a registrant is found not to be in
scribed by rule X-15C3-1.
compliance with the rule, and it is consistent with the public interest
to permit him to effect compliance, a limited time is given him for
that purpose. Failure to come into full compliance promptly results
in appropriate action by the Commission. Revocation proceedings
are also brought against any registrant who fails to make the necessary filing.
Net Capital Rule

As indicated in the 21st Annual Report, page 43, the Commission
during the last fiscal year revised its net capital rule (rule X-15C3-1)
to increase the safeguards thereby afforded to customers. No broker
or dealer subject to this rule may permit his" aggregate indebtedness"
to exceed 20 times his "net capital" as those terms are defined in the
rule. These definitions were revised, effective May 20, 1955, to increase from 10 to 30 percent the deduction from market value of
common stock forming a part of the capital of a broker or dealer,
which is required to be made in computing his net capital. The
revisions made at that time also included modified deductions from
market values of bonds and preferred stocks in computing net capital
and revisions with respect to the treatment of certain items in computing aggregate indebtedness. During the current fiscal year the
rule was further revised to limit the exemption available thereunder.
This revision eliminated the exemption afforded to all brokers and
dealers who did not extend credit to customers or carry money or
securities for the account of customers, and substituted an exemption
available only to brokers whose activities are limited to soliciting
subscriptions on behalf of issuers and who do not hold funds or securities in connection therewith. The Commission also reviewed the
exemption afforded to members of certain stock exchanges whose rules
impose capital requirements more comprehensive than those of the
Commission's rule in order to make certain that all such exchanges
had adequate inspection procedures for the enforcement of their rules.
As a result of this review the Boston Stock Exchange, the Los Angeles
Stock Exchange, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, and the Salt Lake
Stock Exchange strengthened their enforcement procedures with respect to capital requirements for their members.
The Commission takes prompt action whenever it appears that any
broker or dealer is not in compliance with this rule. Unless deficiencies are promptly corrected, injunctive action may be taken or

revocation proceedings commenced. During this fiscal year violations of this rule were alleged in 6 injunctive actions, 3 proceedings

registration.
The injunctive actions arising under this rule are referred to in this report under the heading, "Litigation Under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934."
Broker-Dealer

Inspections

During 1956 the Commission placed increased emphasis upon its
inspection program for registered brokers and dealers. Regular and
periodic inspection of broker-dealers are a vital part of the Commission's activities for the protection of investors. The purpose of these
inspections is to obtain compliance with the securities acts and the
rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission and to detect
and prevent violations.
An inspection ordinarily includes, among other items, (1) a determination of the financial condition of the broker-dealer; (2) review of
pricing practices; (3) review of the treatment of customers' funds and
securities; and (4) a determination whether adequate disclosures are
made to customers. The inspection process also determines whether
the required books and records are adequate and currently maintained,
and whether broker-dealers are conforming with the margin and other
requirements of regulation T, as prescribed by the Federal Reserve
Board. They also check for "churning," "switching," sale of unregistered securities, use of improper sales literature or sales methods, and
other fraudulent practices. These inspections frequently discover
situations which, if not corrected, would result in losses to customers.
The following table shows the various types of violations disclosed
as a result of the inspection program:

The number of indicated violations found by inspections increased
31 percent in 1956 over 1955. This reflects existing conditions in the
financial markets described in this report under "Enforcement Program." In particular, these conditions have brought a substantial
number of new broker-dealers into the business. Many of these are

TWENTY-SECOND

inexperienced and unfamiliar both with the obligations owed to their
customers and with the rules of the Commission and established
practices for the conduct of the business. A more serious problem is
created by those who enter the business under present conditions
in the hope of making a quick profit, rather than the establishment of a
sound business based on responsible and ethical dealing. A substantial number of new brokers and dealers either lacked adequate
financial resources or speculated unwisely, thus impairing their financial positions and threatening the safety of customers' funds or
securities entrusted to them.
During the fiscal year the Commission filed 10 complaints in the
Federal district courts based upon violations discovered in the course
of broker-dealer inspections and commenced 7 proceedings to revoke
the registration of brokers and dealers based upon violations so discovered. In the majority of instances the violations found are not
of a character requiring formal enforcement action but are inadvertent
or the result of a misunderstanding.
In every such instance the
broker-dealer is informed of the violations and required to report the
steps he has taken to prevent a repetition. Mter an appropriate
lapse of time it is the policy of the Commission again to inspect such
brokers to determine whether they have in fact taken adequate
measures to prevent repetition of the violations.
Several times during the course of the year the Commission dispatched so-called "task forces" of broker-dealer inspectors to particular areas where the public interest required a more intensive program
than could be conducted with the manpower available in the particular
area. During the fiscal year a task force of 6 inspectors and 2 attor-,
neys conducted such inspections in the Denver Region, a task force of
2 inspectors visited the Hawaiian Islands, a task force of 2 inspectors
conducted inspections in the Fort Worth Region, and at the end of the
fiscal year 2-man task forces were at work in the Atlanta Region and
in the State of Pennsylvania. The use of such task forces was necessary in order to cope with special problems existing in particular
areas, but it is not a permanent solution of the problem since it tends
to disrupt the inspection program in the areas from which personnel
are dispatched.
During 1956, 952 inspections were made, which is the largest
number since 1941. During the year, however, the number of registered broker-dealers increased from 4,334 to 4,591 and the number
is continuing to increase, amounting to 4,652 at October 1, 1956. In
response to these conditions the Commission proposes a substantial
increase in the number of broker-dealer inspections to be made in
1957 and in future fiscal years.
In addition to the Commission's inspection program, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the principal stock ex-

114

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

changes also conduct inspections of their members and some of the
States also have inspection programs. Each inspecting agency conducts inspections in accordance with its own procedures and with
particular reference to its own regulations and jurisdiction. Consequently, inspections by other agencies are not an adequate substitute
for Commission inspections, since the inspector will not be primarily
concerned with the detection and prevention of violations of the Federal securities laws and the Commission's regulations thereunder.
The Commission and certain other inspecting agencies have, however,
embarked upon a program of coordinating inspection activity for the
purpose of avoiding unnecessary duplication of inspections and to
obtain the widest possible coverage of brokers and dealers. This
seems appropriate in view of the limited number of inspections which
it is possible for the Commission to make. The program does not
prevent the Commission from inspecting any person recently inspected by another agency, and this is done whenever reason therefor
exists, but it has been necessary for the Commission to rely to a considerable degree upon the inspection programs of the major exchanges,
such as the New York Stock Exchange.
Agencies now participating in the coordinated program include the
New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange,
the San Francisco Stock Exchange, and the National Association of
Securities Dealers. During the fiscal year, and following discussions
with the Commission's staff, the Boston and Los Angeles Stock Exchanges established regular field inspection programs and became
participants in the program. During calendar 1955, an aggregate of
2,718 inspections covering 2,228 different firms were reported to
have been made by the participating agencies.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF SECURmES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Maloney
Act") provides for the registration with the Commission of national
securities associations. The statute prescribes standards for such
associations. Their rules must be designed to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and other requirements must be met. The Commission has
jurisdiction to review disciplinary action by such associations and to
consider all changes in their rules. The National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) is the only such association registered
under the Act. That Association serves as a medium for self-regulation
by over-the-counter brokers and dealers. Membership in this Association is important to brokers and dealers engaged in over-the-counter

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL

REPORT

115

activities since, as contemplated by section 15A (i) of the Act, the
rules of the Association prevent members from dealing with nonmembers except upon the same terms and at the same prices as are
accorded the general public. Accordingly, members may not accord
the customary dealer's commissions, discounts, preferential rates,
concessions, or allowances to nonmembers.
Membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
at June 30, 1956, was 3,634. This represented an increase of 284 during
the year as a result of' 440 admissions to and 156 terminations of
membership. At the same time there were registered with the N ational Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., as registered representatives, 48,566 individuals, including, generally, all partners, officers,
salesmen, traders, and other persons employed by, or associated with,
members in capacities which involve their doing business directly with
the public. The number of registered representatives increased by
7,500 during the fiscal year as a result of 12,317 initial registrations,
3,353 re-registrations and 8,170 terminations of registrations.
Disciplinary Actions

During the fiscal year the Commission received from the NASD
reports of final action in 102 disciplinary proceedings in which formal
complaints had been filed against members alleging violations of
specified provisions of the Association's Rules of Fair Practice. Each
of these decisions is considered by the staff, and referred to the appropriate regional offices with comments as to whether further independent attention on the part of the Commission appears warranted. In
most cases the staff also reviews the complete NASD file in such
matters to determine whether the evidence there available indicates
violations of the Federal securities laws which require enforcement
action by the Commission. In 48 cases complaints were directed solely
against member firms, while in 54 other cases the complaints included
members and also 78 registered representatives of such members.
One complaint was withdrawn prior to determination on the merits
and, after consideration, 16 other complaints were dismissed on findings that alleged violations had not, in fact, occurred. In the remaining 85 cases the committees having jurisdiction found violations and
in each of these cases some penalty was imposed on the firm and/or
the registered representatives involved.
In 8 proceedings members were expelled, and in 6 proceedings
members were suspended for periods ranging from 15 days to 1 year.
In addition, the registration of 17 registered representatives was
revoked and 7 other representatives were suspended for periods
ranging from 30 days to 1 year. In 16 cases the only penalty imposed
was censure of the firm or the representative found to have acted
improperly, and 1 case was disposed of by acceptance of a statement
pledging future compliance with the Rules of Fair Practice.

116

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In 48 of the remaining cases members were fined sums ranging from
$100 to $4,350, and aggregating $32,500, while in other instances
representatives were fined sums ranging from $50 to $1,000, and
aggregating $2,300. In addition to these direct monetary penalties,
costs were assessed on firms or representatives in 55 instances. These
costs ranged from $18.24 to $6,830.11, and aggregated $37,247.57.
Many decisions involved multiple penalties so that, for example, a
fine or a suspension, or both, was accompanied by the imposition of
costs.
Commission

Review of NASD Disciplinary Actions

Section 15A (g) of the Act provides that disciplinary actions by the
NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion
-
 or on the application of any aggrieved party. The effectiveness of any
penalty imposed by the Association is stayed pending determination
of any matter brought before the Commission for review. One such
petition referred to in an earlier report was pending at the close of the
last fiscal year, and three other petitions were filed during the year.
Two of these cases were disposed of during the year and two were
pending at the year end."
The Commission affirmed a decision by the NASD which resulted
in the expulsion from the Association of Mitchell Securities, Inc.,23
a Baltimore broker-dealer. The NASD's District Business Conduct
Committee found that Mitchell violated the NASD Rules of Fair
Practice by selling securities to customers at prices which were not
fair in view of all relevant circumstances, this being conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, and suspended
Mitchell from NASD membership for 6 months, imposed a $2,000
fine, and assessed costs of $744.40. Upon appeal by Mitchell to
the NASD Board of Governors, the latter also found a violation of
the Rules of Fair Practice but concluded that the penalty imposed
by the committee was too lenient and expelled Mitchell from membership. Mitchell thereupon appealed to the Commission, which affirmed
the NASD action and dismissed the appeal.
The NASD's action was based on 55 sales of Trans Western Oil
& Gas Co. common stock effected by Mitchell acting as principal,
involving a total of 26,000 shares effected at prices ranging from
75 cents to $1.50 per share, for an aggregate price of $24,950. The
Commission found that in 12 of the transactions the per share price
Mitchell charged its customers exceeded the price paid by Mitchell
for the shares bought by it on the same day from other customers or
dealers by amounts ranging from 31.6 to 75 percent; and in the
remaining 43 transactions the per share price charged the customer

exceeded the high asked price quoted by other dealers on the dates
of the transactions by amounts ranging from 10 to 59 percent. The
average markup in the 55 transactions was 34.9 percent.
The Commission rejected arguments advanced by Mitchell in
support of the validity of its markups, stating that they were clearly
excessive by any reasonable criteria and found, contrary to Mitchell's
contentions, that it had not performed any special services in the
interest of the customers or assumed risks in maintaining an inventory
which would warrant such large markups.
The Commission also affirmed an NASD decision against PhiUips
&: 00., a New York broker-dealer firm and its principal partner,
Gerald G. Bernheimer." The NASD action appealed from involved
the suspension of the Phillips firm from NASD membership for 2
years and an assessment against the firm of the full costs of the
proceedings.
According to the Commission's decision, the proceedings were
initiated by the NASD Business Conduct Committee on complaints
of three customers to the effect that Bernheimer, knowing their
limited financial circumstances, urged them to purchase stock of
Quebec Oil Development, Ltd., "on the basis of representations as
to future price increases of the stock and a promise, which he subsequently repudiated, that he would guarantee them against loss."
Although the committee found that the existence of a formal guarantee
against loss had not been established, it concluded that Bernheimer
had accompanied his solicitations of the complainants with "extravagent representations and glowing promises" which induced
them to believe that a profit would certainly accrue to them if they
made the purchases, and that he knew that prior sales to their customers had depleted their cash reserves so that the purchase of
additional securities he suggested was not suitable on the basis of
their financial situation.
The committee censured the firm, suspended it from membership for 1 year, and assessed it with $506.10
costs. On appeal, the NASD Board of Governors suspended the
firm from membership for 2 years and assessed it with full costs of
the proceedings.
Commission Review of Action on Membership

Section 15A (b) of the Exchange Act and the bylaws of the National Association of the Securities Dealers, Inc., provide that except
where the Commission approves or directs to the contrary, no broker
or dealer may be admitted to, or continued in, membership if he or
any controlling or controlled person is expelled or is currently under
suspension from such an Association for violation of a rule prohibiting
conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade or
"Securities Exchange Act Release No. 5294(April 10, 1056)'

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

is subject to an order of the Commission denying or revoking his
broker-dealer registration or was a "cause" of any such order of
expulsion, current suspension or denial or revocation. .At the beginning of the fiscal year two such cases were pending before the
Commission and during the year three additional cases were brought
before the Commission. One of the cases was disposed of during the
year and four were pending at the year end.
In the exercising of its authority the Commission approved 25 an
application for the continuation in membership of a firm while employing Lowell Niebuhr, who was under a disqualification, having
been expelled by the N.ASD on findings that Lowell Niebuhr & Co.,
which Niebuhr controlled, had operated with insufficient capital
and otherwise violated various NASD rules.
The Commission
had earlier in 1947 approved another member's continuance in
membership while controlling Niebuhr. Niebuhr's association with
that member had terminated and he sought new employment requiring further Commission consideration and approval.
Commission Action on NASD Rules

Section I5A (j) of the Act provides that any change in, or addition
to, the rules of a registered securities association shall be disapproved
by the Commission unless such change or addition appears to the
Commission to be consistent with the requirements for such rules as
contained in subsection 15 A (b) of the Act.
Section 2 of article I of the bylaws of the NASD has operated to
disqualify from membership, or association with a member in a controlling or controlled capacity, persons under any of the disqualifications set out in I5A (b) (4) of the Act. After adoption by the Board
of Governors, and approval by the membership, three new subsections
were added, effective November 15, 1955, creating barriers to membership or registration with the Association as registered representative against persons who are subject to an order canceling or revoking
registration as registered representative with the Association, or with
any stock exchange for conduct contrary to high standards of commercial honor or just and equitable principles of trade or who have
been convicted within the preceding 10 years of a felony or misdemeanor involving securities transactions or arising out of the conduct
of the business of a broker or dealer or convicted within the preceding
10 years of any felony or misdemeanor which the Association finds
involved embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, misappropriation of
funds, or abuse or misuse of a fiduciary relationship. Jurisdiction for
these restrictions is based on section I5A (b) (3) of the Act. As provided in section 15A (b), the Commission may be called on to determine whether it should approve or direct the admission to or con.. Secuntles

tinuance in Association membership of a firm controlling or controlled by a person under one or more of these disqualifications.
The Association also adopted, effective June 1, 1956, after requisite
action by the Board of Governors and the membership, a new section
2 (b) of article I of the bylaws which would require any person seeking
membership or registration as registered representative in any 1 of 4
categories, including a sole proprietor, a general partner, an officer or
any controlling or controlled person requiring registration as a representative to meet standards of technical proficiency in, and knowledge
of the securities business. Qualification is achieved either by a
minimum of 1year's experience in the business in one of the capacities
specified above or by passing a written examination as prescribed by
the Board of Governors.
As part of this board program of creating competency standards
for those who engage in the securities business, a qualifying examination was established. The nature and scope of the qualifying examination is established by schedule C, filed by the Association as an
amendment to its registration statement.
The amendment also prescribes the manner in which the examination shall be marked, the
passing grade and the times, intervals and~places at:which it shall be
given, and provides that a particular examination shall consist of
100 questions taken from the master list of 344 questions included
in the filing.
In its consideration of the rules establishing competency standards
the Commission found the proposed restrictions "necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and to
carry out the purposes of the section" (15 A (b) of the Act) and permitted the rules to become effective.
The Association also adopted various other amendments to its rules
during the year here under review which were in the main technical,
or concerned only members and not the investing public, or were
designed to modernize and conform the then existing rules to methods,
practices and circumstances now existing in the securities industry.
LITIGATION

UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

As a protective measure for the public the Commission is authorized
actions in the courts to enjoin broker-dealers and other
persons from engaging in conduct violative of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Some of the actions brought as a result of such violations also include violations of other acts administered by the
Commission.
In S. E. C. v. Trevor Currie 26 defendant, a registered broker-dealer,
was permanently enjoined from further violations of the antifraud

to institute

COMMISSION

provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions
and bookkeeping requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The complaint charged, among other things, that the defendant, in
connection with his acceptance of brokerage orders from customers
for the purchase of securities, falsely represented that he had purchased such securities for their accounts and omitted to disclose to
the customers the source and amount of certain remuneration which
he had received or expected to receive in connection with those transactions.
The defendant consented to the entry of a judgment
against him.
In S. E. C. v. Harold L. Nielsen, doing business as Nielsen Investment Oo., 27 a preliminary injunction was issued against the defendant
to enjoin further violations of the registration and antifraud provisions
of the Securities Act, the antifraud and bookkeeping provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act and the net capital rule under the latter Act.
The Commission charged the defendant with selling securities while
insolvent without disclosing his financial condition to customers, and
failing to deliver securities paid for by his customers or returning the
purchase price to them.
The Commission obtained injunctions against the defendants in
S. E. O. v. Glenn Galen Kolb, individually and doing business as Glenn
Kolb &: 00.; 28 S. E. C. v. Doxey-Merkley &: 00., William H. Doxey
and Lon Babcock Merkley; 29 and S. E. O. v. Robert Dean Langlois,
doing business as R. D. Langlois and Company 30 restraining further
violations of the Commission's rules pertaining to required net
capital.
In each case the defendants consented to the issuance of a
permanent injunction.
In S. E. O. v. National Securities, Inc., and Robert S. Herman 31 the
complaint alleged that the defendants had been soliciting and accepting orders for the purchase and sale of securities and had been soliciting and accepting the deposit of money and securities upon the
representation that the defendant corporation was ready and able to
execute such orders and meet its liabilities when in fact the defendant
corporation had been unable to meet its current liabilities.
By consent the defendants were enjoined from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and of the Commission's net capital rules.
A permanent injunction against further violation of the antifraud
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and the Commission's
bookkeeping rules was also issued against Daniel M. Sheehan, Jr.,
doing business as Sheehan &: 00.32 by consent.

complaint charged that the defendant has been soliciting and accepting
the deposit of monies and securities from customers and representing
that he was ready and able to execute orders and make prompt settlement therefor without disclosing that he was unable to meet his
current liabilities.' The Commission also charged that the defendant
had not kept current the required books and records relating to his
business as a broker-dealer.
In addition to these actions against broker-dealers, the Commission
obtained an injunction against William H. Van Loo 33 for violations
of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. Defendant obtained a list of registered shareholders of a particular company
by representing that he was in the business of tracing the whereabouts
of security holders whom the issuing companies were unable to contact and sought to acquire the securities from persons named on the
stockholders' list, or their heirs or beneficiaries, representing that their
shares were worth considerably less than the prevailing market price.
Defendant represented that the securities had a small liquidation
value when the company had never been in the process of liquidation,
and that the deadline for an exchange of the securities for other
securities had passed when no exchange had ever been authorized or
put into effect. He also misrepresented the amount of stock registered in the names of certain deceased persons whose certificates were
lost or destroyed, and caused the names of deceased persons who had
been the registered owners of the securities to be signed on stock
powers purporting to assign their rights and interests therein to
himself. The defendant consented to the issuance of a permanent
injunction.
Proxy Litigation

One of the most important cases successfully litigated by the Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act during the past fiscal
year involved enforcement of the Commission's proxy rules. The
Commission does not attempt to guide, control or interfere in the
strategy employed by participants in a proxy contest and scrupulously
maintains a neutral position in these contests. However, the Commission does scrutinize objectively and impartially the proxy material
filed with it for the purpose of enforcing the standards of fair and
adequate disclosure to investors which are the primary objectives of
the Federal securities laws. The objective of the proxy regulations is
to obtain for investors and stockholders a fair and complete statement
of material facts and to prevent the dissemination to them of false
and misleading statements.
Where necessary the Commission is authorized by the Act to seek injunctive relief in the Federal courts to
enforce these objectives. A complaint seeking such injunctive relief
Q

w. D.

Mich. No. 2835(December 8, 1955),

122

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

was filed by the Commission on August 3, 1955, in the United States
District Court (S. D. N. Y.) against Mitchell May, Jr., Alfred Parry,
Jr., and Wilbur E. Dow, Jr., individually and as members of the
Independent Stockholders Committee of Libby, McNeill & Libby,
charging that the defendants had been soliciting proxies from the.
stockholders for the election of directors at the meeting scheduled to
be held on August 17, 1955, in violation of the Commission's proxy
ru1es. The complaint charged, among other things, that the defendants failed to disclose all the names of persons on whose behalf the
solicitation was being made and in their representations concerning
the formation and membership of the committee the defendants
failed to state the circumstances leading up to the formation of the
committee and the identity and purpose of the individuals who sponsored and underwrote the activities of the committee. The complaint
also alleged that the material sent to stockholders by the committee
was materially false and misleading in that it contained misleading
questions which improperly implied: (1) that the company did not make
full disclosure of its operations to its stockholders, (2) had withheld a proper accounting for a portion of the 1954 period and (3)
that the management was guilty of improper manipu1ation or mismanagement of corporate funds.
On August, 15, 1955, Circuit Judge Lumbard, sitting by designation
as a district judge, filed his opinion sustaining our allegations 34 and
on the following day Judge Lumbard entered a preliminary injunction
enjoining the defendants from making further solicitations in violation
of the proxy rules and from using the proxies they had obtained, and
ordered postponement of the stockholders' meeting until September 7,
1955, to permit defendants to solicit new proxies in compliance with
the proxy regulation if they so desired. The defendants, who did not
resolicit, appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit and, in connection therewith and prior to the stockholders'
meeting, made unsuccessful applications first to Chief Circuit Judge
Clark and then to Supreme Court Justice Harlan for a stay of Judge
Lumbard's injunctive order. The meeting was held on September 7,
1955, at which time the management's slate was elected.
On January 11, 1956, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
affirmed Judge Lumbard's injunctive order." Fully approving and
adopting the "well-supported findings and conclusions of Judge Lumbard," the Court of Appeals held that the proxy rules were violated by
the use of rhetorical questions in defendant's soliciting material which
â€¢â€¢ S. E. C. v. Mall, tl al., 134 F. Supp. 247(SoD. N. Y.l9S5). The complaint also alleged that the defend.
ants (1) had presented a mlsleadlng statistical presentation of comparative earnings of the Libby Company
and other food distributing companies and (2) had failed to disclose a plan to liquidate the company. Judge
Lumbard held (i) that the statistics were a matter of argument and (2)that the evidence on the preliminary
bearing was insufficient to sustain the hquidatlon allegation,

were based on false assumptions and carried the previously stated
false and misleading implications. Although these proceedings were
brought under the Commission's proxy rules in effect prior to the
January 1956 revision," the court held also that the provision of the
proxy rule calling for disclosure of every person on whose behalf the
solicitation was being made required disclosure of those persons who
were leading factors in the committee's formation and activities notwithstanding the fact that they were not technically designated committee members. The revised proxy rules now plainly spell out this
requirement."
The court of appeals rejected as meritless defendants'
attacks upon the constitutionality of section 14 (a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Commission's proxy regulation thereunder, including the contention that the rules provided for censorship
in contravention of defendant's constitutional guarantee of free speech,
stating:
Appellants argue that ~ 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15
U. S. C. ~ 78n (a), and regulations adopted thereunder are unconstitutional as
unauthorized delegations of legislative power and otherwise; but these contentions
have no merit. American Power & Light Co. v. S. E. C., 329 U. S. 90; Yakus v,
United States, 321 U. S. 414. Furthermore, the Commission's proxy rules as
applied either to management or to insurgent stockholder groups are clearly
authorized by the statute.

The Appellate Court also flatly rejected the argument advanced by
the defendants that because of the apparent similarity of proxy contests to political campaigns, the various groups soliciting proxies
should be permitted with comparative unrestraint to engage in the
same type of "campaign oratory" as that of participants in a political
contest. The court in refusing to accept this contention emphasized
that "Congress has clearly entrusted to the Commission the duty of
protecting the investing public against misleading statements made
in the course of a struggle for corporate controL" Thereafter defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment which made permanent
the provisions of the preliminary injunction previously entered.
Inside Reporting Litigation

Section 16 (a) requires that every stockholder owning more than
10 percent of the stock of a corporation registered on an exchange and
every officer and director thereof shall report his ownership and the
monthly changes in that ownership to the Commission and the
exchange. In the vast majority of cases, the required reports are
filed promptly. On the rare occasions when the statutory requirement is flagrantly disregarded notwithstanding repeated reminders
the Commission is compelled to seek court enforcement. During the
past fiscal year, two such actions were brought. One was against

Both actions are pending.
In 8. E. O. v. East Boston 00.,40 the Commission, on July 13, 1955,
secured a summary judgment requiring defendant corporation to file
annual reports for each of its fiscal years since 1948 with the Boston
Stock Exchange and the Commission, as required by section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act, no later than November 1, 1955. The
company thereafter asked the court to extend its time to file the required reports. The Commission countered with a petition asking
that both defendant and its officers and directors be held in civil
contempt of court. The court agreed with the Commission that the
company was in contempt, but declined so to find as to the officers
and directors. Annual reports for the delinquent years were thereafter filed with the Commission and the Exchange but upon examination the Commission found them to be inadequate, 'misleading and
not in accord with its rules and regulations. The Commission again
petitioned in contempt. On April 5, 1956, upon stipulation, the court
ordered defendant to pay a fine of $3,000 to the Government as compensatory damages and to file corrected reports within 90 days. The
fine has since been paid and amended reports were filed by June 18,
1956.
Participation as Amicus Curiae

In Speed v. Tromsemeriea Corp.,41 which was pending for decision
at the close of the fiscal year, the Commission as amicus curiae filed a
memorandum of law on the question of the materiality under rule
X-10B-5 of the failure to disclose the asset value of stock purchased
by a controlling majority stockholder from minority public stockholders and the majority stockholder's intent to liquidate the company. The Commission expressed the view that it could not properly
be held, as a matter of law, that a great appreciation in the realizable
asset value of such stock was not in itself a material fact which must
be disclosed under the rule, wholly apart from proof of the controlling
stockholder's intention at the time of the stock purchases with respect
to the realization of that value. Nondisclosure of a great disparity
between the price offered and the realizable asset value of the stock,
our memorandum stated, is a fact entitled to independent consideration in the determination of materiality.
The Commission also expressed the view that the intent on the part of the controlling stockholder to liquidate the corporation, whether or not such intent had
been translated into corporate action at the time of the purchases in

In Nash v. J . Arthur Warner &; Oo., Inc.,42 judgment was entered
for the defendants in a civil action [or damages for overtrading or
"churning" of certain customers' accounts in alleged violation of
section 17 (a) of the Securities Act and sections 10 (b) and 15 (c) of
the Securities Exchange Act and the Commission's rules under the
latter sections. The judgment appears to have rested in large part
on the court's conclusion of fact that the customers, rather than the
securities :firm involved, were responsible for the degree of activity in
the accounts. At the request of the Court the Commission prepared
and filed a brief as amicus curiae on several questions pertaining to the

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOWING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 provides for three
separate areas of regulation of holding company systems which control
electric utility companies and companies engaged in the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas. The first embraces those
provisions of the Act, principally those in sectaon 11 (b) (1), which
require the physical integration of public utility and functionally
related properties of holding company systems, and those provisions,
principally section 11 (b) (2), which require the simplification of
intercorporate relationships and financial structures of holding company systems. The second area of regulation covers financing operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, acquisitions and dispositions of securities and properties, their accounting
practices and servicing arrangements and intercompany transactions.
The third area includes the provisions of the Act providing for exemptions, and those regulating the right of a person who is affiliated with a
public utility company to acquire securities resulting in a second such
affiliation.
COMPOSITION

OF UEGISTERED HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMSSUMMARY CHANGES

During 1956 two registered holding companies, Interstate Power
CO.1and Wisconsin Southern Gas Co., Inc.," disposed of their remaining subsidiaries by means of dissolution and merger and as a result
their registrations as holding companies were terminated by orders
of the Commission pursuant to section 5 (d) of the Act. As a consequence, there remained on June 30, 1956, 23 public utility holding
company systems, controlling one or more electric or gas utility
subsidiaries, which are subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act
as registered systems. The aggregate assets of these systems as at
December 31, 1955, less valuation reserves, amounted to $10,411
million. Included in these 23 systems were 27 registered holding v,"
companies of which 21 function solely as holding companies and 6 ~<,
also function as operating companies plus 164 electric and gas utility'
subsidiaries, and 111 nonutility subsidiaries, a total of 302 companies.
In two systems there are 2 registered holding companies each, and in
another there are 3 registered holding companies. For convenience
of discussion these 23 systems will be referred to as "active systems."
The following tabulation shows the number of holding companies,
electric and gas utility companies and non utility companies comprising the 23 active registered systems as at June 30, 1956, and their
aggregate assets as of December 31, 1955.

COMMISSION

On June 30, 1955, there were 25 active registered systems, the
aggregate assets of which, less valuation reserves, were $9,972 million
as at December 31, 1954. Included in these systems, were 30 registered holding companies of which 23 functioned solely as holding
companies and 7 also functioned as operating companies plus 168
electric and gas utility subsidiaries and 136 nonutility subsidiaries, a
total of 334 companies. In each of 3 systems there were 2 registered
holding companies, and in a third system there were 3 registered
holding companies.
During 1956 active registered systems divested themselves of 2 gas
utility subsidiaries with aggregate assets of $2.9 million and 7 nonutility subsidiaries with assets of $11.3 million. Three additional
utility subsidiaries and 20 nonutility subsidiaries were merged into
other system companies. These and other changes bringing about
the net decrease of 32 in the number of companies comprising active
registered systems during the fiscal year are summarized in the table
below. Details of changes occurring in each system are set forth in

I This reflects a reduction from the previous year in the number of nonutility subsldlanss reported by
Cities Service Co., a registered holding company, in Its Annual Report on Form U5S. Since the normal
operations of the industrial subsidiaries of Cities service are exempt from the provisions of the Holding
Company Act pursuant to rule U-3D-15 thereunder, notification as to the manner of elimination or disposition of these 20 companies has not been received. Published reports concerning the system reveal
no record of sales of any of these 20 companies to other persons. Accordmgly. it has been assumed that
they were elinIinated through merger or consolidation.

The maximum number of companies subject to the Act as components of registered holding company systems at anyone point of
time was 1,620 in June 15, 1938. Since that date additional systems
registered, with the result that 2,314 companies have been subject to
the Act as registered holding companies and subsidiaries thereof

Included in this total were 216 holding companies (solely holding
companies and operating-holding companies), 998 electric and gas
utility companies and 1,100 non-utility enterprises. From June 15,
1938 to June 30, 1956, 2,012 of these companies have been released
from the active regulatory jurisdiction of the Act or have ceased to
exist as separate corporate entities. Of this number 916 companies
with assets aggregating approximately $14.9 billion as at their respective dates of divestment, have been divested by their respective parents
and are no longer subject to the Act as components of registered systerns." The balance of 1,096 companies includes 765 which were released from the regulatory jurisdiction of the Act as a result of dissolutions, mergers and consolidations,' and 331 companies which
ceased to be subject to the Act as components of registered systems
as a result of exemptions granted under sections 2 and 3 of the Act
and deregistrations pursuant to section 5 (d) of the Act."
DEVELOPMENTS

IN ACTIVE REGISTERED

SYSTEMS

Among the significant corporate developments of registered systems
have been the organization of new companies, divestments of subsidiaries, dispositions of nonretainable properties by operating subsidiaries, acquisitions by systems of additional subsidiaries, and, as
previously indicated, the deregistration of certain holding company
systems. Following is a discussion of each registered system in which
there occurred during 1956 important corporate changes other than
:financing transactions which are treated in a separate section of this
report at page 148 below.
American Gas and Electric Co.

This registered holding company and its 24 subsidiaries with
consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of $1,071 million at December 31, 1955, constitutes the largest registered holding company
system subject to the provisions of the Act. American Gas owns a

2,321 communities in Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan having an aggregate population of approximately
4,836,000.
In a proposal approved by the Commission on July 26, 1956,~
Appalachian Electric Power Co., a system company, acquired the assets
and assumed the liabilities of Flat Top Power Co., another subsidiary
of American Gas, with Flat Top being subsequently liquidated. In
connection with the transaction, Appalachian issued 10,000 shares of
it common stock to Flat Top, which upon its dissolution transferred
the shares to American Gas,"
Cities Service Co.

Cities Service Co., which is a holding company controlling a large
integrated petroleum production, refining and marketing organization,
is also a registered holding company, having one public utility subsidiary, Dominion Natural Gas Co., Ltd. As at December 31, 1955,
the system had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of $1,095
million of which Dominion Natural Gas accounted for $15 million.
With respect to a consolidated proceeding, described at page 57
of the 21st Annual Report, involving an exemption application
filed by Cities pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the Act and a section 11
proceeding pertaining to the elimination of a publicly held 48.5 percent
minority interest in its subsidiary, Arkansas Fuel Oil Corp. (Arkfuel),
the Commission on August 31, 1956 denied the exemption application, holding, among other things, that the existence of the public
minority interest constitutes a complexity and results in an inequitable distribution of voting power in violation of the Act, that it would
be detrimental to the interest of investors to grant Oities the requested
exemption, and that Cities and Arkfuel must within a reasonable
time submit a program of compliance with the Act to effect either
the elimination of the minority interest or the disposition by Cities

of its 51.5-percent interest." On October 29, 1956, Cities filed a
petition with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit seeking a review of the Commission's order pursuant to section
24 (a) of the Act.lO
A petition filed by Reynolds Metals Co., in the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review an
order of the Commission approving the sale by Cities of its holdings
of 51.5 percent of the common stock of Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Co.
(Arkla) to W. R. Stephens Investment Co. which is described in
the 21st Annual Report, was dismissed on the ground that the issues
had been mooted."
The Commission reexamined, pursuant to section 3 (c) of the Act,
an exemption previously granted to W. R. Stephens Investment Co.,
Inc., under section 3 (a) (4) of the Act. The exemption was predicated, among other things, on an understanding that W. R. Stephens
Investment Co. would distribute the Arkla common stock it had
acquired and that prior to the distribution it would cause Arkla to
transfer its natural gas and oil properties to a' company to be newly
organized, and to distribute to its stockholders the stock of the new
company which it would receive for its properties, and that the
Stephens Co. would sell to a nonaffiliated interstate pipeline company
the capital stock of the new company that it would receive as a
stockholder of Arkla. The facts developed at the current hearing
indicate that the Stephens Co. proceeded with its plans to dispose of
Arkla's properties until it learned that the proposed disposition would
be taxable to the stockholders of Arkla as an ordinary dividend.
At
this point it abandoned the proposal.
Accordingly, the Commission
determined in an order dated March 30, 1956, to modify the exemption order so that, inter alia, in the event Arkla or Stephens Co.
take any action which would require the filing of an application or
declaration, if the former were a subsidiary of and the latter a registered holding company, they are required to give the Commission
timely written notice of such proposal in order that the Commission
may determine whether an application or declaration shall be filed
with respect thereto.P
Within recent weeks Stephens Co. has renewed
its efforts to sell its holdings of Arkla stock.
The Columbia Gas System, Inc.

The Columbia Gas System, Inc., a holding company controlling 14
operating subsidiaries and a subsidiary service company, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, totaling $721 million as at

operations are conducted in the States of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, Kentucky, New York, Maryland, and Virginia. Service is
provided to 1,303,601 customers. In addition, subsidiaries conduct an
extensive wholesale business, selling natural gas to nonaffiliated public

The subsidiaries obtain their natural gas supplies partially from gas
produced or purchased in the Appalachian area and partially from gas
which is purchased from southwest pipeline companies or which is purchased from southwest producers and transported by southwest pipeline companies. The subsidiaries have extensive underground gas
storage facilities located in the Appalachian area.
Columbia has filed a motion, on which hearings have been held,

Co., both gas transmission companies, and Amere Gas Utilities Co.,
Virginia Gas Distribution Corp., The Keystone Gas Co., Inc., and
Binghamton Gas Works, all gas utility companies, are either retainable as parts of Columbia's gas utility system or as one or more

EUA to cause the disposition of the gas properties owned by Blackstone Valley Gas & Electric Co. ("Blackstone").15 On July 10, 1951,
a year's extension was granted."
On April 18, 1952, the Commission
approved EUA's plan filed under section 11 (e) of the Act which, in
brief, provided for the reclassification of its then outstanding common
and convertible shares into a single class of common shares and the
refinancing of a substantial portion of its bank debt." Although the
plan did not propose the disposition of the gas properties of Blackstone, it provided that EUA would cause such disposition to be accomplished in an appropriate manner. At the request of EUA the Commission, by letter dated July 17, 1952, advised the company that it
did not intend to insist upon the disposition of BJackstone's gas properties prior to January 1, 1955, if the earnings from such property were
necessary to enable the company to pay dividends of between $2 and
$2.20 per share on its common stock. Subsequently EUA was able to
increase its dividends from $2 to $2.20 per share without dependence
upon the gas property earnings.
Plans for compliance with the Commission's 1950 divestment order
have been the subject of conferences between the Commission's
staff and EUA representatives and such plans have been facilitated
by the adoption by the Rhode Island Legislature of a special act
permitting the incorporation of a new company to hold the gas
properties."
Electric Bond and Share Co.

Electric Bond and Share Co., which no longer holds as much as 5
percent of the outstanding voting securities of any domestic electric or
gas utility company, had total assets, less valuation reserves, of $127
million at December 31, 1955. This amount includes its investment
in its 56 percent owned subsidiary, American & Foreign Power Co.,
Inc., which had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of $644
million on that date.
Electric Bond and Share Co. has made application for exemption
pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the Act, which is described at page 60
of the 21st Annual Report.
The presentation by Bond and Share of
its direct case has been completed.
This consisted of the production
of witnesses as representatives of Bond and Share, Ebasco Services,

pleted. The principal issues being considered in this proceeding relate
to the possible retention of control over, or the absence of arm's-length
bargaining with respect to the negotiations with and the performance
of services for, public-utility holding companies and public-utility
companies, which formerly were subsidiaries of Electric Bond and
Share Company, by Ebasco Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary
service company.
These issues, which relate to the possible existence of affiliation
between the companies and to the possible exercise of a controlling
influence by Bond and Share through Ebasco over certain holding
companies and public utility companies in the absence of stock
ownership and interlocking directorships, are complex. Preparation of
the case has required. concentrated analysis of a vast amount of details
concerning the operations of both Ebasco and certain of its client
companies in order to evaluate the relationships between the two.
Because of the long period of close association between those clients
and the Bond and Share System, which formerly were indirect subsidiaries of Bond and Share, examination of the problem cannot be
limited to present day operations, but must of necessity involve
careful analysis of changes in operating methods and relationships
extending over a period of several years.
General Public Utilities Corp.

General Public Utilities Corp. (GPU) is the top holding company
of an electric utility system with consolidated assets, as of December
31, 1955, less valuation reserves, totaling $677 million. As a result
of a merger undertaken in the past fiscal year, the number of domestic
public-utility subsidiaries in the system was reduced from 7 to 6 and
one wholly owned subsidiary registered holding company, through
which GPU controlled 1 domestic and 2 foreign subsidiaries, was
dissolved during the year. GPU has 2 subsidiaries operating in
the Philippine Islands. The system renders electric utility service
to 937,180 customers located in more than 1,350 communities in the
States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey and to 267,738 customers in
the Philippine Islands.
The Commission approved a joint application-declaration filed by
GPU and certain system companies requesting that the Commission
modify its order dated December 28, 1951, 19 issued pursuant to section 11 (b) (1) of the Act to enable GPU to retain its subsidiary,
Northern Pennsylvania Power Co., and the latter's subsidiary, the
Waverly Electric Light & Power Co., with North Penn being merged
with Pennsylvania Electric Co. (Penelecl."
The Commission modified its order because of the construction, subsequent to the divestment order, of a transmission line across North Penn's entire service

a retainable subsidiary in GPU's principal system, so that the properties of North Penn had become an integral part of the interconnected
and coordinated properties of the GPU system. To avoid the
"great grandfather" relationship prohibited by the second sentence of
section 11 (b) (2), which would have arisen as a consequence of the
merger by the interposition of two intermediate holding companies
(Associated Electric Co. and Penelec) between GPU and Waverly,
GPU and Associated Electric Co. requested, and was granted, authority to liquidate the latter company and to transfer its assets to GPU,
subject to GPU's assumption of the companies' liabilities. These
assets consisted principally of all the outstanding common stock of
Penelec, all of the outstanding stock and $4 million principal amount of
debentures of Manila Electric Co. and all of the outstanding securities
of Escudero Electric Service Co., the latter two companies being
public-utility companies operating in the Republic of the Philippines."
Another significant development occurred with respect to the retention by GPU of its two public utility subsidiary companies in the
Republic of the Philippines with respect to which a section 11 (b) (1)
divestment order, originally issued by the Commission in 1942, suspended in 1945 and reinstated on December 28, 1951. Legislation
enacted in the 84th Congress permits GPU to retain these properties.
This legislation is discussed in detail under the heading "Legislative
Activities," at page 17 of this report.

Hydro-Electric System

International Hydro-Electric System ("IRES") is a registered
holding company which, as a result of completion of the various
steps required to bring the system into compliance with the standards of section 11 (b) of the Act, has reduced its public utility interests
to 18.8 percent of the outstanding common stock of Gatineau Power
Co., a Canadian electric utility company.j" In 1944, Bartholomew
A. Brickley was appointed trustee of the system pursuant to section
11 (d) of the Act by the United States District Court for the District

Various steps taken by the trustee to effect
compliance with the provisions of section 11 (b) of the Act have been

Power Co. and its subsidiaries, less valuation reserves, totaled $113
million as of the same date.
During the fiscal year the Commission issued its Findings and
Opinion 23 and Order 24 approving a section 11 (e) plan filed by the
Interim Board of Directors of IRES providing for the continuation of
IRES as a registered, closed-end, nondiversified investment company
(renamed "Abacus Fund") and the retention of IRES's present assets
consisting of: (a) the 18.8 percent of the outstanding common stock
of Gatineau Power Co. noted above; (b) all of the outstanding
common stock of Eastern N ew York Power Corp., an inactive company
with assets of approximately $3 million in cash; (c) 4.6 percent of the
outstanding common stock of New England Electric System, a
registered holding company; and (d) cash in excess of $9 million. In
addition, the plan provided for various changes in IRES's Declaration
of Trust, the principal ones being: the renaming of IRES, "Abacus
fund;" the elimination of the several classes of authorized capital
stock and the designation of the new stock as $1 par value common
stock; the provision of cumulative voting and preemptive rights for
the stockholders; the increase of the quorum requirements for stockholders' meetings from one-third to one-half of the shares outstanding;
the grant to the stockholders of the right to elect directors where, due
to resignation, less than two-thirds of the remaining directors in office
are elected by the stockholders; and the requirement that a quorum of
directors be not less than a majority. Certain other proposed
amendments of the Declaration of Trust, which would have reduced
existing requirements for certain types of action from two-thirds to
a simple majority vote of stockholders, were rejected by the Commission and eliminated from the provisions of the plan in accordance
with the Commission's Findings and Opinion which stated that the
proposals curtailed desirable stockholder protection and were therefore
objectionable under the standards of the Act.
In conjunction with its approval of the Interim Board's Plan, the
Commission also found (without, however, entering an order thereon)
that IRES would qualify for an exemption pursuant to section 3 (a) (5)
of the Act. The Commission also granted an application to modify
the outstanding liquidation and dissolution order issued in 1942
pursuant to section 11 (b) (2) of the Act on the ground that the conditions upon which its previous order were predicated no longer
existed.
The Interim Board's Plan was opposed by certain stockholder
groups who submitted plans which the Commission rejected. The
Commission's Findings and Opinion and Order were approved and

of Massachusetts by order dated April 23, 1956.25 An appeal has

court's order pending disposition of their appeals which was granted
on May 29, 1956.26 The Court of Appeals on October 26, 1956, dismissed the appeals and affirmed the order of the district court."
During the past year the Commission disposed of various applications for fees and expenses incurred up to September 30, 1954, by
certain participants in the IHES reorganization proceedings in
accordance with the procedure for processing such applications outlined at page 64, 21st Annual Report. Thirty-one applications were
received requesting allowances aggregating some $1.7 millions. On
November 25, 1955, the Commission issued an order approving
maximum allowances aggregating some $965,000 for all but 7 of the
31 applicants." These payments were subsequently approved by the
reorganization court."
Hearings were held with respect to the
remaining seven applications on which the trustee had been unable
to reach settlements, and shortly after the close of the fiscal year the
Commission issued its Findings and Opinion and a Supplemental
Order disapproving the requests of 5 of the 7 applicants and approving
allowances aggregating some $29,500 to the 2 remaining applicants."
Interstate Power Co. (Delaware)

This company, which was formerly a public utility subsidiary of
Ogden Corp., a registered holding company, is an electric utility
operating company which had, at the beginning of the year, one
wholly owned public utility subsidiary, East Dubuque Electric Co.
On December 31, 1955, the consolidated assets of the 2 companies,
less valuation reserves, were $63 million. The system was engaged,
principally, in furnishing electricity to 96,657 customers in 224 communities in the States of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and South Dakota.
It also furnished a small amount of gas at retail to 13,555 customers
in 2 communities in Illinois and South Dakota, and operated transportation facilities.
During 1956 the Commission approved a joint application-declaration filed by the companies proposing the dissolution and complete
liquidation of East Dubuque with Interstate's acquisition of the
latter's assets and the assumption of its liabilities." This transaction
was made possible by the enactment of an amendment, effective

Middle South Utilities, Inc.

Middle South Utilities, Inc., functions solely as a holding company.
It has 4 operating subsidiaries, Arkansas Power and Light Co., Louisiana Power and Light:Co., Mississippi Power and Light Co., and New
Orleans Public Service, Inc. Middle South also owns a lO-percent common stock interest in Electric Energy, Inc., an electric generating company described elsewhere in this report in the discussion of Union Electric Co., and a 79-percent interest in Mississippi Valley Generating Co.,
now an inactive company but originally organized for the purpose of
supplying electric energy to the Tennessee Valley Authority as replacement for power supplied by the latter to the Atomic Energy
Commission. Middle South's subsidiary, Arkansas Power and Light,
owns a 34-percent common stock interest in Arklahoma Corp., a
transmission facility owned jointly with two nonaffiliated power
companies. One of these companies, Southwestern Gas & Electric
Co., which owns a 32-percent interest in Arklahoma, is a subsidiary
of Central & South West Corp., a nonaffiliated registered holding
company. The Middle South system furnishes electric service to
over 1,700 communities and extensive rural areas in the States of
Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana and furnishes gas service to 48
communities in Louisiana. Transit service is also provided in the
New Orleans metropolitan area. The system services 815,658 electric
customers and 231,477 gas customers. Consolidated assets of the
system as at December 31, 1955, less valuation reserves, totaled $590
million. Included in the above are the system's investment in Electric Energy, Inc., Arklahoma Corp., and Mississippi Valley Generating Co.
Subsequent to the remand, on September 12, 1955, of the case of

On March 20, 1953, the electric properties of the Middle South
system were found by the Commission to constitute an integrated
electric utility system; but in the same proceeding the Commission
entered an order under section 11 (b) (l) of the Act directing Middle
South and its subsidiary, Louisiana Power and Light Co. (Louisiana),
to divest themselves of their interests in the nonelectric properties
of Louisiana." These included certain small water properties in
Arcadia, La., and gas distributing properties providing service to
some 48 communities in the northern and southeastern portions of
the State of Louisiana including all of the territory extending around,
but not embracing, the city of New Orleans. In compliance with
this order, Louisiana filed an application-declaration for the purpose
of transferring to a new company the nonelectric properties then held
by Louisiana. Thereafter, the Louisiana Public Service Commission
requested that the Commission not proceed with the applicationdeclaration, and that it reopen the section 11 (b) (1) proceedings
which had terminated in the order of March 20, 1953. It also urged
that the Commission take certain evidence which the State commission alleged would indicate that the electric and gas properties of
Louisiana Power should not be separated and that the combined
properties be retained under a single corporate entity. Jefferson
Parish, a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana, opposed the
State commission in this matter. After considering an offer of proof
filed by the Louisiana Commission, an order was entered by this
Commission on September 13, 1955, denying the petition to reopen
the section 11 (b) (1) proceeding." A petition to review this order
was filed by the State commission with the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which, on June 30, 1956, issued its
Opinion holding, among other things, that the Commission erred in
denying the petition to reopen the section 11 proceeding and thereupon
remanded the matter to the Commission."
The Court of Appeals
decided (1) that the Commission had improperly excluded from its
consideration the question of what, if any, economies might be lost
to Louisiana Power within the meaning of clause (A) of section 11
(b) (1) of the Act if it disposed of its gas properties as directed by the
Commission, and (2) that the Commission's concept as to what constituted substantial economies was too rigid. Subsequent to the
close of the fiscal year the Commission petitioned the United States
Supreme Court to review the decision of the court of appeals.F"

nonutilities are engaged in the production of petroleum products, one
holds and operates real estate, and another is a gas transmission company. The system is principally engaged in the production, transmission, and retail distribution of natural and mixed gas. Service
is furnished to 504,265 customers in 78 communities in New York,
Pennsylvania, and Ohio. As at December 31, 1955, consolidated
assets of the system, less valuation reserves, amounted to $155
million.
During the past year National disposed of its holdings of its foreign
utility subsidiary, Provincial Gas Co., Ltd., consisting of approximately 75 percent of the outstanding common stock of that company.
National also filed a proposal to eliminate a minority interest of
approximately 38 percent of the common stock of its subsidiary,
Pennsylvania Gas Co., which was held by 850 public stockholders.
The proposal involved the issuance of additional common stock by
National to be offered in exchange for the common stock of Pennsylvania Gas Co. held by the minority stockholders on the basis of
1.45 shares of National's stock for 1 share of Pennsylvania Gas Co.'s
stock. One holder of a substantial amount of Pennsylvania Gas Co.
stock appeared at the hearing in support of the proposals and no one
appeared in opposition. In approving the transactions involved, the
Commission found, among other things, that the exchange offer was
reasonable and that the acquisition by N ational of the minority-held
shares of Pennsylvania Gas Co. tended to minimize if not remove
impediments and problems incident to the existence of such a minority
interest in National's system. The Commission also noted that
proposals having as their objective the reduction or elimination of
publicly held minority interests in public-utility holding company
systems should be encouraged." The exchange offer was accepted by
minority stockholders holding 191,771 shares and as a result National
now owns 94.05 percent of Pennsylvania's outstanding capital stock
as compared to its previous holdings of 62.26 percent.
The Southern Co.

The Southern Co. functions solely as a holding company over 4
public utility subsidiaries which furnish electric service to 1,318,553
customers in 1,394 communities in the States of Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, and Mississippi. The system also includes a nonutility subsidiary and a mutual service company. Consolidated assets of the
system as at December 31, 1955, less valuation reserves but including
the Southern Co.'s investment in Mississippi Valley Generating Co.,
totaled $880 million. The public utility subsidiaries of the system
were formerly part of the Commonwealth and Southern Corp. holding

of the 21st Annual Report, the Commission on November 4, 1955,
rescinded its previously issued order authorizing the issuance of
44,000 shares of common stock by Mississippi Valley Generating Co.
and the acquisition thereof by Middle South Utilities, Inc., and The
Southern Co. With respect to the 2,310 shares of common st~ck
already issued by Mississippi Valley and acquired by The Southern
Co., the Commission reserved jurisdiction to determine at a later

On June 28, 1956, the Commission approved a joint applicationdeclaration filed by the system companies and by Southern Electric
Generating Co., a newly organized company, proposing among other
things: (1) the issuance and sale by two subsidiary companies, Alabama
Power Co. and Georgia Power Co., and the acquisition by The Southern
Co. of their common stock for an aggregate consideration of $2 million;
and (2) the issuance and sale and the acquisition by Alabama and
Georgia of 10,000 shares each of the common stock of Southern
Electric Generating Co. for an aggregate consideration of $2 million.
These proposals constituted the initial financing for the construction
by Southern Electric Generating Co. of a steam electric generating
plant on the Coosa River in the State of Alabama which it is estimated
will have a capacity of over 1.0 million kilowatts by the end of 1963.
The overall financing requirements for the construction of the plant
are estimated to require $150 million."
Ohio Edison Co.

Ohio Edison Co. is an operating electric utility company and is also
a registered holding company by virtue of its control of Pennsylvania
Power Co., also an electric utility company. The electric facilities of
. the company and its subsidiary constitute an integrated electric
utility system serving 508,453 customers in 588 communities and in

in the system. The aggregate of the holdings of Standard Shares,
Standard Gas and Philadelphia in the common stock of Duquesne
constitutes 14.6 percent of the outstanding amount of that issue.
Standard Shares, Inc., which was formerly named Standard Power

During 1956 its petition for modification of a dissolution order then
outstanding under section 11 (b) of the Act was approved by the
Commission." At the same time the Commission approved the
company's plan under section 11 (e) for conversion into a closedend, nondiversified investment company. This plan was approved
and ordered enforced by the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware." With Commission approval 44 the company's
investments have been restated at approximately $31,000,000 which

enforced. The assets of the system's two subsidiaries, Pittsburgh
Railways Co. and Duquesne Light Co., as at December 31, 1955, less
valuation reserves, totaled $44 million and $351 million, respectively.
Under the plan, Standard Shares has embarked upon a restricted

Standard Gas & Electric Co. (Standard Gas) and Philadelphia Co.
(Philadelphia) are subject to Commission orders to liquidate and dissolve." It is proposed pursuant to a section 11 (e) plan that this
liquidation and dissolution be accomplished by means of the divestment of a substantial part of the system's interests in Duquesne and
of the system's entire interest in Pittsburgh Railways Co., a nonutility
subsidiary. Unresolved tax difficulties have caused delay. During
the fiscal year Standard Gas filed an application for approval of certain amendments to its section 11 (e) plan which would, among other
things, amend a 1952 tax cutoff agreement between Philadelphia and
Duquesne so as to permit some further progress towards consummation by reducing the need for Standard Gas and Philadelphia to retain
assets to cover potential tax liabilities and thereby permitting distribution of common stock of Pittsburgh Railways Co. and Duquesne
now held by these companies.
The tax difficulties arise from consolidated Federal income and excess profits tax returns filed by Standard Gas, Philadelphia, and certain other affiliated companies for the years 1942 to 1950, inclusive.
At the end of the fiscal year the field agent of the Internal Revenue
Service had reported on all of the years and had alleged tax deficiencies

subsidiaries provide electric utility service to 544,930 customers in the
city of St. Louis and in other communities in eastern and central
Missouri, and in portions of Illinois and Iowa. About 228 communities are served. Consolidated assets of the system as at December

to its electric utility properties, Union Electric owns directly or indirectly through subsidiaries certain gas utility properties and nonutility assets. It also owns 40 percent of the voting securities of
Electric Energy, Inc., which owns and operates a 6-unit steam electric
generating station in Joppa, Ill., with aggregate capacity of 1,009,800
kilowatts. The station supplies 735,000 kilowattf of firm power to
an Atomic Energy Commission installation near Paducah, Ky. The
balance of its output is taken by the five electric utility systems which
own all of the company's stock. Union Electric Co. is the largest
stockholder of Electric Energy. Middle South Utilities, Inc., another
registered holding company described elsewhere in this report, owns
"28 S. E. C 35 (June 1,1948), 28 S. E C.944 (December31,1948),

not otherwise connected with any registered holding company systems;
Central Illinois Public Service Co. and Illinois Power Co. each own
20 percent and Kentucky Utilities Co. owns 10 percent. The total
assets of Electric Energy, Inc., as at December 31, 1955, less valuation

During the past year Union Electric disposed of its direct interest
in Hevi-Duty Electric Co., a wholly owned nonutility subsidiary
company, and its indirect interest in Anchor Manufacturing Co., a
subsidiary of Hevi-Duty. The proposals to effectuate this disposition,
which the Commission approved on May 4, 1956,46included, among
other things, (1) the reclassification of Hevi-Duty's 2,500 shares of
authorized and outstanding no par value common stock into 345,230
shares of $5 par value common stock; (2) an increase in the number
of authorized shares of common stock as so reclassified to one million
with provisions for preemptive rights and cumulative voting in the
election of directors; (3) acquisition by Union Electric of the 345,230
shares of new Hevi-Duty common stock in exchange for the 2,500
shares of old common stock; and (4) distribution by Union Electric
to its stockholders of the shares of the new common stock of HeviDuty at the rate of 1 share for each 30 shares of Union Electric common stock held of record on June 29, 1956. In addition, provision
was made for the election of new directors to the boards of Hevi-Duty
and Anchor, promptly after the distribution by Union Electric of
the Hevi-Duty common stock. Subsequently, Hevi-Duty submitted
a proposed slate of nominees which the Commission approved in an
order dated June 28, 1956.47 The Commission's order required
Hevi-Duty to submit to its stockholders at the next annual meeting
a charter amendment to increase the number of members of its
board of directors so that a majority of such directors would be
persons who were neither officers nor employees of either Hevi-Duty
or Anchor and directed that the names of the nominees for the additional directors be submitted to the Commission for approval.
The latter two requirements were consented to by Hevi-Duty and
by Union Electric.
Union Electric also filed a notice of intention pursuant to rule
U-44 (c) to sell its interests in Muzak Corp., consisting of 500 shares

Other nonutility dispositions made during the past year included
the sale of properties constituting the St. Louis & Belleville Electric
Railway Co. and the sale of water properties owned by Missouri
Power & Light Co. located in Mexico, Missouri, on January 3, 1956
and July 16, 1956, respectively.
On March 6, 1956, Union Electric filed an application, which was
pending at the close of the fiscal year, requesting an exemption from
the Act pursuant to section 3 (a) (2) thereof on the ground that it is
predominantly a public utility company whose operations as such
do not extend beyond the State in which it is organized and States
contiguous thereto. Union Electric also requested that the Commission release the jurisdiction previously reserved over the question
of the retainability of the gas systems of Union Electric and its
subsidiaries."
Wisconsin Southern

Gas Co., Inc.

This company, formerly known as Wisconsin Southern Gas and
Appliance Corp., registered as a holding company on May 28, 1952,
prior to which it had been an exempt holding company pursuant to
rule U-9. The company distributes natural and propane gas in
three counties in Wisconsin with a total population of 40,000. As
at December 31, 1955, system assets, less depreciation reserves, totaled
$3.8 million. The company had had one public utility subsidiary,
a gas utility, and in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1955, it proposed
a statutory merger with its subsidiary, in connection with which it
applied for and was granted an exemption pursuant to section 3 (a)
(1) of the Act. In the past fiscal year the merger was consummated,
and the Commission issued an order pursuant to section 5 (d) of the
Act declaring that the company had ceased to be a holding company."
OTHER REGISTERED

HOLDING COMPANIES

On June 30, 1955, there were 10 other companies subject to the
provisions of the Act as registered holding companies but which as
a result of having completed nearly all steps required for compliance
with outstanding orders of the Commission under section 11 (b) of
the Act, no longer held any public utility subsidiaries. 50 Seven of

these companies had completed all divestments of former subsidiaries
and were in the final stages of liquidation. 51 During 1956 the Commission granted an application of one of these companies, American
Power and Light Co., declaring pursuant to section 5 (d) of the Act
that such company had ceased to be a holding company," subject
to the condition that the trustees in dissolution for American remain
subject to the Commission's jurisdiction in respect to any further
proceedings or orders the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate with respect to its order dated March 31, 1953, approving
American's plan for liquidation under section 11 (e) of the Act.
During 1956 Electric Power & Light Corp., with the approval of
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, made its final liquidating distribution of cash in an amount
exceeding $1 million to certain of its common stockholders and holders
of option warrants. 53
Engineers Public Service Co. is another of the 7 registered holding companies in the final stages of liquidation and dissolution.
Certain of its residual problems with respect to applications for fees
and expenses incurred by participants in the company's reorganization under section 11 (e) of the Act were disposed of during the fiscal
year. On March 14, 1956, the Commission issued a supplemental
order approving payment of additional fees in the amount of $2,500 to
each of 2 applicants in compromise of all claims for services rendered
and disbursements made by them subsequent to the filing of their
original fee application in 1949.54 No further steps were taken during
the past fiscal year by the other 4 registered holding companies in
process of final liquidation.
Three other registered- holding companies which were not in process
of liquidation remain in business as going concerns, but were in final
stages of conversion to other status. At the close of the preceding
fiscal year, Western Kentucky Gas Co., a registered holding company,
was in process of consummating the merger of its sole subsidiary,
Shelbyville Gas Co., as described at page 74 of the 21st Annual
Report. The merger was completed during 1956 and, upon application by Western Kentucky, the Commission issued its order pursuant
to section 5 (d) of the Act declaring that the company had ceased to be
a holding company and terminating its registration as such."

The steps taken by Southwestern Development Co. and its subsidiaries to comply with the integration and simplification provisions
of section 11 (b) of the Act are described in the 18th, 20th, and 21st
Annual Reports, at pages 99, 65, and 69, respectively. An integral
part of Southwestern's section 11 (e) plan related to the program of
Sinclair Oil Corp., a partially exempt registered holding company,
to dispose of its holdings of 384,860 shares (52.88 percent of common
stock of Westpan Hydrocarbon Co., formerly a nonutility subsidiary
of Southwestern, which shares were received by Sinclair under the
provisions of Southwestern's plan. In the previous fiscal year Sinclair
filed with the Commission a notice of intention pursuant to rule U-44
(c) to sell its Westpan holdings to Jalco, Inc., a nonaffiliated corporation, pursuant to a contract between the parties. The sale was not
consummated and Sinclair and Jalco, Inc., entered into a new contract
providing for the purchase by Jalco of Sinclair's holdings of Westpan
common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $4,887,733. A new
notice of intention to sell pursuant to rule U-44 (c) was filed with the
Commission and, on May 22, 1956, the sale was consummated.
The United Corp.

On January 16, 1956, the Commission issued its findings, opinion
and order pursuant to section 5 (d) of the Act declaring that United
Corp. had ceased to be a holding company, and denying, among other
things, the request of Randolph Phillips, a stockholder of United
Corp., for a hearing." On January 17, 1956, United filed its Notification of Registration pursuant to section 8 (a) of the Investment
Company Act as a closed-end nondiversified investment company.
Subsequently Phillips petitioned the Commission for a rehearing
asserting as grounds therefor that the Commission's findings and
opinion were not factually accurate and contained erroneous conclusions of law. The Commission denied the petition on February 16,
1956/7 and Phillips filed a petition for review of the January 16 and
February 16 orders in the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit." This case was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
During the fiscal year the Commission also disposed of applications
for fees and expenses for services rendered in connection with United's
1944 Exchange Plan and its 1951 Amended Investment Company

FINANCING OF REGISTERED PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY
SYSTEMS-TRENDS IN ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITY INDUSTRIES

During 1956, registered holding companies and their subsidiaries
sold to the public and to institutional investors $565 million of their
securities, all to provide new capital. In the preceding fiscal year,
registered systems sold $704 million of securities, of which $524 million
was for new construction and $180 million was for the refunding of
other securities. Thus, even though 9 subsidiaries of registered holding companies with aggregate assets of $14 million were divested during
the fiscal year 1956 and two registered systems with total assets of
$67 million were deregistered in that year, the volume of external
financing by registered systems for new money purposes increased
approximately $41 million, or 7.8 percent.
Excluding companies in registered holding company systems,
electric and gas utility companies and gas pipeline companies in the
electric and gas utility industries sold $1,980 million of securities to
the public and to financial institutions in the fiscal year 1956. It is
estimated that all but approximately $23 million of this amount, or
about $1,957 million, was for new money purposes. In the fiscal year
1955 these companies sold $2,238 million of securities, of which
approximately $592 million was for refunding purposes and about
$1,646 million was used for new money purposes. The volume of new
money financing by these companies in the fiscal year 1956 thus
reflected an increase of approximately $315 million, or 19.1 percent,
over the amount reported for the fiscal year 1955.
The increase in the volume of new money financing in 1956 over 1955

utility industries was caused by the continuation of the rising trend of
expenditures for new plant and equipment which became evident in the
last quarter of the fiscal year 1955. In that 3-month period expenditures by electric, gas and water utilities amounted to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4,090 million. The volume of such expenditures
has Increased in each subsequent quarter, and in the final 3 months of
the fiscal year 1956reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4,610
million. Actual expenditures by these industries increased from the
$4,066 million reported for the fiscal year 1955 to a total of $4,547
million for the fiscal year 1956. Total funds generated internally by
means of depreciation, depletion, and amortization accruals and by
the retention of undistributed net income, increased from an estimated
$1,128 million in the calendar year 1952 to $1,416 million in the
calendar year 1955. In the calendar year 1955 approximately 33.7
percent of the plant expenditures reported by the electric and gas
utility industries were financed from internal sources, as compared
with 34.0 percent in 1954, 28.2 percent in 1953 and 29.7 percent in
19{)2. The balance of the funds required was derived from sales of
new securities and from bank borrowings.
The following table sets forth the amounts of various types of securities sold in the fiscal years 1956 and 1955 by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries and by all other companies in the electric
and gas utility industries.
As shown by the data in the following table, registered systems sold
proportionately greater amounts of notes and debentures and proportionately smaller amounts of preferred stocks in the fiscal year 1956
than did the other companies in the electric and gas utility industries.
In the fiscal year 1955 the pattern was markedly different. The percentage of the total external financing of registered systems represented
by mortgage bonds in 1955 was 1 percent higher than in 1956. Notes
accounted for a much smaller percentage of the total and preferred
stock financing represented a much greater share. In contrast, between 1955 and 1956 all other companies showed decreases in debt
categories and increases in both preferred and common stock financing.
Registered systems sold proportionately greater amounts of common
stocks in both years than did the other companies, with the percentage
in 1956 showing an increase over 1955.
In addition to passing upon the 43 issues of securities totaling $565
million which were sold outside of their respective systems by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries in the fiscal year 1956.
the Commission was required to authorize the issuance and sale of
securities by subsidiaries of registered holding companies to their
parents. That year 84 such issues with gross sales value of $199
million were sold, as compared with 108 issues totaling $224 million

exempted by order, 10 issues amounting to $107 million were sold by
Ohio Valley Electric Corp. pursuant to long term construction financing agreements authorized and exempted from competitive bidding
requirements by the Commission in earlier years. The remaining 5 of
these issues in the amount of $67 million were pipeline mortgage
bonds sold to insurance companies by American-Louisiana Pipe Line
Co., a subsidiary of American Natural Gas Co., a registered holding
company, pursuant to the long-term construction financing agreement
authorized by the Commission during 1956 as described under
"Relationships With State Public Utility Commissions" at page 166
of this report.
During 1956 only 2 orders were issued by the Commission pursuan t
to paragraph (a) (5) of rule U-50 exempting proposed issuances of
securities from the competitive bidding requirements of the rule.
The first was the order approving the American-Louisiana Pipe Line
financing referred to above. The second related to the offer by N ational Fuel Gas Co., a registered holding company, of shares of its
own stock in exchange for minority holdings of 234,772 shares of the
common stock of its subsidiary, Pennsylvania Gas Co. National
Fuel issued 286,768 shares of its stock in connection with this offering.
This issue is not included in the preceding tables showing the total
volume of financing by registered holding company systems and by
all other companies in the electric and gas utility systems, because it
involved the issuance of securities in exchange for other securities in
connection with a reorganization transaction.

The discounts below market price at which electric and gas utilities
set the subscription prices for their common stock rights offerings
varied considerably in 1956. The offerings by registered systems
carried discounts in the range from 5.00 to more than 10 percent,
with 4 of their 5 rights offerings in the 5.00 to 9.99 percent bracket.
The discounts chosen by other companies in the electric and gas

FINANCING STANDARDS-IMPORTANCE OF CAPITALIZATION
RATIOS

The Commission has consistently urged the maintenance of sound
capital structures by registered holding company systems since the
Act became law. As stated in its 10th Annual Report: "A balanced
capital structure provides a considerable measure of insurance against
bankruptcy, enables the utility to raise new money economically,
and avoids the possibility of deterioration in service to consumers if
there is a decline in earnings." 65
The statutory basis for the Commission's concern with this problem lies in sections 1 (b), 6 (b), and 7 (d) of the Act. In section 1 (b),
Congress dechlred that "the national public interest, the interest of
investors in the securities of holding companies and their subsidiary
companies and affiliates, and the interest of consumers of electric
energy and * * * gas are or may be adversely affected" when, among
other things, " * * * control of such companies is exerted through
disproportionately small investment" (sec. 1 (b) (3)) and "when in any
"P

other respect there is * * * lack of economies in the raising of capital" (sec. 1 (b) (5)). Section 1 (c) directs that "all the provisions
of this title shall be interpreted to meet the problems and eliminate
the evils as enumerated in this section."
Section 6 (a) requires all securities issued by registered holding
companies or their subsidiaries, not exempt under section 6 (b), to
be subject to a declaration meeting the standards of section 7. Among
the standards of section 7 (d) is the requirement that the Commission shall not permit a declaration to become effective if it finds that
"the security is not reasonably adapted to the security structure of
the declarant and other companies in the same holding company
system; the security is not reasonably adapted to the earning power
of the declarant; or the terms and conditions of the issue or sale of
the security are detrimental to the public interest or the interest of
investors or consumers."
Section 6 (b) exempts securities issued by a subsidiary which are
solely for the purpose of financing the business of such subsidiary
company and have been expressly authorized by the State commission
of the State in which such subsidiary company is organized and doing
business, but this exemption is made subject to "such terms and
conditions as [the Commission] deems appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors or consumers."
Passage of the act by the Congress was preceded by long and detailed investigation by the Federal Trade Commission of the public
utility industry, particularly as it was affected by the control exerted
by the holding company device. As a result of its study, the Federal
Trade Commission found that among the abuses of the holding company device was "Corporate organization which gives powers inconsistent with a just division of responsibilities and emoluments as
between various groups or parties furnishing capital by loan or by
contribution, either directly or indirectly by purchase, succession, or
otherwise." 66 On the basis of these studies, Congress determined
that the national public interest and the interest of investors and
consumers were adversely affected when control of subsidiary publicutility companies "is exerted through disproportionately small investment" and this became a cornerstone of section 1 (b) (3) of the Act.
That the pyramided capital structures of many of the holding
company systems were ill-equipped to withstand the rigors of any
sudden decline in earnings is evident from the following facts. From
September 1, 1929, to April 15, 1936, a total of 36 public-utility
operating company subsidiaries of holding companies, with outstanding securities in the hands of the public of some $445 million, went

into bankruptcy or receivership. Sixteen additional companies, with
about $152 million of securities outstanding in the hands of the
public, offered readjustment or extension plans after defaulting on
interest payments." Many other operating companies escaped bankruptcy or receivership by deferring needed replacements, stinting
on maintenance, and by stopping dividends on the publicly held
preferred as well as the controlling common stocks. Of preferred
stocks of operating subsidiaries aggregating about $1.6 billion (involuntary liquidation preference) at December 31, 1940, approximately
$453 million (or 27 percent) were in default, such accumulated arrears
amounting to $165 million."
As might be expected, because of the greater leverage factor present,
holding companies were in even more distressed financial condition.
From September 1, 1929, to April 15, 1936, a total of 53 holding
companies, with about $1.7 billion of securities outstanding went
into receivership or bankruptcy. An additional 23 holding companies,
with about $535 million of outstanding securities, defaulted on interest and offered readjustment plans." The corporate income of
many of the holding companies was insufficient to service both their
debt securities and preferred stock, and arrears on the latter continued
to mount. As of December 31, 1940, registered holding companies
had outstanding approximately $2,501,723,000 of preferred stock, of
which $1,442,188,000 (or 58 percent) was in arrears, the total arrears
as of that date aggregating approximately $476,000,000.70
Since 1935 the electric utility industry has made very substantial
strides toward basic financial soundness. While improved economic
conditions have, of course, provided a favorable basis for such development, and most industries have shared, to a greater or lesser degree,
in the general prosperity which has developed since that date, it is
clear beyond any doubt that the combined regulatory efforts of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Power Commission,
and the State regulatory commissions, have contributed materially
to this improved financial health. The arrears on the operating
company and holding company preferred stocks which existed at the
end of 1940 have been eliminated; some $1,107,000,000 of electric
plant adjustments (i. e., writeups and other inflationary itemsaccount No. 107) have been eliminated from the electric utility plant
accounts, and approximately $517,000,000 of electric plant acquisition
adjustments (account No. 100.5) have been or are being amortized
or otherwise disposed of; depreciation reserves have nearly doubled
in terms of percentage of utility plant account; the proportion of
outstanding long-term debt to net utility plant has substantially

decreased; corporate structures have been substantially simplified
and unnecessary corporate entities have been eliminated; and actual
investment in common stock equity has been materially increased
as a result of reorganizations, equity contributions by the parent,
sales of equity securities, and the like.
As at the end of 1955, on the basis of the aggregate of the balance
sheets of all class A and class B privately owned electric utility companies in the United States (as classified by the FPC), the composite
capital structure was as follows: long-term debt 50.7 percent; preferred stock 12.3 percent; and common stock and surplus 37.0 percent.
The composite percentage of long-term debt to net utility plant was
52.5 percent. The composite percentage of reserve for depreciation
to gross utility plant was 19.0 percent. The composite annual depreciation accrual rate amounted to 2.3 percent of gross utility plant.
Similarly on a composite basis, income deductions were earned (after
taxes) 3.84 times, while income deductions plus preferred dividend
requirements were earned 2.88 times.
It is interesting to note that whereas in 1935 the electric and gas
utilities subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act earned
their income deductions plus preferred dividend requirements an
average of 1.23 times (after taxes), the composite coverage in 1955.
even on the basis of including parent company interest charges, of
composite income deductions and preferred dividend requirements
of the -12 principal electric registered holding company systems was
2.73 times. In the case of the 4 gas registered holding company
systems, the composite coverage in 1955 was 3.55 times; and on a combined basis, for the 16 systems, the composite coverage in 1955 was
2.88 times. These composite coverages in 1955 are considerably better
than the composite coverage of triple-A credit utilities in 1935.
In the Eastern. Utilitie8 Associates case (Holding Company Act
Release No. 11625, p. 55, Dec. 18, 1952) the Commission prescribed,
in connection with its approval of collateral trust bonds, that the
system's funded debt ratio should not exceed 60% and that its common
stock equity ratio should not be less than 30%. Since the remaining
component of capital in a system with this maximum debt and minimum common stock equity would ordinarily be preferred stock, this
prescription is sometimes charact erized as expressing a 60-10-30
policy. Although the Commission has not attempted to prescribe
optimum or ideal capitalization ratios, nor assumed that the 60-10-30
policy of the Eastern Utilities case sets a fixed or permanent standard
to be applied to all systems, these ratios have been generally regarded
as embodying the present working policy of the Commission.
The Commission's capitalization ratio standards are applied both
on a consolidated basis and on an individual operating-company
basis.

160

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In carrying out its duties under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act as respects security issuances, the Commission, while insisting at
all times upon adherence to the standards of the Act, does not approach
security issues with a rigid, preconceived set of requirements applicable
to all situations.
It considers one of its major functions to be that of
helping companies to meet the requirements of the Act. For example,
where the terms of a proposed security issue, as initially filed with the
Commission, fail to meet one or more of the statutory standards, the
Commission does not simply refuse to permit the issue to be sold, but
seeks to strengthen the terms of the issue. This work is done largely
over the conference table and in informal meetings with the company's
officials and its financial and legal advisers.
As a remedial measure, designed to conform corporate structures to
statutory standards where the ratio of debt to net property is excessive,
the Commission has frequently required issuers to follow some systematic debt reduction plan. In some instances, conditions have been
attached to the Commission's orders requiring that the interest savings
from refunding or a certain amount of net earnings be reserved to
redeem outstanding debt. In other instances, the Commission has
required the inclusion of sinking fund provisions whereby the issuer
agrees to devote annually a stated amount to retirement of bonds or
to property additions.
In still other instances, the objective of debt
reduction has been achieved by means of serial financing.
Among other means employed to strengthen the financial structure
of weak companies the Commission has required more adequate maintenance and depreciation charges, restrictions on dividends, limitations as to the future issuance of securities having a preference over
the proposed security issue, restatement of certain accounting items,
and other provisions.
In certain cases where the proposed issue has already been approved
by a State commission, the issue is exempt from section 7 of the Act,
and the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission is
limited to attaching, for the protection of investors and consumers,
It has been the
terms and conditions to its order of exemption.
Commission's practice to communicate with the appropriate State
commission to discuss any problems raised by the issue and to cooperate in settling the problems which exist. When it appears that
a proposed debt issue in a section 6 (b) case is excessive, or that there
is an insufficient equity "cushion" under the senior securities, including
preferred stock issues, it is the Commission's policy to impose conditions which will improve the company's financial structure.
The Commission under unusual circumstances has departed from
its general policy with respect to capitalization ratio standards even
in the absence of factors which would bring about a relatively rapid
improvement.
Generally, such cases involve situations where a sub-

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

161

sidiary company was formed by a public utility company in conjunction with one or more unaffiliated public utility companies for the
purpose of building and owning generating facilities or transmission
lines whose output or use was for the benefit of the sponsoring companies or a Government agency,
That the achievement and preservation of sound capitalization
ratios are essential to the financial health of the public utility industry
has been recognized not only by the Commission and some other
regulatory bodies, but also by informed writers on the subject.
Most
of these authorities are generally agreed on the necessity for an adequate "cushion" of common stock equity to withstand the shock of a
severe decline in earnings, and for not too excessive an amount of debt,
notwithstanding the apparent cheapness of bond money versus common stock money and the deductibility for tax purposes of interest
expense. Quite a number urge that a company should not use up all
of its bonding credit, but rather should reserve a substantial portion
of it for such time when it may become difficult to sell common stock.
On September 5, 1956, the Commission announced that its Division
of Corporate Regulation has undertaken a study for the purpose of
determining the advisability of recommending that the Commission
issue for comment by interested persons a proposed Statement of
Policy relative to appropriate capitalization ratios in connection with
security issues by registered holding companies and their subsidiary
operating companies subject to the Act. The Division considers that
an administrative determination by the Commission through a Statement of Policy may be a desirable means of apprising issuers subject to
the Act and investors and consumers of the standards respecting capitalization ratios which the Commission would generally apply in determining (1) whether to impose terms and conditions in granting applications under section 6 (b) or (2) whether to make adverse findings
in respect of declarations pursuant to section 7 (d) of the Act.
The views and comments received from interested persons regarding
the advisability of promulgating a formal Statement of Policy are
being carefully considered by the staff of the Division for the purpose
of making its recommendation to the Commission.

Paducah, Ky. The operations of this company and the ownership
of its common stock are described at page 143 of this report under the
discussion of Union Electric Co.
Ohio Valley Electric Corp. and its subsidiary, Indiana-Kentucky
Electric Corp., were also organized to furnish electric energy to the
Atomic Energy Commission at its plant near Portsmouth, Ohio.
These companies are described at page 129 of this report under the
discussion of the American Gas and Electric Company system.
A fourth company, Mississippi Valley Generating Co., was organized
in July 1954 by two registered holding companies, Middle South
Utilities, Inc. and The Southern Co., for the purpose of furnishing
power to the Atomic Energy Commission, or to the Tennessee Valley
Authority for the account of the AEC in replacement of power furnished by TVA to the AEC. However, the power contract embracing
the terms of this arrangement was canceled by the Government of
the United States. Details concerning the proceedings before the
Commission with respect to the financing of Mississippi Valley and
the action taken by the Commission to rescind certain authorizations
are described at pages 84-85 of the 21st Annual Report and in this
report at pages 138 and 140. Electric Energy, Inc., and Ohio Valley
Electric Corp. obtained no new financing authorizations from the
Commission during the past fiscal year. However, Ohio Valley
issued and sold during the year $91,500,000 of bonds and $15,250,000
of notes pursuant to construction financing commitments negotiated
in earlier years. The organization and previous financing arrangements of these companies are described in the 17th, 18th, 20th, and
21st Annual Reports."
In the past fiscal year the Commission was presented with the first
formal proposal under the Act relatieg to the construction of an electric generating plant powered by atomic energy." In this case, the
Commission approved the issuance and sale of $500,000 par value
capital stock and $500,000 of unsecured noninterest bearing notes, as
part of the initial financing program for a new company, Yankee
Atomic Electric Co., to be formed by a group of 12 sponsoring utility
and holding companies for the purpose of constructing and operating
an atomic power plant estimated to cost about $33,400,000. The
Commission also approved the acquisition of these securities by six

of the sponsoring companies which were required to obtain the
authorization of the Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Act.
Two of the sponsors, New England Power Co., a subsidiary of New
England Electric System, a holding company registered under the
Act, and Connecticut Light and Power Co., an operating-holding company exempt from the provisions of the Act, each proposed to acquire
more than 10 percent of the voting stock of Yankee. These two
companies were required to obtain the Commission's approval of
their acquisitions of Yankee stock and they also applied for exemptions
from the provisions of the Act as holding companies. Four other
sponsoring companies, the Hartford Electric Light Co., Western
Massachusetts Cos., Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, and
Montaup Electric Co., were affiliates of other public-utility companies
and for that reason were also required to obtain approval of the
Commission of their proposed acquisitions of Yankee stock. Montaup
Electric Co. is a subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates, a registered
holding company. The Commission authorized all of the proposed
transactions and granted the requested exemptions without imposing
any terms or conditions. In its opinion, the Commission took into
account the novel and unusual circumstances present in the case,
noting among other things, that the Yankee project will involve
unusual risks, not merely in higher capital costs, but also with respect
to the dependability of its operation and the possibility of its early
obsolescence as new developments in the atomic power field are made.
However, it added that a group approach will not merely minimize
these risks to each of the sponsoring utilities but will provide th em with
a full opportunity to gain experience in the new field of atomic power.
The Commission made the findings required by sections 10 (b) and
10 (c) of the Act in respect of the proposed acquisitions of securities
of Yankee Atomic by the sponsor companies. In applying the standards of section 10 (b) of the Act, the Commission noted that the
sponsor companies would not acquire any control over each other by
virtue of the proposed joint undertaking, that the interlocking relations and arrangements embraced by the project were the normal requirements of a joint operation of that type, and that they did not
create a relationship of a kind which is detrimental to the public interest of investors or consumers or the interest.
In considering the application of section 10 (c) of the Act, the
Commission found that the proposed acquisitions of Yankee Atomic's
securities by the sponsor companies would not be detrimental to the
carrying out of the integration and corporate simplification provisions
of section 11 of the Act, and that the joint project tended towards
the economical and efficient development of an integrated electric
utility system in the New England area. It was noted that the
sponsor companies supplied about 90 percent of the power require-

164

ments of the New England States and that Yankee Atomic's plant
was capable of physical interconnection with all sponsor companies.
The Yankee case demonstrates the adaptability of the Holding
Company Act, as administered by the Commission, to meet the needs
of the atomic age. Yankee's sponsors have been able to combine
their forces to develop atomic power in full compliance with the Act
without seeking or receiving any exemption based on the research
and development aspects of the project. It appears that the effect
of the Act is not to impede this important development but rather
to channel it along sound corporate and financial lines and to prevent the advent of atomic power from causing the reappearance of
abuses which the Act was so successfully designed to remove.
RULES, FORMS, AND STATEMENTS OF POLICY

In accordance with a continuing program to reexamine the rules
and forms adopted pursuant to the Act and to issue statements of
policy regarding interpretations and procedures under the Act, the
Commission in the past fiscal year adopted an amendment to one
rule, adopted two statements of policy, and withdrew a proposal to
amend a rule.
On February 17, 1956, the Commission adopted Statements of
Policy with respect to first mortgage bonds 73 and preferred stocks of
public utility companies." In effect, these Statements of Policy
represent a codification of certain principles and policies prescribed
for the protective provisions of securities announced on a case-by-case
basis over a period of 15 years, as modified in the light of experience
and a reappraisal of those principles and policies and in the further
light of comments received from various interested persons whose
views were solicited by the Commission prior to adoption of the Statements of Policy. It is expected that the adoption of these Statements
of Policy will bring about substantial simplification in the administration of the Act, Among other things, the Statements provide the
means of achieving a greater degree of uniformity of administration
and interpretation than was permissible under methods formerly used.
They also provide investors, the issuing company, and the professional
practitioners who specialize in this field with a convenient guide to
enable them to determine in advance the basic requirements required
by the Commission in examining proposals for the issuance and sale
of mortgage bonds and preferred stocks of public utility companies
subject to the Act.
In the 84th Congress, legislation was introduced to amend the
Public Utility Holding Company Act so as to exempt from its provisions nuclear power reactor companies and their sponsors." These
amending bills failed of adoption after having been the subject of study

and comment and extensive hearings before a special subcommittee
of the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.
In the course of the subcommittee hearings it appeared that the
managements of some utility and industrial companies might be
reluctant to engage in sponsoring nuclear power projects because of
fear of involvement in the Holding Company Act. To a large degree
the Commission believed these fears groundless. Whereas the Commission had opposed efforts to grant automatic and permanent exemptions to nuclear power projects, it did agree as a matter of policy
that nonprofit reactor companies were entitled to exempt status at
least as long as they remained predominantly research and development projects. The Commission also found, in the last sentence of
section 2 (a) (3) of the Act, authority to exempt certain nonprofit
reactor companies by order or by rule.
Although none of the companies asserting fear of the Act as a,
deterrent to peaceful nuclear power development had in fact sought
an exemptive rule or order, the Commission published for comment 76
and ultimately adopted 77 an amendment to rule U-7 for the benefit
of nuclear power projects.
The amended rule in substance declares that a nuclear reactor
company is not an electric utility company if (1) its". . . only connection with the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric
energy is the ownership or operation of facilities used for the production of heat or steam from special nuclear material which heat or
steam is used in the generation of electric energy ... ", (2) if it " ...
is
organized not for profit ... " and (3) if it " ... is engaged primarily in
research and development activities."
Certain filing requirements are
set out for companies claiming exemption under the rule, and a procedure is established for challenge by the Commission.
Since it follows that if a non-profit nuclear reactor company in developmental stages is not a utility company, then no sponsor can become a holding company under the Act by virtue of its owning voting
securities of the reactor company, the amended rule provides a device
by which nuclear power projects can be organized without causing
sponsors to become subject to the Act. This is not the only device,
as the Yankee Atomic Electric Co. case and several other existing
nuclear power projects attest, but the Commission believes it to be an
important contribution to peaceful development in this important
area. The Chairman stated, in a release on behalf of the Commission
accompanying the adoption- of the amended rule:
The Securities and Exchange Commission is fully aware of the national and
worldwide importance of the development of nuclear power for peaceful purposes
in accordance with the policies expressed by the Congress in the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954. These include the promotion of world peace, improvement of the
"Holdmg Company Act Rclease No 13200,June 15, 1956.

general welfare, increase in the standard of living, and strengthening of free
competition in private enterprise.
We do not believe that the Public Utility Holding Company Act, as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, should deter private enterprise from going forward with nuclear power projects.
We believe that nuclear
reactors for the generation of electricity can be developed and ultimately incorporated into the electric utility industry in a manner consistent with the principles
and standards of the Holding Company Act.

With minor exceptions, rule U-50 requires competitive bidding in
connection with the issuance or sale of securities by registered holding
companies and their subsidiaries. In the fiscal year 1953, the Commission undertook a study as to whether competitive bidding should
be imposed as a condition to the exemption afforded by section 6
(b) of the Act. On November 25, 1953, the Commission published
a notice of a proposed amendment to rule U-50 which would exempt
from the competitive bidding requirements of the rule securities issued
by public utility subsidiaries of registered holding companies if such
issues had been expressly authorized by a State commission." Extensive written comments on the proposal were received and public
hearings on the matter were held in March 1954. No further action
on the proposal was taken and on July 2, 1956, the Commission announced its decision not to adopt the proposed amendment to rule
U-50.79
RELATIONSHIPS

WITH STATE PUBLIC UTILITY

COMMISSIONS

The long established policy of the Commission is to cooperate to
the fullest extent possible with State and local regulatory authorities
in all matters where their respective jurisdictions complement each
other and in all other instances where such cooperation is desirable
and appropriate. This policy was carried forward with renewed
effectiveness in 1956. The underlying objective of the Holding Company Act is to free operating electric and gas utility companies from
the control of absentee and uneconomic holding companies and to
provide effective supervision over those regional integrated holding
company systems which will continue in operation subject to tho Act
following compliance with the integration and corporate simplification
provisions of section 11 (b) of the Act, thereby permitting more effective regulation of operating utility companies by the States and
municipalities in which they operate.
This fundamental concept is inherent in the basic policies set out in
the preamble of the Act. In section 1 (a) it is stated that: "Publicutility holding companies and their subsidiary companies are affected
with a national public interest in that, among other things, * * *
their activities extending over many States are not susceptible of
effective control by any State and make difficult, if not impossible,
effective State regulation of public-utility companies."

In section 1 (b) of the Act, Congress enumerated the serious abuses
in public utility holding company financing and operations which it
had found to exist and expressly stated that it was the policy of the Act,
in accordance with which all other sections of the statute were to be
construed, to meet the problems and eliminate the evils described.
Among the abuses enumerated are several expressed references to
obstructions to State regulation: (1) the issuance of securities by
holding companies and other companies in holding company systems
without the approval or consent of the States having jurisdiction over
subsidiary public-utility companies; (2) the issuance of securities bj
subsidiary public-utility companies under circumstances which subject
those companies to the burden of supporting overcapitalized financial
structures and tend to prevent voluntary rate reductions; (3) the
allocation of service company charges among subsidiary public-utility
companies in different States so as to present problems of regulation
which cannot be dealt with effectively by the States; and (4) the
control of the accounting practices and rate, dividend and other
policies of subsidiary public-utility companies so as to obstruct State
regulation.s"
This policy fostering cooperation with State regulatory authorities
finds direct expression in a number of other sections of the Act. For
example, section 6 (b) directs the Commission to exempt from the requiremen ts of section 7 an issuance and sale of securi ties which has been
expressly authorized by a State commission of the State in which the
issuer is both organized and doing business and where the issuance of
the securities is solely for the purpose of financing the issuer's business.
In granting an exemption pursuant to section 6 (b), however, the
Commission is empowered to impose such terms and conditions as it
deems appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
.. Tbe abuses set fortb m sec. 1 (b) of the Act are as follows
"(I) When such investors cannot obtain the mformatlon necessary to appraise the financial position or
earning power of tbe issuers, because of the absence of umform standard accounts; when such sccunnes are
issued WIthout the approval or consent of the States having [unsdicnon over subsrdiary publtc-utrltty companies; wben such seeurrties arc ISSuedupon tbc basis of fietttious or unsound asset values having no fair

voluntary rate reductions;
"(2) When subsidiary publtc-utllity companies are subjected to excessive charges for services, construetlon work, equipment, and materials, or enter Into transactions in which evils result from an absence of

investors and consumers-a reservation which is essential to coordinate
properly the financing practices of subsidiaries and their holding
company parents so as to safeguard the overall financial integrity of
the holding company system. In all instances where a State Commission has indicated an interest in the subject matter, the Commission
has followed the regular practice of communicating with the State
commission to discuss the issues raised by the proposal and to cooperate with it in settling the questions presented.
In this connection, the President of the National Association of
Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, in addressing the Association's
sixty-eighth annual convention in San Francisco in July 1956, stated:
Supervision over the issuance of securities by intrastate utilities is an important
function and in most jurisdictions such financing must be passed upon by State
commissions. In many important cases, the proposed financing is also reviewed
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In this important area of dual
regulation our relations with the Federal agency are harmonious.

In its enforcement of the geographical integration and corporate
simplification provisions of section 11 (b) of the Act, in which area the
Commission's jurisdiction is exclusive, interested State commissions
are always notified of all developments and are given the privilege of
participating as parties in proceedings whenever they so request.
The Commission endeavors to defer to the wishes of State commissions in such cases to the extent permitted by the requirements of
section 11, as interpreted by the Commission and by the courts.
Certain security and utility asset acquisitions similarly are exempted under section 9 (b) where they have been approved by a State
commission. Moreover, the Commission may not authorize security
issues (sec. 7 (gÂ» or the acquisition of assets (sec. 10 (I) unless
applicable State laws have been complied with. Section 8 prevents
the ownership of both electric and gas utility properties in violation
of State law, and section 20 (b) requires that accounting standards
established by the Commission shall not be inconsistent with the
provisions of applicable State law.
Other provisions of the Act reflect the congressional intent that the
Commission's work be coordinated with the work of State commissions.
Section 19 expressly provides that in any proceeding before it, the
Commission shall admit as a party any interested State, State commission, municipality or any political subdivision of the State. In
accordance with this provision the Commission regularly notifies all
interested State commissions of any proceedings before it which may
affect the work of such commission.
A number of specific sections of the Act look toward action by the
Commission and State commissions on a cooperative basis. Section
18 authorizes the Commission to make available to State commissions
information obtained in the course of its investigations under the

TWENTY-SECOND

ANKUAL REPORT

169

Act and also places the investigatory powers of the Commission at
the disposal of State commissions. Section 13 (d) empowers the
Commission, upon the request of a State commission, to require
after notice and opportunity for hearing, the revision or elimination
of inequitable servicing arrangements among the member companies
of a 'mutual service company. Section 13 (g), which authorizes the
Commission to conduct investigations and make recommendations
with respect to servicing arrangements, directs that such recommendations be made available to State commissions.
An excellent example of cooperation with State commissions is
described in the Commission's order 81 and Findings and Opinion,"
issued on July 29, 1955, and July 20, 1955, respectively, approving
a proposal for the issuance and sale to institutional investors of
$97,500,000 principal amount First Mortgage Pipeline Bonds by
American Louisiana Pipe Line Co., an interstate natural gas pipeline
subsidiary of American Natural Gas Co., a registered holding company. The company also proposed the sale of $20,000,000 of common
stock of its parent. The purpose of the financing was to obtain
funds to construct a new pipeline that would connect Louisiana gulf
coast gas fields with the system's facilities at points near Detroit and
Bridgman, Mich. In support of their proposal, applicants represented
that the new facilities would relieve an existing natural gas shortage
in the States of Wisconsin and Michigan.
Appearances in the proceedings before the Commission were entered
by the attorney general of the State of Wisconsin, the Public Service
Commission of Wisconsin, the Michigan Public Service Commission,
and the Corporation Counsel for the city of Detroit, Mich. Interested
local gas companies also entered appearances and all of the parties
participated actively in the hearings.
One of the two main issues raised bv the proposal was whether the
redemption provisions of the indenture securing the bonds were in
conflict with established policies and precedents set forch by the
Commission in similar cases. The prices at which the bonds could
be redeemed for general purposes began at 104X percent. However,
in the event the bonds were to be redeemed for the purpose of refunding at a lower interest rate, the prices at which the bonds could be
called started at 115 percent, with declining prices in subsequent years.
This latter provision gave the Commission considerable concern since
it rendered refunding by the issuer improbable for several years and
appeared to be in conflict with the established requirement of the
Commission that senior securities be fully redeemable at the option
of the issuing company upon the payment of a reasonable premium.

SECURITIES

COMMISSION

The Wisconsin Public Service Commission took the position that
if the reduction of the redemption premiums through renegotiation
of the bond indenture provisions with the prospective purchasers
could not be accomplished without undue delay, or if progress on the
pipeline would be seriously impaired or obstructed thereby, the
financing should be approved. The city of Detroit and the Michigan
Public Service Commission urged the Commission to approve the
financing as proposed and not to jeopardize the pipeline by requiring
a further renegotiation of the redemption premiums. They stated
that delay in the construction of the line would have an ad verse effect
on a great number of consumers in urgent need of natural gas. The
Cotnmission, giving weight to the views expressed by the State and
local regulatory bodies on behalf of the urgent consumer interests
present in the case, approved the financing proposal without imposing
terms or conditions, although it reaffirmed its policy against nonredeemable features or excessively high call premiums in senior
securities, citing the Congressional policy against "lack of economies
in the raising of capital" set forth in section 1 (b) (5) of the Act.
Another issue confronting the Commission arose out of the company's application for exemption of the proposed hond issue from the
competitive bidding requirements of rule U-50. The Commission
granted the exemption, but expressed concern over the limited extent
to which competitive conditi.ons had been maintained in negotiations
for the sale of the bonds. The record of the proceedings showed that
the pipeline company had entered into the bond purchase agreement
with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and that a small participation was given to the Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York. The
proposed sale was not discussed with any other prospective purchasers.
In its opinion, the Commission stated that it recognized the activity
of Metropolitan Life in the field of pipeline construction financing,
but felt that more than one major source of funds for a "Soundpipeline
enterprise might be found. In conclusion, it pointed out that in the
future the Commission will expect, as a condition to obtaining an
exception from rule U-50, that an issuer give evidence that it has
discussed its issue with a reasonable number of prospective purchasers.
In addition to the specific cases in which the Commission and its
staff have had occasion to cooperate or to coordinate their efforts
with those of State commissions, the Commission has participated
actively in the work of the National Association of Railroad and
Utilities Commissi.oners since the Holding Company Act became law
in 1935. All members of the Commission, its Secretarv and its general counsel have been members of the Association continuously
throughout the period. In all but 2 years a member of the Commission has served on the Executive Committee of the Association.

PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE NATIONAL
BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED

!

;.
I'

i,

.

t,

'

Chapter X of the N ationalIBankruptcy Act provides a procedure
for reorganizing corporations in the United States District Courts.
The Commission's duties under Chapter X are to provide independent
expert assistance to the court and investors on the various legal and
financial questions that arise in the proceeding, and to prepare reports
on plans of reorganization. The Commission acts in an advisory
capacity only and generally participates in proceedings in which there
is a substantial public investor interest.
Under section 208 of Chapter X, the Commission is required to file
a notice of appearance in a Chapter X proceeding if so requested by
the judge of the court. The Commission may file a notice of appearance upon its own motion if approved by the judge of the court.
Upon the filing of the notice, the Commission is deemed to be a party
in interest with the right to be heard on all matters. The Commission
has no right of appeal in a Chapter X proceeding, but it may participate in appeals taken by others.
Section 172 of Chapter X provides that if the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor does not exceed $3,000,000, the judge may, before
approving any plan, submit such plan to the Commission for its
examination and report. If the indebtedness exceeds $3,000,000, the
judge must submit the plan to the Commission before he may approve
it. The Commission is not obligated to file a report, and it has no
authority either to veto or to require the adoption of a plan of reorganization or to render a decision on any other issue in the proceeding.
Its recommendations are made for the benefit of the court and the
security holders, affording them its disinterested views in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission participated during 1956 in 33 proceedings involving the reorganization of 52 companies with aggregate stated assets of
$455,136,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $324,036,000.
During the year the Commission, with court approval, filed notices of
appearances in 6 new proceedings under Chapter X involving companies with aggregate stated assets of $15,578,000 and aggregate
172

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

173

stated indebtedness of $16,837,000. Proceedings involving 4 principal
debtor corporations were closed during the year. At the end of the
year, the Commission was actively participating in 29 reorganization
proceedings involving 48 companies with aggregate stated assets of
$344,564,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $318,344,000.
Timing of Participation

Usually the Commission does not enter a case until the court has
approved the petition for reorganization. However, section 208 of
Chapter X, which authorizes the appearance of the Commission, either
at the request of the court or upon the Commission's own motion if
granted by the court, does not require the Commission to wait until
approval of the petition. Developments in a particular case may
impel the Commission to move to appear as soon as practicable, without awaiting approval of the petition.
In August 1954 an involuntary petition under Chapter X was filed
by certain creditors against Hudson &: Manhaitam. Railroad Co. in the
United States District Court, Southern District of New York, and,
after the company had moved to dismiss the proceeding, it filed an
answer admitting that it was unable to pay its debts as they mature.
The court thereupon approved the creditors' petition and appointed
a trustee.' Thereafter a stockholder filed an answer denying that the
debtor was unable to pay its debts as they mature. Subsequently,
the company filed an amended answer and the court at this point
requested the Commission to file its appearance, which the Commission did. Although the company had originally filed an answer consenting to reorganization under Chapter X, the company petitioned
the court in March 1955 for leave to file a contrary answer. The
court denied this petition. A hearing was then held on the issue of
_whether the debtor was unable to pay its debts as they mature and
the court affirmed its approval of the involuntary petition on the
ground that efforts to refinance the debtor's bonds, which matured
in 2~ years, "had been abandoned as fruitless" * * * and "to insist
on further liquidation to a point of actual default would be to ignore
the purpose of Chapter X, which contemplates court intervention
while there is still some hope of survival through readjustment of
fixed obligations." 2 A further ground for the court's holding that
the debtor was unable to pay its obligations as they mature was the
fact that it was paying its current obligations by a process of liquidation inconsistent with its continuation as a going business.
The foregoing determinations of the district court were in accord
with views expressed by the Commission, and were affirmed by the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit."

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Generally the Commission participates only in proceedings in
which there is a substantial public investor interest. However, there
are many cases which, while-the value of assets and numbers of investors involved do not appear to warrant participation as a party
by the Commission, nevertheless appear to require continuous and
careful observation. In these cases, the Commission makes suggestions to the trustee and the parties and occasionally submits briefs
or reports.
One such case pending during 1956 was the reorganization of
Horsting Oil Co. The trustees appointed by the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, filed an amended plan of
reorganization based upon the issuance of additional shares of stock
and all of the present stockholders were to be given the right to
subscribe to the stock in proportion to their present holdings. One
of the principal stockholders, who had been the debtor's executive
vice president, agreed to subscribe to all shares not taken by other
stockholders. Before the amended plan was acted upon by the
court, this principal stockholder had been found guilty of making
false and misleading representations in soliciting sales of fractional
interests for the company. The Commission advised the trustees of
the fact that this stockholder had been convicted of violations of the
Securities Act of 1933 and also called their attention to the fact
that the plan would leave this stockholder in control of the reorganized
company. The trustees did not withdraw from their sponsorship of
the amended plan and the Commission filed its appearance in the
proceeding in order that it might be in a position to object to the
plan.
Examinations and Reports on Plans of Reorganization

During 1956 the Commission issued two supplemental advisory
reports in the consolidated reorganization proceedings involving Inland
Gas Corp., Kentucky Fuel Gas Corp., and American Fuel & Power Co.
These supplemental reports were issued as a result of the submission
to the Commission by the United States District Court, Eastern
District of Kentucky, of an amended plan of reorganization for these
debtors. TIllS plan, identified as the trustee's plan, provided for the
sale of certain physical properties and materials and supplies of
Inland Gas Corp. and three of the American Fuel & Power Co's.
subsidiaries. The Commission found the trustee's plan, as finally
amended, fair and equitable and feasible, and it was approved by
the court and accepted by one of two classes of affected security
holders but rejected by the other class. The court subsequently
issued an order denying confirmation of this plan, because of the
existence of a tax question and because it provided for payment to

TWENTY-SECOND

unsecured creditors of interests accrued on the principal amounts
of their claims from the date of filing of the Chapter X petition.
This order has been appealed.
The district court also found unworthy of consideration a plan
submitted by a creditor providing for an internal reorganization of
the debtor, holding that the plan was neither fair nor feasible and
provided for "heavy indebtedness."
This order was also appealed.
These two appeals are now pending before the United States Court
of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, 4 and the Commission has taken the position in that court that the district court properly refused to confirm
the trustee's plan because the plan had not been accepted by the
creditors affected thereby and an internal reorganization plan appears
to be available which would eliminate the tax question. The Commission also contends that the district court should have submitted
the creditor's plan providing for an internal reorganization to the
Commission for examination and report. It asserts that the fact
that a plan appears to have features which are unfair or unfeasible
does not necessarily make it unworthy of consideration since often
the improper features are not of the essence of the plan and might be
subsequently corrected. As to the district court's objection to
"heavy indebtedness," the Commission contends that with respect
to questions of feasibility, which involve a financial judgment to the
future, it was intended by Congress that the Commission's analysis
should be made available to courts and investors.
A very important issue in both appeals involves the question whether
public holders of unsecured debt may be deprived of postreorganization interest. The Commission contends that the statutory
limitations of section 63a of the Bankruptcy Act, which sets forth
the types of debts that may be proved and allowed in bankruptcy,
do not apply in Chapter X. It further contends that the barring of
postreorganization interest to public holders of unsecured debt in
the circumstances of this case is improper since the surplus would be
distributed to a creditor whose holdings were subordinated by reason
of its inequitable conduct towards the public holders of unsecured
debt of the debtor.
During 1956 a plan of reorganization proposed by the trustee of
Third Avenue Transit Corp. and its subsidiaries was submitted to
the Commission for examination and report. The Commission concluded that the plan was not feasible in light of the debtor's history
and the risks inherent in its business because the consolidated debt
ratio proposed for the reorganized company was in the Commission's
opinion grossly excessive. The Commission, therefore, recommended

that consideration be given to amending the plan to eliminate proposed new income debentures and substitute new common stock
therefor, to improve the sinking fund for proposed new bonds that
were to be issued, and to provide for the merger of Third Avenue
and its principal operating subsidiary, Surface Transportation Co.,
Inc. As to fairness, the Commission concluded that the plan would
be fair to all classes of creditors and security holders if it were amended
to provide for more effective competition for the underwriting of the
new securities to be!issued by the reorganized company, to provide
for more equitable provisions respecting the composition of the initial
board of directors, and to eliminate provisions for settlement of claims
against former officers and directors of Third Avenue unless based
upon valid consideration. In a supplemental report to the district
court on the amendments to the plan submitted by the trustee, the
Commission expressed the view that the plan was still unfeasible in
that the proposed amendments failed to meet the basic objections
expressed by the Commission in its advisory report.
Through the assistance of the Commission's staff a ne-w plan of
reorganization was worked out. The trustee withdrew his earlier
plan and, jointly with an adjustment bondholders' committee, sponsored a plan which provided for the merger of Third Avenue and its
principal operating subsidiary and for the issuance by the new company of new first mortgage bonds and common stock. All of the
new common stock would be acquired by Fifth Avenue Coach Lines,
Inc., in consideration for which it would issue to the trustee shares
of its own common stock and cash. Under the plan the refunding
bondholders of Third Avenue were treated substantially the same as
in the earlier plan except that the sinking fund was appropriately
strengthened.
The adjustment bondholders were afforded substantially better treatment under the new plan. The Commission
reported to the district court in a second supplemental report that
the joint plan was fair and equitable and feasible. Later in approving
the plan, the court commended the Commission and the N ew York
Public Service Commission for their assistance."
Activities With Respect to Allowances

The Commission has taken an active part in the matter of allowance of compensation for those claiming to have rendered services
and incurred expenses in Chapter X proceedings. In making allowances the court seeks to protect the estate from exorbitant charges,
â€¢ In the court's opiruon Judge Dimock stated:
"The plan, down to the minutest detail, has been discussed and approved in the reports of the New York
Public Service Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It would be presumptuous for
me to attempt to add everything to the analysis of these experts. I have nothing but praise for the widsom
of the legislation wlneh gave the court the benefit of their participation and nothing but gratttude for the
enormous amount of work done by these two bodies on very demanding schedules as the court submitted
plan after plan and amendment after amendment to them." In the Matter of Third Aoenue Trall.rit Corp.

at the same time providing equitable treatment to the applicants.
The Commission receives no allowances from estates in reorganization
and is able to present a wholly disinterested and impartial view. In
each case in which the Commission participates it makes a careful
study of the applications of the various parties to the end that unnecessary duplication of services shall not be compensated and that
compensation shall be allotted on the basis of the work done by each
claimant and of his relative contribution to the administration of
the estate and the formulation of a plan.
A significant decision involving allowances was rendered during
1956 in the Central States Electric Corp. reorganization in the United
States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia." The trustees
appointed by the court had brought an action in the United States
District Court, Southern District of N ew York, against former
officers and directors of the debtor and others. This action was
ultimately unsuccessful and certain of the defendants made application to the District Court in New York for allowance of expense and
attorneys' fees pursuant to article 6A of the N ew York General
Corporation Law, which provides for indemnification of officers and
directors of litigation expenses under certain conditions. The United
States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, reversed and directed,
dismissal of the N ew York District Court's order assessing expenses
and attorneys' fees against the debtor in favor of the former officers
and directors." The basis of the reversal was that jurisdiction concerning such allowances was in the reorganization court in Virginia.
Thereafter, attorneys for certain of the defendants in the prior action
applied to the reorganization court seeking compensation. One of
the grounds relied on was the contention that the attorneys' services
in defending the directors advanced or benefited the reorganization
proceeding in thai, termination of the litigation was necessary for the
final disposition of the reorganization proceeding. The Commission
was an active participant in the reorganization from the outset and
urged that the petition be denied. The reorganization court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the N ew York General
Corporation Law was not binding upon it and that counsel for the
defendants, seeking to avoid liability for certain claims asserted by
the trustees, did not contribute anything to the reorganization.
An appeal has been filed by the unsuccessful applicants in the United
States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit." The matter was pending
at the close of the fiscal year .

Activitieli Under Chapter

XI

Section 328 of Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides that the
Commission may apply to the district court for dismissal of a Chapter
XI proceeding when it believes that the case properly belongs under
Chapter X. The question of whether Chapter X or Chapter XI is the
appropriate statutory proceeding for the financial rehabilitation of a
corporation in a particular case is one which has arisen with increasing
frequency in recent years. This problem was illustrated in the recent
decision of the United States Supreme Court in the General Stores
Corporation case, where the court considered whether Chapter X or
Chapter XI was available for relief of the corporation involved."
General Stores Corporation's publicly held securities consisted of over
2,000,000 shares of $1 par value common stock owned by more than
7,000 widely scattered shareholders. It had no other publicly held
securities. For some years General Stores (formerly D. A. Schulte,
Inc.) operated a chain of tobacco stores. After a reorganization under
section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act in 1940 and a few years of prosperity, substantial losses caused a new management to be installed. It
decided to abandon the existing business and to have the corporation
acquire the stock of two drug chains. In October 1954 General Stores
filed a petition under Chapter XI in the United States District Court,
Southern District of New York, proposing an arrangement extending
its unsecured obligations. The court granted motions of the Commission and a stockholder to dismiss the Chapter XI proceedings 10 and
this decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals,
Second Circuit."
The Supreme Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari 12
filed by the corporation and, with two Justices dissenting, affirmed
the Court of Appeals' decision holding that "the lower court took a
fair reading of c. X and the functions it served and reasonably concluded" that General Stores Corporation "needed a more pervasive
reorganization than is available under c. XL" 13 Accordingly, it
found that the district court's "exercise of discretion" did not transcend "the allowable bounds." Following the decision of the Supreme
Court, General Stores filed a voluntary petition under Chapter X.
The Supreme Court disagreed with the Commission's contention
that public ownership of the debtor's securities is the determinative
factor. The court recognized that in most cases where the debtor's
securities are publicly held Chapter X might well afford the more
appropriate remedy but stated that neither the character of the
debtor nor its capital structure is controlling. The essential criterion

is the needs to be served. To the extent that the Supreme Court did
not lay down absolute criteria in the General Stores case, an area of
uncertainty remains as to the choice of remedies by a corporation in
need of debtor relief. The question of determining whether the Commission should move to dismiss a Chapter XI petition will necessitate
an extensive examination of the facts in each particular case.
Subsequent to the Supreme Court's decision in the General Stores
case the United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, affirmed the
decision of the United States District Court, Western District of
Michigan, refusing to dismiss a Chapter XI proceeding involving
Wilcox-Gay Corporation and referred to the Supreme Court's pronouncement in the General Stores case "that the District Judge * * *
was privileged to exercise * * * sound diseretion'U'
The Commission did not seek a writ of certiorari.
Where there are indications of misdeeds by management, Chapter
X appears to provide the appropriate proceeding for the needs to be
served. Accordingly the Commission moved for dismissal of a petition filed in the United States District Court, Western District of
Washington, by Alaska Telephone Corp. under Chapter XI, because
the circumstances of the case called for an investigation into the
existence of possible causes of action against the management and the
underwriters.
The Chapter XI petition disclosed that Alaska's
$71,600 of outstanding debentures were held by approximately 1,300
investors residing at a great distance from the company's operations
and offices and from the forum of the court proceeding. Shortly after
the Commission's motion, Alaska consented to
under Chapter X
and the district court approved the petition."
In another case arising before the decision in the General Stores
case, a motion by the Commission to dismiss a proceeding brought by
Liberty Baking Corp. for an arrangement under Chapter XI was
denied by the United States District Court, Southern District of
New York." Of Liberty's outstanding debt securities, 65 percent,
amounting to $1,031,820, is in the hands of public investors; the
entire issue of presently outstanding preferred stock and 20 percent
of Liberty's common stock are also publicly held. The Commission
has appealed the district court's decision, contending that the Chapter
XI arrangement in this case does not accord public debenture holders
fair and equitable treatment because these security holders are not
fully compensated while stockholders are accorded participation under
the plan. The Commission contends that the district court erred in
permitting the debtor to utilize Chapter XI.

ADMINISTRATION

OF TIlE TRUST INDENTURE ACT
OF 1939

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which meets
the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with the Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified include
specified provisions which provide means by which the rights of holders
of securities issued under such indentures may be protected and
enforced. These provisions relate to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable
financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests. The
Act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all
liability of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after
default, the duty to use the same degree of care and skill "in the
exercise of the lights and powers invested in it by the indenture" as
a prudent man would use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act,
and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must
be contained in the registration statement.
In the case of securities
issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and securities issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority which, although exempted from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the
Trust Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the
qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required
information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

Section 304 (d) of the Act permits an exemption from anyone or
more provisions of the Act in the case of corporations organized and
existing under the laws of a foreign government if and to the extent
the Commission finds that compliance with such provision or provisions is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of
investors. During the year certain German corporations filed applications pursuant to this provision for exemption from the provisions
of the Act requiring that the rights, powers, duties and obligations
under the indenture be conferred upon an American Institutional
Trustee alone or jointly with a German cotrustee except under certain circumstances.' These applications were made in connection
with the issuance of debt adjustment bonds by such corporations
under offers of settlement made pursuant to the London Agreement
on German External Debts of February 27, 1953, between the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States of America and other
countries. It was the contention of the corporations that the vesting of title and related powers in the German cotrustee was essential
to the orderly settlement and payment of the obligations, in that the
bondholders' rights in the security were rights in German property,
created under German mortgage laws and to a large extent dependent
upon the interpretation of the German laws implementing the London
Agreement, and that the rights in the security should be adjudicated
only by German courts. While the vesting of title to the security
in the cotrustee necessarily results in certain acts (relating to the
release of property, the reduction of the registered amount of liens
and the disposition of release moneys) being performable by the cotrustee, any such action is subject to ultimate control by the American
Institutional Trustee if such control is exercised within 30 days after
notice of the proposed action by the cotrustee.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT
OF 1940

COMPANY

ACT

The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of companies engaged primarily in the business of
investing, reinvesting, holding and trading in securities.
The Act
requires, among other things, disclosure of the finances and investment policies of these companies, prohibits such companies from changing the nature of their business or their investment policies without
the approval of their stockholders, regulates the means of custody of
the companies' assets, prohibits underwriters, investment bankers,
and brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors
of such companies, requires management contracts to be submitted to
security holders for their approval, prohibits transactions between
such companies and their officers, directors and affiliates except with
the approval of the Commission, and regulates the issuance of senior
securities.
The Act requires face-amount certificate companies to
maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their
certificates.
COMPANIES REGISTERED

UNDER THE ACT

As of June 30, 1956, there were 399 investment companies registered
under the Act, and it is estimated that on that date the aggregate
value of their assets was approximately $14 billion. This represents
an increase of approximately $2 billion over the corresponding total
at June 30, 1955. These companies were classified as follows:

REPORT

The classification of two management closed-end registered investment companies was changed to management open-end companies
during the year.
The new management investment companies registered under the
Act during the year subscribed to a wide variety of investment
objectives. Five of these companies were organized for the purpose of
emphasizing investment in industrial companies engaged in various
phases of automation, several others for investment in the securities
of life insurance companies, and several for investments in so-called
"special situations."
For the first time an investment company
organized'iin Hawaii registered under the Act in order to make its
shares available for sale in the continental United States. Each of
the nine unit investment companies registered during the year was
organized to operate periodic payment plans for the purchase of the
common stock of a single specified industrial corporation or shares of
other investment companies.

STUDY OF SIZE OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

Under section 14 (b) "The Commission is authorized, at such times
as it deems that any substantial further increase in size of investment
companies creates any problem involving the protection of investors
or the public interest, to make a study and investigation of the effects

184

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of size on the investment policy of investment companies and on security markets, on concentration of control of wealth and industry, and
on companies in which investment companies are interested, and from
time to time to report the results of its studies and investigations and
its recommendations to the Congress." This provision has been in
effect since the adoption of the Act, but no study or investigation has
been made.
With funds made available by the Congress in its 1956 and 1957
fiscal year appropriations the' Commission has commenced a study
under this section of the Act. The great expansion in the aggregate
assets of investment companies registered under the Investment
Company Act, from approximately $2.5 billion in 1941 to the present
total of approximately $14 billion, the rapid growth in size in recent
years of investment companies, and the growing significance of investment companies as holders of equity securities traded in the market
are some of the reasons for such a study. As the first step, the Commission has retained the services of Prof. Paul F. Wendt, professor of
finance at the University of California (Berkeley), and two associates
on the faculty, James E. Walter and James R. Longstreet, to report
on a program for research and study for the Commission. When
this necessary groundwork has been completed the Commission hopes
to be in a position to determine the statistical and other data which
may be relevant, and the methods to be used in obtaining them.
CURRENT INFORMATION

The basic information disclosed in notifications of registration and
registration statements is required by rules promulgated under the
statute to be kept up to date, except in the case of certain inactive
unit trusts or face-amount companies. During the 1956 fiscal year the

APPLICATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

One of the functions of the Commission in its regulation of investment companies is to determine whether applications for exemption
filed under various provisions of the Act may be granted pursuant to
the statutory standards.
Under section 6 (c) of the Act, the Commission is empowered, either upon its own motion or by order upon
application, to exempt any person, security or transaction from any
provision of the Act if and to the extent such exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Various other sections, such as 6 (d), 9 (b), 10 (f),

TWENTY-SECOND

185

ANNUAL REPORT

11 (a), 17 (b), and 23 (c) contain specific provisions and standards
pursuant to which the Commission may grant exemptions from
particular sections of the Act or may approve certain types of transactions.
During 1956 a total of 172 applications of various types were pending before the Commission, of which 115 were disposed of, leaving
57 pending on June 30, 1956. Thirty-three of the 128 applications
filed during the fiscal year were for general exemptions, 24 for orders
terminating registrations, 33 for orders under section 17 of the Act
permitting transactions between investment companies and affiliates,
and 38 for other relief. The various sections of the Act under which
these applications were filed, and their disposition during the fiscal

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Of the matters considered by the Commission pursuant to formal
applications filed under a particular section of the Act, those arising
under section 17 (a) and (b) of the Act requiring a determination of
the fairness of transactions between affiliates are generally the most
difficult and complex. The Atlas Corp. and the International Mining
Corp. matters are two examples, both of which involved the merger
of affiliated companies in which it was necessary to value securities
of diverse types for the purpose of assuring their equitable allocation
among public security holders of the merging companies. In the
Investors Diversified Services, Inc., matter, that company was under
common control with Atlantic Life Insurance Co. and Life Companies,
Inc., and sought to exchange its holdings of preferred stock in one
of these insurance companies for that of the other and to purchase
additional shares. The Commission granted the requested exemptions
in the foregoing cases upon finding that the transactions were fair
and reasonable and involved no overreaching. The North River case
involved the purchase of the assets 0'Â£ real estate companies and the
securities of a wholesale hardware company from affiliated persons.
This matter was pending at the end of the year.
Matters involving affiliated transactions as to which no hearing
was necessary included (i) the purchase by an affiliate from an investment company of the control of a business development eompanyj"
(ii) the exchange by two investment companies of the second mortgage bonds of an affiliated industrial company for its debentures and
common stock warrants; 10 and (iii) the surrender of securities by a
company controlled by an investment company to an affiliated company in partial liquidation and the receipt of cash and other securities
therefor. 11
Another important activity under tbe Investment Company Act
relates to questions and proceedings arising under sections 3 and 6
as to whether a company is required to register under the Act or
whether a company is entitled to an exemption from any or all the
provisions of the Act. Much of this work is accomplished by correspondence and by conference. In the B. S. F. Co. matter mentioned
above, which was pending at the close of the fiscal year, and in Real
Silk Hosiery Mills, Inc.,12 formal hearings were held to determine the
claims of these companies that they were primarily engaged in a business other than that of an investment company. In addition, the
Commission has instituted injunctive proceedings against the Variable
Annuity Life Insurance Company oj America alleging that it is an
investment company required to register under the Act. An alternaâ€¢ Amn'ican Rueurch <l' Dtflelopmenl Co., Investment Company Act Release No. 22M (November 3,1955).

matter is discussed more fully hereinafter under Litigation.

investment company from adopting a deceptive or misleading name
or implying that the company or its securities have been recommended or approved by the United States or an agency or officer
thereof. The Private Investment Fund for Governmental Personnel,
Inc., mentioned above, involved both of these aspects of section 35,
including an issue of possible confusion in name with an existing insurance company. Hearings in this matter have been held, the case
was argued before the Commission and the matter was pending at
the close of the fiscal year. In the Atomic, Chemical & Electronic
Shares, Inc., case, two established existing investment companies
claimed that because of similarity of names with a proposed investment company the public would be misled as to the identities of the
companies. The matter, after being noticed for hearing, was settled
by a change in the name of the new company.
Due perhaps to the increase in recent years in the number of investment companies and the highly competitive nature of the industry,
there appears to be a growing tendency to adopt corporate names containing some special sales appeal by implying that its securities have
particular investment characteristics or that the company invests in
a particular industry. Such names may be misleading and deceptive
unless the investment policies of the company offer reasonable assurance that the implications of the name will be realized. In numerous
instances during the year the Commission settled such problems
administratively by requiring either a modification of the name or
the conformance of the company's investment policy to the representations implicit in the name.
Some transactions involving investment companies, while important and complicated, do not require a filing under the statute by the
investment company or any affiliated person. Nevertheless, these
matters are scrutinized by reason of the Commission's responsibilities
under sections 25 and 36 of the Act to bring court proceedings if it
believes that proposed transactions in reorganizations are grossly
unfair or that management has committed a "gross abuse of trust."
An important example of this type of matter which arose in 1956
involved the proposal of an investment company to repurchase a
substantial number of its outstanding shares of preferred stock on the
market with cash on hand. The stock was entitled to accumulated
dividend arrears for a considerable number of years, although in
recent years the current dividends had been more than earned and
had been paid. These excess earnings which might have been used
to reduce the dividend arrears had instead been retained by the

company although admittedly not needed in the business. It appeared inequitable to the Commission that such funds, on which all
the preferred stockholders had an equitable claim, be used to buyout
a few preferred stockholders. This was particularly true since the
market price of the stock was substantially less than its liquidating
value as well as its redemption price and the benefits arising from such
a use of the funds would redound essentially to the common stock
and not the remaining preferred stockholders. After the Commission's views had been brought to the company's attention, the repurchase program was abandoned.
Alleghany Corp.

The question of Alleghany Corp.'s status as an investment company and the litigation in connection therewith is described in detail
at pages 101-102 of the Commission's 21st Annual Report. Since
that report Alleghany's status has been resolved for the time being
by its registration as an investment company on December 9, 1955.
On November 18, 1955, a special three judge court of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, upon
complaint of certain Alleghany stockholders, entered an opinion
finding, among other things, that Alleghany was an investment company subject to regulation under the Act and that the Interstate
Commerce Commission had improperly asserted jurisdiction over
Alleghany by orders dated March 2 and May 24, 1955.13 The Interstate Commerce Commission orders, if effective, would have subjected
Alleghany to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act and thus
brought it within the exceptive provisions of section 3 (c) (9) of the
Investment Company Act.
Since the three-judge court found that the Interstate Commerce
Commission either had no jurisdiction over Alleghany or had not
properly exercised it, the court found certain Interstate Commerce
Commission orders of May 26 and June 22, 1955, to be a nullity.
These orders had approved Alleghany's issuance of new convertible
preferred stock in exchange for an outstanding issue of preferred stock
which had a claim on assets of approximately $33,000,000. Having
found Alleghany to be an unregistered investment company on June
23, 1955, the court found the issuance of the new preferred stock on
that day to be unlawful under section 7 of the Investment Company
Act. This section prohibits, among other things, the use of the mails
or means of interstate commerce by an unregistered investment company in effecting security transactions.
13 Bresuiick &: Co. v. u. S. et 01., 138 F. Supp. 123 (1955) In the proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission this Commission had filed memoranda setting forth tho view that Alleghany was prlmanly an Investment company and that accordingly tbe Interstate Commerce Commission should In Its
discretion limit Its jurisdiction to matters relating to any acquisition of a carrier by Allegbany, and that In
other respects Alleghany should be subject to the broader and more comprehensive regulatory provisions ot
the Investment Company Act.

Pursuant to its finding the court entered a final injunction on December 23, 1955, making permanent earlier orders restraining the distribution and transfer of approximately 400,000 shares of the new
convertible preferred stock which was held by the exchange agent for
delivery. The transfer of 900,000 shares of this stock which had
been delivered to the stockholders through the mails on June 23, 1955,
had also been preliminarily enjoined, but Mr. Justice John Marshall
Harlan of the United States Supreme Court stayed the preliminary
injunction in this respect. Trading in the new convertible preferred
stock has been suspended on the stock exchanges since June 1955.
Alleghany and the Interstate Commerce Commission have filed
notices of appeal to the United States Supreme Court from the three.
judge court order of December 23,1955, and the matter is now pending
for argument.
Shortly after Alleghany had registered as an investment company
a number of its preferred and common stockholders, as well as Alleghany itself, filed applications with the Commission seeking an exemption, nunc pro tunc, under section 6 (c) of the Act from the provisions
of section 7 of the Act for the issuance and exchange of the new preferred stock. Objection to the granting of the application was entered
by certain common stockholders, who were the complainants in the
injunctive actions. Extensive public hearings were held and the
matter was pending before the Commission at the end of the fiscalyear.13B
RULES AND REGULATIONS

Section 17 (a) prohibits, with certain exceptions, an affiliate of a
registered investment company from purchasing from, or selling to,
the investment company securities or property. The terms "purchase"
and "sale" as used in this section embrace distributions of various
kinds made by investment companies to their security holders,
sometimes under circumstances in which the evils intended to be
prevented by this section of the Act are not present. To obviate the
burden on the Commission and on the companies involved in filing
and considering certain of these transactions under the exemptive

Corpora/ion,
Investment Company Act Release No. 2446. The Commissron found that the new convertible preferred
stock was a right to purchase, specifically outlawed hy Section 18 (d) of the Investment Company Act,
and not a senior security which would he exempt from Seetion 18 (d). It stated that whether a security
Is a right to purchase "IS not controlled by the nominal designation given the security but is rather appropriately based on a reahstic appraisal of the rights and values attaehmg to It at time of ISsuance", and
pointed out that the preferred stock attributes of the new stock are "clearly subordinate and probably have
an indiscernible influence on Its market value" The Commission concluded that the requested exemption
from the statute could not be granted in view of the difficulties of evaluating the new security that would
be Imposed on investors, both present as well as prospective, to whom the safeguards of the statute extend,
and the fact that It was not able to find on the basis of the record, which was unclear and eonfucting as to
the ultimate value of the new stock, that the exchange offer fell within the range of Iairness.
Commissioner Patterson dissented on the ground that, since the new preferred' stock carried with it a
priority over the common stock as to distribution of assets and payment of dividends, It was a senior security
and therefore specifically exempted by Section 18 (c) (2) from the prohibitions of Section 18, and that the
record showed the exchange offer fen within the permissible range of fairness.

provisions of section 17 (b) of the Act, the Commission on September
28, 1955, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, adopted
its rule N-17A-5 which- provides as follows: "When a company
makes a pro rata distribution in cash or in kind among its common
stockholders without giving any election to any stockholder as to
the specific assets which such stockholder shall receive, such distribution shall not be deemed to involve a sale to or a purchase from
such distributing company as those terms are used in sections 17 (a)
of the Act."
LITIGATION

UNDER THE INVESTMENT

COMPANY ACT OF 1940

Just before the end of the fiscal year the Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
against the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Co. of America, Inc.14
(VALIC) in which it was alleged that the company is issuing securities
which should be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and that
the company, or in the alternative certain funds which it administers,
is an investment company which should be registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. In its answer, VALIC, among
other things, denied that the contracts it is selling are securities and
that it is an investment company. VALIC is one of the first companies to sell to the general public so-called "variable annuities,"
which are widely recognized as a new and novel instrument.
The
company is incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia
pertaining to the incorporation of life insurance companies and is
supervised by the Superintendent of Insurance of the District of
Columbia. Since the filing of the complaint, VALIC has been issued
a license to transact business in the State of West Virginia by the
West Virginia Commissioner of Insurance. VALIC intends to
invest the "net premiums" which it receives from the sale of its
contracts in equity type investments such as common stocks. During
the accumulation period, the purchaser of a contract will be credited
with "accumulation units" representing his interest in the underlying
investments. The value of the "accumulation unit" will increase or
decrease in accordance with the value of the underlying investments.
Prior to the "maturity date," the purchaser may receive the cash
value of his proportionate share of the investments. At "maturity,"
the purchaser has an election to convert his "accumulation units"
into "annuity units" under various options set forth in the contracts.
The number of "annuity units" which a purchaser will receive involves
a mortality factor. Like the "accumulation unit," the "annuity unit"
varies in value in accordance with the underlying investments.
Broadly speaking, the case presents to the Court the questions, inter
alia, of whether the VALIC contracts fall within the exemption of
If

insurance or annuity contracts from registration contained within
section 3 (a) (8) of the Securities Act of 1933 and whether the company's primary and predominant business is the writing of insurance
and thus the company is exempt under section 3 (a) (3) from the
registration provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
RECENT

DEVELOPMENTS

Investment Clubs

A new development relating to the activities of the Commission
under the Investment Company Act is the rapid growth in recent years
of so-called investment clubs. While no firsthand information is
available as to the number of such clubs in existence or the number of
people involved, officials of a federation of approximately 1,700 clubs
with approximately 23,000 members, estimate there are about 15,000
investment clubs in existence involving about 200,000 persons.
An investment club, generally speaking, is an investment company
in miniature, formed by a small group of persons. The typical investment club consists of approximately 15 persons organized under a
partnership arrangement, although some are organized as corporations. Periodically, specific amounts in the form of dues are paid to
one member designated as secretary or treasurer by all members and
the proceeds are pooled and invested in stocks. The investments
are held in the name of the club or of one of the members. All members
share equally in profits and losses and may withdraw their pro rata
share of the club's net asset value upon notice and at certain times.
Usually there is no paid officer or investment adviser, although increasing interest has been shown by various brokerage houses in counseling clubs on their investments. Various stocks are discussed at
periodic meetings and investments are made with the consent of the
majority of the members.
The Commission has given consideration to the fact that membership in the club constitutes participation in a "profit sharing agreement" or "investment contract" and thus constitutes a security, and
that the club as such falls within the definition of an investment
company under the Act. However, section 3 (c) (1) of the Act excludes
an investment company which has less than 100 stockholders and
which is "not making and does not propose to make a public offering
of its securities." Since so far as the Commission is aware these
clubs consist of less than 100 members, the central question under the
Act is whether a club is making or proposes to make a public offering
of its membership. If a public offering were involved, registration
under the Securities Act of 1933 would also be required because the
exemptions provided in section 3 (a) (11) of that Act for an intrastate
offering or under regulation A for an offering of $300,000 or less is not
available to investment companies.

192

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Liquidation or Withdrawal Plans

New programs or methods for the sale of mutual fund shares make
their appearance from time to time and require the Commission's
scrutiny. During the past fiscal year there appeared a number of
plans under which a purchaser of open-end investment company
shares may arrange for the redemption of sufficient number of his
shares to provide a fixed dollar monthly repayment until the principal
sum is exhausted. These plans may be misleading to the investor
unless there is a full realization that the monthly repayments he receives represents not only income and capital gains but also a return
of his own capital. Another facet of the problem is the necessity under
the plan of liquidating an investor's shares at times when because of
adverse markets the net asset value of the shares redeemed may be
low. Still another aspect of the problem is the fairness of charging
a full sales commission for the purchase of mutual fund shares when
all or part of the shares purchased are concurrently being redeemed.
These are some of the aspects of this particular sales device which the
Commission is now studying.
Certain Insurance Company Contracts

Late in the fiscal year the Commission's attention was drawn to a
new type of contractual arrangement offered for sale by certain insurance companies in connection with their conventional life insurance
policies. Though varying in detail, they involve essentially the
creation of a separate identifiable fund of common stocks created either
by payments made to the company specifically for such purpose or by
the withholding and investment of dividends payable to the insurance
policyholder. The participant's interest in the fund and its investment results may be absolute or contingent upon his surviving a given
period of years. While certain mortality aspects may be present,
there are no aspects of "risk shifting" such as is present in pure life
insurance, and the contracts are apparently offered solely on an investment basis.
The Commission is investigating the questions whether the registration of contracts of this type is required under the Securities Act of
1933 because the contract is in fact severable from the insurance policy
to which it is appended and constitutes in itself a security, and whether
the fund of common stocks created by the arrangement would under
the Investment Company Act comprise an investment company
required to register under that Act.

PART X
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT
OF 1940

ADVISERS

ACT

Persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising others
with respect to securities are required under the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 to register as investment advisers. Under the Act it is
unlawful for investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud or deceit. The Act also requires investment advisers to
disclose the nature of their interest in transactions which they may
effect for their clients, prohibits profit-sharing arrangements and, for
all practical purposes, prevents the assignment of any investment
advisory contract without the consent of the interested client.
The Investment Advisers Act gives the Commission no power to
inspect the books and records of investment advisers, nor may the
Commission deny or revoke the registration of an investment adviser
except upon the ground that he has been convicted of certain offenses
involving securities or arising out of his conduct as an investment adviser or in certain other financial relationships, or if he has been enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction on the same grounds, or
if he has falsified his application. Violation of the Investment Advisers Act or the Federal securities laws is not a ground for revocation
absent prior conviction or injunction in court. Although the Act
prohibits investment advisers from engaging in practices which amount
to a fraud upon their clients, the lack of effective procedures for the
enforcement of the statute has made it difficult for the Commission
to control the activities of tipsters who make extravagant representations relating to speculative securities. The Commission is currently
considering recomemndations to the Congress for amendments to this
Act which would permit more effective enforcement and greater protection to the investing public.
ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEEDINGS

An application for registration as an investment adviser filed by
Bradford Dorr 1 was denied by the Commission following a proceeding
in which it appeared that the applicant had been permanently enjoined by a United States district court from engaging in and continuing certain conduct and practices in connection with his activity

as an investment adviser and, in answer to a question in his application for registration, falsely represented that he was not so enjoined.
A permanent injunction had been entered against the applicant in
1939 enjoining him, in effect, from committing further violations of
section 17 (b) of the Securities Act of 1933 on the basis of allegation
that the applicant was publishing and circulating an investment service
consisting of a book and monthly supplements thereto in which the
applicant described various bank stocks and recommended the purchase and sale thereof without disclosing the receipt from securities
dealers of a percentage of their commissions on transactions in such
stocks induced by such recommendations.
LITIGATION UNDER mE

INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940

An injunctive action was filed by the Commission against OlijJord
A. Greenman, doing business as the Western Trader &: Investor and the
Western Trader, Inc} its successor, to enjoin the defendants from
further violations of sections 206 (1), (2), and (3) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as well as of the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint charged, among
other things, that the defendants represented to purchasers and prospective purchasers of stock of a uranium company that such company
had ore reserves in the amount of $70,791,000 but omitted to state
that these ore reserves were predicated on only 4 samplings, 3 of which
were taken more than a decade ago, and that the defendants took
undisclosed profits in discretionary accounts in connection with the
purchase and sale of securities and converted to their own use funds
deposited with them by persons to whom representations were made
that such funds should be kept by the defendants in a special trust
fund not to be used except for the accounts of such customers. A
final judgment by consent was entered and a permanent injunction
was issued by the court in accordance with the Commission's prayer.
The court also appointed a permanent receiver for the assets of the
defendants.
In another injunctive action against a registered investment adviser,
the Commission charged Thomas L. North, doing business as North's
News Letter, with violations of section 17 (b) of the Securities Act of
1933. This action is described under the heading "Litigation Under
the Securities Act of 1933" appearing elsewhere in this report .

PART XI
RELATED ACTIVITIES OF mE

COMMISSION

COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

.At the beginning of the fiscal year 1956 there were pending in the
courts 14 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices
in the sale or purchase of securities. During the year 35 additional
proceedings were instituted and 28 cases were disposed of, leaving 21
such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a number of corporate reorganization
cases under chapter X of the Bankruptcy .Act, in 6 proceedings in the
district courts under section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company .Act; and in 7 miscellaneous actions, usually as amicus curiae, to
advise the court of its views regarding the construction of provisions of
statutes administered by the Commission which were involved in
private lawsuits. The Commission also participated in 30 civil appeals. Of these, 12 came before the courts on petition for review of
an administrative order, 7 arose out of corporate reorganizations in
which the Commission had taken an active part, 6 were appeals in
actions brought by or against the Commission, 2 were appeals from
orders entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company .Act, and 3 were appeals in cases in which the Commission
appeared as amicus curiae.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year,
are contained in the appendix tables 14 and 16 to 23, inclusive.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during the
year are discussed in the sections of this report relating to the statutes
under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General, who may
institute criminal proceedings. The regional offices of the Commission prepare detailed reports in cases where the facts appear to warrant criminal prosecution. .After careful review by the General
Counsel's Office, these are considered by the Commission, and if it
195

196

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

believes criminal prosecution is appropriate they are forwarded to the
Attorney General. Commission employees familiar with the case
often assist the United States attorneys in its presentation to the
grand jury, the conduct of the trial, and the preparation of briefs on
appeal. The Commission also submits parole reports prepared by its
investigators relating to convicted offenders.
Seventeen new cases were referred to the Justice Department for
prosecution during the past fiscal year. From 1934 to June 30, 1956,
2,283 defendants have been indicted in United States district courts
in 543 cases developed by the Commission. These figures included
10 indictments returned during the past fiscal year against 24 defendants. Also during the fiscal year 1956 there were 14 convictions
in 12 cases, making the total 1,237 convictions in 513 cases. In one
of these cases the defendant, whose prior conviction had previously
been reversed was convicted on his nolo contendere plea entered at the
retrial. On the basis of these 513 cases the Commission's record of
convictions is 87 percent. Convictions against 2 defendants were affirmed by a court of appeals in 1 case and a criminal contempt conviction was also affirmed. An appeal is pending in another case in
which the sole defendant was convicted.
Cases in 1956 again covered a wide variety of charges of fraudulent
practices including broker-dealer frauds, and promotions involving
oil, gas and mining ventures, insurance, and other types of businesses.
Broker-dealers figured in several cases. Stanley C. Shaver, Sr., who
had, among other things, falsely advised that two Florida telephone
companies would merge in order to induce his customers to purchase
stock and had thereafter converted to his own use the funds provided
for this purpose, was convicted in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Florida, placed on probation for 5 years,
and ordered to pay back $8,000 to defrauded customers. The defendant in U. S. v, Ernstrom (E. D. N. Y.), advised clients to purchase over-the-counter securities at prices in excess of the market
prices, without disclosing this fact to them. Edwiin R. Hawley, a
broker-dealer, who had embezzled customers' funds, was sentenced to
5 years probation and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine (U. S. v. Hawley,
D. Ariz., sentenced S. D. CaL).
Another defendant indicted in his capacity as broker-dealer is
awaiting trial. W. F. Tellier and two officers of the Alaska Telephone
Corp. (U. S. v. Tellier, et al., E. D. N. Y.),! are charged, among other
things, with concealing the fact that Alaska Telephone Corp., whose
debentures investors were being asked to buy, was unable to pay
interest out of earnings, and was paying it instead from sales of new
debentures. In addition, the indictment charges that Tellier advanced

funds to the Telephone Corp. with the understanding that he would
receive repayment from the proceeds of new debenture sales and did
not disclose this to his customers.
Tellier is also charged in a subsequent indictment with fraud in selling uranium stock. This indictment charges that in his capacity as a broker he persuaded customers
to buy shares of Consolidated Uranium Mines, Inc., by making
numerous false claims as to its value. It also charges that he purchased shares for one cent and sold them through his company for
between 75 cents and $1.87, without disclosing his original cost to his
customers.
After the close of the fiscal year a third indictment was
resumed against Tellier and others charging them with fraud in the
sale of a stock of Colorado Uranium Mines, Inc., Mesa Uranium
Corp., Three States Uranium Corporation, Paradox Uranium Mining
Corporation, Consolidated Uranium Mines Inc., Cherokee Uranium
Mining Corp. and Blackstone Uranium Mines, Inc., in violation of the
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute
and with conspiracy to violate these statutory provisions, as well as
the registration provisions of the Securities Act and conspiracy to
defraud the United States by filing false documents and reports with
the Commission.
U.
Other cases concerned allegedly fraudulent business ventures.
S. v. Horton, et al., in which an indictment was obtained in the Southern District of California, involved the promotion of a wingless airplane. It is alleged that the airplane in question was represented to
potential investors as one which would carry twice the load, twice as
far, and twice as fast as any other plane. It is also alleged that It
proposed Horton airplane was represented as capable of carrying 4,000
passengers 25,000 miles nonstop at over 400 miles per hour.
As in past years, a large number of the Commission's cases centered around oil and gas ventures. In the fiscal year 1956, 5 allegedly fraudulent oil and gas promotions led to 2 convictions and a
number of pending indictments.
One convicted defendant, Ben H.
Frank, had been found guiltv earlier but the conviction was reversed
because of judicial error. He subsequently entered a plea of nolo
contendere (U. S. v, Frank, W. D. Okla.). A conviction was also
obtained against William F. Horsting (E. D. Wis.). Horsting had
misrepresented the amounts paid for various leases, misstated the
company's earlier record, deceived investors by claiming that funds
invested were in trust, and used the money so obtained for his own
purposes.
Ben E. Young (E. D. Wash.) is charged WIth taking
money for advanced rent and filing fees on oil leases and oonverting the money to his own use. Eldridge S. Price and his wife (N. D.
Ga.) are charged with falsely representing to investors, inter alia,
that certain lands were proven to have oil, that they owned large

198

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

amounts of drilling equipment and other valuable assets and that
Price had never drilled a dry well.
The indictment pending against Homer W. Snowden and Allen A.
Borton (E. D. Ill.) covers a large scale oil promotion as well as the
sale of securities in other enterprises, including an insurance company. It is charged in this case that the detendants falsely guaranteed that the investors' money would be refunded on demand and
made numerous other misrepresentations.
A 5-year sentence and $3,000 fine was imposed upon Arthur V.
Donaldson (U. S. v . Donaldson, D. O. Mont.) for fraud in connection with an insurance company promotion. Donaldson sold stock
in a health and accident insurance company by falsely representing
the manner in which the funds were to be used, the extent of company
assets, and the progress made toward creating the company as a
going concern. Sale of stock in another insurance venture also gave
-
rise to the indictment of James O. Jensen, et al. in the District Oourt
at Spokane (E. D. Wash.). The charges include allegations that
the defendants falsely told a large number of investors that the sale
of stock in the Washington Insurance 00. had the approval of the
State Insurance Oommission, that all funds would be Oommission
supervised, and that investors would receive 6-percent interest and
could withdraw their investment at any time.
Richard Bowler was convicted and sentenced (E. D. Wash.) for
fraudulently representing to investors that a warehouse and storage
company was a debt free, profitable operation when. in fact, it had
a $350,000 debt and had defaulted on its interest payments. Bowler
has filed an appeal. In U. S. v . Holemam (N. D. Ill.) the two defendants, father and son, were convicted for selling stock in a fraudulentventure in volving construction of a cooperative apartment house.
The promotion was effected by a series of false and misleading statements, such as that all funds would be watched over by a conservative
trust company. In fact, the defendants diverted to their own use a
considerable part of the funds obtained from investors. A promoter of
a mining venture was sentenced to 1 year (U. S. v . Elliott, S. D. Oal.).
In the criminal appellate cases, the convictions of James Robert
Palmer and his wife, Lenore, for violations of the antifraud provisions
of the Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute, were affirmed in
December 1955 by the Oourt of Appeals for the tenth Circuit."
The Palmers, who had conducted business as Ace Motors, fraudulentlv obtained funds through the issuance of fictitious notes and
spurious automobile chattel mortgages. In addition, James Palmer
fraudulently sold preferred stock of Ace Finance, Inc., by means of
numerous misrepresentations, including claims that each investment

was insured up to $10,000; that a reserve fund of $25,000 was maintained to make refunds to investors; and that Ace Finance was
audited every quarter by the Controller of Currency of the State
of Colorado.
In Mills v: U. S. ex rel S. E. 0.,3 the Court of Appeals affirmed
Mills' conviction for criminal contempt for violating preliminarv and
final injunctive decrees enjoining him from selling securities in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
Mills' contempt arose from his sale to the public of Searchlight
Consclidated Mining & Milling Co. common stock without registering
the stock with the Commission.
COMPLAINTS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission conducts investigations under authority contained
in each of the acts which it administers for the purpose of determining
whether violations of these laws have occurred. Conduct of such
investigations is the responsibility of the Commission's nine regional
offices working under the general supervision of the Division of
Trading and Exchanges. As in the case of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and other government enforcement agencies, the Commission's investigation files are nonpublic since making such files
public would seriously impar, if not make impossible, effective investigation work. Furthermore this policy protects innocent persons
where the subject of an investigation is found ultimately to be innocent of wrongdoing.
Complaints by the investing public, together with the Commission's broker-dealer inspection program with respect to registered
broker-dealers and the Commission's surveillance of the securities
markets, account for most of the leads which develop into Commission
investigations.
Complaints and inquiries received from the public
number many thousands every year. These complaints and brokerdealer inspection reports are carefully examined with a view toward
determining whether violations of the acts are revealed which merit
enforcement attention.
Where a brief examination is necessary to
determine whether or not a violation occurred, a preliminary investigation may be initiated for the purpose of determining whether further
investigation is justified.
These preliminary investigations which are generally limited to an
examination of the Commission's files, correspondence with persons
in possession of pertinent information, and telephone or personal
interviews with a small number of individuals, may serve to provide
the information needed for a determination of whether a violation has
occurred. Where the preliminary investigation is sufficient to disclose
â€¢ (C. A. 9, No. 14613 (unreported).

200

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

that no violation has been committed or that a violation has occurred
because of a misunderstanding or ignorance of the law, no further
action is ordinarily taken except that under the latter circumstances
the offender is informed of his violations and steps are taken to procure
compliance. In this manner the preliminary investigation results in
compliance with the law before the investing public has suffered
serious damage or loss.
In the event that a satisfactory disposition cannot be made following
such a preliminary investigation, the matter is docketed as a case and
a full, detailed investigation is made. The Commission may, in connection with such investigation, issue a formal order appointing
officers from members of its staff to issue subpenas calling for the
appearance of witnesses to testify under oath and for the production
of documents. Authority under it is limited to the persons named by
the Commission in that order and its use is limited to the subject
matter specifically designated. During the fiscal year 47 such orders
were issued.
Upon completion of an investigation the regional administrator of
the office in which the investigation is being conducted receives a
report from the investigators assigned to the case and, following a
review of that report, the regional administrator submits a recommendation that appropriate action be instituted by the Commission
or that the investigation be closed. These reports in every instance
are reviewed and analyzed by the staff of the Commission's principal
office before being presented to the Commission for disposition.
In cases where it appears that a criminal prosecution would be
appropriate, the action of the Commission may take the form of a
reference of the evidence to the Department of Justice. In that
event, members of the staff familiar with the development of the
investigation, assist the United States Attorney, to whom the Department of Justice has assigned the matter, in the presentation of the
evidence to a grand jury, and, where an indictment is returned, in
the prosecution of the case.
In other cases the Commission may authorize institution of a civil
proceeding for injunctive relief or bring administrative proceedings
against broker-dealers and investment advisers. At times where it
appears appropriate to do so, the Commission will also refer evidence
of violations of other Federal statutes and State laws to the Department of Justice or other interested Federal or State authority.
During prior fiscal years intensive efforts were made to close old
cases upon which further work did not appear to be justified with the
result that the investigations pending at the beginning of the year
largely included matters requiring active work. An unusual proportion of these involved complex situations requiring intensive effort
by numerous investigators to develop all,of the pertinent information.

Restitution

While the statutes administered by the Commission do not specifically authorize it to bring action or conduct investigations for the
purpose of effecting recovery of money for investors, a substantial
amount is recovered each year by investors as a result of investigations
by the Commission. The amount of such recoveries cannot be computed with any degree of accuracy. It is estimated that several
millions of dollars annually are so restored.
For example, in one situation during 1956, an investigation disclosed
a distribution in violation of the registration requirements of the
Securities Act to residents of the United States, of securities of a Canadian mining venture by a registered broker-dealer located in this
country. The firm recognized its responsibility and, regardless of the
proceedings instituted by the Commission to determine whether its
registration as a broker-dealer should be revoked, voluntarily effected
an offer of rescission at a cost to it of over $200,000.
Payments to members of the public through the Commission's enforcement efforts also result from the appointment by the courts of
receivers at the instance of the Commission in connection with brokerdealer injunctive actions. Where the situation warrants such action,
the Commission will seek appointment of a receiver by the court to
preserve assets of firms against whom action is taken for distribution
to customers. While neither the Securities Act of 1933 nor the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 contains specific authorization for the
appointment of a receiver which the Commission may seek in order
to fully protect the public interest, the Federal courts have consistently sustained the Commission's position that the authority to appoint such a receiver is inherent in the broad equity power of the
judiciary.ts

The effect of the enforcement program cannot, of course, be measured by money restored to customers and investors as a result of
Commission action. Far more important is the money saved to the
investing public by vigorous enforcement action to prevent fraudulent
transactions before they can be consummated.
Enforcement Problems With Respect to Canadian Securities

In general the initiation and conduct of investigations with respect
to violations which have their origin in Canada parallel other enforcement procedures. The principal difference arises from the territorial
limitations of the Commission's authority and the fact that in a large
majority of such cases the evidence is located, as are the violators, in a
foreign country. The Commission staff cannot examine these persons
under oath or inspect their books and records nor is it possible to
obtain proof of the falsity of their representations concerning the
issuers of the securities being offered for sale. Even where evidence
is available, sanctions such as criminal or civil prosecution or administrative proceedings cannot be effective unless personal jurisdiction
over the defendants is obtained. The difficulty in obtaining the requisite personal jurisdiction is highlighted by the narrow construction
given by the Canadian courts to the Supplementary Extradition Convention between Canada and the United States. In the first case,
U. S. v. Link and Green, 3 D. L. R. 386 (1955), brought under the new
extradition arrangements which had been designed to permit extradition from Canada of persons engaged in the fraudulent sale of securities
by mail and telephone to United States residents, the Canadian courts
denied extradition.
At the conclusion of the 5 weeks hearing, the
extradition judge announced that he was satisfied that a prima facie
case of fraud had been made out against the defendants involved.
but nevertheless denied the extradition request because he did not
approve of the extent of the evidence which might be admissible in the
prosecution of these defendants in the United States. Application
was made to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the
decision, and that application was denied by the court for lack of
jurisdiction, U. S. v. Link and Green (1955) S. C. R. 183. Negotiations
aimed at a solution of the problem have been continued through the
Department of State. Meanwhile, enforcement efforts are necessarily
dependent to a very large degree upon the cooperation of appropriate
Canadian Federal and Provincial officials which, as mentioned in
this Report under "Enforcement Program", has been excellent.
Despite these difficulties, the Commission and other Federal agencies have made aggressive efforts to cope with the overall situation.
Hundreds of investigations have been made, injunctions have been
secured whenever jurisdiction over the violator could be obtained, a
substantial number of criminal indictments have been entered, and
over 80 postal fraud orders have been issued. A central clearing

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL

REPORT

203

house for information concerning violators has been established within
the Commission, whereby information in the possession of numerous
law enforcement agencies is compiled and exchanged.
Early in 1956, there was reason to be optimistic concerning the
progress being made. Available information indicated that fraudulent offerings from Canada had decreased very substantially since the
peak of 1949-52, both in number and in magnitude. This progress was
the more encouraging because the past, year or two have been a period
of activity in the securities market and relatively high public interest
in speculative securities when an increase rather than a decrease in
the fraudulent offerings from Canada might reasonably have been
anticipated.
The favorable trend which was noted earlier in the year was reversed in the succeeding months of 1956 and is a cause for serious
concern. The recent instances of fraudulent activity seem to be
largely attributable to a small coterie operating in western Canada.
There is reason to believe that this newly troublesome group includes
notorious "stockateers" from Eastern Canada who were forced to
discontinue activities there because of the vigilance of Quebec and
Ontario authorities.
The migration of persons engaged in illegal sales activities from one
province to another in Canada creates a problem f01 the Canadian
authorities who have been vigorously cooperating with the Commission; and points up the inadequacy of provincial regulation to bring
this illegal activity under control. The limitations of provincial law
did not, however, prevent effective action by Canadian provincial
authorities against 6 broker-dealers and 3 securities issuers whose
registrations were either canceled or not renewed upon expiration
following complaints submitted by the Commission. In particular,
the cooperation of the provincial authorities of Ontario and Quebec
and their positive attitude toward the enforcement of their respective
securities regulations have contributed greatly to the measure of
success that has resulted from the cooperative enforcement, program.
In this connection, enactment of new legislation has enabled Quebec
authorities to take forceful measures to halt fraudulent sales activities
in that province. The Quebec Legislature which created the Securities Commission for that province was fully aware of the need for its
Commission to be in a position to deal effectively with securities
violators and theretore armed it with summary power to penalize and
halt the activities of those persons who did not comply with the
requirements of the law. It should also be mentioned that the
Canadian provincial and Federal authorities have continued to
cooperate with the Commission by making available evidence from
their official files for use in proceedings initiated by the Commission,
406617--57----15

204

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

as well as by furnishing the assistance of members of their staffs in
some instances. The Commission has cooperated with and assisted
Canadian authorities by obtaining and making available evidence
necessary for enforcement actions in that country.
In April 1956 the Commission revised its Canadian restricted list,
initially issued in September 1951, which contains a list of Canadian
issuers whose securities the Commission has reason to believe recently
have been or currently are being distributed in the United States in
violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.
The Commission's release publishing the list also, and for the first
time, specified the conditions under which a name would be deleted
from the restricted list. Deletions are effected after a reasonable
time if it appears that the issuer has ceased to exist and there appears
to be no trading in the securities in the United States. Deletions
may also be made upon compliance with the Federal securities laws
by effective registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or qualification for an exemption under the Commission's regulations. Normally,
a security will not be removed from the list until at least a year after
the unlawful distribution is completed absent an appropriate filing
under the Securities Act. In the originally revised restricted list,
the names of 79 issuers no longer in existence were deleted and the
names of 30 issuers were added, making a total of 135 issuers on the
restricted list. In June 1956, the first supplement to the revised list
was issued, adding the names of 14 Canadian issuers. It is the
intention of the Commission to issue additional current supplements
as the need appears in keeping with the primary function of the list
to put brokers and dealers, as well as the investing public, in the
United States on notice of the fact that securities of Canadian issuers
named thereon appear to be the subject of illegal distributions.
The list even as supplemented does not purport to include all
Canadian securities being illegally distributed in the United States.
It does serve as notice with respect to the securities of the issuers
named which have come to the attention of the Commission. Before
executing transactions in such securities, brokers and dealers are
expected to satisfy themselves that any such security purchased by
them for resale or acquired in the execution as broker of a customers'
order is not a part of the unlawful distribution, since otherwise the
broker or dealer himself may be regarded as participating in an unlawful distribution.
The list, among other things, discourages a particular technique of illegal distribution by which investors in the
United States are solicited to place orders with their own brokers or
dealers instead of directly with Canadian brokers, and the securities
being distributed are used to fill the resulting orders from brokers and
dealers in the United States. The current list is as follows:

To assist in the enforcement work of the Commission, brokers,
dealers, and members of the public are requested to report to the
Commission evidence of violations of the Securities Acts which may
come to their attention.'
SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

A section of Securities Violations is operated by the Division of
Trading and Exchanges of the Commission as a part of its enforcement
program and to provide a further means of detecting and preventing
fraud in securities transactions.
The Securities Violations Section
maintains files which provide a clearing house for information concerning persons who have been charged with violations of various
Federal and State securities statutes.
Considerable information is
also available concerning violators who are resident in the provinces
of Canada. The specialized information in these files is kept current
through the cooperation of the United States Post Office Department,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials,
State securities authorities, Federal and State prosecuting attorneys,
police officers, Better Business Bureaus, and chambers of commerce.
At the end of the fiscal year these records contained information concerning 59,664 persons against whom Federal or State action had been
taken in connection with securities violations. In keeping these
records current there were added during 1956 information concerning
4,798 persons, including 1,695 concerning persons not previously
identified therein.
The Securities Violation Section issued and distributed quarterly
a Securities Violations Bulletin containing information received during
the period concerning violators showing new charges and developments
in pending cases. The bulletin includes a "wanted" section in which
are listed the names and references to bulletins containing descriptive
information as to persons wanted on securities violations charges.
The bulletin is distributed to a limited number of cooperating law
enforcement officials in the United States and Canada.
Extensive use is made of the information available in these records
by regulatory and law enforcing officials. During the past year the
Commission received 3,204 "securities violations" letters or reports
and dispatched 1,823 communications to cooperating agencies.
ACTIVITIES OF TIlE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The several acts administered by the Commission provide that
dependable, informative financial statements, which disclose the
financial status and earnings history and potentialities of a corporation
or other commercial entity, shall be made a part of registration statements, applications for registration, and periodic reports required to
â€¢ Securities Act Release No. 3632.
406617-ll7-16

206

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

be filed with the Commission. These financial statements are always
a vital, often the most significant, element of the information the
investor must have upon which to predicate investment decisions.
The Congress recognized the importance of these statements.
It
was aware also that they lend themselves readily to misleading inferences or even deception, whether or not intended. Consequently,
the various statutes administered by the Commission deal extensively
with financial statement presentation and the accounting concepts
and principles on which they are based. The recognition by the
Congress that accountants and accounting perform a vital role in
achieving the statutory objectives of fair disclosure, prevention of
fraud, inequitable and unfair practices, and control and regulation,
makes the activities of the Commission in the field of accounting most
significant from the standpoint of the investor.
Thus, for example, the Securities Act requires the inclusion in
prospectuses of balance sheets and profit and loss data "in such form
as the Commission shall prescribe," 5 and authorizes the Commission
to prescribe "the items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and
earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation
of accounts * * *." 6 Similar authority is contained in the Securities
Exchange Act,? and more comprehensive power is embodied in the
Investment Company Act 8 and the Holding Company Act,"
The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission
shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 10
The other three statutes permit the Commission to require that such
statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent public
accountant ,11 and the Commission's rules require, with minor exceptions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by qualified
accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement
as to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some individual
accountants, was for the first time authoritatively and explicitly
introduced into law in 1933. Out of this initial provision in the
Securities Act and the rules promulgated by the Commission,"
together with strict action taken by the Commission in certain cases,"
there have grown concepts of accountant-client relationships that
have strengthened the protection afforded investors .

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL

REPORT

207

The Commission's standards of independence are stated in rules
2-01 (b) and (c) of regulation S-X which provide among other things
that an accountant will not be considered independent with respect to
any person, or any affiliate thereof, for any period during which he
has any financial interest, direct or indirect, in such person, or with
whom he is or as connected was a promoter, underwriter, voting
trustee, director, officer or employee. In determining whether
an accountant is in fact independent with respect to a particular
registrant, the Commission will give appropriate consideration to all
relevant circumstances, including evidence bearing on all relationships
between the accountant and that registrant or any affiliate thereof.
Experience with these rules shows that many accountants, especially
those certifying financial statements of companies coming within the
Commission's jurisdiction for the first time by reason of a registration
statement for a new issue or the listing of an outstanding issue on an
exchange, find that they cannot certify financial statements of clients
of long standing because during the period for which financial data
is required to be furnished they have served clients of whom they have
in fact not been independent.
The most common (and often unwitting) cause of lack of independence is ownership of stock by a
member of the accounting firm of the client company during any of
the periods certified. This the Commission deems an absolute bar to
independence, though exceptions where there would be particular
hardship and investor protection can be achieved by other safeguards,
have occasionally been permitted.
As shown above, the statutes administered by the Commission
give it broad rule-making power with respect to the preparation and
presentation of financial statements.
Pursuant to the authority
contained in the statutes the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies subject to the provisions of the Holding Company Act;14has adopted rules under the Securities Exchange
Act governing accounting and auditing of securities brokers and dealers; and has promulgated rules contained in a single, comprehensive
regulation, identified as Regulation S-X/5 which govern the form and
content of financial statements filed in compliance with the various
acts. This regulation is implemented by the Commission's Accounting Series releases, of which 77 have so far been issued. These releases were inaugurated in 1937, and were designed as a program for
making public, from time to time, opinions on accounting principles
for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in major accounting questions. The rules and

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

regulations thus established, except for the uniform systems of accounts, prescribe the accounting to be followed only in certain basic
respects. In the large area not covered by such rules the Commission's principal reliance for the protection of investors is on the determination and application of accounting principles and standards
which are recognized as sound and which have attained general
acceptance.
Changes and new developments in financial and economic conditions
affect the operations and financial status of the several thousand commercial and industrial companies required to file statements with the
Commission. It is necessary for the Commission to be informed of
the changes and new developments in these fields and to make certain
that the effects thereof are properly reported to investors. The Commission's accounting staff, therefore, engages in study designed to
establish and maintain appropriate accounting procedures and practices. The primary responsibility for this program rests with the
chief accountant of the Commission who has general supervision with
respect to accounting and auditing policies and their application.
Furtherance of these activities requires constant contact and cooperation between the staff and accountants both individually and
through such representative groups as, among others, the American
Accounting Association, the American Institute of Accountants, the
American Petroleum Institute, the Controllers Institute of America,
the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, and
National Federation of Financial Analysts Societies as well as other
governmental agencies. Recognizing the importance of cooperation
in the formulation of accounting principles and practices and proper
auditing procedures which will best serve the interests of investors,
the American Institute of Accountants and the Controllers Institute
of America regularly appoint committees which maintain liaison with
the Commission's staff.
For example, experience over the years has shown the need for an
adequate guide for the auditing of broker-dealers who are required to
file reports on Form X-17 A-5 with the Commission, under rule
X-17 A-5. These reports include responses to a financial questionnaire and supplementary questions. Our rules now prescribe what
are referred to as "Minimum Audit Requirements."
Examination
of the reports seems to indicate that many accountants consider these
to be all of the requirements and fail to vary their procedures to fit
changing conditions. Our chief accountant has been cooperating for
some time with committees of the American Institute of Accountants
in an effort to produce a comprehensive guide in this specialized field
of auditing. This work resulted in the publication by the American
Institute of Accountants, under date of October 24, 1956, of a booklet

TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

209

entitled: "Audits of Brokers or Dealers in Securities." It is expected
that Form X-17A-5 will be appropriately amended.
The many daily decisions of the Commission require the almost
constant attention of some of the chief accountant's staff. These include questions raised by each of the operating divisions of the Commission, the regional offices and the Commission. This day-to-day
activity of the Commission and the need to keep abreast of current
accounting problems causes the chief accountant's staff to spend
much time in the examination and reexamination of sound and generally accepted accounting and auditing principles and practices.
From time to time members of this staff are called upon to assist in
field investigations, to participate in hearings, and to review opinions
insofar as they pertain to accounting matters.
Prefiling and other conferences, in person or by phone, with officials
of corporations, practicing accountants and others occupy a considerable amount of the available time of the staff. This procedure, which
has proved to be one of the most important functions of the office of
the chief accountant, and of the chief account of the Division of
Corporation Finance and his staff saves registrants and their representatives both time and 'expense.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems arise as a result
of the examination of financial statements required to be filed with
the Commission. Where examination reveals that the rules and
regulations of the Commission have not been complied with or that
applicable sound accounting principles have not been adhered to, the
examining division usually notifies the registrant by an informal
letter of comment. These letters of comment and the correspondence
or conferences that follow continue, as in the past, to be a most
convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial statements, both to registrants and to the
Corrunission's staff. Where particularly difficult or novel questions
arise, which cannot be settled by the accounting staff of the divisions
and by the chief accountant, they are referred to the Commission for
consideration and decision. The Commission's treatment of accounting questions by these administrative means is extensive. A
considerable portion of the time of the accounting staff is spent in the
discussion of such cases by letter and telephone, and in conference
with registrants and their accounting and legal advisers. There is
also a large, and in recent years growing, volume of inquiries as to the
propriety of particular accounting practices from accountants and
from companies not presently subject to any of the acts administered
by the Commission who wish to have the benefit of the Corrunission's
views, and thus utilize and apply the Commission's experience to the
facts of their own case.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

During 1956 several accounting problems required the staff's
consideration, some for the first time because of new economic developments and others due to changed viewpoints. The past year has seen
an increasingly large number and variety of corporate mergers and
acquisitions, and many more reportedly are in process. Since the
transactions occurring in this area of business activity may have
material effect upon the reported earnings of the corporations involved
as well as serious tax consequences, it is essential that sound and
workable criteria be established governing the accounting therefor.
The Commission's staff has been cooperating closely with the accounting profession to bring about the establishment of .uniform
procedures in this area.
Novel accounting problems have been raised in connection with a
public offering by a corporation organized under the laws of the
District of Columbia pertaining to the incorporation of insurance
companies, of contracts described as "variable annuity contracts."
These contracts are discussed in greater detail on pages 190, 192 of this
report. While proposals have also been made in other jurisdictions
for the issuance of this type of contract, this case is the only one thus
far presented to the Commission for its consideration. This form of
contract differs from the conventional annuity contract usually
available from insurance companies in that the issuer is not obligated
to pay a fixed dollar amount but instead contracts to pay varying
periodic sums depending upon the value of an underlying fund
invested in common stocks and other equity securities. The appropriate accounting for these contracts is receiving the attention of the
Commission's staff in cooperation with the accounting profession.
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Opinions are issued by the Commission in contested and other
cases arising under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 where the nature of the matter to be decided,
whether substantive or procedural, is of sufficient importance to
warrant a formal expression of views. These opinions include detailed
findings of fact and conclusions of law based on evidentiary records,
taken before a hearing examiner, or, in an occasional case, before
a single Oommissioner or the entire Oommission. In some cases
formal hearings are waived by the parties and the :findings and
conclusions are based on stipulated facts or admissions.
The Commission is assisted in the preparation of :findings, opinions
and orders by its Office of Opinion Writing, an independent staff
office directly responsible to the Commission,
It receives all assign-

TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

211

ments and instructions from, and makes recommendations and
submits its work to, the Commission directly. While engaged in the
preparation of opinions members of the Office of Opinion Writing are
completely isolated from members of the operating division actively
participating in the proceedings, and it is an invariable rule that those
assigned to prepare such an opinion must not have had any prior
participation in any phase of the proceedings with respect to which
the opinion is to be prepared. Commission experts are from time to
time consulted on technical problems arising in the course of the
preparation of opinions and findings, but these experts are never
individuals who have participated in the proceedings. This complete
independence of staff members assisting in the preparation of opinions
accords with the principle embodied in the Administrative Procedure
Act requiring a separation between staff members performing prosecutory functions and those performing quasi-judicial functions.
Members of the Office of Opinion Writing who are assigned to
work on a particular case attend the oral argument of the case before
the Commission and frequently keep abreast of current hearings.
Prior to the oral argument the office makes a preliminary review of
the record and prepares and submits to the Commission a summary
of the uncontested facts and the factual and legal issues raised in the
hearings as well as in any proposed findings and supporting briefs,
the hearing examiner's recommended decision and exceptions thereto
taken by the parties. Following oral argument or, if no oral argument
has been held, at such time as the case is ready for decision, the
Office of Opinion Writing is instructed by the Commission respecting
the nature and content of the opinion and order to be prepared.
In preparing the draft of the Commission's formal opinion, the
entire record in the proceedings is carefully read and in some cases
a narrative abstract of the record is prepared. Upon completion
of a draft opinion and review and revision in the Office of Opinion
Writing it is submitted to the Commission. The draft as submitted
may be modified, amended, or completely rewritten in accordance
with the Commission's final instructions.
When the opinion accurately expresses the views and conclusions
of the Commission it is adopted and promulgated as the official decision of the Commission and constitutes a source of information for
the bar, investors and other interested persons. Opinions are
publicly released and distributed to representatives of the press and
persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, the opinions
are printed and published by the Government Printing Office in
bound volumes entitled "Securities and Exchange Commission
Decisions and Reports." 15&
II. There are presently 33 published volumes, covering the period from July 2, 1934to September 30, 1952.
Volumes 34 to 36, covering the period from October I, 1952to January 31, 1956,are now at the Government
PrInting Office and are expected to be dlstributed by March 1957.

212

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

During the fiscal year 1956 the Commission issued findings, opinions
and orders in 84 cases, exclusive of numerous uncontested matters
disposed of without opinion.
APPLICATIONS FOR NON.DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

Under various of the acts administered by the Commission,
public disclosure of certain limited types of information by persons
filing documents with the Commission is not required. Thus, under
item (30) of schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933, no disclosure
is required of any portion of a material contract if the Commission
determines that disclosure of such portion would impair the value
of the contract and would not be necessary for the protection of
investors. Under section 24 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, trade secrets or processes need not be disclosed in any material
filed with the Commission and, under section 24 (b) of that act,
written objection to public disclosure of information contained in
any such material may be made to the Commission which is then
authorized to make public disclosure of such information only if in
its judgment such disclosure is in the public interest. Somewhat
similar provisions are contained in section 22 of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 and in section 45 of the Investment
Company Act of 1940.
The Commission has implemented these sections of the acts by
rules outlining the procedure to be followed by persons applying to
the Commission for a determination that public disclosure of certain
information is not necessary. The Commission has exercised sparingly
its authority to grant applications for nondisclosure of information
that would otherwise be public. The Commission has required a
showing of a real detriment to the issuer of the securities with no real
detriment to investors if such information is not disclosed. For
example, the Commission has not granted applications for nondisclosure of sales and cost of sales except in one case where it appeared
that the foreign operations of a company would have been seriously
damaged.
Certain applications for nondisclosure, particularly under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are of a recurring nature because of
the requirements of that act that reports be filed periodically. It is
the policy of the Commission to reexamine such applications for the
purpose of determining whether in the Iight of current conditions
the applications should be denied in whole or in part even though
such applications may have been granted in the past. This critical
attitude of the Commission is known to the industry and has resulted
in a small number of applications in the past fiscal year.

STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

The statistical work of the Commission is divided into two broad
groups, the first covering statistics necessary to the Commission as
the agency of the Government concerned with the operation, according
to statutory standards, of the capital markets of the country. The
second group of statistics pertain to general economic data connected
with the overall government statistical program under the direction
of the Office of Statistical Standards of the Bureau of the Budget.
These general data are for the most part related to capital formation
and other financial aspects of registered companies, and thus are
also important to the Commission in carrying out its regulatory
functions.
The statistical series which are prepared include data on securities
effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933, offerings of
securities by all corporations in the United States (including issues
not registered with the Commission, such as privately placed issues
and railroad securities), retirements of corporate securities, net change
in corporate securities outstanding, stock prices and trading. The
research and statistical activity carried out under the direction of the
Bureau of the Budget includes individuals' savings in the United
States, income flow and investments of private pension funds of
United States corporations, current liquid position of United States
corporations, anticipated expenditures for plant and equipment by
United States businesses, and a quarterly financial report for all
United States manufacturing concerns.
Special studies are made from time to time on certain phases of the
statistical data, and special reports are also prepared at the request
of the Congress, the Council of Economic Advisers and other Government agencies. During 1956 studies and surveys concerned with
stock market activity and practices were prepared for internal use
and for the use of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency

214

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

in its study of the stock market. Statistical data on the cost of
flotation for registered and unregistered issues covering the years
1951, 1953, and 1955 were compiled, a report being planned for
publication in 1957. Another special report, covering self-insured
pension plans developed from the Commission's annual survey of
corporate pension funds was published in November 1956.
The statistical series are published in the Commission's Statistical
Bulletin and in addition, except for data on registered issues, current
figures and analyses of the data are published in quarterly press
releases. The Commission's stock price index is released weekly,
together with data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the two New
York exchanges.
The various statistical series are as follows:
Issues Registered under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly and quarterly statistics are compiled on the number and
volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type
of security, and use of proceeds. Data for the 1956 fiscal year appear
at page 52 and in appendix tables 1 and 2.
New Securities Offerings

This is a monthly and quarterly series covering all new corporate
and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues
privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration
under the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and railroad
securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually
offered for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers.
Annual statistics on new offerings since 1951, as well as monthly
figures from January 1955 through June 1956, are given in appendix
tables 3 and 4. A summary of the data is shown annually from 1934
through June 1956 in appendix table 5.
Corporate Securities Outstanding

Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount of
estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale of
securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations
to investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements
and net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Stock Market Data

Statistics are regularly compiled on the market value and volume
of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges, round-lot
stock transactions on the N ew York exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock transactions on the New York

TWENTY-SECOND

ANNUAL REPORT

215

exchanges, special offerings and secondary distributions.
Indexes of
stock market prices are compiled, based upon the weekly closing
market prices of 265 common stocks listed on the N ew York Stock
Exchange. The indexes are composed of 7 major industry groups, 29
subordinate groups, and a composite group.
Saving Study

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases in mortgage and consumer debt. The study shows the aggregate value of saving and the form in which the saving occurred, such
as investment in securities, expansion of bank deposits, increase in
insurance and pension reserves, etc. The saving series was initiated
by the Commission in the Thirties and in recent years has been considerably refined and improved. During 1956, the Office of Statistical
Standards discussed with the Commission its proposal to transfer
central responsibility for savings statistics to the Federal Reserve
Board. The Commission is cooperating 'with the Board in developing a new program of savings statistics along the lines suggested by the
Task Force on Saving Statistics of the Joint Committee on the
Economic Report.P" Some of these improvements, already under
way by the Commission, were incorporated in the Commission's
1955 annual release on saving, published in May 1956. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the personal saving estimates
of the Department of Commerce, derived in connection with its
national income series, is published annually in the National Income
Number of the Survey of Current Business.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on working capital position of all United States corporations, excluding banks and insurance companies, shows the principal
. components of current assets and liabilities, and also contains an
abbreviated analysis of the source and use of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission,
compiles a quarterly financial report for all United States manufacturing concerns. This report, an outgrowth of the-working capital
series, gives complete balance sheet data and an abbreviated income
account, data being classified by industry and size of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce,
conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant
and equipment expenditures of all United States businesses, exclusive
of agriculture.
Shortly after the close of each quarter, data are

released on actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated
expenditures for the next two quarters.
In addition, a survey is
made at the beginning of each year of the plans for business expansion
during that year.
PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION

OF INFORMATION

Among the basic purposes included in the statutes administered by
the Commission are to provide information to the public about corporations and others. selling new issues of securities to the public in
interstate commerce or having securities listed on national securities
exchanges, and detection, prevention and punishment of fraud, manipulation and other illegal activities in the securities markets, where
Federal jurisdiction is involved.
As a result of the activities of the Commission in administering the
"full disclosure" principles of the Federal securities laws, a vast
amount of business and financial information has become available to
the investing public. The availability of this information has been of
particular importance in recent years because of the expanding and
developing economy and the concomitant requirements for large
amounts of new investment capital. Virtually all of the data obtained by the Commission under statutes administered by it is available to the public. In terms of volume, in excess of 90 percent of the
Commission's files and records are freely available for public use and
inspection.
Only a limited amount of information is not generally available to
the public and this covers primarily the internal operating files of the
Commission and the Commission's investigation files, the disclosure
of which would be detrimental to the public interest. As the Attorney
General pointed out: 16

* * * The great mass of material relating to the internal operation of an agency
is not a matter of official record. For example, intra-agency memoranda and
reports prepared by agency employees for use within the agency are not official.
records since they merely reflect the research and analysis preliminary to official
agency action. Intra-agency reports of investigations are, in general, not matters
of official record; in addition, they usually involve matters of internal management
and, in view of their nature, must commonly be kept confidential * * *
Members of the Commission as well as top staff officials frequently
make themselves available for speeches and discussions before civic,
professional and industry groups interested in the work of the Commission.
While the Commission has no formal public relations office, the
Chairman, the other Commissioners, the Secretary and staff members
of the home office as well as the regional offices, are always available for
press interviews regarding the Commission's day to day operations.
This is true, not only in the main office in Washington, but throughII

out the country generally, the practice being for Commissioners and
Commission representatives to meet with the press whenever Commission business requires their presence in other sections of the
country." During the 1956 fiscal year, over 30 press conferences
were held by Commissioners and staff members in Washington and
throughout the country.
Most Commission actions take the form of orders for hearing
(or orders giving notice of opportunity to request a hearing), interim
or final decisions and orders, and rules and regulations. So that the
investing public may keep currently informed of these actions, copies
thereof are distributed in "release" form to the Commission's mailing
lists, comprising the names of persons who have specifically requested
certain types of releases. During the year, a total of 736 such releases
were distributed to these lists. .An additional 73 releases were issued
announcing court actions involving the Commission's law enforcement activities, such. as injunction actions and criminal prosecutions .
.Another 73 releases were issued in the Statistical Series announcing
the results of the Commission's regular statistical studies including
New Security Offerings, Expenditures on New Plant and Equipment,
Working Capital of Corporations, Saving of Individuals, the Financial Reports of Manufacturing Companies, and Surveys of Pension
Plans.
Furthermore, to facilitate widespread press coverage of financial
and other proposals filed with, and actions by, the Commission,
and thus contribute to a greater public knowledge and understanding
of the Commission's activities, a daily digest or summary of all such
developments is prepared and distributed to the press. In addition
to summarizing the Commission's orders, decisions and rules, including such administrative actions as the suspension of registration
statements or regulation .Anotifications with respect to public offerings of securities or the revocation of broker-dealer registrations,
a brief description of all new financing proposals included in registration statements filed with the Commission, including the terms
of the offering, expected use of the proceeds, and similar information,
is reflected in the daily summarv.
This program of information distribution is supplemented bv many
responses each day to individual inquiries of press representatives
and others with respect to the Commission's activities and the financial proposals and other matters pending before the Commission.
Information

Available for Public Inspection

The Commission maintains public reference rooms at the headquarters office in Washmgton, D. C., and at its regional offices in
New York City and Chicago, Ill.

Copies of all public information on file with the Commission contained in registration statements, applications, declarations and
other public documents are available for inspection in the public
reference room in Washington. During the fiscal year 3,348 persons
made personal visits to the public reference room seeking public
information and an additional 24,908 requests for registered public
information and copies of forms, releases and other material of a
public nature were received. Through the facilities provided for
the sale of reproductions of public information, 1,845 orders involving
a total of 102,739 pages were filled and 325 certificates attesting to
the authenticity of copies of Commission records were prepared.
The Commission also mailed 445,588 copies of publications to persons
requesting them.
There are available in the New York Regional Office copies of
recent filings made by companies which have securities listed on
exchanges other than the N ew York exchanges and copies of current
periodical reports of many other companies which have filed registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933. During the
fiscal year 11,670 persons visited this public reference room and
more than 10,006 telephone calls were received from persons seeking
public information and copies of forms, releases, and other material.
In the Chicago Regional Office there are available copies of recent
filings made by companies which have securities listed on the New
York exchanges.
Copies of recent prospectuses used in the public offering of securities
registered under the Securities Acts are available in all regional
offices, as are copies of active broker-dealer and investment adviser
registration applications and Regulation A Letters of Notification
filed by persons or companies in the respective regions.

ORGANIZATION

The Securities and Exchange Commission is an independent regulatory agency exercising quasi-judicial, quasi-legislative, and administrative functions. Its staff is composed of attorneys, accountants,
engineers, securities analysts, and clerical employees. The staff is
divided into divisions and offices, including nine regional offices,
as indicated in the organization chart on the following page.
The executive director is the chief operating official of the Commission. He acts under the direction of the Commission in the
coordination of, and the performance of functions by, the operating
divisions and offices of the agency, but under the direction of the
Chairman with respect to administrative matters. He serves as
head of the Division of Administrative Management, which includes
the branches of Personnel, Budget and Finance, and Records and
Service.
Reorganization Plan 10 of 1950, pursuant to the Reorganization
Act of 1949,18 providing for reorganization of the Securities and Exchange Commission, became effective on May 24, 1950.

applications and other ..matters arising under the statutes flow from
the operating divisions and offices directly to the Commission. Plan
10 specifically provides that the appointment of the heads of major
administrative units shall be made by the Commission on recommendation of .the Chairman, and that personnel employed in the
immediate offices of the Commissioners shall not be affected by
provisions of the plan. The Plan also reserves to the Commission its
functions as to revising budget estimates and with respect to determining the distribution of appropriated funds according to major
programs and purposes. Although certain executive and administrative responsibilities are vested in the Chairman by Plan 10, the Commission is regularly consulted with respect to important executive and
administrative matters. In addition, personnel actions affecting professional, technical and administrative employees are reported
regularly to the Commission.
The Commission operates under a continuing policy of review of
its organization and functions in order that its responsibilities may
be discharged as efficiently and economically as possible. Under this
policy, management studies were made of all of the Commission's
major divisions in Washington, and the New York Regional Office
during the fiscal year 1956. The principal realignments of functions
and personnel approved by the Commission pursuant to this selfevaluation program were as follows:
The Division of Corporate Regulation formerly had three operating
units, two of which handled the Division's work under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The work is now concentrated
in one Branch of Public Utility Regulation. The other operating
unit, the Branch of Investment Companies, will continue to handle
the Division's work under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
An office of Special Studies and Administration was created to replace
the Branch of Special Studies, thus concentrating in one branch the
general analytical, financial, economic, and administrative functions
of the Division. The newly created Office of Chief Counsel will be
responsible for legal advice to the Division as well as for the Division's
work under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. This realignment of
functions and personnel became effective June 1, 1956.
The Division of Administrative Management formerly consisted
of the Branches of Personnel, Budget and Finance, Records, and
Service. Effective June 1, 1956, the two latter branches were combined into one Branch of Records and Service.
Effective June 25, 1956, the functions and personnel of the Division
of Trading and Exchanges were realigned to a minor extent. The
Section of Enforcement was reconstituted and given immediate
supervision over three component units each performing related
functions. Similarly, the Section of Economic Research was recoustituted to provide for three units each responsible for a broad area
406617--57----17

222

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the Commission's statistical program. These changes were designed
to improve the flow of work within the Division.
The table of organization of the Office of the General Counsel
formerly provided for a General Counsel, an Associate General
Counsel and an Assistant General Counsel. Effective June 27, 1956,
two additional Assistant General Counsel positions were created.
The Associate General Counsel position, which had been vacant,
was filled by promotion, as were the resulting three Assistant General
Counsel positions. These changes gave recognition to the duties

Personnel Program

During fiscal 1956 there were significant developments in employment. As a result of a series of budget cuts, during the period 1949
to 1954 the Commission's staff was reduced from 1,149 on June 30,
1948, to 666, as of June 30, 1955. The figure of 666 represents an alltime low since the formative days of the Commission. As a result of
favorable action on the Commission's budgets for fiscal years 1956 and
1957, this downward trend has been reversed. An aggregate of 140
appointments were made to fill the new positions in the Commission
provided for by these appropriations and to replace retirements and
resignations. In addition, 22 temporary clerical employees were
appointed. During the summer months of 1956, 10 law school and
business college students were hired under the Commission's newly
established student assistant program. During the same period, it
was also possible to make 172 promotions for members of the staff
who were assigned increased duties and responsibilities which made
possible their upgrading. The policy of recognition of hard, devoted,
and productive work by the staff, which has resulted in these increased
responsibilities at higher grades, is basic in providing incentive and
enthusiasm, and the Commission believes contributes to the very
high professional standing of the' agency.
The Commission's appropriation for 1957 will permit an average
employment of 794.18b The Commission believes that an adequate
II. Principal rates are (1) 1/100 of 1% of the maximum aggregate price of securities proposed to be offered,
but not less than $25; (2) 1/500of 1% of the aggregate dollar amount of stock exchange transactions. Fees
for other services are only nominal.
lib At December I, 1956,there were 785employees in service.

TWENTY -SECOND ANNUAL REPORT

staff is essential to insure that the basic policies of the Congress
enacted in the securities laws for the protection of the investing public
shall continue to be effectively discharged by the Commission.
During fiscal 1956, the Commission administratively extended to
certain employees in positions excepted from the competitive civil
service career tenure similar to that given to employees in the competitive service by law and regulation. In January 1956, the Commission adopted a program making possible the conversion of the
indefinite appointment of attorneys who joined the staff after December 1, 1950, to a permanent or career basis. In addition, the
Commission took administrative action converting to a permanent
basis the indefinite promotions of employees in excepted positions.
During fiscal 1956, there have been significant accomplishments
under the Commission's Incentive Awards Plan. In September 1955,
the Commission recognized the long service of its career employees
by presenting 10- and 20-year service pins and certificates to a total
of 453 employees (63 percent of the entire staff) for service with the
Commission." In addition 6 employees were awarded $175 for
adopted suggestions and cash awards totaling $3,500 and certificates
of merit were presented to 33 employees.
Fiscal 1956was also a notable year for the recognition of the achievements of members of the Commission's staff by other organizations.
In December 1955, the National Civil Service League presented 1 of
its 10 career service awards to the chief accountant of the Division of
Corporation Finance, Andrew Barr, and certificates of merit were
awarded to 4 other Commission employees, Arden L. Andresen,
William E. Becker, Orval L. DuBois, and Karl C. Smeltzer. In
March of 1956, 2 of 16 Rockefeller Public Service Awards made
throughout the Federal service were granted to the chief counsel of
the Division of Corporation Finance, Manuel F. Cohen, and to an
attorney-adviser in the Division of Trading and Exchanges, Edward
C. Jaegerman. In June 1956, an attorney-adviser in the Office of
the General Counsel, Elizabeth B. A. Rogers, was awarded a certificate
of merit by the William A. Jump Memorial Foundation."
The Commission is justifiably proud of this record of distinction
earned by its employees, and they are richly deserved by an able and
conscientious staff that has contributed much to furthering the objectives for which the Commission was created.
I. In September 1956, 10- and 2O-yearservice pins and certlficates were awarded to an additlonal 62 em.
ployees.
III In addltlon, In August 1956,the National Civil Service Leagua awarded Its Merit Citation to 5 Commission employees In recognttton ot their outstanding careers In tha public service. Also In August 1956,
3 employees were selectad tor participation In the Civil Service Commission's Eighth Junior Management
Intern Program, out ot a total ot only 19 government employees admitted to the program.
