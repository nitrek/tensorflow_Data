APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement, Securities and
Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision revokes the registrations of the registered securities of Respondents
China Bus Group Co. (f/k/a Alpine Alpha 3, Ltd.) (China Bus) and China Oumei Real Estate,
Inc. (China Oumei) (collectively, Defaulted Respondents).1 The revocations are based on
Defaulted Respondents’ failures to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (Commission).
INTRODUCTION
On September 18, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange

On October 16, 2014, I defaulted Respondents China Transportation International Holdings
Group Ltd. and Precise Strategy Acquisition Corp. I. China Bus Grp. Co., Initial Decision

Act). The OIP alleges that Respondents each have a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g) and have repeatedly failed to file timely
periodic reports with the Commission, in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules
13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder. Information provided by the Division of Enforcement shows
that Defaulted Respondents were served with the OIP by January 14, 2015, in accordance with
Commission Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(iv), through methods proscribed by the Hague
Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
Commercial Matters. 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(iv). As such, their Answers were due by
Monday, January 26, 2015. OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(a)-(b). To date, no Defaulted
Respondent has filed an Answer.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Defaulted Respondents are in default for failing to file Answers or otherwise defend the
proceeding. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by
Rule 155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.
China Bus, Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1444185, is a void Delaware corporation
located in Shenyang, China, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). China Bus is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended March 31, 2011, which reported a net loss of $366,982 from the company’s October 31,
2007, inception to March 31, 2011.
China Oumei, CIK No. 1368192, is an exempt Cayman Islands corporation located in
Qingdao, China, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act 12(g). China Oumei is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not
filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 20-F for the period ended December 25, 2010.
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Defaulted
Respondents failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of
Corporation Finance requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through
their failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission
rules, did not receive such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. “Compliance with those requirements is
mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is
not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250,
1268 (D.D.C. 1978). There is no genuine issue of material fact that Defaulted Respondents each
failed to timely file required periodic reports. As a result, Defaulted Respondents each failed to
comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13.

SANCTIONS
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or
rules thereunder. In proceedings pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j) against issuers that
violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13, the determination “of what
sanctions will ensure that investors will be adequately protected . . . turns on the effect on the
investing public, including both current and prospective investors, of the issuer’s violations, on
the one hand, and the Section 12(j) sanctions, on the other hand.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19 (May 31, 2006). The
Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s violations, the
isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved, the extent of the
issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and the credibility of
its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Id. at *19-20.
Defaulted Respondents’ failure to file required periodic reports is serious because it
violates a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply
investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make
sound [investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Defaulted Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that each repeatedly failed to
file periodic reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268,
2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic
reports due over a two-year period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008
SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an
eighteen-month period considered recurrent). Defaulted Respondents are also culpable because
they failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance or,
through their failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission, did not receive
such letters, and they were therefore on notice, even before the OIP issued, of their obligations to
file periodic reports. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC
LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even
without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally, each Defaulted
Respondent has not answered the OIP or otherwise defended the proceeding to address whether
it has made any efforts to remedy its past violations, and has made no assurances against further
violations.
Considering these delinquencies, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registrations of each class of registered securities of Defaulted
Respondents.

ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrations of each class of registered securities of China Bus Group Co. (f/k/a Alpine
Alpha 3, Ltd.) and China Oumei Real Estate, Inc., are hereby REVOKED.
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.360, a party may file a petition
for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of the Initial Decision. A
party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the Initial
Decision, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is
filed by a party, then that party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the
date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This Initial Decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of
finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review
or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative
to review the Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the Initial Decision shall
not become final as to that party.
Defaulted Respondents are each notified that they may move to set aside the default in
this case. Pursuant to Rule 155(b), the Commission is authorized, at any time, to set aside a
default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be
appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a
reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the
proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
