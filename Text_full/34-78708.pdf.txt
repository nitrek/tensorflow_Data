ORDER OF FORTHWITH SUSPENSION
PURSUANT TO RULE 102(e)(2) OF THE
COMMISSION’S RULES OF PRACTICE

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Michael
Ralph Casey (“Respondent” or “Casey”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice.1 17 C.F.R. 200.102(e)(2).
II.
The Commission finds that:
1.

Casey, age 68, is an attorney who was previously licensed to practice law in the State of
Florida. He is currently suspended from practicing law in Florida and has inactive law
licenses in the states of Colorado and North Carolina.

1

Rule 102(e)(2) provides in pertinent part: “Any attorney who has been suspended or disbarred
by a court of the United States or of any State ... or any person who has been convicted of a
felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing
or practicing before the Commission.” 17 C.F.R. 201.102(e)(2).

2.

In August 2012, the Department of Justice filed criminal charges against Casey and
others, alleging conspiracy to commit wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1349) and mail fraud (18
U.S.C. § 1341) for conspiring with others to defraud individuals who invested in
Commodities Online, LLC (“COL”). United States v. Howard, et al., Case No. 12-cr20630-JAL, (S.D. Fla.). In September 5, 2012, the Commission filed a civil action
seeking permanent injunctive relief against Casey and others alleging that Casey
violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”),
15 U.S.C. §§77e(a), 77e(c) and 77q(a), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. §78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder 17 C.F.R.
§240.10b-5. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Howard, et. al., Case No. 12-cv61731-WJZ (S.D. Fla.). The Commission’s Complaint alleged that Casey, as outside
counsel and later as president of COL, substantially participated in COL’s fraudulent
solicitation of investors for its securities offerings.

3.

On April 29, 2014, Casey failed to appear at a status hearing in his criminal case and
was determined to be a fugitive. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest by the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida.2 The criminal case was concluded
due to his fugitive status.

4.

On May 28, 2014, the Supreme Court of Florida entered an Order suspending Casey
from the practice of law. The court based its ruling upon the May 19, 2014 Petition for
Emergency Suspension of the Florida Bar (“Bar”), which requested the court enter an
emergency suspension of Casey based on his participation in the COL fraud and his
failure to appear at a status hearing in his criminal case on April 29, 2014. The Bar
Petition asserted that Casey “has caused or is likely to cause, immediate and serious
harm to clients and/or the public and that immediate action must be taken for the
protection of the respondent’s clients and the public.”
III.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Casey is an attorney who has been
suspended by a State court within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice.

2

On August 28, 2014, a grand jury indicted Casey for knowingly failing to appear before the court
in violation of 18 U.S.C. 3146(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(i). See United States v. Casey, Case No. 14-cr20619-FAM (S.D. Fla.). The court subsequently transferred this criminal case to fugitive status.
2

Accordingly, it is ORDERED, that Casey is forthwith suspended from appearing or
practicing before the Commission, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice.

By the Commission.

Secretary
