In the Matter of
DONALD F. (“JAY”) LATHEN, JR.,
ORDER ON MOTION TO QUASH
EDEN ARC CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC, and
EDEN ARC CAPITAL ADVISORS, LLC

Respondents submitted a request for a subpoena directed to the Securities and Exchange
Commission concerning twelve categories of documents and information. After I issued the
subpoena, the Division of Enforcement moved to quash and Respondents filed an opposition. I
resolve the motion to quash as is discussed below, addressing each category in the order listed in
the subpoena.
Preliminarily, Respondents’ opposition to the Division’s motion to quash is animated by
their assertion that in disclosing its investigative file, the Division has provided an
“organization-less, behemoth” in excess of 600,000 pages, “composed almost exclusively of
difficult to search PDF files.” Opp. at 1, 5. In this regard, the Commission has held that absent
bad faith not shown here, the Division satisfies its discovery obligations when it “turns over its
investigative file—voluminous though it might be—in an electronically searchable format.”

2013 WL 6384275, at *6 (Dec. 6, 2013) (emphasis added).1 Although Respondents assert in
their motion—they have not submitted a supporting declaration—that they have experienced
great difficulty performing an electronic search of the documents they have received, Opp. at 1,
5, I have no way of judging this assertion.
I direct Respondents to submit a declaration within ten days detailing the difficulties they
have experienced in searching the documents disclosed by the Division. Within seven days of
1

This rule is influenced by certain appellate decisions addressing the government’s
obligations under Brady v. Maryland. See John Thomas Capital Mgmt. Grp. LLC, at *6 n.41
(citing, among other decisions, United States v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 211 (3d Cir. 2005)
(concerning 75,000 pounds of documents), and United States v. Mulderig, 120 F.3d 534, 541
(5th Cir. 1997) (concerning 500,000 pages of documents)).

filing of Respondents’ declaration, the Division should submit a responsive declaration
addressing how the documents were disclosed and the specific manner in which the disclosed
documents are maintained by the Division, including whether the Division’s investigative file is
maintained in an undifferentiated collection.2
1. Respondents’ request for a list of everyone the Division interviewed in the course of
its investigation is moot. The Division has provided Respondents with a list of interviewees.
2. Respondents seek “notes and/or summaries from the[se] interview[s].” The Division
responds that its interview notes constitute work product and that Respondents have not made the
requisite showing necessary to justify production of the notes. Mot. at 4-5. For their part,
Respondents do not seriously contest that the Division’s interview notes constitute work product.
Instead, they argue that the Division has not shown that its notes constitute opinion work
product. Opp. at 3-4.
Assuming the Division has failed to show that its notes are opinion work product, in
order to obtain the Division’s notes, Respondents must show “a substantial need for the
materials” they seek “and an undue hardship in acquiring the information any other way.” Dir.,
Office of Thrift Supervision v. Vinson & Elkins, LLP, 124 F.3d 1304, 1307 (D.C. Cir. 1997). In
moving to quash, the Division disclosed the names of every person its staff interviewed in the
course of its investigation of Respondents. Respondents have thus only recently learned the
names of the people the Division interviewed. Their assertion of substantial need and undue
hardship is premature. This aspect of Respondents’ subpoena is quashed without prejudice to
later renewal.
3. Respondents seek written witness statements obtained during the course of the
Division’s investigation. In its motion to quash, the Division asserts that it has already complied
with this request. Mot. at 3-4 (“[T]hose documents have been produced.”). Respondents’
request appears to rest on their claim that the Division produced its investigative file in a
disorganized manner, Opp. at 6, without further support that the Division failed to produce
required material.
Rule of Practice 231(a) requires the Division to disclose witness “statements,” as that
term is defined in the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500. 17 C.F.R. § 201.231(a).3 By its terms, the
2

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34(b)(2)(E), which does not apply in this
proceeding but which may provide useful guidance, documents produced in civil litigation may
either be produced in the manner in which they are kept or they may be produced in an organized
and labeled fashion. This rule was intended to create an “equality between the parties in their
ability to search . . . documents.” United States v. O’Keefe, 537 F. Supp. 2d 14, 19 (D.D.C.
2008).
3

The Jencks Act defines the term “statement” as
(1) a written statement made by said witness and signed or
otherwise adopted or approved by him;

Jencks Act applies in criminal proceedings. Unlike Section 3500, which requires production of a
witness’s statement after a government witness testifies on direct examination, 18 U.S.C.
§ 3500(b), Rule 231(a) permits a respondent to seek disclosure of statements before the witness
testifies. 17 C.F.R. § 201.231(a).
When an issue arises in a criminal trial as to whether the government has complied with
its obligation to disclose Jencks Act material, the operating presumption is that, if the defendant
meets his threshold burden, the district court will review in camera the document at issue. See
United States v. Allen, 798 F.2d 985, 994-96 (7th Cir. 1986); see also United States v. Smith, 31
F.3d 1294, 1302 (4th Cir. 1994). To meet this initial burden, a defendant must “specify[] with
reasonable particularity (normally by his cross-examination at trial) that a certain document
exists, that there is a reason to believe that the document is a statutory ‘statement,’ and that the
Government failed to provide it in violation of the Act.” Allen, 798 F.2d at 996 (quoting United
States v. Robinson, 585 F.2d 274, 280-81 (7th Cir. 1978) (en banc)); see United States v. Nickell,
552 F.2d 684, 689-90 (6th Cir. 1977) (requiring a defendant to lay a foundation to support in
camera review). If the defendant meets his burden, the court cannot simply take the
government’s word for it that the document in question does not contain Jencks material. Allen,
798 F.2d at 994-96.
Here, Respondents have not met their initial burden. They have merely offered
unsupported speculation. This aspect of their request is thus quashed without prejudice to
renewal during the hearing in this matter. See United States v. Roseboro, 87 F.3d 642, 645-46
(4th Cir. 1996) (“The defendant’s showing need not be great, but it must be more than a mere
automatic demand for government witness’ statements. . . . An inadequate foundation may be
grounds alone on which the court can properly deny further inquiry.”).
4-5. Respondents seek communications between the Commission and various state
and federal law enforcement authorities. They also seek documents in the Division’s possession
related to investigations conducted by state and federal authorities. The Division responds that it
has produced unprivileged material and that anything not produced is privileged under Section
24(f)(3)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78x(f)(3)(A). Mot. at 6.
Subsection (f)(3)(A) provides that “Federal agencies, State securities and law
enforcement authorities, self-regulatory organizations, and the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board shall not be deemed to have waived any privilege applicable to any information
by transferring that information to or permitting that information to be used by the Commission.”
15 U.S.C. § 78x(f)(3)(A). In other words, if a privilege protects information law enforcement

(2) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a
transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an
oral statement made by said witness and recorded
contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement; or
(3) a statement, however taken or recorded, or a transcription
thereof, if any, made by said witness to a grand jury.
18 U.S.C. § 3500(e).

authorities have provided to the Commission, the provision of that information to the
Commission will not amount to a waiver of the privilege. The Division, however, has not
established the predicate for application of subsection (f)(3)(A); it has not attempted to show that
any underlying privilege exists that could be protected by subsection (f)(3)(A). The party
asserting a privilege has the burden of showing that it applies to documents in question. See,
e.g., In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d 923, 944 (2d Cir. 2010). Within ten days, the Division shall
produce a detailed privilege log describing the withheld communications, a thorough explanation
of the applicability of any privilege it believes is relevant to the communications, and an
appropriate declaration supporting its factual assertions. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.230(c); see also In
re Sealed Case, 856 F.2d 268, 272 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (discussing the privilege proponent’s
burden); Landry v. FDIC, 204 F.3d 1125, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2000). Respondents may respond to
the Division’s submission within seven days after it is filed.
6. Respondents seek all documents that relate to any examination the Commission
conducted of Respondent Eden Arc Capital Management, LLC. The Division argues that these
documents are protected from production under Rule of Practice 230, except to the extent it
offers them during the hearing. Mot. at 5 n.7. In their opposition, Respondents do not address
the Division’s argument. As a result, they have waived any challenge to the Division’s argument
and I need not resolve this issue. This aspect to the subpoena is quashed.
7. Respondents request all material that qualifies for disclosure under Brady v.
Maryland, 372 U.S. 83, 86 (1963), as implemented under former Rule of Practice 230(b)(2), 17
C.F.R. § 201.230(b)(2). The Division asserts that it has produced all that it is required to
produce, plus a withheld document list. Mot. at 3-4 & nn.5-6; see Berke Decl. at 2. Respondents
are dubious but point to nothing specific to show that the Division has failed to comply with its
obligations. Opp. at 6. The Division has produced a declaration generally describing its efforts
to produce “non-privileged documents in its investigative file.” See Berke Decl. at 2. To
remove any doubt about the matter, the Division is directed to file an affidavit specifically
addressing its compliance with Rule 230(b)(2). See Orlando Joseph Jett, Admin. Proc. Release
No. 514, 1996 WL 360528, at *1 (June 17, 1996). This aspect of Respondents’ subpoena is
quashed pending review of the Division’s affidavit. See id. at *1 (“speculation that government
documents may contain Brady material is not enough to require . . . in camera review”); see also
Landry, 204 F.3d at 1137 (“Normally we accept the government’s representations as to whether
documents in its possession constitute Brady material.”).
8-9. Respondents seek documents relating to complaints the Commission has received
about Respondents and documents relating to communications with issuers of the securities at
issue in this proceeding or their trustees, brokerage firms carrying the joint tenancy with rights of
survivorship accounts, or the DTCC. The Division says it has turned over all non-privileged
documents relating to this request. Mot. at 4. As with previous requests, Respondents fail to
provide any specific basis to rule in their favor. This aspect of the subpoena is quashed.
10-11. Respondents ask that the Division provide details as to how certain figures in the
order instituting proceedings were calculated. The Division argues that these requests amount to
interrogatories which are not contemplated under the Rules of Practice. Opp. at 6. As
Respondents do not respond to the Division’s argument, which is correct, see Rules of Practice,

Exchange Act Release No. 33163, 1993 WL 468594, at *47 (Nov. 5, 1993), this aspect of
Respondents’ request is quashed.
12.
Respondents seek all documents related to the appointment process of the
Commission’s administrative law judges. The Division responds that the appointment process is
a matter of record and is not in dispute. Mot. at 7. Because Respondents do not deny this
assertion, this aspect of their request is quashed.
