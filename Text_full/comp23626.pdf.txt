INTRODUCTION
1.

The Commission brings this action to enjoin Secured Income Reserve, Inc.

(“Secured”), its President, CEO, majority shareholder, and Director, Ilona A. Mandelbaum
(“Mandelbaum”), a recidivist, its Vice President of Investor Relations, David A. Zimmerman
(“Zimmerman”), a recidivist, Secured’s Secretary, Treasurer, Chief Operations Officer and

of the federal securities laws.

2.

From February 2013 to at least June 2013, Defendants Secured, Mandelbaum,

Zimmerman and Sage defrauded investors in a $5 million unregistered securities offering of
Secured’s preferred shares as well as an unregistered common share offering, and Tamda acted
as an unregistered broker, by marketing and selling Secured securities.
3.

Secured’s Private Placement Memorandum (“PPM”) for the preferred share

offering contained material misrepresentations and omitted material facts concerning the prior
securities fraud injunctions and other SEC-related disciplinary actions against Mandelbaum,
Zimmerman, and Sage; the use of investors’ proceeds; and Zimmerman’s retention and
compensation. As President, CEO, majority shareholder and a Director of Secured, Mandelbaum
was responsible for these misstatements and omissions in Secured’s PPM.
4.

Sage drafted the background section in the PPM that omitted material facts

concerning prior enforcement actions brought by the SEC and antifraud and other injunctions
issued against Mandelbaum, Zimmerman and Sage. Further, Sage misused Secured’s investor
proceeds to fund payroll and other expenses related to another company, Sarben Holdings, Inc.
(“Sarben”). Sage also assisted in the approval of an improper and undocumented “loan” from
Secured to HSC Holdings, LLC (“HSC”), an entity controlled by Mandelbaum.
5.

Mandelbaum used the proceeds of the HSC loan to purchase for herself an

indirect controlling interest in another company, Filewarden.com Corp. (“Filewarden”).
Mandelbaum also misappropriated Secured’s funds by transferring $131,000 to her daughter,
relief defendant Jennifer Austin (“Austin”).
6.

Zimmerman made material misrepresentations to investors regarding the risks of

investing in Secured.

In addition, Zimmerman made material misrepresentations to investors

regarding the use of investor proceeds and the future liquidity of shares in Filewarden when he

2

Case 9:16-cv-81490-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/24/2016 Page 3 of 26

raised approximately $1,017,500 by selling Filewarden stock to investors. In selling Secured and
Filewarden shares to investors, Zimmerman also acted as an unregistered broker.
7.

By engaging in this conduct, Defendants Secured and Mandelbaum violated

Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. §78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5
thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], and aided and abetted violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)(1)]. Zimmerman violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act
[15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b),
78o(a)(1)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. Tamda, Zimmerman’s company
through which he contracted to work for Secured and Filewarden, violated Section 15(a)(1) of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)(1)]. Sage aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of
the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)]
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5].

Unless restrained and enjoined, the

Defendants are reasonably likely to continue to violate the federal securities laws.
8.

The Commission also seeks conduct-based injunctions against Mandelbaum,

Zimmerman and Sage; disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains against Secured, Mandelbaum,
Zimmerman, Tamda and the Relief Defendants, including prejudgment interest thereon; an order
directing the Defendants to pay civil penalties; officer and director bars against Mandelbaum,
Zimmerman and Sage; an order against Mandelbaum, Zimmerman and Sage to comply with
prior district court and/or Commission orders; and any other relief that may be necessary and
appropriate.

VI.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A.

Background to the Secured Securities Offerings

19.

In March 2012, Mandelbaum formed Secured for the ostensible purpose of

providing senior citizens with loans collateralized by proceeds from their life insurance policies.
Styled as “Senior Lifetime Loans,” these advances would involve tax-free monthly payments to
qualifying seniors during their lifetimes to be repaid, with interest, from life insurance proceeds
upon their deaths.

However, aside from fundraising, Secured never commenced business

operations.
20.

From February 2013 through June 2013, Secured, through Zimmerman and

Tamda, offered and sold Secured Series A Preferred Stock at $50,000 per share (“Preferred
Shares”) pursuant to a $5 million unregistered securities offering (the “Preferred Share
Offering”).

In addition, Secured, through Zimmerman and Tamda, offered and sold Secured

common stock (“Common Shares”) to investors, the sale of which by Zimmerman violated his
penny stock bar.
21.

Pursuant to the Preferred Share Offering, Secured issued offering documents to

investors consisting of the PPM and two investment brochures. A total of 18 investors purchased
$1.15 million in Preferred Shares.

Three of the 18 investors also purchased $300,000 in

Common Shares.
B.

Zimmerman’s and Tamda’s Role in Secured’s Securities Offerings

22.

Despite being aware of Zimmerman’s prior antifraud and other injunctions, in

January 2013, Mandelbaum hired Zimmerman through his marketing company, Tamda, to serve
as Vice President of Investor Relations at a rate of $10,000 to $12,000 per month. In addition,

7

Case 9:16-cv-81490-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/24/2016 Page 8 of 26

Zimmerman received two million common shares of Secured as partial compensation for his
services.
23.

As Vice President of Investor Relations, Zimmerman (and Tamda, through

Zimmerman) marketed and sold Secured securities and was the primary contact for Secured
investors. In selling Secured securities, Zimmerman largely targeted previous investors in Vicor
Corporation (“Vicor”), a medical diagnostics company for which, during 2002-2003, he served
as Vice President of Corporate Development and sold Vicor securities.
bankruptcy protection in December 2012.

Vicor filed for

In soliciting these investors to purchase Secured

securities, Zimmerman touted the investments as an opportunity for former Vicor investors to
recoup their losses sustained as a result of Vicor’s bankruptcy. Specifically, Zimmerman told
Vicor investors that by investing in Secured, they would also receive five shares in a “new
company” that would hold Vicor’s medical technology.

Zimmerman told investors that these

“newco” shares were offered as a “courtesy” to Vicor investors who purchased Preferred Shares.
24.

From

January 2013 through June 2013, Zimmerman (and Tamda, through

Zimmerman), regularly and actively solicited the sale of Secured securities to over 110 potential
investors through phone calls, emails, the PPM, and investment brochures. Zimmerman advised
potential investors of the merits of investing in Secured, ultimately convincing 18 investors to
invest $1.45 million in Secured.

In addition to his monthly compensation and common stock,

Zimmerman was paid performance-based bonuses for his successful fundraising for Secured as
directed by Mandelbaum.
C.

Zimmerman’s Misrepresentations Concerning the Safety and Quality of the
Secured Investments

25.

In the course of marketing Secured’s securities, Zimmerman made material

misrepresentations concerning their safety and quality to investors. For example, in emails to
8

Case 9:16-cv-81490-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/24/2016 Page 9 of 26

investors, Zimmerman touted the investment as a “home run opportunity” and that there was “no
risk of losing capital.” Zimmerman represented that the returns would be “excellent” and that
the shares were “totally secured.” Zimmerman verbally advised at least one investor that the
investment opportunity was “phenomenal” and that the investments were “fully secured.”
26.

Zimmerman knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that these statements

were false and misleading. In reality, as stated in the PPM, the Secured investments involved a
high degree of risk with the possibility of total loss of investment. Zimmerman’s misleading
statements were material because a reasonable investor would consider it important to
understand the true risks of investing in Secured in making their investment decisions.
D.

Misrepresentations and Omissions in the PPM
i.

27.

Misrepresentations and Omissions in the PPM Concerning
Mandelbaum’s and Secured’s Fraudulent Use Of Investor Proceeds
The Secured PPM stated that Secured intended to use investor proceeds for,

among other things, offering and startup costs, initial working capital, and general corporate
purposes. The PPM stated that approximately 80% of the offering proceeds would be used for
making Senior Lifetime Loans and that the remaining funds would be used to cover management
compensation, broker-dealer fees, due diligence fees, consulting and licensing fees, and legal
costs.
28.

Despite the PPM’s representations that offering proceeds would be used for

Secured’s business purposes, in reality, Mandelbaum misappropriated offering proceeds for
various personal uses.

For example, in October 2013 Mandelbaum wired $131,000 from

Secured’s bank account to Austin, her daughter, to assist Austin with purchasing a home.
Neither Mandelbaum nor Austin provided any consideration to Secured in exchange for this
money.

And in July 2013, Mandelbaum, Sage, and another Secured Director approved an
9

Case 9:16-cv-81490-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/24/2016 Page 10 of 26

undocumented and improper “loan” to HSC, a Mandelbaum-controlled entity, pursuant to which
HSC received $300,000 in funds from Secured. Mandelbaum used those funds to acquire for
herself an indirect controlling interest in Filewarden.
29.

Mandelbaum and Sage also funneled offering proceeds by way of undocumented

“loans” and other payments to Sarben, an entity controlled by Sage, which Sage then used to
fund Sarben’s payroll and other expenses. These expenses were totally unrelated to Secured’s
stated business purpose and were contrary to the statements in the PPM concerning the use of
investor proceeds.

Mandelbaum also transferred Secured offering proceeds to other entities,

including to Filewarden, and to Intelakare Marketing (“Intelakare”) for services it performed on
behalf of Filewarden. As with the payments to Sarben and to HSC, these payments represented a
misuse of investor proceeds as they were for purposes unrelated to Secured’s purported business.
30.

Mandelbaum, as majority shareholder and President, CEO and a Director of

Secured, had ultimate authority over the representations contained in the PPM. Mandelbaum
knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that her misuse of offering proceeds rendered the
statements in the PPM concerning the legitimate use of the funds false and misleading. The
PPM’s statements and omissions concerning the use of proceeds were material because a
reasonable investor would consider it important to know in making their decisions to invest in
Secured that Secured and Mandelbaum intended to use offering proceeds to enrich company
insiders and pursue other business ventures instead of the purpose stated in the PPM.
ii.
31.

Misrepresentations and Omissions in the PPM Concerning the
Backgrounds Of Mandelbaum, Sage and Zimmerman

The PPM contained numerous material misrepresentations and omissions

concerning the backgrounds of Mandelbaum, Sage and Zimmerman.

For example, the PPM

contained a “Management” section, drafted by Sage, touting the professional experience of
10

Case 9:16-cv-81490-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/24/2016 Page 11 of 26

Secured’s officers and directors, including Mandelbaum and Sage.

The PPM described

Mandelbaum as having a “proven record of success” having “worked in the financial markets
sector for over 25 years” and orchestrated “mergers and acquisitions both domestically as well as
internationally.”

The PPM failed to disclose, however, that Mandelbaum was subject to

antifraud and other injunctions arising out of an SEC enforcement action taken against her in
SEC v. Hawa. The PPM also failed to disclose that Mandelbaum filed for bankruptcy protection
on five separate occasions and that at least one of the proceedings was dismissed for lack of
candor and cooperation. Similarly, the PPM touted Sage’s experience, including his work as a
marketing consultant, his previous variable annuities, life and health insurance licenses, and his
educational history back to 1984. However, the PPM did not disclose Sage’s 1993 antifraud
injunctions issued in SEC v. U.S. Dairy Corp. or his 1994 penny stock bar.
32.

In addition, the PPM did not mention Zimmerman at all, despite the fact that

Mandelbaum had hired Zimmerman as Vice President of Investor Relations one week before the
PPM was issued on February 15, 2013 at a rate of $10,000 to $12,000 per month. This omission
was material because the PPM expressly stated that Secured would “pay licensed broker dealers
a fee of 5% of funds raised in the offering” and the use of proceeds section stated that $250,000
was budgeted for broker dealer fees. At the time these statements were made, Secured had hired
Zimmerman – an unlicensed broker – to sell its securities, and had agreed to pay Zimmerman
while it did not have (and never established) a relationship with a licensed broker dealer to sell
its securities.
33.

Moreover, this failure to disclose Zimmerman’s involvement in Secured,

including his retention and compensation, as well as the failure to disclose his antifraud and other
injunctions entered against him in SEC. v Vector Medical Technologies were material omissions

11

Case 9:16-cv-81490-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/24/2016 Page 12 of 26

because Zimmerman was an officer, Secured’s sole fund raiser, its second highest paid
employee, and one of only three principal employees of Secured – with the other two being
Mandelbaum and Sage. The omissions are all the more glaring given that the PPM’s use of
proceeds section budgeted $450,000 for management compensation and specified Mandelbaum,
Sage, another director, and another member of management as payees while omitting
Zimmerman and his anticipated compensation.
34.

Mandelbaum and Secured knew or were severely reckless in not knowing that the

PPM omitted material facts concerning the backgrounds of Mandelbaum and Zimmerman,
because Mandelbaum was obviously aware of her own prior SEC-related disciplinary history and
prior bankruptcies and had previously been made aware by Zimmerman of his SEC-related
disciplinary history. Similarly, Sage knew or was reckless in not knowing that the Management
section of the PPM omitted material facts regarding the backgrounds of Mandelbaum and
Zimmerman, having previously been made aware by Mandelbaum and Zimmerman of their
SEC-related disciplinary histories.

Sage also knew or was reckless in not knowing that the

Management section of the PPM omitted reference to his own prior antifraud injunctions and
penny stock bar. These omissions were material because, in deciding whether or not to invest in
Secured, a reasonable investor would consider it important to understand that Secured’s three
principal employees had antifraud and other injunctions arising from previous SEC enforcement
actions and that Sage and Zimmerman had penny stock bars. Mandelbaum, as the President,
CEO, majority shareholder, and a Director of Secured, had ultimate authority over these
misrepresentations and omissions in the PPM.

12

Case 9:16-cv-81490-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/24/2016 Page 13 of 26

E.

Zimmerman’s Misrepresentations In Connection With Sales Of
Filewarden Stock

35.

From December 2013 through February 2014, Tamda lent $790,000 to

Filewarden by way of six convertible promissory notes (the “Notes”).

To fund the Notes,

Zimmerman caused Tamda to purchase 3,225,000 shares in Filewarden for $1,000 from two
existing investors and then resell approximately 2,035,000 of the shares at $0.50 per share to new
investors (all but one of whom had previously invested in Secured Common Shares and/or
Preferred Shares) for approximately $1,017,500, in violation of his penny stock bar. Tamda next
entered into the six Notes with Filewarden lending a total of $790,000 to Filewarden in exchange
for 15% ($118,500) in “prepaid interest”.

In reality, the prepaid interest was a disguised

commission for Tamda’s sale of the Filewarden shares. Zimmerman, through Tamda, ultimately
forgave the Notes.
36.

In the course of the Filewarden share sales to investors, Zimmerman touted

Filewarden’s prospects to investors by stating that if they invested in Filewarden they would
soon have the opportunity to sell Filewarden shares to market makers and broker dealers at a
substantial profit. Zimmerman also advised investors that the proceeds from Tamda’s sales of
the Filewarden shares would be used for Filewarden’s business purposes, including its business
operations and working capital.
37.

These statements were materially false and misleading. In reality, Zimmerman

knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that there were no immediate prospects of
liquidity and profitability for Filewarden’s shares. Further, rather than using the proceeds from
Tamda’s sale of the Filewarden shares for Filewarden’s business purposes, Zimmerman lent
approximately $227,500 of the proceeds to other entities, including HSC, Intelakare, White

13

Case 9:16-cv-81490-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/24/2016 Page 14 of 26

Orchid Design Group, an entity controlled by Sage, and Centuri Global, Inc., in exchange for
approximately $29,850 in prepaid interest.
38.

In addition to his sales of Tamda’s Filewarden shares, in late 2014 and early 2015,

Zimmerman raised approximately $115,000 for Filewarden by selling Filewarden shares held by
Haras Holdings at $0.20 per share to existing Filewarden shareholders. Through his involvement
in selling Haras Holdings’s Filewarden shares, Zimmerman again violated his penny stock bar.
