STRATEGIC CONSULTING ADVISORS, LLC,

ORDER DENYING
MOTION TO SEVER

Respondents Strategic Consulting Advisors, LLC (“SC Advisors”), and David I.
Osunkwo (“Osunkwo,” and, collectively with SC Advisors, the “Moving Respondents”) request
that we sever the claims against them from the remainder of this proceeding. The Moving
Respondents have not demonstrated the “good cause” required under Rule of Practice 201(b) for
severance, and we therefore deny the motion.1
I.

Background

On March 30, 2015, the Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (“OIP”)
against registered investment advisors Aegis Capital, LLC (“Aegis Capital”) and Circle One
Wealth Management, LLC (“Circle One”); their Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), Diane W.
Lamm (“Lamm”); and the Moving Respondents.2 The OIP alleges that, between January 2010
and December 2011, SC Advisors—a firm that offered compliance consulting and Chief
Compliance Officer (“CCO”) services to investment management firms—provided those

services to Aegis Capital and Circle One (collectively, the “Registrants”). Osunkwo, an attorney
and principal at SC Advisors, purportedly was designated to serve as the Registrants’ CCO and
reported to Lamm.
The OIP alleges that the Registrants failed to file timely and accurate reports with the
Commission and to maintain required books and records.3 On March 31, 2010, Aegis Capital
allegedly filed a false 2009 Form ADV, which Lamm signed, overstating its assets under
management (“AUM”) and number of advisory accounts.4 The OIP also alleges that Aegis
Capital failed to file a required annual update of that form in 2011. As a result, Aegis Capital
allegedly willfully violated Advisers Act Section 204 and Rule 204-1(a), which require a
registered investment adviser to amend its Form ADV “[a]t least annually, within 90 days of the
end of [its] fiscal year” and “[m]ore frequently, if required by the instructions to Form ADV.”5
SC Advisors and Osunkwo purportedly caused violations of these provisions.
As an additional basis for liability, the OIP alleges that, on March 31, 2011, “Osunkwo
filed a [2010] Form ADV for Circle One” that overstated Circle One’s AUM and number of
advisory accounts. According to the OIP, “pursuant to the contract with SC Advisors, Osunkwo
was responsible for, among other compliance-related matters, preparing, reviewing, and filing a
Form ADV for Circle One for the year ended December 31, 2010.” Osunkwo allegedly relied
exclusively on estimated information that Circle One’s Chief Investment Officer (“CIO”)
provided hours before the filing deadline. Although Osunkwo purportedly knew the information
was estimated, he allegedly misrepresented that the CIO certified the contents of Circle One’s
Form ADV to be true and correct and forged the CIO’s electronic signature on the filing. The
OIP alleges that Circle One, SC Advisors, and Osunkwo, among others, willfully violated
Advisers Act Section 207, which makes it “unlawful for any person willfully to make any untrue
statement of a material fact in any [Form ADV], or willfully to omit to state in any such
application or report any material fact which is required to be stated therein.”6

3

The OIP does not assert any claims against the Moving Respondents based on violations
of recordkeeping obligations. Rather, the Registrants are alleged to have willfully violated, and
Lamm to have willfully aided and abetted and/or caused violations of, Advisers Act Section 204
and Rule 204-2(a).
4

The OIP alleges that “Aegis Capital’s Form ADV for that year was filed by Osunkwo
based on information obtained from Lamm.” In an order on a motion for more definite statement
filed by the Moving Respondents, the law judge concluded that “[t]he Division [of Enforcement]
is not relying on Aegis’s 2009 Form ADV to demonstrate that Mr. Osunkwo and Strategic
Consulting are liable.” Aegis Capital, LLC, Administrative Proceedings Rulings Release No.

15 U.S.C. § 80b-4; 17 C.F.R. § 275.204-1(a).

The OIP also asserts claims against Lamm and Aegis Capital under the same provisions.

3
On June 10, 2015, the law judge stayed this proceeding in favor of a related criminal
proceeding against Lamm in which she was charged with securities and bank fraud.7 The law
judge found that the criminal proceeding arose “out of the same or similar facts” as the
administrative proceeding, and that “a stay w[as] . . . in the public interest because without a stay
both the criminal and administrative proceedings m[ight] be prejudiced.”8
On January 21, 2016, the Moving Respondents filed a motion requesting that we sever
the causes of action against them from those against the other respondents. They principally
argued that good cause existed to grant this relief because, given the stay, they were unable to
litigate the claims against them in a hearing and dispel “a cloud over Osunkwo’s reputation and
professional life” that they attributed to the proceeding. The Division of Enforcement opposed
the motion.
On February 29, 2016, the law judge lifted the stay because the “defendants in the related
criminal proceeding ha[d] pled guilty and the criminal trial has been canceled.”9 On March 7,
2016, the Moving Respondents filed a supplemental brief in support of their motion to sever. In
that brief, the Moving Respondents argued that good cause still existed to grant their motion
based on other arguments that they asserted in their initial briefing. The Moving Respondents
argue, among other things, that (1) because Osunkwo was the Registrants’ CCO, his actions
should be evaluated under a different standard than applies to the other Respondents; (2) the
claims against the Moving Respondents should never have been brought; and (3) the
Commission should pursue claims against the Moving Respondents in federal court, rather than
an administrative proceeding.10

Analysis

Under Rule of Practice 201(b), we may sever any proceeding with respect to one or more
parties on a showing of good cause.11 “[C]onsiderations of adjudicatory economy carry great

The Division subsequently filed a motion for leave to respond to the Moving
Respondents’ supplemental brief, which the Moving Respondents did not oppose. We grant the
Division’s motion and consider its attached response brief, as well as the supplemental brief to
which the Division responds.

weight in the analysis of [a] motion [to sever].”12 Consolidated hearings have advantages,
including that testimony and other evidence can be presented once on common issues, rather
than multiple times in separate hearings.13 Because we find that each of the Moving
Respondents’ three arguments in favor of severing the claims against them from the remainder of
this proceeding fails to establish good cause, we deny their motion.
First, the Moving Respondents argue that severance is appropriate because different legal
standards govern the conduct of the Registrants’ COO (Lamm) and their CCO (Osunkwo), and
“different factual questions, different witnesses, and different evidence . . . will be at issue.” The
Moving Respondents argue that “the Commission has implicitly recognized that there are
significant differences between the facts and legal standards related to the liability of CCOs—as
opposed to principals of the adviser—by bringing separate proceedings against each.”
We are not persuaded. Osunkwo is alleged to have filed the false Aegis Capital Form
ADV that Lamm signed, and the claims against the Moving Respondents involve their conduct
with respect to the Registrants’ Forms ADV and include claims that they caused predicate
violations by other Respondents. These matters necessarily present common issues of fact and
law.14 The claims against one respondent also need not be identical to those against another
respondent to support litigating the claims against them in a single proceeding.15 Indeed, our
Rules of Practice allow us to consolidate separate “proceedings involving a [single] common
question of law or fact.”16 And to the extent that the different legal standards apply to the

issues” “indicates that a single proceeding [against multiple respondents] will be more efficient
than separate trials from the standpoint of judicial economy and financial resources”).

required to show that (1) Phlo committed a primary violation, (2) an act or omission by A. Hovis
caused the violation, and (3) A. Hovis knew or should have known that her act or omission
would contribute to the violation.”).

See Finnerty I, 2005 WL 1963821, at *1-2 (rejecting respondents’ argument that claims

underlying claims against registered representatives, although proceeding included claims
against one representative that respondent was “not alleged to have supervised”).

alleged violations of each respondent,17 it is routine to adjudicate such cases in a single
consolidated proceeding when there is a common nucleus of facts, as there is here.18 Therefore,
administrative efficiency favors litigating such claims here in a single proceeding.
We also reject Moving Respondents’ argument that, because we have brought separate
administrative proceedings against CCOs and principals in other cases, we also should do so
here. The Commission’s decision whether to institute one or more proceedings is discretionary.
Our determination to pursue separate cases in one instance under the applicable facts and
circumstances does not mean that we must do so in every case. In any event, Respondents base
their argument on three settled proceedings in which we accepted separate offers of settlement
from individual respondents.19 These cases were not litigated, either together or separately, and
do not support severance here.
Second, the Moving Respondents argue that the case against them should not have been
brought because the Division is “doing nothing more than challenging the exercise of Osunkwo’s
good faith judgment” as a CCO. But this is an argument about the merits of the allegations
against Osunkwo and is not relevant to whether the Moving Respondents have established the
required good cause to sever the proceeding.
Third, the Moving Respondents contend that the claims against them should be severed
and the Commission should proceed in federal court based on a May 2015 Division policy
statement regarding its forum selection recommendations.20 Citing a single factor articulated in

In ruling on the Moving Respondents’ motion, we do not address the merits of the claims
against any of the respondents, which are pending before the law judge. Nor do we suggest any
view of them.

3274455, at *3 (same); cf. Bresner, 2012 WL 6608195, at *2 (declining to sever claims against
supervisor in light of the fact that “the Division commonly pursues combined proceedings
against alleged violators of the securities laws together with their supervisor(s)”).

See Division of Enforcement Approach to Forum Selection in Contested Actions,
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/enforcement-approach-forum-selection-contestedactions.pdf (setting out a nonexclusive “list of potentially relevant considerations” that “the
Division may in its discretion consider . . . in assessing whether to recommend that a contested
case be brought in the administrative forum or in federal district court”). “The Division’s forum
recommendations are in all cases subject to review and approval by the Commission.” Id. at 1.

the statement,21 Respondents argue that district court litigation is appropriate because we
purportedly we do “not have an inherent expertise” in resolving “unsettled and complex legal
issues of federal law” pertaining to Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-7. We disagree, but even
assuming that this factor weighs in the Moving Respondents’ favor, there are many other factors
that the Division considers under its policy statement, and the policy statement does not “create
any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter.”22 The
Commission has the sole discretion to determine whether to institute administrative proceedings
or file a civil enforcement action in district court, and the Commission appropriately invoked its
discretion to authorize an administrative proceeding for the case against the Moving
Respondents.23
Because they have failed to establish good cause for severing the claims against them
from the remainder of this proceeding, IT IS ORDERED that the motion of Strategic Consulting
Advisors, LLC, and David I. Osunkwo to sever is accordingly DENIED.
By the Commission.

See id. at 3 (“If a contested matter is likely to raise unsettled and complex legal issues
under the federal securities laws, or interpretation of the Commission’s rules, consideration
should be given to whether, in light of the Commission’s expertise concerning those matters,
obtaining a Commission decision on such issues, subject to appellate review in the federal courts,
may facilitate development of the law.”).

See 17 C.F.R. § 202.5(b) (providing that “[a]fter investigation or otherwise the

2014) (“Simply put, the Commission takes many considerations into account when deciding

Respondents also argue that, if the proceeding remains in the administrative forum,
proposed amendments to our Rules of Practice should apply to it. See Amendments to the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Exchange Act Release No. 75976 (Sept. 24, 2015), 80 Fed.
Reg. 60091, 60097 (Oct. 5, 2015) (stating that “we have determined that it would be useful to
publish these proposed rules for notice and comment before adoption”). Because these rules are
proposed, and not final, only the current Rules of Practice apply to this proceeding.
