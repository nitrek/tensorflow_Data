INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
March 21, 2016

APPEARANCES:

Cynthia A. Matthews and Kevin P. McGrath for the Division of
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
Summary

In this initial decision, I grant the Division of Enforcement’s motion for sanctions.
Respondent Gedrey Thompson is permanently barred from associating with an investment
adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent.
Procedural Background
The Commission initiated this proceeding in May 2015, by issuing an order instituting
proceedings (OIP). As authority, the OIP relies on Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940. OIP at 1; see 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(f). The Division alleges the following in the OIP.
Thompson incorporated GTF Enterprises, Inc., an investment company “for which he had sole
trading authority.” OIP at 1. From 2003 through 2009, he was GTF’s sole shareholder and acted
as an unregistered investment adviser. Id. In 2013, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York entered a final judgment by default, enjoining Thompson from
violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(1), (2), and (4) of
the Advisers Act. Id. at 2.
In June 2015, the Division notified my office that it had experienced certain challenges in
its efforts to serve Thompson with the OIP. See Gedrey Thompson, Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 2813, 2015 SEC LEXIS 2390 (ALJ June 15, 2015). During a later prehearing
conference, the Division proposed serving Thompson in Jamaica by publication. Tr. 4.
Following the conference, I ordered the Division to (1) explain its “efforts to locate and serve
Mr. Thompson”; (2) provide “evidence that Mr. Thompson is currently in Jamaica”; (3) explain
how it proposed to effect service by publication; and (4) provide “support for the proposition

that” service by publication “‘is not prohibited by’ Jamaican law.” Gedrey Thompson, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 2846, 2015 SEC LEXIS 2562 (ALJ June 23, 2015) (quoting 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(iv)). After the Division supplied the requested information and evidence, I
granted its request to serve Thompson by publication in two Jamaican newspapers and by email,
and I directed it to notify my office and the Office of the Secretary when it had completed
service. Gedrey Thompson, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2935, 2015 SEC LEXIS 2925
(ALJ July 16, 2015).
In September 2015, the Division filed a declaration showing that it completed service by
publication on September 11, 2015. Gedrey Thompson, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3200,
2015 SEC LEXIS 4094 (ALJ Oct. 6, 2015). After Thompson failed to answer the OIP, I ordered
him to show cause why this proceeding should not be determined against him. Id. Because
Thompson failed to respond to the order to show cause, I found him in default.1 Gedrey
Thompson, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3330, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4772, at *1 (ALJ Nov.
19, 2015).
The Division moved for sanctions in January 2016. The Division’s motion is supported
by twenty-four exhibits, described more fully below.
The findings and conclusions in this initial decision are based on the record and on facts
officially noticed under Commission Rule of Practice 323. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.323. Because
Thompson did not file an answer to the OIP or otherwise participate in this proceeding, I have
accepted as true the factual allegations in the OIP. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a). I have applied
preponderance of the evidence as the standard of proof. See Steadman v. SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 10104 (1981).
Findings of Fact
Thompson was an unregistered investment adviser from at least 2004 through 2009. Ex.
8 (Matthews Decl.) at 7; OIP at 1. He incorporated GTF Enterprises, Inc., which purported to be
an investment company. Id. Thompson “had sole trading authority” for GTF and was its only
shareholder. Id.
From January 1, 2004, through April 1, 2009, seventeen investors invested over $820,000
in GTF. Ex. 8 at 7. In order to convince investors to invest, Thompson and his associates gave
them a “Welcome to GTF Enterprises” brochure. See Ex. 16 (GTF Brochure); see also Exs. 15A
at 83, 15C at 211, 15D at 364, 15E at 393, 15F at 595-96.2 This brochure, which is replete with
grammatical errors, employs jargon seemingly calculated to convince the reader of GTF’s bona
fides through the use of sophisticated-sounding investing terminology. See Ex. 16. In the
brochure, Thompson proclaimed that GTF “Assume[d] All The Trading Risk,” and would give

I informed Thompson that he could, “within a reasonable time,” move to set aside the
default. Gedrey Thompson, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3330, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4772, at
*3 (ALJ Nov. 19, 2015). To date, Thompson has not moved to set aside the default.

its “partners . . . a pre-determined rate of interest, which is contractually binding.” Id. at 1. He
also said that while “GTF is a leverage company that day trade [sic] futures and stock options for
a profit,” id., it “specialize[s] in the risk-averse trading strategy,” id. at 9. Thompson explained
these seemingly disparate statements by asserting that GTF’s “focus . . . has been on the
Commodities, Futures, and Options sectors, which by nature are designed to regularly add 80 to
90 percent to the value of your portfolio on a consistent basis.” Id. at 9. Thompson would
reinforce these statements in form welcome letters given to investors after they invested. See Ex.
19 (welcome letters and account statements) at 1; see also Exs. 15A at 85, 15C at 224-25.
Thompson and his associates also spoke to potential investors in order to induce their
investment. Thompson and his associates targeted unsophisticated investors. Ex. 10 (Opinion
and Order Adopting Report and Recommendation in Part) at 5; Exs. 15A at 59, 15B at 187, 15C
at 207-08, 15F at 575-76. Many of those investors were immigrants. See Exs. 15A at 41, 15B at
156, 15C at 206, 15D at 358, 15F at 574. His investors included a kindergarten teacher, a hotel
room attendant, a worker at a group home for people with cerebral palsy, a home care nurse, a
retired transit worker, and a soldier recently returned from Iraq.3 Exs. 15A at 41-42, 15B at
154-55, 165, 15C at 205, 15D at 357, 15E at 389-90, 395, 15F at 574.
During a related criminal trial, witnesses recalled various ways Thompson and his
accomplices sought to convince them to invest. Investors were told that the risk of investing
with GTF was “very low,” they would not lose any money, or their principal was guaranteed.
Exs. 15A at 59-60, 15D at 366, 387-88, 15E at 393. One witness recalled that Thompson said he
could guarantee returns because he would invest in options. Ex. 15A at 108-09. Another
remembered Thompson saying investors could not lose money because Thompson invested in
commodities. Ex. 15B at 159-60. Thompson told a third investor that although GTF invested in
stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, he did not want to be specific about his strategy because it was
“a company secret.” Ex. 15E at 397.
Typically, investors were told that their investment was secure and that they could not
lose money. See Exs. 15B at 159-60, 15D at 366, 15E at 393. They were promised returns of
between 4 and 7%. Ex. 18; see Exs. 15A at 95, 108, 15B at 160, 164-65, 15C at 207, 222, 15E at
396, 15F at 577. In order to reassure investors that they were earning the returns that had been
guaranteed, Thompson provided bogus account statements. See Exs. 15A at 86-87, 15B at
164-65, 15C at 218, 225, 15D at 367, 386, 15E at 397-98. Many of these statements purported to
show haphazardly calculated or absurd returns. Ex. 19 at 2-9, 11-13, 15-21, 23-65; see Exs. 15A
at 94-96, 15B at 178, 15E at 409-10, 15F at 577. For over two years, Thompson reported that
Martin earned a 6% return compounded monthly, before he switched to 6% compounded
3

Several witnesses testified during the related criminal trial. Among these witnesses were
Crete Martin and Aron Donaldson. Martin’s brother, Garnet Locke, was serving in Iraq when he
wired money to Martin for her to invest with GTF. Ex. 15B at 165. While Donaldson was in the
Army, he was introduced to Locke, whom he knew had invested with GTF. Ex. 15E at 390.
Donaldson spoke to Locke in late December 2007 “after returning from overseas.” Id. at 391.
Donaldson invested $80,000 in February 2008. Id. at 395. Donaldson earned part of the money
he invested while serving overseas in the military. Id. Donaldson therefore invested shortly
after returning from Iraq.

quarterly, with some apparent calculation errors. Ex. 19 at 27-63. Thompson purported to pay
another investor interest at random intervals varying between three and seven months. See id. at
16-22. A third investor was told he had received a 7% return compounded nine months after he
invested and again three months later. Id. at 64-66. These account statements induced some
investors to give GTF more money. Ex. 15F at 577, 581.
In total, investors gave Thompson $821,707. Ex. 8 at 7. Thompson and his associates
returned $208,000 to investors. Id. Thompson operated GTF as a Ponzi scheme; payments to
earlier investors were made from funds invested by later investors. Ex. 10 at 9.
Thompson invested only $100,000 of the $820,000 investors gave him. Ex. 10 at 5. And
he did not use the $100,000 to engage in a “risk-averse trading strategy,” instead choosing to
engage in high-risk options trading. Id. Of the remaining amount, Thompson took $465,000 in
cash from GTF and diverted $52,000 to his personal accounts. Id.
In May 2010, the Commission filed an injunctive complaint against Thompson, GTF, and
two other individuals in relation to the actions described above. See Ex. 7. In its complaint, the
Commission alleged that Thompson violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act,
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(1), (2), and (4)
of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Id. at 4. The district court entered final
judgment by default as to Thompson and GTF in September 2013. Ex. 9. It permanently
enjoined him from violating each of the statutory and regulatory provisions cited in the
Commission’s complaint. Id. at 2-6. The court also ordered Thompson and GTF to disgorge
over $940,000 in profits and prejudgment interest. Id. at 6. Finally, the court referred the matter
to a magistrate judge to determine the amount Thompson and GTF should be required to pay as a
civil penalty. Id. at 7.
The magistrate judge later issued a report and recommendation recommending that,
although a third-tier civil penalty was warranted, no civil penalty should be imposed because he
could not ascertain the appropriate penalty amount. Ex. 10 at 2. On review, the district court
agreed that a third-tier civil penalty was warranted but did not adopt the recommendation that no
civil penalty be imposed. Id. at 2, 5-6. In doing so, the court held that:
Thompson, through GTF, deliberately orchestrated an investment
scheme that defrauded unsophisticated investors of hundreds of
thousands of dollars over a five year period. After duping those
investors about his qualifications and employment history,
Thompson misappropriated the vast majority of their investments.
Id. at 5. The court also held that Thompson’s “conduct clearly ‘involved fraud, deceit,
manipulation, or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement,’ and ‘directly or indirectly
resulted in substantial losses to other persons.’” Id. (quoting SEC v. Razmilovic, 738 F.3d 14,
38-39 (2d. Cir. 2013)). According to the district court, Thompson’s “conduct was not
‘isolated.’” Id. at 8. After analyzing various factors, the district court imposed penalties of
$130,000 against Thompson and $650,000 against GTF. Id. at 9. In April 2015, the district
court issued an amended final judgment incorporating the civil penalties it imposed. Ex. 11.

Conclusions of Law
Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act gives the Commission authority to impose a collateral
bar4 against Thompson if, among other things, (1) he was associated with or seeking to become
associated with an investment adviser; (2) he was enjoined “from engaging in or continuing any
conduct or practice in connection with . . . activity” as a broker, dealer, or investment adviser, or
“in connection with the purchase or sale of any security”; and (3) imposing a bar is in the public
interest. 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(e)(4), (f).
Because Thompson acted as an investment adviser, OIP at 1, the first factor is met in this
case. The second factor is also met. In the context of his conduct as an unregistered investment
adviser, the district court enjoined Thompson from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the
Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section
206(1), (2), and (4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Exs. 9, 11. It thus
enjoined him “from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with [his]
activity” as an investment adviser. See 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(e)(4), (f).
With respect to the third factor, whether imposition of a collateral bar would be in the
public interest, I must consider the public interest factors set forth in Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d
1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981). See Toby G. Scammell,
2014 SEC LEXIS 4193, at *23. The public interest factors include:
the egregiousness of the [respondent]’s actions, the isolated or
recurrent nature of the infraction, the degree of scienter involved,
the sincerity of the [respondent]’s assurances against future
violations, the [respondent]’s recognition of the wrongful nature of
his conduct, and the likelihood that the [respondent]’s occupation
will present opportunities for future violations.
Steadman, 603 F.2d at 1140 (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334 n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)).
Other relevant factors include the degree of harm resulting from the violation5 and the deterrent

A collateral bar is a bar that prevents an individual from participating in the securities
industry in capacities in addition to those in which the person was participating at the time of his
or her misconduct. See Toby G. Scammell, Advisers Act Release No. 3961, 2014 SEC LEXIS
4193, at *1 & n.1 (Oct. 29, 2014). Though Section 203(f) did not include a collateral bar until
the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on July 21,
2010, Thompson’s earlier misconduct can still serve as the basis for a collateral bar except as to
municipal advisors and nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. See Koch v. SEC,
793 F. 3d 147, 157-58 & n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2015).

effect of administrative sanctions.6 The public interest “inquiry is flexible[] and no single factor
is dispositive.” David F. Bandimere, Exchange Act Release No. 76308, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472,
at *109 (Oct. 29, 2015).
Before imposing a collateral bar, an administrative law judge must determine, based on
the evidence presented, “whether such a remedy is necessary or appropriate to protect investors
and markets.” Ross Mandell, Exchange Act Release No. 71668, 2014 SEC LEXIS 849, at *7
(Mar. 7, 2014) (quoting John W. Lawton, Advisers Act Release No. 3513, 2012 SEC LEXIS
3855, at *32 (Dec. 13, 2012)). I must therefore “‘review [Thompson’s] case on its own facts’ to
make findings regarding [his] fitness to participate in the industry in the barred capacities.” Id. at
*7-8 (quoting McCarthy v. SEC, 406 F.3d 179, 188 (2d Cir. 2005)). A decision to impose a
collateral bar “should be grounded in specific ‘findings regarding the protective interests to be
served’ by barring the respondent and the ‘risk of future misconduct.’” Id. at *8 (quoting
McCarthy, 406 F.3d at 189-90); see John W. Lawton, 2012 SEC LEXIS 3855, at *34-35.
Because “[t]he securities industry presents a great many opportunities for abuse and
overreaching,” it “depends very heavily on the integrity of its participants.” Bruce Paul,
Exchange Act Release No. 21789, 1985 SEC LEXIS 2094, at *6 (Feb. 26, 1985). As a result,
“conduct that violates the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws” should be “‘subject
to the severest of sanctions.’” Daniel Imperato, Exchange Act Release No. 74596, 2015 SEC
LEXIS 1377, at *17 (March 27, 2015) (quoting Chris G. Gunderson, Esq., Exchange Act
Release No. 61234, 2009 WL 4981617, at *5 (Dec. 23, 2009)).
The public interest and the need to protect investors support imposing a collateral bar.
Thompson and his accomplices used lies when they solicited investments from unsophisticated
investors. Thompson and his accomplices first told investors that they could not lose money and
would receive a guaranteed return. He used sophisticated-sounding investment jargon while
promising to use a low-risk strategy. In fact, it was a virtual certainty that investors would lose
money. Thompson stole most of the money he received and what little he did invest was
invested using a high-risk trading strategy.
In order to induce additional investment and deflect any investor’s concerns, Thompson
furthered his scheme by generating false account statements showing fanciful returns. He also
paid earlier investors with funds provided by later investors.
The fact that Thompson repeatedly lied in order to induce investment and then generated
bogus account statements while running a Ponzi scheme and misappropriating funds shows both
that his conduct was egregious and that he cannot be permitted to remain in the securities
industry. See Alfred Clay Ludlum, III, Advisers Act Release No. 3628, 2013 SEC LEXIS 2024,
at *17-18, *26-28 (July 11, 2013); James C. Dawson, Advisers Act Release No. 3057, 2010 SEC
LEXIS 2561 at *8-9, *15-16, *24 (July 23, 2010).

Thompson caused his victims substantial harm. His victims were not wealthy. In many
cases, they gave Thompson money they had saved over years working in difficult jobs for low
pay. As a percentage of what his victims had saved, the financial harm Thompson caused was
severe.
As the district court held, Thompson’s “conduct was not ‘isolated.’” Ex. 10 at 8.
Instead, Thompson’s conduct was recurrent. His scheme involved seventeen investors and lasted
over a period of years. Id. at 5.
There is no doubt that Thompson acted with scienter. He distributed a brochure replete
with lies and nonsensical jargon. He stole investment funds and tried to cover his tracks by
producing account statements with no connection to reality. When he bothered to actually invest
investors’ capital, he adopted a high-risk strategy, contrary to what he told investors. The fact
that Thompson was willing to repeatedly lie to investors over a period of several years shows
that he cannot be permitted to remain in the securities industry, where he would have the
opportunity to again harm investors.
Thompson has made no assurances against future violations. He avoided service in both
district court and in this proceeding, and eventually had to be served via newspaper publication
and email. Thompson therefore failed to participate in either matter. He has thus not shown that
he recognizes the wrongfulness of his conduct.
As the Commission has recognized, “the existence of a violation raises an inference that”
the acts in question will recur. Tzemach David Netzer Korem, Exchange Act Release No. 70044,
2013 SEC LEXIS 2155, at *23 n.50 (July 26, 2010) (quoting Geiger v. SEC, 363 F.3d 481, 489
(D.C. Cir. 2004)). Thompson’s occupation would “present[] opportunities for future illegal
conduct in the securities industry.” John W. Lawton, 2012 SEC LEXIS 3855, at *43. In
combination with Thompson’s failure to show that he recognizes the harm he caused and the
wrongfulness of his actions, this factor shows that the Commission’s interest in protecting the
investing public weighs heavily in favor of a collateral bar. Cf. Charles Trento, Exchange Act
Release No. 49296, 2004 SEC LEXIS 389, at *12 (Feb. 23, 2004) (“There can be little doubt that
[respondent]’s egregious misconduct over a more than three-year period carries with it the risk
that it may be repeated after he completes his sentence.”).
Finally, imposing a collateral bar will serve as a general and specific deterrent. 7 It will
deter Thompson and will further the Commission’s interest in deterring others from engaging in
similar misconduct.

7

While general deterrence is not determinative of the question of whether the public
interest weighs in favor of imposing a collateral bar, it is a relevant consideration. See Peter
Siris, Exchange Act Release No. 71068, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3924, at *48 n.72 (Dec. 12, 2013),
pet. denied, 773 F.3d 89 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see also PAZ Sec., Inc. v. SEC, 494 F.3d 1059, 1066
(D.C. Cir. 2007); Guy P. Riordan, 2009 SEC LEXIS 4166, *81 & n.107.
7

Given the foregoing, I find that it is in the public interest to impose a collateral bar
against Thompson.
Order
The Division of Enforcement’s motion for sanctions is GRANTED.
Under Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Gedrey Thompson is
permanently BARRED from associating with an investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal
securities dealer, or transfer agent.8
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Under that rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party
may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,
pursuant to Rule 111. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is
filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
The initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of
finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review
