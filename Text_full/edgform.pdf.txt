INDEX TO FORMS

As a filer, you will first need to determine whether you must meet your filing obligation via
EDGAR. The SEC Rules, particularly Regulation S-T, General Rules and Regulations for
Electronic Filings, outline which filings are mandated as electronic. This means that they must be
filed on EDGAR unless there is a case for Temporary or Permanent Hardship. (The rules for each
form and hardship exemptions may differ, so please see the regulation for specific information.)
Once you determine the form you need to file is electronic, then you need to identify the
submission type to use. For each submission type, there are specific tools that you can use.
As the EDGAR system has evolved using new technologies, tools have been added, changed, and
sometimes updated. There is no longer a single tool for preparing an EDGAR submission. Your
guide to the tools is this index. The first index allows you to lookup EDGAR electronic
submission types easily if all you know is the submission form type. Included in the last two
columns is detailed information about the tools that are used to create and/or assemble the filing.
The second index is easiest to use if you are more comfortable looking up your submission type
by Act.
Before using the indexes, it is important to understand the difference between the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Form/Schedule/Rule column reference and the EDGAR Submission Type
column. The index entries under the CFR Form/Schedule/Rule column refer to the titles of the
actual Form, Schedule or Rule named in the CFR. The Submission Type refers to Form variations
filers use on the electronic filing system to fulfill their filing obligation. For example, the paper
Form 15 is implemented on EDGAR as a number of different submission types including:
15-12B, 15-12G, and 15-15D. The last three digits represent the section of the 34 Act under which
the filer is obligated to file periodic reports.
Using either Index, find the submission type, check that the description of the form matches your
understanding of the purpose of the form, and identify the tool that should be used to create the
form. The options in this column are EDGARLink Online, EDGARLite and the corresponding
templates, and OnlineForms. There is a section in this manual describing in detail each of these
tools. Chapter 7, “Preparing and Transmitting EDGARLink Online Submissions,” describes
EDGARLink Online. Chapter 8, “Preparing and Transmitting EDGARLite Submissions,”
describes EDGARLite. Chapter 9, “Preparing and Transmitting Online Submissions,” describes
online submissions using the EDGAR OnlineForms/XML Website and EDGAR Filing Website.
The column entitled Filer-Constructed Technical Specifications should only be used by filers who
want to create their submissions without the use of EDGAR tools. These Technical Specifications
are available on the SEC’s Public Website. The Technical Specifications are delivered separately
and are not part of the Filer Manual.
Note: In Section 3.1, “Alpha/Numeric” for simplicity we include both the initial form and the
associated amendment in the Submission Type column.

Electronic Form Types by Act

This index will allow you to use the filing type to identify the EDGAR submission type and
finally the tool or template you can use to either create or assemble the filing. Each of the tools
and templates are covered in detail in separate sections of this document. The final column should
only be used by filers or software developers who construct filings outside of the SEC supplied
tools. EDGARLite templates can be downloaded from the OnlineForms/XML Website. FilerConstructed Technical Specifications are available on the SEC’s Public Website. Please refer to
these sites to determine if your version of the tool, template, or document is correct.
Note: Tools, templates, and documents will no longer be marked with a version number relating
to a software release. Some tools may be specific to submission types that remain the same
through several releases, instead of being updated with each new release. Therefore each
tool, template and manual will now be marked with its own version number, specific to
that particular item. You can find the most current versions on the website from which the
tools, templates, and manuals are downloaded. Be sure to verify that you have the current
version before filing.
Issuers are advised that filings with the submission types listed below will receive a “Filing Date”
identical to the EDGAR “Received Date” even if received after 5:30 P.M. Eastern time, which is
different than normal filings. In addition these filings will be disseminated until 10:00 P.M.
Eastern time. Normally filings received after 5:30 P.M. Eastern time will receive a filing date of
the next business day and will not be disseminated until the next business day.
The following submission types will receive a filing date identical to the EDGAR “Received
Date” and will be disseminated until 10:00 P.M. Eastern time:

included in the DOS submission as a
COVER document or must be submitted
