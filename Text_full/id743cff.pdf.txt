INITIAL DECISION
February 18, 2015

Nancy K. Ferguson for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
Respondent Michael Lee Mendenhall, pro se

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision bars Michael Lee Mendenhall (Mendenhall) from the securities
industry. Mendenhall was previously convicted of securities fraud and theft under Colorado state
law.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) instituted this proceeding with an
Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on September 12, 2014, pursuant to Sections 15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(Advisers Act). The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on People v. Mendenhall, No.
2011CR10094 (Colo. Dist. Ct. Apr. 20, 2012), appeal pending, No. 12CA1171 (Colo. App.)
(People v. Mendenhall), in which Respondent Michael Lee Mendenhall was convicted of securities
fraud and theft under Colorado state law. The Division of Enforcement (Division) filed a motion
for summary disposition on December 12, 2014, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a), in accordance
with leave granted. Michael Lee Mendenhall, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 1952, 2014 SEC
LEXIS 4054 (A.L.J. Oct. 28, 2014). Mendenhall did not file an opposition.
This Initial Decision is based on the pleadings and Mendenhall’s Answer to the OIP. There
is no genuine issue with regard to any fact that is material to this proceeding. All material facts that
concern the activities for which Mendenhall was convicted were decided against him in the criminal
case on which this proceeding is based. Any other facts in his filings have been taken as true,

pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). All arguments and proposed findings and conclusions that are
inconsistent with this decision were considered and rejected.
B. Allegations and Arguments of the Parties
The OIP alleges that Mendenhall was convicted of securities fraud and theft under Colorado
state law in People v. Mendenhall. The Division urges that he be barred from the securities
industry. Mendenhall argues that the proceeding should be dismissed as premature since his appeal
in People v. Mendenhall is pending.
C. Procedural Issues
1. Official Notice
Official notice pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323 is taken of the documents attached to the
Division’s Request for Official Notice in Support of Motion for Summary Disposition as Exhibits
1-6, which are materials from the courts’ official records in People v. Mendenhall, and from
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), records as well. See Joseph S. Amundsen,
Exchange Act Release No. 69406, 2013 SEC LEXIS 1148, at *2 n.1 (Apr. 18, 2013), pet. for review

Mendenhall’s August 14, 2014, Opening Brief in his appeal of People v. Mendenhall,
Case No. 12CA1171, Court of Appeals, State of Colorado (Div. Ex. 6). The Opening
Brief is also included in Mendenhall’s Answer as Exhibit A.
2. Collateral Estoppel
Mendenhall’s Answer includes the opening brief in his appeal of People v. Mendenhall,
which argues, inter alia, that the trial court made reversible errors in evidentiary rulings and jury
instructions. However, it is well established that the Commission does not permit criminal
convictions to be collaterally attacked in its administrative proceedings. See Ira William Scott,
Advisers Act Release No. 1752, 1998 SEC LEXIS 1957, at *8-9 (Sept. 15, 1998); William F.
Lincoln, Exchange Act Release No. 39629, 1998 SEC LEXIS 193, at *7-8 (Feb. 12, 1998).1 Nor
1

Nor does the Commission permit a respondent to relitigate issues that were addressed in a
previous civil proceeding against the respondent, whether resolved by consent, by summary
judgment, or after a trial. See Jeffrey L. Gibson, Exchange Act Release No. 57266, 2008 SEC
2

does the pendency of an appeal preclude the Commission from action based on a conviction. See
Joseph P. Galluzzi, Exchange Act Release No. 46405, 2002 SEC LEXIS 3423, at *11 n.21 (Aug.
23, 2002); Charles Phillip Elliott, Exchange Act Release No. 31202, 1992 SEC LEXIS 2334, at *11
(Sept. 17, 1992). If Mendenhall is successful in overturning his conviction, he can request the
Commission to vacate any sanctions ordered in this proceeding (or to dismiss the proceeding, if it is
still pending).2
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
Mendenhall was convicted in People v. Mendenhall after a jury trial in 2012 of numerous
counts of securities fraud, in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. § 11-51-501, and theft, in violation of
Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-4-401. Div. Ex. 1 at 1; Div. Ex. 3. All counts are felonies. Div. Ex. 1 at 1;
Div. Ex. 3; Div. Ex. 4 at 42-43. Mendenhall was sentenced to twenty-five or thirty years of
imprisonment. See Div. Ex. 1 at 2 (sentencing docket showing thirty years); Div. Ex. 4 at 43-45
(court pronouncing sentence for each count on which Mendenhall was found guilty, totaling thirty
years); Div. Ex. 4 at 45 (court summarizing sentence as twenty-five years). He was also ordered to
pay restitution of $1,408,667.77.3 Div. Ex. 1 at 3, Div. Ex. 4 at 46.

The court expressed doubt as to whether Mendenhall would ever be able to repay this sum. Div.
Ex. 4 at 42.

Mendenhall was associated with UVEST Financial Services Group, Inc. (UVEST), a registered
broker-dealer and investment adviser. See Michael L. Mendenhall BrokerCheck Report at 4
available at http://brokercheck.finra.org (last visited Jan. 27, 2015).4 From January 2010 to
October 2010, he was associated with Colorado Financial Service Corporation (CFSC), a registered
broker-dealer and investment adviser.5 Id. Mendenhall was indicted on April 13, 2011. Div. Ex. 3
at 1.
Mendenhall was hard-working and honest for most of his working life but turned to criminal
misconduct when financially pressed in the economic downturn that affected his real estate
investments. Div. Ex. 4 at 37, 39-40. The conduct for which Mendenhall was convicted involved
sixteen victims. Div. Ex. 5 at 7-14. He met the victims through Bankers Life. Div. Ex. 4 at 39.
However, he considered them to be “life long friends/family not just policy holders.” Answer at 3.
They trusted him. Div. Ex. 4 at 36, 38. They were elderly and far from wealthy, but he talked each
one into loaning him, a large part or all of, his or her life savings and issued promissory notes. Div.
Ex. 4 at 38-39, 41. The court instructed the jury that the term “security” includes a note. Answer at
Ex. A, p. 4. By the time of his April 20, 2012, sentencing, Mendenhall had been in custody for 317
days. Div. Ex. 4 at 45-46. The court commented on Mendenhall’s demeanor as displayed at the
trial and sentencing: sometimes contrite and sometimes arrogant. Div. Ex. 4 at 40. Mendenhall
never meant to hurt the investors and apologized to them. Div. Ex. 4 at 33-36, 39-40. However, he
has never recognized that he had done anything wrong. Div. Ex. 4 at 40.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Mendenhall has been convicted within ten years of the commencement of this proceeding of
a felony that “involves the purchase or sale of any security . . . ; arises out of the conduct of the
business of a broker, dealer, . . . investment adviser, [or] insurance company . . . ; [or] involves the
larceny, theft, . . . or misappropriation of funds, . . . or substantially equivalent activity” within the
meaning of Sections 15(b)(4)(B)(i), (ii), (iii) and 15(b)(6)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act and Sections
203(e)(2)(A), (B), (C) and 203(f) of the Advisers Act.
Mendenhall’s Opening Brief in his appeal of People v. Mendenhall (Exhibit A of his
Answer) includes the argument that the loans or notes at issue were not “securities” within the
meaning of applicable law. However, Mendenhall was convicted of theft as well as securities fraud,
and the Commission has the authority to bar individuals based on convictions involving dishonesty
that are not securities-related. See Kornman v. SEC, 592 F.3d 173, 180 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citing
with approval the Commission’s policy that “the importance of honesty for a securities professional
is so paramount that [the Commission has] barred individuals even when [a respondent’s]
conviction was based on dishonest conduct unrelated to securities transactions or securities

securities business is “a field where opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly.” Soliman, 1995
SEC LEXIS 968, at *10.
Mendenhall suggests in his Answer that others, such as his former employers, do not have
clean hands with regard to the events at issue in People v. Mendenhall. Assuming, arguendo, that
others were aware of or contributed to Mendenhall’s conduct, that does not relieve him from
responsibility. See James J. Pasztor, Exchange Act Release No. 42008, 1999 SEC LEXIS 2193, at
*15-18, *25-29 (Oct. 14, 1999) (supervisor held liable for registered representative’s execution of
violative directed trades; supervisor had tried to stop the trading but was overruled by brokerdealer’s owner who was friendly with the customer); Charles K. Seavey, Advisers Act Release No.

911 (9th Cir. 2004).
IV. SANCTION
As the Division requests, a collateral bar will be ordered.6
A. Sanction Considerations
The Commission determines sanctions pursuant to a public interest standard. See 15 U.S.C.
§§ 78o(b)(6), 80b-3(f). The Commission considers factors including:
6

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act),
which became effective on July 22, 2010, provided collateral bars in each of the several statutes
regulating different aspects of the securities industry. Mendenhall’s conviction occurred after July
22, 2010. Additionally, even if some of his underlying wrongdoing occurred before that date, the
Commission has determined that sanctioning a respondent with a collateral bar for pre-Dodd-Frank
Act wrongdoing is not impermissibly retroactive, but rather provides prospective relief from harm
to investors and the markets. John W. Lawton, Advisers Act Release No. 3513, 2012 SEC LEXIS
3855 (Dec. 13, 2012); see also Tzemach David Netzer Korem, Exchange Act Release No. 70044,
2013 SEC LEXIS 2155 (July 26, 2013); Johnny Clifton, Securities Act Release No. 9417, 2013
SEC LEXIS 2022 (July 12, 2013); Alfred Clay Ludlum, III, Advisers Act Release No. 3628, 2013
SEC LEXIS 2024 (July 11, 2013).

the egregiousness of the defendant’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant’s assurances
against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his
conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant’s occupation will present opportunities
for future violations.
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334
n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)). The Commission also considers the age of the violation and the degree of
harm to investors and the marketplace resulting from the violation. Marshall E. Melton, 2003 SEC
LEXIS 1767, at *4-5. Additionally, the Commission considers the extent to which the sanction will
have a deterrent effect. Schield Mgmt. Co., Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS
195, at *35 & n.46 (Jan. 31, 2006). The public interest requires a severe sanction when a
respondent’s past misconduct involves fraud because opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly
in the securities business. See Vladimir Boris Bugarski, Exchange Act Release No. 66842, 2012
SEC LEXIS 1267, at *18 n.26 (Apr. 20, 2012); Richard C. Spangler, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 12104, 1976 SEC LEXIS 2418, at *34 (Feb. 12, 1976).
B. Sanction
As described in the Findings of Fact, Mendenhall’s conduct was egregious and recurrent,
involving at least sixteen elderly victims whom he met as policy holders of Bankers Life and who,
he knew, placed their trust in him as a friend, and who could not afford the loss of their modest life
savings. As such there was a high degree of scienter. Mendenhall’s previous occupation, if he were
allowed to continue it in the future, would present opportunities for future violations. Absent a bar,
he could re-enter the securities industry. The violations, which grew out of financial pressure
Mendenhall faced from the financial crisis, are thus relatively recent but could not, in any event,
have continued after his 2011 incarceration. Mendenhall has not recognized the wrongful nature of
his conduct. The degree of direct financial harm to investors is quantified in the $1,408,667.77 in
restitution he was ordered to pay, and, as the Commission has often emphasized, the public interest
determination extends beyond consideration of the particular investors affected by a respondent’s
conduct to the public-at-large, the welfare of investors as a class, and standards of conduct in the
securities business generally. See Christopher A. Lowry, Investment Company Act of 1940 Release
No. 2052, 2002 SEC LEXIS 2346, at *20 (Aug. 30, 2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003); Arthur
Lipper Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 11773, 1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at *52 (Oct. 24, 1975). A
conviction involving dishonesty requires a bar, and because of the Commission’s obligation to
ensure honest securities markets, an industry-wide bar is appropriate.
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, MICHAEL LEE MENDENHALL IS
BARRED from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer,
municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization and from
participating in an offering of penny stock.7
7

Thus, Mendenhall will be barred from acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, or agent; or
otherwise engaging in activities with a broker, dealer, or issuer for purposes of the issuance or
6

This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of
the Initial Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then that party shall
have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving
such motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The Initial Decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the Initial Decision shall not become final as to that party.
