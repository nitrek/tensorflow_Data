In the Matter of
DIANE D. DALMY, ESQ.

ORDER DENYING PETITION TO LIFT
TEMPORARY SUSPENSION AND
DIRECTING HEARING

Diane D. Dalmy, Esq., an attorney licensed to practice law in Colorado, has filed a
petition, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii) 1 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, to lift her
temporary suspension from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney. For
the reasons set forth below, we deny the motion and set the matter down for hearing before an
administrative law judge.
On August 1, 2013, the Commission filed a civil complaint against Dalmy and others in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging, among other things,
that Dalmy, a transaction attorney for penny stock company Zenergy International, Inc., issued
opinion letters that improperly concluded that her and others' shares of Zenergy were unrestricted
and freely tradable.2 As Zenergy's stock price increased in conjunction with promotional activity
and other misconduct, the complaint alleged, Dalmy sold her shares to unsuspecting investors for
illicit profits.3 The complaint charged Dalmy with violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of
19334 and sought injunctive and monetary relief against her.5

appearing and practicing before the Commission . . . may, within 30 days after service upon him
or her of the order of temporary suspension, petition the Commission to lift the temporary
suspension").

On September 30, 2015, the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of
the Commission on its claims against Dalmy.6 The district court found that Dalmy violated
Section 5 based on an undisputed factual showing that Dalmy sold Zenergy shares, those shares
were unregistered, and no exemption to the registration requirements applied.7 The district court
did not find that Dalmy's conduct was not willful. The district court has not ruled on the
Commission's pending requests for monetary and injunctive relief against Dalmy.
On December 22, 2015, we issued an order instituting proceedings against Dalmy and
imposing a temporary suspension8 pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(B).9 In the order, we found it
"appropriate and in the public interest" that Dalmy be temporary suspended from appearing or
practicing before the Commission as an attorney based on the findings of the Northern District of
Illinois, a court of competent jurisdiction, in an action brought by the Commission, that Dalmy
violated Section 5. We advised Dalmy that the temporary suspension would become permanent
unless she filed a petition to lift it within thirty days pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii).10 We further
advised that, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(iii),11 upon receipt of such a petition, we would either
lift the temporary suspension, schedule the matter for hearing, or both.
On December 28, 2015, Dalmy filed this timely petition requesting that the temporary
suspension be lifted because it is "premature." In the petition, Dalmy states that "[b]ecause
Section 5 liability is strict liability,[12] the court did not—in fact it would not—opine on Dalmy's
mental state, i.e., willfulness."13 Dalmy argues that "until such time as the court determines

Commission in any administrative proceeding to which he or she is a party to have violated

Contrary to Dalmy's suggestion, a finding of willfulness does not require an intent to violate
the law, but merely an intent to do the act which constitutes the violation. See, e.g., Steadman v.
SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1135 (5th Cir. 1979), aff'd on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981); Arthur

willfulness, it is premature for the Commission to suspend her on the basis that the court has not
opined that she did not act willfully." In her view, a temporary suspension "where a 'no
willfulness' finding is not possible because the issue is not yet before the court cannot possibly
be the intent of Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(B)." Dalmy further argues that "[i]n the remedies phase, the
court will consider whether Dalmy acted willfully." Consequently, Dalmy believes that it is
"appropriate, reasonable, and justified for the SEC to consider a suspension after the court makes
a remedies determination where willfulness is an issue."
The Commission's Office of the General Counsel ("OGC") has opposed Dalmy's petition
and argues, inter alia, that "the intent of Rule [102(e)(3)(i)(B)] is to empower the Commission to
protect the investing public by enabling the Commission to issue a temporary suspension when a
professional has been found by a court to have violated the securities laws, unless a court
specifically finds that the professional did not act willfully." According to OGC, "[i]n the
absence of any finding by the Court regarding willfulness, the professional is given ample
opportunity in an administrative proceeding before an ALJ to demonstrate whether a lesser, or
no, suspension is warranted." Thus, OGC argues, "[b]ecause the predicate for a temporary
suspension has been met—i.e., a finding of a securities law violation with no finding that it was
not willful—the Commission's temporary suspension of Dalmy was not premature and should
not be lifted." OGC also argues that the Commission need not wait until after the district court
makes its remedies determination before ordering a temporary suspension. In support of this
argument, OGC relies by analogy on cases holding that a pending appeal from a district court
order on which a temporary suspension is based does not justify lifting the temporary
suspension.14
The plain language of Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(B) authorizes us to temporarily suspend a
professional who appears or practices before us without a preliminary hearing if, as here, the
professional has been found by a court of competent jurisdiction, in an action brought by the
Commission, to have violated the federal securities laws, and there was no finding that the
professional did not act willfully.15 Dalmy does not cite, nor have we uncovered, any authority
holding that a finding of willfulness is a prerequisite to ordering a temporary suspension under
Rule 102(e)(3). Rather, as we recently stated, Rule 102(e)(3) "reflects our determination that a

finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that a respondent has violated securities laws , or
that an injunction against future violations is warranted, is a sufficient standard of unfitness for
practice before the Commission that we 'will afford a hearing only to consider mitigating or other
factors why neither censure nor temporary or permanent disqualification should be imposed.'"16
Continuing Dalmy's temporary suspension pending a hearing before a law judge serves
the public interest and protects the Commission's processes.17 As discussed, Dalmy was found
by a district court to have violated Section 5. That finding alone provided a statutory basis for us
to temporarily suspend her without a preliminary hearing.18 Dalmy is licensed as an attorney and

This result is consistent with the results reached in similar cases. See, e.g., Virginia K.

(denying respondent's motion to lift a temporary suspension under Rule 102(e)(3)(i)(B) that was
based on findings by a district court, entered on summary judgment, that she aided and abetted
antifraud violations; determining that continuation of temporary suspension pending a hearing
served the public interest and protected the Commission's processes notwithstanding the
assertion that a temporary suspension was premature because the district court's summary
judgment order was not a final order); Stewart A. Merkin, Esq., Exchange Act Release No.

summary judgment, that respondent violated antifraud provisions; determining that continuation
of temporary suspension pending a hearing served the public interest and protected the
Commission's processes notwithstanding the assertion that respondent was seeking appellate
review of district court's summary judgment order); Michael C. Pattison, CPA, Exchange Act
Release No. 64598, 2011 WL 2169094, at *2 (June 3, 2011) (denying respondent's motion to lift
temporary suspension that was based on both a jury's findings of securities law violations and a
district court's imposition of an injunction; determining that continuation of temporary
suspension was warranted notwithstanding the assertion that it was "premature" because
respondent filed a "meritorious motion to amend the [final judgment]" with the district court and
intended to "appeal any adverse ruling on his motion" to the court of appeals); Ware, 2005 WL
399675, at *1 (denying respondent's motion to lift a temporary suspension under Rule
102(e)(3)(i)(A) and (B) that was based on a district court's entry of a default judgment and
issuance of a permanent injunction finding that respondent had violated antifraud, registration,
and reporting provisions; concluding that continuation of temporary suspension was warranted
notwithstanding assertion that "the Commission did not have jurisdiction to enter the temporary
suspension because the injunction is not a final order" and attaching a motion that he filed with
the court to set aside the default judgment).

Although Dalmy argues that we should wait until after the district court makes its remedies
determination before ordering a temporary suspension, we have already determined that it was in
the public interest to temporarily suspend Dalmy, see supra note 8, and Dalmy has not provided,
nor do we see, any persuasive reason why we should forebear from acting promptly under Rule

has not expressed an intent to stop working in securities law. She "thus remains in a position to
harm the Commission's processes if the temporary suspension is lifted and she is permitted to
appear and practice before the Commission pending the outcome of a hearing."19
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Diane D. Dalmy, Esq.'s petition to lift the temporary
suspension is denied, and that the temporary suspension will remain in effect pending a public
hearing and decision in this matter; it is further
ORDERED that this proceeding be set down for a public hearing before an administrative
law judge in accordance with Commission Rule of Practice 110. As specified in Rule of Practice
102(e)(3)(iii), the hearing shall be expedited in accordance with Rule of Practice 500; and it is
further
ORDERED that the administrative law judge shall file an initial decision no later than
210 days from the date of service of this order.
