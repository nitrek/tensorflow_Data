ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On January 7, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A hearing is scheduled to commence on January 28, 2016.
On January 19, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a declaration of service
establishing that Respondents were served in accordance with Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), (iv),
17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), (iv), by January 15, 2016. Because service was made by mail,
Respondents’ answers to the OIP are due January 28, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160,
.220(b). If Respondents fail to timely file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding, they will
be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against them, and the registrations of
their securities will be revoked. See OIP at 3, 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
I ORDER that the January 28, 2016, hearing is POSTPONED sine die, and a telephonic
prehearing conference shall be held on February 18, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. EST, if the proceeding
has not been resolved by then.
