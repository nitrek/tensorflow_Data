1984 marks the 50th anniversary of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Fifty years ago, in the depths of the depression, the nation's securities markets
were demoralized. Today, they are by far the best capital markets the world has
ever known-the broadest, the most active and efficient, and the fairest.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has played an important role in the
restoration of public confidence in the nation's securities markets. With the help
and support of the Congress, the executive and the judiciary, the investing public,
industry, the financial community, the legal and accounting professions and legal
scholars, the Commission has discharged with distinction its mandate to protect
investors and maintain fair and orderly markets.
The Commission's illustrious history over the past half century is a testimonial
to the generations of exceptional and dedicated individuals who have served in a
wide variety of capacities, ranging from clerks, secretaries and staff professionals
to Division Directors and Commissioners. They have been widely acknowledged
to be among the best in government. They have built the Commission's reputation. They have set the standards of excellence to which we all aspire.

Gentlemen:
Fiscal 1984, the Commission's 50th Anniversary, was another record year. Investor
protections and corporations' financing flexibility were increased, and unnecessary paperwork and other expenses, ultimately borne by investors, were reduced.
Fiscal 1984 highlights include:
• Results: Through automation, paperwork reduction and other staff initiatives,
record results (or the highest levels in years) were achieved in the volume and
efficacy of enforcement actions, investment company and adviser inspections,
broker-dealer examinations and reports processed, self-regulatory organization
inspections, full disclosure filings processed and appellate and other litigation
cases opened. Since fiscal 1981, the annual volume of these activities has been
increased by 19% to 78%, with 5% less personnel. Also, the 1981-84 average
annual rate of accounting firm peer reviews, under SEC oversight, has been
increased more than 100% over the 1978-80 rate.

• Edgar: The pilot high-speed electronic filing system was commenced on
schedule (September 24, 1984). It is intended to accelerate dramatically the
filing, processing, dissemination and analysis of corporate information; revolutionize the manner in which. many investment decisions are made and executed; and contribute to the efficiency of the securities markets .
• Insider Trading Sanctions Act: The Commission proposed this Act, which was
signed by the President in August. Most inside traders have only been compelled to disgorge their profits, which has not been much of a deterrent. Now they
will be subject to fines, up to three times their profits. Criminal fines for securities law violations were also increased-from
the $10,000 established 50
years ago, to $100,000 per count.
• Revised Shelf Registration Rule: This rule has increased the largest and most
creditworthy corporations' financing flexibility and reduced their expenses, for
the benefit of their shareholders, by hundreds of millions of dollars per annum,
without compromising full disclosures. These large savings are principally due
to keener competition among underwriters, and among institutions which purchase the bulk of such issues, whether under shelf or conventional offerings.
The Commission is continuing to monitor the effects of the rule and will take
appropriate action, if warranted .
• Proxies And Mutual Fund Prospectuses: Simplification and improvement of
these documents have reduced their cost and increased their utility to investors .
• New Options: New options authorized by the Commission permit investors
and corporations to hedge stock market, foreign currency and other risks at a
fraction of the cost of other means of hedging or reducing such risks .
• Intermarket Surveillance: At the Commission's initiative, the exchanges are
installing electronic intermarket stock and options surveillance systems and
transaction audit trails for the quick identification of inside traders and market
manipulators. Audit trails also reduce transaction reconciliation costs, ultimately borne by investors .
• Shareholder Communications: Legislation proposed by the Commission will
telescope the time and expense of corporations' communications with their
shareholders, by requiring banks to provide corporations with the identity of
those shareholders, who do not object.
• Bush Task Group: The recommendations of Vice President Bush's Task Group
on the Regulation of Financial Services include consolidation within the SEC of
the filings of all publicly owned banks and thrifts, and other major legislative
initiatives for the benefit of investors and depositors, which are expected next
year.
• Budget: Registration, transfer and other fees exceeded the Commission's budget by 29%. In the past two fiscal years, such fees have exceeded the Commission's budget by over $35 million.

iv

The 50th Anniversary year results are a tribute to the Commissioners and the
fine men and women who serve throughout the agency. In addition to ongoing
programs, the future offers the prospect of major improvements in the regulatory
structures of the financial service industries and the exciting potential of high
speed, electronic dissemination and analysis of corporate information.
Sincerely,

Court orders obtained by the Commission required defendants to divest themselves of illicit profits amounting to more than $12 million, either as disgorgement
or restitution to defrauded investors. The Commission also obtained freeze orders to protect over $23 million in assets until courts could make appropriate
dispositions.
In fiscal 1984, the Commission provided substantial assistance to the Department of Justice and state authorities in connection with criminal cases; 61 criminal indictments or informations were obtained in such cases, compared with 75
in 1983.

Introduction
The enforcement program seeks to preserve the integrity, efficiency and fairness of the securities markets by enforcing the Federal securities laws. These laws
provide civil and administrative remedies designed to rectify past violations and
prevent future violations.
The primary civil remedy is a Federal court injunction. An injunction directs the
subject to comply with the law in the future. If it is violated, contempt of court
proceedings may result in imprisonment or imposition of fines. Courts may also
issue orders providing additional equitable relief, including restitution, disgorgement and other appropriate remedies.

Administrative proceedings may be brought against regulated entities: principally broker-dealers, investment companies, investment advisers, and their associated persons, as well as transfer agents. Such administrative proceedings
may result in censure, imposition of limitations on activities, or suspension or
revocation of registration. (Regulated entities may not conduct business without
an effective registration.) Remedies against associated persons include censure,
suspension or a bar from association.
Issuers of securities are subject to administrative proceedings for failure to
comply with the disclosure requirements and certain other provisions of the
Exchange Act. Individuals causing such failures may be named as respondents
under legislation enacted on August 10, 1984 as part of the Insider Trading
Sanctions Act. Respondents may be ordered to comply with applicable provisions
upon specified terms and conditions, or to take steps to effect compliance.
Issuers also may be named as respondents in certain proceedings authorized by
the Securities Act. In addition, the Commission may publish reports of investigation under Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act.
Criminal sanctions for Federal securities law violations include fines and imprisonment for up to five years for each violation. During fiscal 1984, enactment
of the Insider Trading Sanctions Act increased the maximum criminal fine for
most Exchange Act violations from $10,000 to $100,000.
Close working relationships have been developed with other law enforcement
authorities, both in the United States and abroad, to assist in the investigation and
prosecution of cases. Such authorities include foreign policy officials, state prosecutors and securities regulators, the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorneys'
offices. The Commission also cooperates closely with enforcement efforts of selfregulatory organizations, including the National Association of Securities Dealers
(NASD) and the various national securities exchanges.
Program Areas
One of the strengths of the enforcement program is its breadth and depth.
Enforcement activity during fiscal 1984 included cases concerning corporate
reporting and accounting;' insider trading;2 securities offerinqs-' regulated entities and associated persons." market manipulation:" changes in corporate control;6 related party transactions." contempt proceedinqs." and delinquent filing
cases against issuers? and individuals.'?
Corporate Reporting and Accounting-Financial disclosure cases continued to be a high priority in 1984. For example, in fiscal 1984, the Commission brought 33 cases containing significant allegations of financial disclosure violations against issuers or their employees. This compares with 25
such cases in 1983 and 23 in 1982. The Commission brought 18 cases
alleging misconduct on the part of accounting firms, partners or employees
in 1984, including four of the issuer disclosure cases set forth above. There
were 11 enforcement actions against accountants or accounting firms in 1983
and 3 in 1982.
Classified by their principal violation category, there were 36 injunctive actions and administrative proceedings during 1984 involving issuer fraud or

2

reporting violations (excluding delinquent filing cases). This compares with
29 such cases reported in 1983. (The classification
by principal violation
category omits 11 of the 1984 financial disclosure cases reflected in the paragraph above because those cases were classified in other categories.)
Typical financial disclosure cases involve improper valuation of assets or
liabilities; improper recognition of revenue or expenses; or failure to provide
adequate disclosure concerning the ability of a corporation to meet its obligations. For example, in one case the Commission
alleged that although the
Issuer reported pre-tax earnings of approximately
$33 million over a three
year period, earnings in fact were less $14.5 million.'! In another case, the
Commission brought an injunctive action agamst a publicly-held
bank holding company and two individuals for overstating the holding company's earnings and failing to comply with the reporting requirements with respect to
other material developments.F
Many cases concerning financial disclosure by reporting companies also
involve enforcement of the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). In one, a reqistrant allegedly engaged in improper revenue
recognition practices and, as a result, materially overstated its 1981 revenues
by approximately
$22.1 million and its net earnings for that year by $5 rrullion.l-' In fiscal 1984, 10 actions were brought to enforce the accounting
provisions of the FCPA, compared with 12 in 1983 and 10 in 1982. These 32
cases represent 78% of all such actions brought since enactment
In

of the FCPA

1977.

Violations with respect to non-financial
Information have included material
misstatements or omissions concerning corporate operating information, and
failure to disclose material facts concerning the remuneration
of corporate
officers and other related parties. In addition, the Commission
brought 15
delinquent filing actions during the fiscal year, compared with 22 in 1983 and
9 in 1982.
Insider Trading-In general, insider trading is the purchase or sale of securities by persons in possession of material non-public information relating
to such securities in violation of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust
and confidence. These practices undermine the expectation of fairness and
honesty that is the basis of investor confidence
in the nation's securities
markets. Trading of standardized option contracts, coupled with tender offers
and other acquisitions,
has increased opportunities
for those With materiel
non-public information to reap large profits.
The Commission brought 13 insider trading cases dunnq fiscal 1984. This
compares with 24 commenced
during fiscal 1983,20 in 1982 and a total of
132 brought since 1949.
Cases included actions

involving

Information

concerning

tender

offers,

mergers, business combinations
and other acquisitions of securities, as well
as proposed changes to dividend payment policies.l? Individual defendants
included an officer and director of a corporanon.'> employees of law firms
representing the involved corporations.!"
an officer of an investment banking
firm;'? and varIOUS tippees.P' ln one case, the Commission is alleging, among
other things, that an employee of a law firm communicated
material nonpublic

information

to eight other defendants

concerning

proposed

acquisi-

3

tions of various corporations.'? Disgorgement of approximately $1.9 million is
being sought.
In another case, the Commission alleged that a former reporter for the Wall
StreetJournal misappropriated material, non-public information concerning articles to be published in the Journal's "Heard on the Street" column,2° and disclosed it to a broker for a major brokerage firm who agreed to split profits from
securities transactions with the reporter. Three other individuals are alleged to
havetraded securities while in possessionof the information.
Securities Offering Violations-Some
issuers fail to register public offermgs of their securities, although required to do so by the Securities Act. Some
purport to rely on exemptions to registration requirements which are not
available. Some violate antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws by
making material misrepresentations or omissions in connection with a securities offering.
During 1984, the Commission brought 48 cases principally involving offering violations by issuers and other persons. That compares with 41 such cases
in 1983 and 48 in 1982. The 1984 figure does not include 17 cases involving
offering violations by regulated entities. The latter are discussed below under
"Regulated Entities and Associated Persons."
In one case, an oil and gas exploration company and its chief executive
officer allegedly violated antifraud provisions of the Securities Act in connection with a $16.5 million public offering of common stock and warrants.P The
complaint alleged that a registration statement filed with the Commission and
a prospectus issued in connection with the offering materially underestimated
the amount of the proceeds to be used to repay bank debt, failed to disclose
plans to purchase other companies with a portion of the proceeds and materially overstated estimates of proved oil and gas reserves. A related administrative proceeding was brought against an individual associated with the underwriter of the offering 22
An administrative proceedmg was also initiated against a New York brokerdealer firm and three individual respondents alleging violations of antifraud
provisions in connection with a $3 million securities offering. The alleged
fraud consisted of closing the offering before all customer purchase price
payments had been received and misrepresentation of, or failure to disclose,
material facts. The Commission also alleged that the firm failed reasonably to
supervise two of the respondents, and persons subject to their supervision.P
Regulated Entities and Associated Persons-Regulated entities include
broker-dealers, investment companies, investment advisers and transfer
agents. Fiscal 1984 actions involvinq regulated entities ranged from books
and records violations to attempts to defraud customers. There were 128
cases involving regulated entities compared with 110 in fiscal 1983 and 118 in
1982. Seventeen cases involved securities offering violations by regulated
entities. Of the other cases, 65 primarily involved broker-dealers, 28 investment advisers, 6 investment companies and one transfer agent. The total
includes 11 actions in which customers or employees were alleged to have
defrauded a regulated entity.
During fiscal 1984 the Commission revoked the registration of 12 firms,
suspended 10 and censured 14. This compares with 19 revocations. 3 suspen-

4

sions and 12 censures in fiscal 1983; and 11 revocations, 9 suspensions and
28 censures in 1982.
There were 43 individuals barred, 40 suspended and 12 censured in fiscal
1984. During fiscal 1983 there were 54 bars, 44 suspensions, and 8 censures
compared to 44 bars, 82 suspensions and 19 censures in the prior year.
Broker-dealers and underwriters who engage in questionable or improper
sales practices are subject to Commission scrutiny. In one proceeding, the
Commission's Atlanta, Fort Worth, New York and Washington Regional Offices
coordinated an investigation of several offices of a large nation-wide brokerdealer firm.24 The investigation resulted in institution of an administrative
proceeding against the firm charging that certain of its registered representatives engaged in fraudulent practices relating to the sale of options and securities, including conversion of customer funds, and that the firm failed
reasonably to supervise its employees in connection with this misconduct. In
another proceeding, a broker-dealer firm allegedly engaged in violations of
the financial responsibility, bookkeeping and financial reporting requirements, and failed reasonably to supervise persons subject to its supervision
who committed the vlolations.P The firm was censured and directed to comply with undertakings concerning the supervision and training of employees,
the adoption of written compliance procedures and the establishment of a
special audit function.
In a third case, a broker-dealer firm located in New York, and two of its
senior officers, were charged with operating a "boiler room" and defrauding
purchasers of bonds issued by the Washington Public Power Supply System
(WPPSS) and other municipal securities.e? The Commission's complaint alleged that many customers were charged excessive and unfair prices by the
defendants.
Market ManipuLation-The Commission, the securities exchanges and the
NASD engage in surveillance of trading on the national securities exchanges
and the over-the-counter markets to ensure their integrity. During 1984, 12
cases involving market manipulation were brought; there were 11in 1983 and
10 in 1982.
One Commission case alleged that an individual engaged in a fraudulent
free-riding scheme to amass and maintain a large portfolio of securities without meeting his obligation to pay for such securities by issuing more than $2
million in checks on accounts that had insufficient funds. In addition, the
Commission alleged that the individual artificially inflated the price of a corporation's common stock in order to profit from its sale and increase his
buying power in margin securities accounts holding the stocks?
In another case, a corporation and three individual defendants allegedly
engaged in a course of conduct to enhance artificially the market value of a
corporation's securities and to induce persons to purchase securities of the
corporation and its affiliated partnerships. According to the complaint, the
defendants created a false impression of the value of the corporation's interests of oil and gas leases and of the identity of its management. The defendants are also alleged to have caused the value of the corporate defendant's
common stock and warrants, and securities of another corporation that
owned a controlling interest of the corporate defendant, to be artificially in-

5

creased by the dissemination of materially false and misleading information.28
A third case involved alleged manipulation of a corporation's initial public
offering to cause the stock to sell in the after-market at a premium price.
Thereafter, various persons allegedly participated in creating the false appearance of active interest In the security-?
Changes in Corporate Control-Sections
13 and 14 of the Exchange Act
govern proxy solicitations and the filing of reports by persons or groups who
make a tender offer or acquire beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a
class of equity securities registered with the Commission. The requirements
are intended to ensure that investors have the material information needed to
make informed investment or voting decisions concerning potential changes
in the control of a corporation. Eleven enforcement actions were brought in
this area during fiscal 1984, while 5 were brought in 1983 and 9 were commenced in 1982.
In one case, the Commission alleged that a corporation and an individual
failed to correct proxy solicitation materials. The defendants allegedly failed to
disclose an agreement involving the issuance of a controlling interest in the
corporation's common stock and a change in control of its board of directors,
and failed to correct statements in the proxy materials which had become
materially false and misleading with the passage of time."?
In another case, the Commission alleged that a company's proxy solicitation
materials did not disclose the facts and circumstances concerning a potential
leveraged buyout. In a release regarding this case, the Commission noted that
adequate and accurate disclosure with respect to anti-takeover and other
proposed defensive measures is necessary. The Commission particularly
stressed the need for disclosure of management's interest in proposed transactions; the ultimate effect of proposals upon shareholders; and other material effects of the adoption of antitakeover and other proposed defensive
rneasures-'!

In another case, three individuals allegedly made false and misleading
statements in connection with materials regarding a joint proxy solicitation
and tender offer. The materials allegedly failed to disclose the true identity of
the soliciting purchasers, the true financial condition of the corporation, and
that a primary purpose of the tender offer was to oust the corporation's manaqernent.V
Other Developments
Waiver by Conduct-The
Commission issued a release requesting comments on a concept to address problems encountered in investigations and
enforcement actions involving persons who purchase or sell securities in the
U.S. markets from foreign countries, particularly when such transactions are
effected through institutions in nations with secrecy laws.33 The concept for
analysis is whether the purchase or sale of securities in the U.S., whether
directly or indirectly, should serve as a "waiver by conduct" of the applicability
of foreign secrecy laws. Under the concept, the purchase or sale would constitute an implied consent to disclosure of information and evidence relevant
6

to the transaction for purposes of any Commission investigation, administrative proceeding or action for injunctive relief authorized by the Federal securities laws that may arise out of the transaction. The purchase or sale also
would constitute the appointment of the U.S. broker that executes the transaction as an agent for service of process or subpoenas and a consent to the
exercise of personal jurisdiction by the U.S. courts and the Commission. In
addition, the release seeks comments concerning the concept of codifying
the authority of U.S. district courts to impose sanctions where the Commission seeks a court order compelling the production of evidence or information related to a purchase or sale of securities within the U.S.
Efforts to Obtain Evidence From Abroad-The Commission was successful in three separate efforts to obtain evidence from abroad in connection with
an insider trading case filed in 1981.34 On May 16, 1984, the Swiss Federal
Tribunal granted a request for information concerning the identity of certain
individuals that allegedly purchased securities while in possession of material
non-public information through various Swiss banks. This represents the first
instance in which the Commission has successfully employed provisions of
the 1977 Treaty Concerning Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between
the United States and Switzerland in a case involving insider trading. In addition, the Commission successfully employed letters rogatory to obtain assistance in gathering additional evidence located in the United Kingdom and
France.
Beneficial Ownership Reports-A special effort was launched to assure
that corporate officers and directors, and shareholders of more than 10% of a
class of registered equity securities, file timely beneficial ownership reports.
The Commission brought 31 civil actions pursuant to Section 21(e) of the
Exchange Act to obtain orders commanding compliance with the applicable
requirements.
Sources for Further Inquiry-The
Commission publishes litigation releases describing civil injunctive actions and criminal proceedings involving
securities-related violations. Among other things, they report the violative conduct alleged by the Commission, or the Department of Justice or found by the
court, and the disposition or status of the case. In addition, orders instituting
administrative proceedings or providing remedial relief are published.
The enforcement actions brought during fiscal 1984 in each major program area are listed in the footnotes to this report. Appropriate references are
made to the litigation releases or orders published in the SEC Docket.
Copies of the SEC Docket may be reviewed at the Commission's headquarters or in a regional office. Further information can be obtained by contacting

Full Disclosure System
Key 1984 Results
The full disclosure system is administered by the Division of Corporation Finance. The disclosure system is designed to provide investors with full and
accurate material information, fostering investor confidence, contributing to the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets, facilitating capital formation and inhibiting fraud in public trading, voting and sale of securities. In fiscal year 1984, about
11,000 publicly-held concerns filed 67,466 full disclosure filings with the Commission, an increase of 3% over fiscal 1983.
Filings given a full review continued to be received at record or near record
levels. First-time Securities Act registration statements totaled 1,183; merger
proxies exceeded the 1983 level (320 vs. 254); and small offerings registered on
Form S-18 increased 13% over 1983 to 710 filings.
EDGAR and Computer-Assisted

Review

Since 1980, the staff has increasingly used computers to screen all filings to
identify those which present significant disclosure issues and to facilitate review.
During fiscal 1984, the Commission met its goal of establishing a pilot EDGAR
system. A group of approximately 150 companies volunteered to participate
initially and a pilot branch to process the electronic filings was established in the
Division of Corporation Finance. After extensive development and training, the
first electronic filing was received by the Commission on September 24, 1984.
(See further discussion p. 51, Management Sec.)
The Proxy Review Program
On May 9,1984, the Commission proposed for comment a new form to be
used to register securities under the Securities Act in connection with certain
business combination transactions.P Designed to replace two existing, frequently unwieldy registration forms, the proposed form addresses disclosure
needs in mergers and exchange offers by applying principles of integrated disclosure. including utilization of the three-tiered registration system and incorporation by reference. This initiative is one of two proposals relating to business
combinations to improve the effectiveness of this prospectus by requiring that the
information be presented in a more meaningful and accessible formal A second
such initiative is the publication for comment of a comparable form designed to
be used by and in connection with business combination transactions involving
foreign private cornpanies.V The proposed forms will provide both transactional
and voting information so that, like their predecessors, they will function as both
registration and proxy statements. The comment period on these two forms
closed on August 17, 1984 and September 14, 1984, respectively. Commission
action is anticipated during the next fiscal year.

On August 9, 1984, the Commission adopted amendments governing disclosure of the background of management of registered companies.>? The
amendments, stemming from hearings held in December 1983 by the Subcommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on "Fraud and Abuse in the 'Hot
Issues' and 'Penny Stock' Markets," willrequire companies to discuss violations of
the Commodity Exchange Act, as well as other legal proceedings now required to
be disclosed, in describing the background of directors and executive officers.
The amendments require companies not subject to the Exchange Act's periodic
reporting requirements for the last 12 months to disclose, with respect to control
persons, bankruptcy proceedings, criminal proceedings, securities and commodities violations and certain other legal proceedings material to a voting or
investment decision in which such control persons have been involved over the
last five years. In addition, companies organized within the last five years must
include such disclosure with respect to promoters. The disclosure will be provided in registration statements, proxy statements and annual reports.
Also, in April 1984, the Commission transmitted to Congress proposed legislation seeking an amendment to Section 14(b) of the Exchange Act authorizing the
Commission to regulate the proxy processing activities of banks, associations and
other entities that exercise fiduciary powers, in the same manner that the Commission currently regulates the activities of broker-dealers. The proposed legislation is based on recommendations contained in the report issued in 1982 by the
Commission's Advisory Committee on Shareholder Communications. The bill
was introduced in the House on May 22, 1984 and in the Senate on June 20,
1984.
Tender Offer Reforms

In February 1983 the Chairman appointed the Advisory Committee on Tender
Offers to reviewtechniques for acquisition of control of public companies and the
laws applicable to such transactions. All 50 of the Advisory Committee's recomrnendations-t" were considered at an open meeting on March 13, 1984. Chairman
Shad testified on Commission positions regarding these recommendations on
March 28, 1984 before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer
Protection and Finance of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Current activity includes a three-part response to the Advisory Committee Report
(1) proposed reform legislation, introduced in the House on May 22,1984 and in
the Senate on June 20, 1984; (2) further study on certain issues; and (3) proposed rulemaking. As to the second phase, the Commission issued a release
soliciting public comment on two-tier tender offers and open market or privately
negotiated purchase programs, respectively-'? Rulemaking initiatives in other
areas relating to tender offers are underway.
SEC Government-Business
Formation

Forum On Small Business Capital

The third annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital
Formation was conducted in Washington, D.C. on September 12-14, 1984. Approximately 170 small business executives, accountants, attorneys, financial ana10

Iysts, broker-dealers, venture capital investors, financial advisors, bankers and
government officials met to discuss issue papers containing recommendations
on taxes, securities, and state capital formation programs. Participants also discussed issues raised in a financial services panel featuring leading members of
the financial service and business community. The Forum is conducted under
the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980 in which Congress directed
the Commission to conduct an annual Government-Business Forum "to review
the current status of problems and programs relating to small business capital
formation" and to include as participants other Federal agencies and leading
small business and professional organizations concerned with capital formation.
SECINASAA

Cooperation

During the year, the Commission worked closely with the North American
Securities Administrators Association (NASM). At NASM's spring meeting, there
was prepared and released a summary report and agenda of areas of joint
consideration to increase efficiency of the dual regulatory process through enhanced cooperation and uniformity. A procedure under which Regulation D interpretive letters are reviewed by a NASM committee to help develop interpretations
that will be uniform on both the Federal and state levels is part of that effort.
Implementation of the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption (ULOE), designed to
coordinate with Regulation D on the state level, is another example of SEC/
NASM cooperation. As of the end of the fiscal year, 29 states had adopted some
form of ULOE.
Foreign Securities
On October 6, 1983, the Commission adopted revisions to the exemption from
Exchange Act registration for securities of foreign issuers that have not voluntarily
sought entry into U.S. markets."? The revisions require foreign securities to be
registered under the Exchange Act in order to be quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (NASDAQ). Canadian
securities already on NASDAQ have until January 1986 to either register or
withdraw. Other foreign securities already on NASDAQ were grandfathered indefinitely.
Other Rulemaking

Initiatives

Resales of Securities Acquired In Certain Business Combination Transactions-Resale
requirements for persons receiving securities in registered
business combination transactions were revised; a release was issued on
February 10, 1984.41 The revisions provide that persons will not be considered
to be underwriters and may freely transfer their securities if they are not
affiliates of the issuer and either (1) have owned the securities for at least three
years, or (2) have owned the securities for at least two years and the issuer
satisfies certain public information requirements.
Option Material-On
March 22, 1984 the Commission adopted amendments to its rule excluding certain instructional or educational materials dis-

11

seminated about standardized options from the definition of a prospectus.F
They are intended to permit fuller explication of the nature of newly developed
option products in this rapidly evolving field. The revised rule will now apply to
advertisements and to other written materials provided that no specific security is identified and that the name and address of a person from whom a
copy of any definitive options disclosure document can be obtained is included.
Suspension of Reporting-The Commission adopted amendments to its
rules permitting the immediate suspension of the Section 15(d) reporting
obligation under the Exchange Act on March 22, 1984.43 The new rules help
standardize and simplify the suspension critieria for all issuers and provide
additional relief from the reporting burden for small issuers.
Confidential Treatment-On March 23,1984 the Commission adopted an
amendment to its rules governing information eligible for confidential treatment under the Securities Act.44 The revised rule extends availability of confidential treatment under the Securities Act to the same types of information
that may be granted confidential treatment in issuers' annual reports under
the Exchange Act. It also conforms the procedure for requesting confidential
treatment under the Securities Act to that under the Exchange Act.
Electric and Gas Utilities-On June 15, 1984, the Commission adopted an
amendment to the Electric and Gas Utility Guides under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act.45 The amendment, based on a rulemaking petition
filed by the California Association of Utility Shareholders, will require electric
and gas utilities which issue securities at a price below underlying book value
per share to disclose, in transactional and periodic reports, where material,
the extent of any resulting book value dilution and its effects on their business
and financing plans.
Broker-Dealer Research Reports-On September 19,1984, the Commission adopted an amendment to its rule governing distribution of research
reports by broker-dealers engaged in the underwriting or distribution of a
security discussed in the report.46 The rule provides safe-harbor protection
from registration violations for reports which meet its conditions. The amendments reflect the principles underlying the integrated disclosure system by
imposing somewhat different conditions on the availability of that safe-harbor
on companies eligible to use short-form registration than on other companies.
Accounting

Matters

Audited financial statements and related financial disclosures form the cornerstone of the Commission's disclosure system under the Federal securities laws,
which give the Commission broad authority to prescribe the financial statements
to be filed, their form and content, and the accounting standards and procedures
to be followed in their preparation. Historically the Commission has relied initially
on the private sector to establish and to improve accounting principles and
auditing standards, and to develop a self-regulatory mechanism for compliance.
Oversight of the private sector activities and accounting-related regulatory initiatives ensures that standards and procedures are mel
12

Accounting Standards and Principles
Since 1973, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has been recognized by the Commission as the private sector body responsible for setting
financial accounting and reporting standards.?? Oversight of the process involves
not only Commission review of the standards set, but also the direct participation
of staff members and, in some instances, the Commission itself in the initial
setting of standards. Staff members monitor developments closely and are in
frequent contact with FASB staff and Board members, participate in meetings,
public hearings, and task forces. The Commission monitors progress of FASB
projects and meets periodically with the FASB to discuss topical issues. For
example, application of the conceptual framework project to the FASB's standard
setting activities was discussed in an open Commission meeting in May 1984.
In addition to monitoring FASB activities, the staff identifies emerging accounting problems in the review process and refers these items to the FASB for
consideration. In the past year these referrals have resulted in the FASB issuing a
technical bulletin on accounting for certain aspects of research and development
arrangements and adding to its technical agenda a project to clarify the accounting for conversion of convertible debt. Both of these issues surfaced in the
Commission's review process.
Although generally satisfied with FASB's performance, the Commission believes that there is need for more timely guidance on emerging issues. The FASB,
in response to the concerns about lack of guidance on emerging issues, has set
up a Task Force on Emerging Issues which is discussed below. The Commission
has a representative on the Task Force and is hopeful that this will provide adequate mechanism for timely response to emerging issues. Certain significant
developments during the past year and current agenda items are discussed
below.
Conceptual Framework Project-In prior annual reports the Commission
has expressed disappointment at the FASB's lack of progress on its Conceptual Framework Project. The Project has been part of the FASB's Technical
Agenda for virtually all of its ll-year history. It now appears that the FASB is
nearing completion of the Project as its scope is presently defined.
In December 1983, the Board issued an exposure draft of a proposed
concepts statement entitled Recognition and Measurement in Financial
Statements of Business Enterprises. This phase of the project deals with
initial recognition of, subsequent changes in, and appropriate measurement
of the asset, liability and equity elements in financial statements.
As the Project nears completion, it is still not clear how the concepts developed
will ultimately impact the evolution of the financial accounting and reporting
model. The FASB believes that the concepts statements developed in this Project
are useful in that they provide a common frame of reference in deliberations on
new standards. The ultimate success or failure of the Conceptual Framework
Project, however, can only be evaluated by assessing the FASB's future standard
setting activities.
Timely Financial Reporting Guidance-As noted above, the Commission
has encouraged the FASB to provide more timely guidance on emerging
issues and is supportive of recent initiatives in this area: (a) broadening the
13

scope of FASB technical bulletins (issued by the FASB staff without formal
deliberations by FASB members and without the entire due process procedures required of FASB statements or interpretations), and (b) establishing
an advisory group to assist the FASB in identifying emerging accounting and
reporting issues.
FASB technical bulletins provide guidance on specific, relatively narrow
accounting issues, and have been issued as interpretations of existing accounting literature. By expanding the scope of technical bulletins, they can
now address areas not directly covered by existing pronouncements. Technical bulletins will now be exposed for a short comment period to selected
knowledgeable individuals and will be discussed at public FASB meetings.
The Commission fully agrees with the expanded role of technical bulletins
and has encouraged their issuance whenever practicable.
The Commission's Chief Accountant is a participant in the Emerging Issues
Task Force, an advisory group composed of accounting practitioners and
representatives of major associations of preparers, such as the Financial Executives Institute and the National Association of Accountants. The primary
objective of the group is problem identification. The Task Force will not formally resolve issues nor will it be authorized to publish solutions to issues
considered, although minutes of its meetings are available. It may, however,
indicate that no immediate action by the FASB is needed if consensus from
discussion suggests that a diversity in practice is not likely to evolve.
The Emerging Issues Task Force is in its development stage; it is too early
to tell if it will effectively fulfillits stated objectives. A key test willbe its ability to
(a) bring emerging problems to the FASB's attention, and (b) limit the development of divergent practice when a consensus is reached by the group on
appropriate accounting for an emerging issue. If a consensus is not reached,
the FASB's challenge will be to resolve the issue through issuance of a technical bulletin or otherwise in a timely fashion.
Accounting for Pensions-Today, it is difficult for even sophisticated analysts to assess the impact of pensions on companies' financial positions and
results of operations and to make valid comparisons between companies. The
FASB's current project on pensions, which has proposed substantial changes
in the way companies account for pensions, addresses a significant financial
reporting matter that requires resolution. The FASB has issued a document
entitled Preliminary Views, disseminating its inclination on the appropriate
accounting for pension plans. Its tentative conclusions on this matter have
generated interest and controversy in the business community. This project,
more than any other in its history, has demonstrated the difficulty in promulgating "generally accepted" standards which may be unpopular with the
FASB's constituents. Clearly, the FASB's leadership role in establishing accounting standards is being tested by this project.
Consolidations-The
FASB project on consolidations and the equity
method was placed on its technical agenda in January 1982. Unfortunately,
there has been little progress. The Commission believes that determinations
made in the project should help resolve many of the important accounting
issues encountered by registrants and their accountants. Resolution of these
fundamental issues should lessen the Commission's need to address ancillary
14

issues through its interpretive process-as was done this year with the issuance of staff accounting bulletins on consolidation-related issues of "push
down" accounting and "carveouts" (see subsequent discussions).
Other Projects-Last year the FASB issued standards on accounting for
extinguishment of debt, transfers of receivables with recourse, and futures
contracts.t" Other important items on the FASB's technical agenda include
accounting for income taxes, employee stock compensation plans, computer
software development costs as well as a number of practice problems. The
Commission concurs with the FASB's decision to address these issues, particularly the accounting for employee stock compensation plans and computer
software development costs.
Accounting-Related

Rules and Interpretations

The Commission's accounting-related rules and interpretations serve primarily
to supplement generally accepted accounting principles (GMP), as established
by the private sector, by addressing areas unique to Commission filings or where
GMP is not sufficiently explicit. Principal accounting requirements are embodied
in Regulation S-X governing the form and content of, and requirements for,
financial statements filed under the Federal securities laws.The Commission also
publicizes its views on various accounting and financial reporting matters in
Financial Reporting Releases(FRRs).
During the past year, revised rules for income recognition by oil and gas
producers following the full cost method were adopted."? Rules which would
require the presentation of industry segment data for interim periods were proposed.P? As part of that proposal, other amendments were proposed, or comment invited, on matters involving interim reporting, segment data and offbalance sheet financing, issues cited by analysts and other users of disclosure
documents as important and in need of improvement. Rules calling for increased
disclosures about property-casualty insurance reserves also were proposed in
response to investors' and analysts' concerns.P!
As the private sector changes financial reporting standards, the Commission
evaluatesits requirements, modifying or eliminating those that become unnecessary. For example, in December 1983, the Commission rescinded an earlier
release prohibiting accounting for "quasi-defeasance" arrangements as extinguishments of debt.52 In quasi-defeasance arrangements, assetsare dedicated
to the future servicing and repayment of currently outstanding debt; the debt itself
may not have been legally satisfied under the terms of the debt agreement. The
FASB addressed this issue and concluded that quasi-defeasance debt extinguishments should be recognized only in limited circumstances involving a "trust" type
arrangement. Thereafter, the Commission rescinded its previous release. However,in its release announcing that rescission, the Commission included certain
interpretive language to clarify possible ambiguities in the new standard and to
emphasize that its provisions should be strictly applied. The Commission and
FASB have closely monitored the implementation of the new standard, and the
FASB has provided timely response to ensure that its application is limited to a
very narrow set of circumstances.

15

In light of the Commission's integrated disclosure program, the need for an
earlier interpretation on the circumstances under which an accountant's report
qualified on a "going concern" basis may be acceptable in Securities Act filings
was re-evaluated.ln February 1984 the Commission rescinded that interpretation,
permitting registrants to offer securities, notwithstanding an accountant's report
qualified because of uncertainties about an entity's continued existence. Registrants are still required to provide full disclosure of the financial difficulties, and
plans to overcome them.53 Financial statements will continue to be considered
defective, however, if these statements are prepared on a going concern assumption but should more appropriately be based on the assumption of liquidation or
ifthe amounts and classifications of assets and liabilitiesin the statements should
be otherwise adjusted.
The staff periodically issues Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs) to inform the
financial community of its views on accounting and disclosure issues.P? During
fiscal 1984, the staff issued SABs on two issues related to the broader issue of
consolidations currently being studied by the FASB and which arose during the
then "hot issues" market.
SAB 54 was issued in November 1983 to address the application of the "push
down" method of accounting. Under push down accounting, the costs of purchasing a business are pushed down to become the new reporting basis in the
separate financial statements of the acquired entity. SAB 54 expresses the view
that push down accounting should be applied where an acquired subsidiary is
substantially wholly owned and has no public debt or preferred stock outstanding.
Also in November, the staff issued SAB 55 to provide its view on appropriate
accounting for "carveouts"-situations where a subsidiary, division or lesser business component of a larger entity files a registration statement for purposes of
obtaining public financing. In such circumstances, financial statements of these
entities are frequently presented on the basis of operating as a subsidiary, division
or lesser business component and therefore, may not reflect all costs incurred in
operating the business. SAB 55 reflects the staffs views as to the necessity of the
allocation of expenses to the financial statements of these separate entities and
the required disclosures.
In the area of bank disclosures, the staff issued SAB 56 concerning appropriate
disclosures about certain reserves mandated by the Federal banking agencies.
The bulletin indicates that registrants are expected to disclose the existence of
these mandatory reserves in their Commission filings and that such disclosures
should be meaningful in the context of the analysis of the loan loss reserve
required by other Commission guidelines. The SAB emphasizes, however, that
registrants are responsible for determining the adequacy of reserves under GAAP
and that this responsibility is not affected by presence or absence of mandated
reserves.
Finally,the staff issued SAB 57 on its views concerning appropriate accounting
for contingent warrants issued by a company to certain of its major customers in
connection WIthsales agreements. The bulletin reflects the view that the cost of
the warrants contingently issuable under these arrangements should not be measured until the requisite amount of purchases specified in the sales agreement
have been made. This cost is the difference between the quoted market price of
16

the company's stock at the date the customer earnsthe warrants and the amount
the customer is required to pay.

Audit and Certification of Financial Statements
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)establishedthe
Division for CPAFirms and the Public Oversight Board (POB) in 1977 in response
to recommendations for self-initiated reform made by various groups, including
Congress. The Division consists of two sections, the SEC Practice Section
(SECPS)and the PrivateCompanies Practice Section. The Commission strongly
encourages membership in the SECPS, believing that it is evidence of a firm's
commitment to quality of practice.
SEC Practice Section-The primary objective of the SECPS is to improve
the quality of practice of CPAfirms before the SEC through various membership requirements, including peer reviews. It provides the organizational structure and processes for the self-regulation of accounting firms with SEC audit
practices. The POB, composed of prominent individuals from outside the
profession, monitors the activities of the SECPS. According to the POB's
Annual Report as of June 30,1984,430 firms have voluntarily become members of the SECPS, including all firms with 30 or more public company
clients.
As discussed in the POB's Annual Report and a special report on "Audit
Quality: The Profession's Program,"Ss peer regulation must be viewed in the
context of its relationship with private regulation (policies and procedures
dictated and enforced by management of accounting firms) and public
regulation (state entrance and licensing provisions, court actions, and Federal
regulatory actions such as SEC's enforcement actions). Regulation of a profession requires the best efforts of all three levels; no one level of regulation is
adequate alone, nor can anyone of them substitute for any other. The POB
has reviewed the accounting profession's program for audit quality, both conceptually and in practice, and found the quality control standards, peer reviews of firms' compliance, and the supporting strength of the special
investigative process, with both public and regulatory oversight, combine to
provide a sound, comprehensive and effective assurance of audit quality.
Peer Review-In its 1984 annual report, the POB concludes that the peer
review process is functioning effectively, and notes that there has been a
significant percentage decrease in the number of qualified and adverse opinions on member firms' systems of quality control.P? In firms found to have
serious deficiencies, results obtained on subsequent peer reviews provide
convincing evidence of a commitment to improve quality of their accounting
and auditing services.
The Commission staff oversees the activities of the SECPS through frequent contact with the POB and members of the executive and peer review
committees of the SECPS. In addition, the staff reviews POB files and selected
working papers of the peer reviewers. The Commission believes the peer
review process contributes significantly to improving quality controls of members and thus should enhance the consistency and quality of practice before
the Commission.

17

However, the process is still evolving. The POB, in its Annual Report, comments on several significant changes effected during the past year, including
those relating to consideration of litigation alleging audit failures in determining the scope of the peer review. Several were suggested by the Commission's
staff in its oversight capacity. The Commission strongly encourages continuing refinements in the program (such as those dealing with uniformity of
reporting mentioned by the POB and the recommendation of a special committee dealing with the need for additional guidance in evaluating the scope
and effectiveness of the concurring second partner review membership requirernent),
Special Investigations Committee-Activities

of the Special Investigations
Committee (SIC) supplement peer review. They determine whether allegations of failure in the conduct of an audit of an SEC registrant indicate need
for improvements in, or compliance with, quality control systems of the reporting firms or whether changes in professional standards are required. If
specific members of the firm's professional staff may have failed to follow
established policies and procedures, the SIC considers whether corrective
action taken by the firm is appropriate.
The POB actively monitors the activities of the SIC and has complete access to
its files. In its 1984 Annual Report, the POB concludes that the SIC has effective
operational procedures, that members take their responsibilities seriously and
that its decisions are sound and in the interest of the public and the profession.
In previous years.>? the Commission has stated that it "has no basis for reaching any conclusions" about the special investigative process or the POB's oversight of that process, and "believes that visible evidence as to specific activities is
critical to demonstrate to the public the effectiveness of this aspect of the profession's self-regulation." This continues to be the case.
Review of SECPS-In June 1984, an AICPA committee issued a report
entitled "Report of the Special Committee on the Review of the Structure and
Operations of the SEC Practice Section." The committee, composed of seven
distinguished members of the accounting profession and two representatives
from outside the profession, reviewed and evaluated the activities of the
SECPS since its formation in the light of the SECPS goal to improve the
quality of practice before the SEC. The report included an evaluation of the
role of the POB, and the SECPS objectives, membership requirements, organizational structure and functions.
The committee's overall evaluation is that the structure of the SECPS is
sound and that it is carrying out its major programs in an effective manner.
But a series of recommendations were made to further improve the effectiveness of the SECPS. One was to develop a broadbased public information
program, including the issuance of periodic reports on the scope and results
of its activities so that the SECPS objectives and accomplishments will be
better known and understood by various interested audiences.
With respect to the SIC, the committee found that the investigative process
complements the peer review process and has operated effectively within the
established guidelines for its activities. The committee addressed the question of whether the confidentiality of SIC activities should be modified. It
concluded that confidentiality on matters related to specific cases still ap18

pears to be desirable because of the voluntary nature of the SECPS, the
possibility of substantial and often unwarranted prejudice against member
firms, and the fact that the public interest has been adequately protected by
the procedures followed by the SIC and the regulatory and court processes. It
nonetheless concluded that some public information about the actions taken
in the investigative process is needed to enhance the credibility of the process.
Recommendations included the publication of a generalized report at least
annually and the publication for educational purposes of information about
unusual or recurring problems encountered in the investigative process.
The Committee also recommended that the membership requirements for
reporting alleged audit failures to the SIC be extended to cover cases involving
all entities in which there is a significant public interest as opposed to only
those involving SEC registrants. This recommendation is responsive to the
Commission's statements in its 1983 annual report58 and has been endorsed
by the POB.59 Indeed, the POB annual report indicates that since the inception of the program, some non-SEC registrant cases were voluntarily reported
to the SEC in response to a request by the SIC.
The Commission has urged the SECPS to carefully consider the recommendation of the special committee and to take positive steps to enhance the
credibility and acceptance of the SECPS; public disclosure of more specific
information about the activities of the SIC is imperative. Unless the public is
awareof the profession's response to potential problems, the requisite degree
of assurance that the profession's program is acting in the public interest by
protecting users of financial statements is unlikely.
International Accounting and Reporting-Disclosure of information by
multinational enterprises continues to be of interest to user groups including
investors, creditors, governments and employee organizations. A number of
regional and international bodies devote substantial time and resources to
Improving the quality and comparability of the information.
The Commission monitors certain activities of several regional and international standard setting bodies, including the European Economic Community, the International Accounting Standards Committee and the International
Federation of Accountants and is interested in and supportive of development
of international standards of accounting and auditing. Closer correspondence
between national requirements will result in more useful and understandable
information for investors and other users of financial reports and mitigate
problems caused by disparate requirements applicable to domestic and foreign private issuers which register securities with the Commission.
The Office of the Chief Accountant maintains communications with various
national and international standard-setting bodies and comments on the proposed standards of such bodies from time to time. A staff member from the
Office serves as an expert advisor on the United States delegations to regular
meetings of working groups on international accounting and reporting standards established by the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD will sponsor an international forum, in April 1985, on harmonization of accounting and reporting
standards at the international level which could result in an important step in
the harmonization process. Harmonization of accounting and reporting stan-

19

dards is a long term process; these efforts will continue and should favorably
affect the efficiency of the world's capital markets.

Regulation of the Securities Markets
Key 1984 Results
The Division of Market Regulation, with the assistance of the Regional Offices,
is charged with the responsibility of overseeing operations of the nation's securities markets, exchanges and broker-dealers. Over 10,000 broker-dealers, 10
exchanges and 6,000 firms conducting a public business were subject to the
Commission's oversight in fiscal 1984.

In fiscal year 1984, the Commission continued facilitating efficient markets and
undertook important initiatives to protect investors and to reduce costs of regulation-from
streamlining the clearing process to simplifying the registration process for broker-dealers. The Commission undertook a major initiative to assure
functional regulation of securities activity by banks as well as broker-dealers.
Capital and reserve additions of $83.2 million were secured from broker-dealers
in financial difficulty, increasing protection of customer assets in those firms'
custody.
Amendments to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) rules requiring certain financial institutions to compare, confirm, affirm and settle by bookentry trades in municipal securities through the facilities of registered clearing
agencies should reduce processing and related costs by $350 million annually.
Adoption of a tender and exchange offer processing rule, requiring tender agents
to use book-entry transfer services at securities depositories, should reduce processing costs by $100 million annually.

Securities Markets, Facilities and Trading
The National Market System-The Intermarket Trading System (ITS), operated by seven national securities exchanges and the National Association of
21

Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), experienced record trading volume in 1984. ITS
upgraded facilities completely, expanding its capacity threefold. ITS also facilitated when-issued trading of stock in the seven regional holding companies
spun-off from American Telephone & Telegraph.
The Commission continues to monitor trading in Securities Exchange Act
(Exchange Act) Rule 19c-3 securities (securities not subject to exchange offboard tradmg restrictions) and trading through the interface between ITS and the
NASD's Computer Assisted Execution System. Although trading through the
latter has been light, all Rule 19c-3 securities now are eligible to be traded through
the interface.
By year-end over 1,000 actively-traded over-the-counter (OTC) securities were
designated as national market system (NMS) securities under Rule llAa2-1 of the
Exchange Act. That rule requires transactions in NMS securities to be reported in
a real-time system, increasing market efficiency and improving execution of customers' orders. In response to a petition submitted by the NASD, the Commission
proposed amendments to the rule to increase substantially the number of securities eligible for designation as NMS securities.s" The petition was granted
Nov. 16, 1984.
National System for the Clearance and Settlement of Securities Transactions-Rule 17Ad-14 under the Exchange Act was adopted requiring registered
transfer agents acting as tender agents for bidders during tender and exchange
offers to establish accounts with registered securities depositories to permit
book-entry delivery of tendered securities for anticipated annual savings to brokers and agent banks of about $100 rnlllion.v' Two securities depositories' proposals to offer tender delivery services were approved.Y (A third depository was
approved in early October 1984.)63
The Commission approved amendments to MSRB Rules G-12 and G-15 that
establish a two-phased timetable for integrating municipal securities brokers and
dealers into the National Clearance and Settlement System.54 Since August 1,
1984, every municipal securities broker and dealer that participates in a registered clearing agency offering automated municipal securities comparison, confirmation and affirmation services (or clears transactions through an agent that is
a member of such a clearing agency) has had to use those services. By February
1,1985, those municipal securities brokers and dealers or their agents also will be
required to settle by book-entry, through a registered clearing agency, compared
and confirmed transactions in depository-eligible securities. When fully effective,
these rule amendments should save the municipal securities industry about
$350 million annually in processing costs. The Commission approved proposed
rule changes of several clearing agencies that implement the first phase of the
tlmetable.s>
Finally, in April 1984, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation hosted a
two-day Securities Processing Roundtable with representatives from organizations involved in processing securities transactions. Discussions focused on improving efficiency and safety in the National Clearance and Settlement System,
and set an agenda for achieving identified goals during the balance of the
1980's.66
Options-During fiscal year 1984, the Commission approved issuance and
trading of ten new options products, including options on stock market Indices"?

22

and foreign currencies.s" and approved 75 other options-related rule filings. The
Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC), have continued work on the Congressionally mandated
Special Study of the Futures and Options Markets.
Short Tenderingof Securities-On March 29, 1984, the Commission adopted
amendments to Exchange Act Rule lOb-4, the short tendering rule,69 prohibiting
the practice of hedged tendering, i.e. tendering and then selling a portion of the
tendered shares in the market. The amendments also clarify certain provisions of
the rule and limit the types of offers to which the rule applies.
On June 15, 1984, additional amendments to Rule lOb-4 were published for
comment. 70 The proposals would require persons who tender shares by guarantee to deliver all guaranteed shares to the bidder and would extend the prohibition
of hedged tendering to cover the writing of certain exchange-traded call options.
Exemption from Short Sale Rule-On March 6, 1984, the Commission
adopted an amendment to Exchange Act Rule lOa-I, the short sale rule,"! to
permit a broker-dealer selling a security acquired in the capacity of a block
positioner to ignore, for purposes of compliance with the "tick" provisions, a
hedged short position in that security arising from arbitrage or hedging activities.
The amendment is designed to facilitate block positioning.
Regulation of Brokers, Dealers, Municipal Securities Dealers, and
Transfer Agents
Broker-Dealer and Transfer Agent Examinations-Over
the past two
years, the number of broker-dealer registrations increased by 30%. In response, the broker-dealer examination program was streamlined and greater
responsibility for "cause" examinations was transferred to self-regulatory organizations (SROs). Examiner resources remained constant. As a result,
depth and frequency of oversight examinations and reviews to ensure better
inspection programs by the SROs have been increased.
Another reason for improvement in the examination process is that during
1984, the Commission, with assistance from the NASD, continued efforts to
phase out the SEC-Only registration (SECO) program. Under amendments to
the Exchange Act enacted in 1983, the SECO program terminated on December 6, 1983.
The staff completed 389 oversight examinations of SRO members in fiscal
1984, the highest level of oversight examinations ever reached and more than
50% higher than the number conducted in fiscal year 1981. Only 218 cause
examinations were conducted, as compared to 435 in 1981, because of increased referrals to SROs of matters which could appropriately be handled by
SRO enforcement and disciplinary procedures. The staff also examined 74
transfer agents, and reviewed 76 transfer agent examination reports prepared
by the Federal bank regulators.
Examination programs were augmented by the formation of a joint SEC/
NASD task force to analyze "hot issue" distributions and other regulatory
concerns. A number of investigations were initiated as a result of this effort.
The Commission also provided training to staff of three SROs on use of the
Commission's Customer Account Statement Evaluation System. This should

23

substantially enhance SRO detection of broker-dealer mishandling of customer accounts.
Persons Deemed not to be Brokers-On May 9, 1984, the Commission
reproposed for public comment Exchange Act Rule 3a4-1 under the Exchange Act. The rule specifies certain conditions under which persons who
are associated with an issuer of securities and participate in sales of the
issuer's securities would not be considered to be acting as "brokers" as that
term is defined in Section 3(a)(4) and, accordingly, would not be required to
register with the Commission under Section 15 of that Act. The rule provides
guidance for issuers that sell securities through associated persons.F
Bank Securities Activities-On November 8, 1983, the Commission published for public comment proposed Exchange Act Rule 3b-9 which provides
that a bank cannot rely on the exclusion for banks from the "broker" and
..dealer" definitions in Sections 3( a)( 4) and (5) of the Exchange Act when it (1)
publicly solicits brokerage business, (2) receives transaction-related compensation for certain brokerage services, or (3) deals in or underwrites securities
other than exempted or municipal securities. The proposed rule would require
that those activities be performed through a registered broker-dealer subject
to the same rules and regulations as all others who engage in such actlvities.P
Customer Protection Rule-On February 15, 1984, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act affecting a
broker-dealer's computation of the Formula for Determination of Reserve Requirement for Brokers and Dealers.?" The proposed amendments were designed to provide greater protection of customer funds held by broker-dealers
against misuse or insolvency and to ensure that customer funds are used only
to service bona fide customer accounts.
On May 10, 1984, the Commission approved a rule change proposed by the
National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) to reduce substantially borrowings of securities by broker-deelers.?> In conjunction with the approved
rule change, the Division issued a no-action letter to NSCC permitting brokerdealers operating under the new NSCC rule to treat positions represented by
money held at NSCC to be within the control of the broker-dealer for a limited
period of time for purposes of the Rule 15c3-3 customer securities segregation requirements.
Extension of Credit by Broker-Dealers on Investment Company SharesOn April 25, 1984, the Commission proposed for public comment Rule
lldl-2 which would conditionally exempt any security issued by an open-end
managment investment company or unit investment trust registered under
the Investment Company Act from the credrt restrictions of Section 11(d)(1) of
the Exchange Act. The effect of the proposed rule, when read in conjunction
with Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
would be to allow a broker-dealer to extend credit to a customer on fully-paid
securities issued by investment companies if the customer purchased the
securities held as collateral more than 30 days prior to the extension of
credit.?"
Conforming Amendments to the Net Capital Rule and Reporting FormConsistent with its policy of avoiding duplicative or inconsistent regulation, the
24

Commission adopted certain amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1, the
net capital rule, to conform it to the net capital rule of the CFTC.77 The
amendments, affecting firms registered with both agencies, related to: (1) the
treatment of exchange-traded commodity options purchased or sold for customers and of commodity option transactions in the proprietary accounts of
such firms; (2) the prepayment of subordinated loans; and (3) the establishment of financial and recordkeeping requirements for introducing brokers.
In addition, the Commission adopted amendments to Part II of Form
X-17A-5 (FOCUS Report) to include the amended CFTC Segregation Schedule which is a component of the FOCUS report. The FOCUS report also was
amended to reflect the previously adopted reduction in required net capital for
those firms on the alternative method of computing net capital.
Moption of Revised Registration and Withdrawal from Registration
Forms-On November 22,1983, the Commission adopted revised Form BD,
the Uniform Application for Broker-Dealer Registration, and revised Form
BDW, the Uniform Request for Withdrawal from Registration as a BrokerDealer.I" The revised forms enable a broker-dealer to use a single form to
register or withdraw from registration with the Commission, the States and
SROs. The revisions will make the forms compatible with the Central Registration Depository (CRD), a computer data base maintaining current registration
information for broker-dealers that are members of the NASD and/or are
registered with a State participating in the CRD program.
Arbitration-The Commission adopted Exchange Act Rule 15c2-2 to prohibit broker-dealers from using predispute arbitration clauses in customer
agreements that purport to bind customers to the arbitration of claims arising
under the Federal securities laws. The rule clarifies investors' options for arbitration and litigation in resolving disputes with their brokers.t?
Transfer Agent Regulation-The
Commission adopted amendments to
Rule 17Ad-2 under the Exchange Act establishing a minimum certificate turnaround and processing standard for certain transfer agents that handle securities issues that are immobilized in securities depositories. The
amendments ensure prompt transfer of record ownership by transfer agents
that previously were exempt from the Commission's certificate turnaround
and processing performance standard.s?
Oversight of Self-Regulatory Organizations
National Securities Exchanges-As of September 30,1984, ten exchanges
were registered with the Commission as national securities exchanqes.s! During the fiscal year, applications by exchanges to delist 53 equity, nine debt,
and eight options issues were granted, as were applications by issuers requesting withdrawal from listing and registration for 23 equity and two debt
issues. In addition, the Commission granted 751 applications by exchanges
for unlisted trading privileges.
The exchanges reported 394 final disciplinary actions imposing a variety of
sanctions upon member firms and their employees, compared with 475 final
disciplinary actions in fiscal 1983. In June 1984, the Commission amended
Rule 19d-1 under the Exchange Act to permit SROs to submit to the Commis-

25

sion plans for abbreviated reporting of minor disciplinary Infractions.sDuring the fiscal year, the Commission received 253 proposed rule changes
from exchanges. Among the significant ones approved were: (1) amendments
to the American Stock Exchange's (Amexs) stock allocation procedures, on a
12-month pilot basis, to permit newly listed Amex issuers to select the specialist units for their stock~;83 (2) a New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) regulatory
oversight services fee based on NYSE members' gross revenues.s" and (3)
amendments to NYSE rules relating to conflicts of interest involving NYSE
listed cornpanles.P''
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.-The NASD, with over
5,600 members, is the only national securities association registered with the
Commission. In fiscal 1984, the NASD reported the disposition of 218 formal
and summary disciplinary actions and 65 formal and summary actions by the
NASD Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) Trading Committee, as compared with 227 and 100, respectively, in fiscal year 1983.
In addition, the Commission received 20 filings of proposed rule changes
from the NASD, up three from fiscal year 1983. One of the significant approved rules formally instituted standards and procedures to be observed in a
pre-membership interview of applicants for rnernbership.s" Another significant approved change concerned sales incentive items paid by sponsors of
direct participation program securtties.'? The amended rule requires that
such be paid in cash to members only and that the member control any
distribution of incentive items to its salespersons. The Commission also approved rule filings by the NASD and the MSRB that would permit the NASD to
prescribe certain remedial measures for NASD members that experience
financial or operational dlfflculties.v"

Clearing Agencies
During the year,the Commission approved 89 proposed rule changes reducing clearing costs and enhancing clearing agency systems for controlling their
financial exposure. Other changes enabled clearing agencies to use automated
terminal systems to communicate with securities processing systems.s? and
enabled the Pacific Clearing Corporation to refine its clearing fund letter of credit

proqram."?
Also, the Commission granted full registration to the Boston Stock Exchange
Clearing Corporation under Sections 17A and 19 of the Exchange Act,91 and
granted the withdrawal from, and cancelled the temporary registration of, the New
England Securities Depository Trust Company under Section 19 of the Exchange

Act92
SRO Surveillance and Regulatory Compliance Inspections
During the fiscal year, the staff conducted 20 inspections of SRO market
surveillance, disciplinary, compliance, and operational programs. Many of these
were special inspections to monitor enhancement of programs found deficient
the previous year.
The 1984 inspection program continued to emphasize improving automated

26

surveillance through transaction audit trails, monitoring development at the
NYSE, Amex, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASD. Special
inspections of the NYSE disclosed that significant progress had been made by
the NYSE in implementing its audit trail, although additional work was necessary
to improve the accuracy and completeness of the data submitted by member
firms so that the audit trail could be fully effective. By the end of the fiscal year,the
NYSE had begun to test its audit trail data to identify problem areas and to take
steps to improve compliance by member firms. The Amex, which is developing
an equity audit trail similar to the NYSE's and has implemented comparable
systems changes, also began late in the year testing the reliability of the information collected from its member firms. The CBOE, In early fiscal 1984, submitted a
plan for implementation of an options audit trail by October 1984. A recent
inspection confirmed that development of the CBOE audit trail is proceeding as
scheduled. During fiscal year 1984, the NASD made a firm commitment to
establish an equity audit trail, and in July 1984, submitted a comprehensive plan
to develop an audit trail for transactions in all NASDAQ securities. Under this
plan, the audit trail would be in place by the end of 1985. Special inspections that
preceded this submission reviewed and confirmed the soundness of the NASD's
proposal.
The staff also completed an oversight inspection of the NYSE's Stock Watch
program. It revealed that the NYSE's capability to detect various forms of price
manipulation had improved since the previous inspection. The staff did recommend some additional refinements in surveillance procedures and determined
that performance in detecting and disciplining members for trading violations
should further improve once the equity audit trail is fully integrated.
A comprehensive inspection of the Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE) options
program disclosed that, while its surveillance was strong in a number of areas
(such as customer complaints and investigation of insider trading), additional
efforts were necessary at the PSE to keep pace with the Exchange's added
regulatory responsibilities resulting from increased options volume and the introduction of new options products. The staff recommended a number of improvements in the PSE's options program (particularly in detection and investigation of
potential marking the close and frontrunning violations).
Surveillance programs for new options products at the CBOE, Amex, PSE,
Philadelphia Stock Exchange (Phlx) and NYSE were also inspected. The inspections focused specifically on intermarket surveillance capability. Programs at each
of these exchanges appeared to be generally well constructed and adequate to
detect most trading abuses, including manipulation. The staff recommended
minor procedural enhancements to surveillance of trading in index options and
the stock components of the indexes (particularly at expiration).
The staff also completed a series of inspections of market surveillance and
disciplinary procedures concerning equity trading at the PSE, Midwest Stock
Exchange (MSE), Phlx, and Boston Stock Exchange (BSE). The procedures were
found to be generally adequate; minor improvements were recommended for
various aspects on each exchange.
An inspection of the NYSE specialist surveillance program and a special review
of recently modified mini-manipulation surveillance procedures at the Phlx is
ongoing. The staff also was completing a report on a series of three inspections

27

of various NASD programs to detect abusive practices in new issues.
The staff conducted inspections of two NASD District Offices to review the
financial surveillance, routine examination and disciplinary programs as well as
the investigations of customer complaints and terminations from employment of
registered representatives for cause. It also began preparation of an inspection to
review the handling of certain customer complaints by the NYSE and CBOE.
Inspections of two clearing agencies, the Options Clearing Corporation (OCe)
and NSCC, were completed during the fiscal year and a comprehensive review of
the Pacific Clearing Corporation commenced.
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)-After notifying the
Commission that the SIPC fund had fallen below the statutory minimum of
$150 million on April 13, 1983, on May 1, 1983, SIPC reimposed its assessment on member broker-dealers at the annual rate of one-fourth of one
percent of aggregate gross revenues from the securities business.v" The slPe
Board of Directors further decided to keep the present SIPC assessments in
place until the SIPC Fund totals $300 million. At September 30, 1984, the
SIPC fund totaled $225.9 million.
During fiscal year 1984, the Commission acted favorably on a number of
SIPC filings including rule changes which will improve SIPC liquidation proceedings by generally providing for the liquidation of options held for the
accounts of customers by the trustee in a proceedlnq.P"
Applications for Re-entry-During the fiscal year, the Division of Market
Regulation received 93 SRO applications to permit persons subject to statutory disqualifications, as defined in Section 3(a) (39) of the Exchange Act, to
become associated with broker-dealers. This represented a 16% increase in
applications over fiscal 1983. The distribution of filings among the SROs was
NASD (62), NYSE (21) and Amex (10). Of the total filings made, six applications were subsequently withdrawn, 84 were processed and three were pending at year end.
Market Oversight and Surveillance System-The
Market Oversight and
Surveillance System (MOSS), initiated as a pilot in 1980, is designed to automate the Commission's surveillance and oversight capabilities. In August
1981, at the Commission's initiative, the .SROs submitted a proposal for an
SRO intermarket surveillance program, to which the Commission would have
ready access. When fully implemented, the program should result in significantly enhanced intermarket surveillance. Therefore, the Commission, to
avoid unnecessary costs and duplication, has deferred major enhancement of
MOSS pending implementation and evaluation of the SRO program.
However, the staff continued to refine the existing oversight and research
capabilities of MOSS, with particular progress in incorporating data regarding
trading in the NASDAQ system and in new products on the options exchanges. During the year, the SROs made substantial progress toward a full
implementation of their programs; most significantly, the SROs began producing a consolidated equity audit trail including trading from all markets.

Investment Companies and Advisers
Key 1984 Results
The Division of Investment Management oversees the registration and regulation of investment advisers and investment companies--mutual funds, money
managers and the like. Currently, 9,000 investment advisers (excluding investment companies) are registered with the Commission, up from 7,000 one year
ago.

During the year, a number of measures were adopted to increase staff productivity. Improved inspection procedures resulted in completion of 1,334 examinations of investment companies and investment advisers, an increase of 23%
over the 1,085 inspections completed during fiscal 1983. The number of inspections completed per staff-year, which reflects directly productivity improvements
made over the past several years, increased by 29% from 12.6 in fiscal 1983 to
16.2 in fiscal 1984. As a result, of its inspection efforts, the Commission recovered
$3.8 million for investment company shareholders and investment advisory clients. The 3,750 registration statements filed by investment companies and advisers and processed by the staff represented an increase of 7% from the 3,490
filed during fiscal 1983. This productivity improvement was caused in part by the
selective review procedures adopted during the past several years.
During 1984, the Commission continued its review of rules under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) to eliminate restrictions
unnecessary for investor protection. During fiscal 1984, the Commission implemented several regulatory changes, modified certain disclosure requirements,
continued its review of investment advisers regulation, reviewed a major new
initiative in insurance and developed several significant applications and interpretations.

29

Regulatory Policy
In July 1984, the Commission adopted a new Rule 12d-1 (renumbered Rule
12d3-1) to permit registered investment companies to acquire, under certain
conditions, securities issued by persons engaged directly or indirectly in securities related businesses, such ,gS brokers, dealers, investment advisers and
underwriters.P? The Commission simultaneously rescinded Rule 2a-3 under the
Investment Company Act, so that banks acting as investment advisers to investment companies are treated in the same way as other issuers engaged in securities-related businesses.
The Commission, on September 7, 1984, adopted a revised proposal of Rule
17f-5 to permit registered United States and Canadian investment companies to
keep their foreign securities, cash and cash equivalents with foreign custodians
under certain conditions.v" At the same time, the Commission issued notices of
its intent to modify certain conditions of existing exemptive orders to conform
those conditions to Rule 17f-5.97
A revised version of Rule 2a-5 (to be renumbered 2a19-1) was issued for public
comment on May 2, 1984. As proposed, the amendment
to Rule 2a-5 would
exempt broker-dealers and their affiliates from the definition of "interested person" under certain conditions. The revisions would expand the pool from which
disinterested investment company directors may be chosen.P'' The Commission
concurrently proposed Rule lOb-1 that would define the term "regular broker or
dealer" which appears in Section 10(b) of the Investment Company Act and in
Form N1-R, the annual report form for management
investment companies.
On August 6,1984, the Commission proposed a new semi-annual reporting
form, N-SAR, which would replace five existing annual reports forrns.P?

Disclosure Requirements
During fiscal 1983, the Commission
adopted a new simplified registration
form, Form N-1A, under the Securities and Investment Company Acts for all
open-end management
investment companies, other than insurance company
separate accounts, required for filings on or after September 21, 1984.100 Following the approach developed for mutual fund prospectuses,
the Commission
published for comment, on December 23,1983, Forms N-3 and N-4 to be used
for variable annuities offered by insurance company separate accounts organized
as management
investment companies and unit investment trusts.l?' New simplified registration forms for unit investment trusts and new disclosure forms for
investment company mergers are also under development. The Commission
also proposed and adopted amendments to Regulation E (small issue exemption
under the Securities Act for securities issued by small business investment companies).102 The amendments
increase the offering limits to $5 million, revise the
offering circular requirements and permit business development companies to
use the exemption.
To increase staff efficiency and improve procedures for reviewing investment
company filings, the Commission announced that the Division implemented new
gUidelines for selective review of registration statements, post-effective amendments, and proxy materials.103 In addition, the Commission amended Rule 24f-2

30

to simplify the procedures required to register an indefinite number of investment
company shares.l?"
On December 7, 1983, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 482
under the Securities Act 105 As amended, the rule permits mutual funds to mail
advertisements in the form of "omitting prospectuses" directly to investors.
Money market mutual funds are permitted to include in such advertisements an
effective yield comparable to the compound interest rates advertised by banking
institutions.
Investment Advisers
The Commission continued Its review of the investment adviser regulatory
program to remove unnecessary regulatory burdens and otherwise improve investor protection. Early in the fiscal year, the Commission initiated discussions
with state securities administrators, through the North American Securities Administrators Association, to develop a uniform adviser registration system based
on the Commission's Form ADV. Because 37 jurisdictions and the Commission
require advisers to register, making the registration system more uniform will
reduce compliance burdens for advisers significantly. The Commission also rescinded Rule 202-1 relative to internal managers of certain employee benefit
plans'?" and proposed amendments to its adviser recordkeeping rules to permit
advisers to retain records in other than hard copy forrn.t??
Insurance Requirements
In fiscal 1984, the Commission undertook a major initiative relating to a new
type of insurance product known as flexible premium variable life insurance. On
November 23,1983, the Commission published for comment a rule, submitted
by an insurance industry trade association, that would provide extensive exemptions from provisions of the Investment Company Act and rules thereunder to
insurance company separate accounts offering this product.
The Commission adopted three rules and proposed a fourth rule, for insurance
company separate accounts offering variable annuity contracts, as part of a
continuing effort to simplify their compliance with the Investment Company Act
by codifying conditions under which routine exemptive relief has been granted.
Rule 6c-7, which was adopted in December 1983, permits separate accounts to
offer variable annuity contracts to certain employees of Texas institutions of
higher education. Rule 26a-1, concerning deduction of administrative fees, and
Rule 26a-2, concerning deduction of other fees and certain custodianship activities, were both adopted in July 1984. An amendment to Rule 22c-1, which
would permit certain pricing procedures with respect to initial purchase payments
for variable annuity contracts, was proposed for comment on May 1,1984.
Significant Applications and Interpretations

Savings and Loan Associations-In recent years Congress and State legislatures have given savings and loan associations (S&Ls) deposit-taking and
trust powers. As a result, questions have arisen as to whether an S&L has the
31

legal status of a "bank" under the Federal securities laws. During fiscal 1984,
the Commission requested public comment on whether it should propose
rules or recommend legislation which would treat S&Ls as banks. The effect
of a rule or statutory amendment would be to exempt S&Ls from provisions of
the Federal securities laws. For example, they could sponsor and manage
common and collective trust funds without complying with the Investment
Advisers Act or the Investment Company Act. Pending Congressional consideration of the Bush Task Force recommendations, which included a recommendation that the bank exemption under the securities laws be deleted, the
Commission has declined to respond to requests for advice on whether S&Ls
are banks.
FinanciaL PLanners-An increasing activity requiring the resources of the
Division is the increase in the number of financial planners whose activities
bring them under the Advisers Act. The staff has advised that registered
representatives of a broker-dealer or insurance salesmen who, on their own as
financial planners, (1) give advice more involved than a general discussion of
the advisability of investing in general categories of securities or (2) discuss,
more frequently than on rare and isolated occasions, the advisability of investing in specific securities or specific categories of securities, must register as
investment advisers if they receive any compensation for giving that advice,
such as a share of the brokerage or insurance commissions paid by the client
to purchase securities or insurance products.
Private Offering by Foreign Investment Companies-The Division stated
in an interpretive letter that a foreign investment company, which makes a
private offering in the United States, would be subject to the Investment Company Act if, after the offering, more than 100 persons residing in the United
States beneficially owned its securities. The Division's position was based on
Sections 7(d) and 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act.
Prudential Series Fund, Inc.-The Commission issued an order granting
the application of Prudential Series Fund, Inc. ("Fund"), the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity contracts, to allow it to use the amortized
cost valuation method for the short-term debt obligations held in certain of its
portfolios which invest in a mix of money market instruments, corporate
bonds, government securities, and common stocks. The Fund was the first
non-money market fund to seek an exemption to use amortized cost valuation.
Institutional Disclosure Program
Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act requires certain "institutional investment
managers" to file reports on Form 13F on a calendar quarterly basis. Managers
required to file 13F reports disclose certain equity holdings of the accounts over
which they exercise investment discretion. As of June 30, 1984, Form 13F reports
had been filed on behalf of approximately 1,100 managers for holdings totaling
$641 billion.
Form 13F reports are available to the public at the Commission's Public Reference Room promptly after filing. Two tabulations of the information contained in
the Form 13F reports are available for inspection at the Public Reference Room:

32

(1) a listing, arranged according to the individual security, showing the number of
shares held and the name of the money manager reporting the holding; and (2) a
summary listing showing the number of shares of a security reported by all
institutional investment managers filing reports. Both tabulations normally are
available approximately two weeks from the filing of the Form 13F.
The tabulations are produced by an independent contractor selected through
the competitive bidding process. The contractor provides its services to the Commission without charge, and is required to make a variety of specified tabulations
available to the public at reasonable prices within ten days after receipt of the
reports.

* * State Courts and Administrative Tnbunals
The General Counsel represents the Commission in all litigation in the United
States Supreme Court and the courts of appeals, defends the Commission and
its employees when sued, prosecutes administrative disciplinary proceedings
against professional persons under Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and appears amicus curiae on behalf of the Commission in significant
private litigation involvingthe Federal securities laws. In addition, under the supervision and direction of the General Counsel, the Regional Offices represent the
Commission in corporate reorganization cases which have a substantial public
Investor interest under the Bankruptcy Code. The General Counsel also seeks to
ensure that objectives of the Commission's enforcement and regulatory programs are supported, that judicial interpretations of the Federal securities laws
afford adequate protection to investors, and that the Commission is able to
discharge its statutory responsibilities, unimpeded by lawsuits against the agency
or its staff.
The General Counsel represented the Commission in 276 litigation matters
during the past fiscal year, more than half of which are still pending. Fifty Court of
Appeals and Supreme Court cases were concluded, 43 favorably to the Commission. There were 42 appeals before the Supreme Court and Federal courts of
appeals cases brought by the Commission to obtain injunctive relief for violation
of the securities laws. Of these appeals, 19 were concluded, with only two outcomes unfavorable to the Commission. The foregoing compares with the following cases in fiscal 1983: a total of 239 matters, of which 52 were appeals or cases
brought by the Commission to obtain injunctive relief. Of those appellate cases,
16 were concluded, 14 of which were favorable to the Commission.
There also were 16 appellate actions seeking to overturn Commission orders,
primarily those issued in Commission administrative proceedings or affirming
self-regulatory organization disciplinary proceedings against regulated entities
such as broker-dealers. Seven of these appeals were concluded, with no adverse
results. In fiscal year 1983, there were 19 actions, 13 of which were concluded with
only one adverse result.
The Commission filed amicus curiae briefs in 52 cases during the year (compared to 53 such instances in fiscal year 1983). Fifteen private cases in which the
Commission participated were decided; only four of these resulted in a decision
adverse to views advocated by the Commission.
35

The General Counsel also handled more than 180 other proceedings before
the Commission or in the Federal district courts, compared to 115 in fiscal year
1983. These included 31 suits brought against the Commission or its staff, and 81
suits, including actions under various public information statutes, seeking access
to Commission documents. Fifty-nine of the latter involved discovery subpoenas
in private actions in which the Commission is not a party. In fiscal year 1983, there
were 35 suits brought against the Commissioners or the Commission's staff, and
46 suits (including 37 third-party subpoenas) under the various public information statutes.
In addition to litigation, the Office of the General Counsel is involved in sigmficant legislative and regulatory work. For example, the Office assisted the Chairman in his participation as a member of the Task Group on Regulation of
Financial Services, assisted the Commission in proposing the Insider Trading
Sanctions Act, the Tender Offer Reform Act, and the Shareholder Communications Act, and supported legislation to facilitate development of the private secondary mortgage market.
During the fiscal year, 64 debtors with securities registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) commenced Chapter 11 reorganizations.
The Commission entered its appearance in 26 of these cases involving aggregate
assets of $13.2 billion and about 150,000 public investors. In addition, the Commission entered an appearance in five cases to pursue a specific law enforcement
interest. A list of these cases is set forth in Table 38 in the Appendix to this Report.

Utigation
Appeals in Commission Enforcement Actions-This litigation consists primarily of attempts by defendants in Commission injunctive actions to obtain
reversal by a court of appeals of district court decisions finding that they have
violated the law, enjoining them, and/or ordering other ancillary relief such as
disgorgement. In addition, there are occasionally cases where the Commission is
denied relief and takes an appeal.
In SEC u Materia, an employee of a financial printer challenged the district
court's determination that he had committed antifraud violations by tipping and
trading on material nonpublic information he had misappropriated from his employer and its clients concerning the clients' plans to tender offers for other
corporations.t?" The lower court had enjoined the defendant from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections lO(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and Commission Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3, and ordered him to disgorge approximately $100,000 in profits from his illegal trading activities. On appeal, the defendant argued that Rule 14e-3, prohibiting the misuse of nonpublic information
concerning tender offers, exceeds the Commission's rulemaking authority, and
that United States u Newman,109 which held that tipping and trading on misappropriated material non public information concerning proposed tender offers
violated Rule lOb-5, was contrary to recent Supreme Court decisions. In response, the Commission urged that Rule 14e-3 came within the scope of Section 14(e), a provision directed at the prevention of abuses in connection with
tender offers, and that Newman was not contrary to the teachings of the Supreme Court. On October 1, 1984, the United States Court of Appeals for the

36

Second Circuit affirmed the lower court and held that by trading on information
misappropriated from his employer, the defendant had violated Section 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5.
In SEC u IMJrld Gambling COrp.,110the same court upheld an injunction
against a securities salesman charged with participating in a shell corporation
fraud, and an order requiring him to disgorge $11,700 in unlawful profits. The
court rejected the contention that the Commission must prove scienter as an
element of a violation of the registration provision of the Securities Act of 1933
(Securities Act), agreeing with the Commission that the public is entitled to
protection under that section against even negligent conduct.
In SEC u Youmans,111the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
held that the district court had ruled improperly when it refused to enter an
injunction against a former bank holding company officer who had committed
repeated and serious antifraud, reporting and proxy violations. The appellate
court agreed with the Commission that a change of occupation alone is not
determinative of whether a person is likely to commit future securities laws violations and, therefore, that he should be enjoined. Rather, consistent with the
protection of the investing public, a court should consider several factors, including the seriousness of past violations and their isolated or repeated nature. Another court of appeals, however,in SEC u Cayman Islands Reinsurance Corp;
found it unnecessary to reach the Commission's argument that the district court
had erred in considering the collateral administrative consequences of an injunction when it refused to enjoin the defendant, a partner in a securities firm.112 In
that case, on the cross-appeal of the defendant, the court refused to set aside
findings that the defendant had violated the securities laws.
In SEC u Randolph and Blackard,113 the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit reversedthe judgment of the district court, which had refused to
enter a consent decree proposed by the Commission, and directed the court to
enter the decree. The appellate court held, as urged by the Commission, that a
district court has "case or controversy" jurisdiction to enter court orders approving consent decrees, and that a supposed contract remedy availableto the Commission-suing the defendants later if they did not comply with the settlement
agreement-was not an adequate substitute for an injunction. The court emphasized that the district court "should have deferred to the [Commission's) decision
that the decree is appropriate and simply ensured that the proposed judgment is
reasonable," instead of considering what it thought it to be in "the public's best
interest."
Petitions to Review Commission Orders-Petitions to review Commission
orders arise from Commission administrative proceedings and from Commission orders on review of disciplinary action by national securities exchanges and
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD). Like appeals in injunctive actions, administrative appeals frequently involve issues central to the
Commission's enforcement program and thus to the integrity of the securities
markets. For example, in the last year,courts upheld Commission orders finding
violations of NASD rules and imposing sanctions where securities salesmen sold
unregistered securities to the public without the knowledge of their employer,1 14
or made unsuitable recommendations and engaged in excessive trading of a
client's account 115

37

Commission Participation in Private Litigation-The Commission also participates as a friend of the court in selected private litigation that involves significant
securities law issues. This is an important supplement to the enforcement program. Because the Federal securities laws provide for private remedies as well as
governmental enforcement actions. decisions in private cases may have precendential effect in the Commission's own regulatory activities.
In January 1984. the Supreme Court. in Daily Income Trust, Inc. u Fox,
adopted the position urged by the Commission and held that a security holder in
an investment company is not required to make a demand on the directors of that
company before bringing suit under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company
Act The court agreed that suits under Section 36(b) are an important mechanism allowing security holders to challenge fairness of compensation paid by an
investment company to its investment adviser.116
The Commission also expressed its views in two cases at the specific invitation
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit In Psimenos u E.F.
Hutton & Co.• the court held that a Federal court had jurisdiction over a commodities transaction initiated by the plaintiff, a foreign national, outside of the
United States, but consummated on an American market,'!" The court stated
that execution of the transaction (involving a domestic futures contract) on an
American commodities exchange, which it described as the culminating act of a
fraudulent scheme that directly caused loss to the foreign national, was conduct
sufficient to warrant the assertion of jurisdiction and the application of United
States law. In CRA Realty Corporation u Iii-South. Inoestments.u" the Commission urged that trading by a brokerage firm in an issuer's common stock does
not give rise to short-swing trading liability under Section 16(b) ofthe Exchange
Act if that trading is incidental to the brokerage firm's market-making activity in
debentures which are convertible into the issuer's common stock. The court
agreed, stating that such a construction of the statute will encourage marketmaking activity in debentures, thus enhancing the depth and liquidity of the
market for those securities.
The Commission urged the court in Salcer u Envicon Equities Corp; 119
which involved allegations of fraud in the sale of tax shelter investments, to hold
that the amount of damages recoverable by investors should not be reduced by
the amount of tax savings previously realized by the investors. The court disagreed with the position urged by the Commission and concluded that the
"actual damages" language of Section 28(a) of the Exchange Act requires that
any tax savings realized by investors in a tax shelter investment must be deducted
from damages.
In Berner u Lezzarro.t-? the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit held, as urged by the Commission, that, by reason of their fiduciary
obligations, securities professionals and corporate officers who have allegedly
engaged in fraud may not shield themselves from liability by clairninq that the
investors they defrauded were equally at fault. In that case a stockbroker and the
president of a corporate issuer conspired to manipulate the price of the issuers
stock by issuing false information concerning the issuer. The defendants argued
that the plaintiffs should not be allowed to recover because the plaintiffs believed
they were trading on inside information. an act which could have been illegal itself
had the information been true. The court held that an equal fault ("in pari de-

38

licto") defense does not apply where the facts show that the plaintiff is not equally
responsible for his own injury. The court was not persuaded "that a duped investor is equally at fault in the fraud perpetuated against him by his broker or an
insider." The court reasoned that the deterrent effect of the threat of private
investor actions against brokers or corporate insiders in these circumstances
protects the investing public against abuses by those persons.
In a case reversed and remanded by the Supreme Court to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 121 the Commission urged on remand, as it
had earlier, that an injured investor may recover damages under Section 1O(b) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 for market manipulation of an exchange-listed
security, even though Section 9 of the Act, under which the investor was precluded from recovering, also prohibits manipulative conduct involving exchangelisted securities. The Commission argued that this conclusion gives controlling
weight to the dominant policy of Congress to provide complete and effective
sanctions under the Federal securities laws and prevents a gap in investor protection by avoiding a disparity of treatment between victims of manipulation depending on whether they are injured through manipulation of exchange-listed or overthe-counter securities. The case is still pending.
The Commission also continued its policy of supporting the availability of
private equitable relief under the Williams Act. In Gearhart Industries Inc. u
Smith International Inc.,122 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit held that a private right of action is available to an issuer corporation to
obtain equitable relief for violations of Sections 13(d) and 14(e) of the Exchange
Act. The court agreed with the Commission that district courts have the equitable
discretion to order remedies beyond corrective disclosure in appropriate circumstances. The Commission had argued that such equitable relief can be necessary
to afford shareholders adequate protection against harm from violations of the
Williams Act.
In Austin Municipal Securities, Inc. u National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., 123 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is considering whether the NASD and its officials are absolutely immune from damages
suits alleging torts committed during the NASD disciplinary process. The court
also is considering whether Federal antitrust laws apply to the NASD's disciplinary
process in view of the pervasive regulatory structure created by the Exchange Act.
The Commission has filed a brief urging the court to hold that the NASD and its
officials are absolutely immune from damages suits and that the antitrust laws are
impliedly repealed as to the NASD disciplinary process.
Definition of a Security-The questions of what constitutes a security continues to be litigated. This year, in SEC u Professional Associates, the Commission prevailed in upholding on appeal the entry of a preliminary injunction against
an association and its principal that had sold to the public more than $15 million
in unregistered investments denominated individual trust accounts, units in an
escrow account, and interests in joint ventures.P" The United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with the Commission that, notwithstanding
their labels, the three types of instruments were in reality securities in the form of
investment contracts.
The United States Courts of Appeals are currently split on whether the sale of a
controlling or 100% stock interest in a corporation is a securities transaction. This

39

year the Supreme Court granted review on this issue125 consistent with the
Commission's position expressed in response to the court's invitation for the
views of the government. Although that case subsequently was settled, review by
the Supreme Court is now being sought in two other cases raising the same
issue. In one of these cases.F" the court of appeals agreed with the Commission's argument as amicus curiae that, where conventional common stock is
transferred, the protection of the antifraud provision of the securities laws should
not depend on whether the defrauded purchaser bought a small or large percentage of the corporation's stock. In the other case, the court of appeals reached the
opposite concluslon.V?
Challenges to the Commissions Authority Under the Investment /vioisers
Act-In three separate challenges to the Commission's authority under the Investment Advisers Act to protect the investing public from abusive practices by
publishers of investment advisory services, the courts have upheld the Commission's statutory authority as not inconsistent with the First Amendment guarantees of free speech and free press.
In SEC u Lowe, 128 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
held that the Commission may revoke the registration of an advisory publisher
who had repeatedly been criminally convicted for misconduct in connection with
his advisory business. The court held that the registration provision of the Act
constitute a valid regulation of a profession and also that the publication of
investment advice constitutes commercial speech entitled to only limited protection under the First Amendment. In SEC u Suter,129the Seventh Circuit likewise
held that a securities advisory publication was commercial speech not subject to
full First Amendment protection. The adviser in Suter had engaged in such
fraudulent conduct as fabricating testimonials, misrepresenting his education
and securities background, and repeatedly double billing his customers. The
Commission also revoked the same adviser's registration, and the adviser has petitioned the Seventh Circuit for review of that order.P? In SEC u \.\.all Street
Publishers' Institute, Inc.,131 the district court entered an order requiring the
defendant to register with the Commission as an investment adviser and enjoining further violations of antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.
Commission Action Under RuLe 2(e)-Under
Rule 2(e) of its Rules of Practice, the Commission may suspend or bar from practicing before it professionals
who have willfully violated the Federal securities laws or engaged in improper
professional conduct. Accountants and lawyers play a critical role in the disclosure of full and accurate information to the investing public, and the ability to
discipline those who have engaged in violative conduct is necessary to protect the
Commission's processes.
In the last year, the Commission instituted nine Rule 2(e) proceedings against
18 individual accountants and three accounting firms. Respondents in seven
proceedings resigned or have been suspended from practice before the Commission. Under the Commission's orders in these proceedings, before these
professionals may be readmitted to practice, they must demonstrate that they will
be subject to adequate supervision and that they have undertaken further professional education. The two remaining proceedings are pending.
Litigation Involving Requests for Access to Commission Records-Although
the Commission received numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and

40

confidential treatment requests in fiscal 1984, only one of those requests resulted
in the filing of a court action against the Commission. The Commission received
1,743 requests under the FOIA for access to Commission records, an increase of
21% over fiscal 1983. Approximately half of the 1984 requests were for investigatory files. The commission also received 2,391 requests for confidential treatment
from persons who submitted information, an increase of 30% over fiscal 1983. In
fiscal 1984, 89 requestors appealed the denial or partial denial of FOIA requests
to the Commission's General Counsel, who has delegated authority to decide
such appeals. Additionally, 14 confidential treatment requesters appealed the
denial of their requests. In the only court action filed against the Commission in
1984 seeking the information denied under the FOIA, the district court upheld the
Commission's denial of access.
The Commission was served with 40 discovery subpoenas in fiscal 1984, twice
the number served in 1983, in private actions in which the Commission is not a
party. These private parties seek information from Commission investigatory files
or testimony from present or former Commission employees related to their
pending litigation.
Litigation Against the Commission and Its Staff-During
1984, the Commission and its staff were defendants in 12 district court actions in which persons
sought to enjoin Commission law enforcement efforts or to obtain damages
awards. The Commission prevailed in each decided case; two cases are still
pending.
In O'Brien u SEC,132 an action instituted against the Commission and its
employees in fiscal year 1982, the Supreme Court reversed a court of appeals
decision which held that, absent special circumstances, the Commission must
notify "targets" of its non-public investigations whenever it issues subpoenas to
third parties. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court held that notice to
"targets" is not required by the Constitution, the statutes governing the Commission's investigative power, or prior decisions of the Supreme Court In its opinion,
the Court expressly recognized the Commission's broad authority to investigate
possible violations of the securities laws.
During fiscal 1984, the Commission's joint authority with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over futures on stock indices under legislation
enacted in fiscal 1983133was challenged for the first time. The Chicago Board of
Trade (CBTP34 challenged the joint action of the CFTC and SEC in publishing an
interpretation relating to applications for designation as contract markets for
futures contracts on nondiversified stock indices composed of securities of domestic issuers (or options on such futures contracts) under the standards of
Section 2(a) (1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).135The CBT argued
that the guidelines are contrary to the express statutory provisions of the CEA and
were promulgated in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Urged by the
Commission and the CFTC, the district court dismissed the case under the
doctrines of exhaustion and ripeness. A motion for reconsideration filed by the
Chicago Board of Trade is currently pending.
In addition, 15 actions were filed under the Right to Financial Privacy Act
seeking to block the Commission from obtaining access to customer records at
banks and other financial institutions. In fiscal 1983, only five such actions had
been filed. In 13 of the cases, the district court found that the Commission was
41

properly seeking the subpoenaed records for a legitimate law enforcement inquiry and enforced the Commission's subpoenas. The two remaining actions
were settled in the Commission's favor prior to judgment
Finally, four motions were filed in the district courts and the courts of appeal
under the Equal Access to Justice Act seeking attorneys fees and expenses.
Three of those motions were decided in the Commission's favor; one is pending.

Significant Legislation
Financial Services Industry-Vice Presidential Task Group and Glass-Steagall
Legislation-During fiscal year 1984, the Chairman participated as a member of
the Task Group on Regulation of Financial Sevices, chaired by Vice President
Bush. The Task Group resulted in part from the Chairman's proposal that a oneyear task force be formed to review the regulatory structure for the securities,
banking, thrift, and insurance industries; that financial services be regulated by
functional activities rather than by outmoded industry classification; that overlapping, duplicative, and conflicting regulatory activities be consolidated; and that
excessive regulations within and between agencies be eliminated.
Early in the fiscal year, the Task Group announced that it would endorse
proposals to substantially reorganize the Federal regulatory system for depository
institutions. The proposals would repeal the exemptions in the Securities Act for
registration of securities issued by banks and savings and loan associations and
transfer to the SEC administration of the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation,
and short-SWing profits provisions of the Exchange Act as they relate to such
institutions. These initiatives would consolidate administration of securities disclosures requirements for banks and savings and loan associations, resulting in
more uniform financial disclosure to public shareholders and securities analysts
and facilitating evaluation of comparative investment risks. Delays in conforming
regulations governing banks and savings and loan association filings with those
applicable to other issuers would be eliminated and duplication of agency staff
requirements would be reduced. The Commission would become the repository
for filings of all publicly held banks, savings and loan associations, and holding
companies, as it is for all other publicly owned companies.
Mortgage-Backed Securities-The Commission testified in support of legislation to facilitate the development of the private secondary mortgage market The
Commission staff also provided technical assistance to Congress in this area. The
legislation was signed by the President on October 3, 1984. The legislation is
designed to encourage offerings of mortgage-backed securities by private issuers, and could have a significant impact on the long-term capital markets.
The Hot Issues Report-On December 15, 1983, the Chairman and the Director of the Division of Enforcement testified before the Subcommittee on Securities of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, on the
subject of problem hot issues. At the request of Chairman Timothy E. Wirth of the
Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer Protection, and Finance of
the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the staff prepared an extensive
report on this area. The report was transmitted to Congress in August 1984.
The Insider Trading Sanctions Act-As proposed by the Commission, the
Insider Trading Sanctions Act (ITSA), developed by the Office of the General

42

Counsel with assistance of the Division of Enforcement, authorizes the Commission to seek a civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided as
a result of insider trading transactions. (Authority to obtain injunctive and other
equitable relief against such conduct is not affected.) ITSA also increased the
maximum fine for a criminal violation of the Act from $10,000 (established in
1934) to $100,000.
As amended by the Congress, ITSA, in addition to the above, (1) prevents
circumvention of existing prohibitions of insider trading by explicitly prohibiting
unlawful conduct in derivative securities such as options; (2) adds commodities
law violations as a basis for statutory disqualification under the Exchange Act; (3)
extends the Commission's authority to bring administrative proceedings to remedy violations of Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and (4) amends Section
15(c)(4) of the Exchange Act to clarify the Commission's authority to proceed
administratively against officers or directors or other individuals who cause a
failure to comply with Sections 12, 13, 14, or 15(d) of that Act, as well as against
the issuer. ITSA was signed by President Reagan on August 10,1984.
Tender Offer Reform Act-As proposed by the Commission, the Tender Offer
Reform Act, developed by the Office of the General Counsel with the Division of
Corporation Finance would, during certain tender offers, restrict certain activities
of tender offers, including the granting of "golden parachute" compensation
agreements; the defensive reacquisition by an issuer of its own securities; and the
defensive issuance of securities constituting more than 5% of a class of securities
or more than 5% of the issuer's aggregate voting power.
The Commission's proposal also would amend the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. Finally, it would
prohibit the purchase by an issuer of any of its securities at a price above the
market from a greater than 3% holder of such class who has held such securities
for less than two years, unless prior security holder approval is obtained or an
offer of at least equal value is made to all security holders. This latter provision is
designed to curb the so-called "greenmail" practice.
The Commission's proposal was introduced in both the Senate and the House
of Representatives. Portions of the Commission's proposal were added to the
banking bill (The Financial Services Competitive Equity Act), passed by the
Senate in September 1984. The Commission's proposal, as amended by the
Committee on Energy and Commerce, was, in August 1984, ordered reported to
the full House of Representatives.
Shareholder Communications Act-As proposed by the Commission, the
Shareholder Communications Act, developed by the Office of the General Counsel and the Division of Corporation Finance, would amend Section 14(b) of the
Exchange Act to authorize the Commission to regulate the dissemination of
proxy materials by banks, associations and other entities in the same fashion as
the Commission now regulates the dissemination of proxy materials by brokerdealers. This proposal contains a one-year delayed effective date. It was introduced in both houses of Congress and was added to the Tender Offer Reform Act
by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

Corporate Reorganizations
The Commission acts in a statutory adviser's role in reorganization cases under
Chapter 11of the Bankruptcy Code to ensure that interests of public investors are
adequately represented. In these cases, administered in Federal court, a debtor
usually continues to operate under the court's protection while it attempts to
rehabilitate its business and work out a plan to pay its debts. Reorganization plans
often provide for the issuance to creditors and shareholders of new securities in
exchange for part of all of their claims or interest in the debtor under an exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by the Bankruptcy Code.
The Commission may raise or present its views on any issues in a Chapter 11
case, but it may not initiate an appeal. Although Chapter 11 relief is available to
businesses of all sizes, the Commission generally limits its participation to cases
involving debtors that have securities registered under the Securities Act.
In these cases, and in those pending from prior years, the Commission presented its views on a variety of issues including: (1) the need for appointment of
additional committees to represent classes of public debt holders or equity security holders; (2) the need for appointment of a trustee to direct the debtor's
affairs or an examiner to investigate prior conduct of management and the scope
of the examiner's investigation; (3) questions conceming the administration of the
estate including proposed sales of major assets; (4) the adequacy of disclosure
statements required to be transmitted to creditors and investors when their votes
on a plan are solicited; (5) the interpetation of provisions of the Code relating
to the payment of fees sought by counsel and other professionals; (6) interpretive
questions concerning applicability of the securities laws to bankruptcy proceedings.
Committees-Committees are empowered to consult with a debtor in possession in the administration of a case and to participate in the formulation of a plan.
With court approval, official committees are permitted to employ, as a cost of
administration, one or more attorneys, accountants, or other agents to assist the
committee in performing its duties. In addition to a committee to represent
creditors holding unsecured claims, the Code also allows the court to appoint
additional committees for stockholders and others where necessary to assure
adequate representation of their interests in a case. During the fiscal year, the
Commission moved or supported motions for the appointment of committees to
represent investors in 12 Chapter 11 cases. Committees were appointed in all but
one.
In a case having significance for the representation of publicly held debt securities, In re The Charter Co., et al.,136 the bankruptcy court agreed with the
Commission that indenture trustees are eligible to sit as voting members of a
committee where the indenture trustee determines that such participation is
necessary to represent the interests of debenture holders. The Commission had
opposed a motion seeking their removal, on grounds of conflict of interest,
arguing that there was no inherent conflict between fiduciary responsibilities of a
trustee to represent indenture debtholders and fiduciary responsibilities of a
member of the committee also to represent other creditors of the estate. The
Commission pointed out that, like other members of a committee, if an actual
conflict arose on a particular matter, the indenture trustee may simply recuse

44

itself, relinquish its voting rights or resign.
Trusteesand Examiners-Under the Bankruptcy Code, the court may appoint
a trustee either "for cause," including fraud, dishonesty, or gross mismanagement of the debtor's affairs by current management, or in the interests of creditors or equity security holders, or other interests of the estate. The trustee's
primary duties are to operate the debtor's business, conduct and report to the
court the results of the investigation of the debtor and file a plan. Where there is
no trustee, an examiner may be appointed, on request of a party in interest, if the
appointment is in the best interest of the estate, and shall be appointed where, in
general, unsecured debts exceed $5 million. Generally, an examiner's duties are
limited to conducting and reporting to the court the results of his investigation.
The Commission participates on questions concerning the appointment of trustees and examiners and the scope of their duties because of the important role
that these independent fiduciaries play in protecting the interests of public investors. This fiscal year, the Commission supported successful motions to appoint a
trustee in one case and an examiner in one case.
In In re Dreco, Inc.,137a case having significant implications for the Commission in this area, the Commission moved for the "mandatory" appointment of an
examiner because of, among other allegations, claims against the debtor's current management made in a private securities fraud litigation. The bankruptcy
court denied the motion on the ground that the Commission lacked standing to
move for the appointment of an examiner. A petition for writ of mandamus by the
Commission seeking review of the denial of its standing was denied by the district
court, which concluded that while the Commission could raise the issue of the
need for the examiner, it lacked standing to invoke the mandatory provision. The
Commission determined not to seek further appellate review at this time based
on the facts of the case, and deferred consideration for a more appropriate case
in which to test its standing.
Under the Bankruptcy Code, the scope of an examiner's investigation is left to
the court's discretion. In a case raising significant issues concerning the judicial
approach to determining the scope of that investigation,138 the Commission
argued that, at the outset of an examiner's appointment, it is premature to limit
the scope of inquiry. Rather, the Commission urged that the court should direct
the examiner to file a preliminary report within 120 days making recommendations concerning the appropriate scope of his investigation and its projected cost.
The bankruptcy court rejected this approach and ordered limited inquiry.
Estate Administration-In
In re Baldwin-United Corporeuion.P" the bankruptcy court issued orders authorizing the debtors to honor indemnification
provisions of corporate by-laws and to advance expenses for legal representation,
as an administrative expense, for certain present and former directors and former
officers named as defendants in class action securities litigation. In appeals taken
from these orders, at the request of the district court, the Commission filed a brief
on this issue.
The position urged by the Commission attempted to reconcile two competing
public policy concerns-the
importance of outside directors to publicly held
corporations and the longstanding policy of the bankruptcy laws of equality of

45

treatment among creditors of the same class, except when expressly authorized
by statute. The Commission argued that indemnification claims for pre-petition
conduct of officers and directors must be treated like all other unsecured claims
and therefore any post petition indemnification payments must be justified on
findings that such payments were in the best interests of the estate.
The district court adopted the Commission's legal analysis of the Bankruptcy
Code and remanded to the bankruptcy court for an evidentiary hearing to determine, with respect to the current directors, whether the estate derived sufficient
benefit from the continued services of the directors to justify the anticipated
amount of advances for legal fees. With respect to former officers and directors
who no longer serve the debtors, the district court disagreed with the Commission's position that the bankruptcy court could, if the court determined that a
consolidated defense was in the best interests of the estate, authorize the advance
of legal fees as loans provided that the adequate protections were afforded in
order to assure that these persons are ultimately treated the same as other
unsecured creditors.
Also in the Baldwin-United
case, the debtor sought to enjoin the Commission's law enforcement investigation until the court-appointed examiner filed his
final investigation report. The debtor claimed that the Commission's investigation
would unduly burden the estate with costs of responding to the Commission's
request for testimony and documents, would divert attention of the company's
executives from working on a plan to reorganize the company, and would duplicate the examiner's investigation. The Commission disputed the factual assertions and the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to stay its investigation.
Subsequently, the Commission entered into a settlement with the debtor which
permitted the investigation to continue.
In Lionel Cotporeuion.v'? the Commission urged that legal standards permitting sale of a major asset of the estate outside of a plan of reorgamzation must not
undercut the disclosure, voting and confirmation standards in Chapter 11 designed to protect the interests of creditors and public investors. The Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with the position urged by the Commission that, without an adequate business justification, major assets may not be
sold outside the context of a reorganization plan.
Plans of Reorganization/Disclosure Statements-A
disclosure statement is a
combination proxy and offering statement used in connection with the acceptance of a plan of reorganization which often includes the exchange of new
securities for claims and interests of creditors and shareholders in the debtor. The
Bankruptcy Code provides that adequate disclosure is to be made without regard
to whether or not the information provided would otherwise comply with the
disclosure requirements of the Federal securities laws. But, in recognition of the
Commission's special expertise on disclosure, bankruptcy rules require the service of the Commission on all disclosure statements and the Bankruptcy Code
expressly recognizes the Commission's right to be heard on the adequacy of
disclosure, although denying the Commission the right to appeal disclosure
issues.
Bankruptcy rules require that disclosure statements filed by corporate debtors
be transmitted to the Commission. During the fiscal year, the Commission received approximately 3,000 disclosure statements filed in Chapter 11 cases in-

46

volving both privately held and publicly held corporations. The Commission staff
reviews disclosure statements to determine whether the plan proposed involves
the issuance of securities consistent with the exemption from registration in the
Bankruptcy Code or compliance with the Federal securities laws. The Commission also reviews disclosure statements to determine whether there is adequate
disclosure concerning the proposed plan. During the fiscal year the Commission
reviewed 1,200 disclosure statements, the great majority of them only cursorily.
Generally, the Commission seeks to resolve questions concerning disclosure
through staff comments to the plan proponent. If those cannot be resolved
through this process the Commission may object to the disclosure statement in
the bankruptcy court.
During the fiscal year the Commission commented on disclosure statements
cited in 31 cases, ten of which resulted in objections filed in the bankruptcy court.
One significant objection the Commission has pressed this year in two cases, In
re LioneL Cotporetionr" and In re SheLter Resources COrp,142is the failure to
include financial projections to support opinions that the plan of reorganization is
economically feasible. Both cases are still pending.
In two cases the Commission objected to plan confirmation because of Commission law enforcement concerns. In In re Taurus Oil CO.,143the Commission
objected to confirmation of the debtor's plan on the grounds that a proposed
securities transaction was not exempt from Securities Act registration by virtue of
the exemption from registration found in the Bankruptcy Code. The court agreed
with the Commission and directed registration of the securities as a prerequisite
to plan confirmation.
In WJods Communication Corp., 144 the Commission objected to confirmation
of a plan of an assetless publicly held shell corporation which contemplated no
business operations but sought to employ the discharge provisions of Chapter 11
to discharge claims of creditors through a de minimis payment. The stated
purpose of the plan was to emerge from Chapter 11as a publicly traded company
without assets or liabilities, and to acquire operating businesses through the
issuance of securities. The Commission's objection was premised on a concern
that adequate information would not be available to the market by virtue of the
court's confirmation of the plan. Further, the Commission viewed the use of
Chapter 11 by corporate shells to cleanse themselves of liabilities as an abuse of
the reorganization process. (After the close of the fiscal year, the court agreed with
the position urged by the Commission and denied confirmation of the plan.)
Fee-Related Questions-From
time to time the Commission expresses views
on particular legal and policy questions relating to fees in order to assure that
adminstrative costs of bankruptcy, borne by public investors, are consistent with
the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. For example, in In re Victor Technologies.
Inc.,145 the Commission argued, and the court agreed, to adhere to the long
standing policy, developed under the former Bankruptcy Act, of paying only a
portion of the requested interim allowances because of the inability of the court
to determine the necessity and value of the services rendered prior to the conclusion of the case. The Commission urged that absent special circumstances, the
award should be limited to 75% of the request, based on normal billing rates.
In two other cases, the Commission expressed its views on fee questions, in
response to judicial requests for assistance. In In re North America Coin &

47

Currency.146the bankruptcy court, as urged by the Commission, denied counsels' requests for the payment of a "bonus" in addition to reasonable compensation, In Southern Industrial Banking Corporetion.r'? the bankruptcy court, as
urged by the Commission, concluded that the Bankruptcy Code confers jurisdiction on the court to determine the reasonableness of fees to be paid, not by the
estate, but by the debtor's successor for legal and accounting services rendered
to the outside investor group which proposed and funded the debtor's reorganization. The court also concluded that the standard for review of the fees is the same
"reasonable compensation" standard governing awards from the estate.
Commission Standing to Appear as a Party in Interest-Occasionally the
Commission has determined that pursuit of certain ancillary equitable relief for
violations of the Federal securities laws against companies undergoing reorganization is more appropriate in bankruptcy court than in a separate district court
proceeding. On those occasions the Commission seeks to intervene as a party in
interest under Section 1109(b) of the Bankruptcy Code with the right to appeal,
rather than in its advisory status under Section 1109(a).
The Commission sought to assert such standing in two cases during the past
fiscal year. In Taurus Oil Co., noted above, the Commission sought to intervene
under Section 1109(b) to object to confirmation of a plan because the plan
contemplated a securities transaction in violation of Securities Act registration
provisions. The court denied the Commission party in interest standing but
granted the relief requested by the Commission.
In another case,148the Commission, in its own law enforcement action, had
frozen $4 million and had sought imposition of a constructive trust on these
monies, which it alleged had been obtained by fraudulent sale of unregistered
securities. While the enforcement action was still pending the defendants filed
petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11. The Commission subsequently
sought to intervene in the bankruptcy court in order to have standing to pursue
the constructive trust. The bankruptcy court denied the Commission's right to
intervene, stating that the Commission's exclusive role in reorganization cases is
limited to its advisory role under Section 1109(a). An appeal to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on this ruling is pending. Subsequent to
this appeal the Commission has commenced an adversary proceeding in the
bankruptcy court against the bankruptcy trustees seeking to impose a constructive trust for the benefit of defrauded investors.

Public Utility Holding Companies
Composition
Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (Holding Company Act),
the Commission regulates interstate public utility holding company systems engaged in the electric utility business or in the retail distribution of gas and the
natural gas pipeline companies and non utility companies within a registered
holding company system.
There are presently 13 registered holding companies with aggregate assets, as
of June 30,1984, of $72.7 billion representing an increase of $6.6 billion, or 10%,
over the previous 12-month period. Total operating revenues, as of June 30,1984,
were $34.6 billion, a $3.3 billion or 10-1/2% increase over the previous year. In the
13 systems, there are 65 electric and/or gas utility subsidiaries, 74 non utility
subsidiaries and 20 inactive companies, for a total of 172 system companies
operating in 24 states, including the parent companies but excluding seven
power supply company subsidiaries. Table 32 in the Appendix lists the systems
and Table 33 lists their aggregate assets and operating revenues.
Financing
During fiscal year 1984, the Commission approved approximately $2.8 billion
of senior securities and common stock financing of the 13 registered systems.
Of this amount, approximately $2.4 billion was long-term debt financing, the
remaining $400 million was common and preferred stock. Over $1.4 billion of
pollution control financing and $4.3 billion of short-term debt financing for the
registered holding company systems was approved. The pollution control financing exceeded the cumulative pollution control financings approved by the Commission between fiscal year 1980 and 1983. The short-term debt, on the other
hand, reflected a 15% decrease over the authorized amounts in fiscal year 1983.
Table 34 in the Appendix presents the amounts and types of securities issued by
the holding company systems under the Holding Company Act
Fuel Programs and Service Companies
During fiscal year 1984, the Commission authorized $740 million for fuel
exploration and development activities of the holding company systems. Since
1971, the Commission has authorized expenditures of over $7.3 billion for fuel
programs of holding companies subject to the Holding Company Act (see Table
36 and 37 in the Appendix).
At the end of calendar year 1983, 12 subsidiary service companies provided
managerial, accounting, administrative and engineering service to 11 of the 13
holding companies registered under the Holding Company Act. Billings for services rendered to the holding company systems amounted to $1.2 billion or
3.54% of the total revenues generated by the electric and gas operating utilities.

49

The subsidiary service companies are heavily labor-intensive, employing 17,147
people, and have assets of over $630 million. Table 35 in the Appendix lists the
subsidiary service companies with billings, total assets, total personnel, and the
number of operating utility companies served.
The Commission's examination of service company and fuel procurement
activities through the accounting jurisdiction under the Holding Company Act of
non utility businesses has resulted in savings to consumers during the fiscal year
of approximately $22.7 million.

Novel Financings and New Business Activities
During fiscal year 1984, the Commission authorized Central Powerand Light to
enter into a leveraged preferred stock financing.I49 This is a new series of sinking
fund preferred which is sold to a special-purpose trust to be established and
financed by, and for the benefit of, a group of corporate investors. The trust
purchases the preferred stock with funds raised by equity contributions from the
corporate investors and loans from institutional lenders (in a ratio of approximately 25% equity to 75% debt). The loans are without recourse to the investors
and are secured by the preferred stock. The corporate investors, as beneficiaries,
receive all preferred stock dividends, less amounts required to service the trust's
debt.
Connecticut Light and Power Company and Western Massachusetts Electric
Company have been given Commission approval to issue a new variety of pollution control bond called a variable rate demand bond or a low floater bond.'>?
After an initial period, the interest rate is determined weekly by a remarketing
agent based on an agreed upon index. Bond holders have the right to tender their
bonds at principal, prior to a new rate period. The quid pro quo for the company
for accepting a variable interest rate is that the initial interest rate will be
substantially less (300-500 basis points) than for a fixed interest rate pollution
control bond.
Central and SouthWest Corporation also has filed an application (File No.
70-6997) to create a factoring subsidiary that would purchase the accounts
receivable (factoring) of the System's operating subsidiaries. These accounts
receivable would be purchased at a discount and CSW Credit will obtain
financing for these transactions from the parent and bank credit. Profits from
the factoring of the subsidiaries would accrue directly to the parent holding
company.

Management,

Key 1984 Management

Economic Analysis and
Program Support

and Program Developments

Fiscal 1984 marked an important milestone for the Commission, the securities
industry, and public investors. In May, after competitive bidding, the Commission
awarded a contract to Arthur Andersen and Company to conduct a pilot program
(EDGAR) to test the receipt and analysis of a limited number of corporate filings
electronically-the
first step toward realization of an operational electronic disclosure program.
Emphasis in 1985 will be on expanding and improving EDGAR's analytic capabilities. During 1985, the Commission expects to solicit proposals on the contract for the long-term, operational system.
In a related effort, the Executive Director's Office conducted a study to determine the potential impact of EDGAR on the market for securities information.
The study revealed substantial financial benefits for investors, issuers, and the
securities industry. In addition, the study found a sizable and potentially lucrative
market for the range of services to be provided by EDGAR. Data generated by the
study are being used in support of the Commission's deliberations on financing
EDGAR and in preparing a Request for Proposal for the operational program.
In June, the Commission celebrated its 50th Anniversary. This included a
reception for alumni and staff at 450 5th Street and a dinner for 1,500 present and
former staff that featured presentations by all living former Chairmen. At the
dinner, the Commission's official 50-year history was formally presented. In conjunction with the Anniversary, the Commission sponsored its second Major Issues
Conference dealing with a range of topics regarding the operation of the nation's
financial markets in the 1980's. Among the issues discussed were the convergence of the financial service industries, the impact of technology on the
securities markets, and regulation of corporate mergers and acquisitions. Over
700 people attended the Conference.
During the year, the Executive Director's Office conducted management reviews of the Office of the General Counsel, the Office of the Administrative Law
Judges, and the Commission's personnel procedures. In addition, the staff prepared a cost-benefit study on proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, redesigned the Name Relationship Search System, and conducted a comprehensive analysis of regional office productivity.
Economic Research and Statistics
Changes in the marketplace have increased the number and complexity of
economic issues coming before the Commission and have greatly complicated
analysis of impacts of SEC regulation.
Research and technical support are required to evaluate the economic aspects

51

of the Commission's regulatory program. This task is carried out by the Office 01
the Chief Economist and the Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis. The
economics staff evaluates rule proposals, established policy and the capital markets. Staff economists also conduct statistical monitoring of major programs
affecting the securities industry and markets and publish findings in the SEC's
Monthly Statistical Review.
During fiscal 1984, proposals to introduce more than two dozen new products
were reviewed, including options and futures on stock market indices and industry stock groups. The number of new products and services is expected to grow.
New and more complex market structures and trading systems are expected to
evolve. The economics staff helps the Commission assess the economic aspects
of major policy issues relating to these evolutions and develops monitoring procedures to evaluate the operations of the markets.
During fiscal 1984, the economic staff reviewed 80 rules and rule proposals.
Rule reviews emphasized the economic costs and benefits of alternative approaches to regulation. In addition, advice was given to the operating divisions on
requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), particularly focused on economic effects of proposed rules and alternatives for reducinq regulatory burdens
on small business entities. In fiscal 1984, the economic staff reviewed 21 RFA
analyses and 25 RFA certifications.
Economic research projects completed during fiscal year 1984 included an
examination of the effects of the net capital and the reserve/segregation rules
(financial responsibility rules) on the capital structures of broker-dealers. This
study analyzed factors affecting long-term trends in the capital structure and
capital needs of broker-dealers, and assessed the impact of recent amendments
to the financial responsibility rules, showing $550 million in freed-up capital
during the first year.
The economics staff continued to monitor the effects of trading in Rule 19c-3
securities (those securities not subject to exchange off-board trading restrictions)
and the development of automated trading facilities in the OTC and exchange
markets. Another major review calculated that $15.5 billion of securities had been
offered under the recently restructured private and limited offering exemptions
from Federal registration (Regulation D). The study indicated that certain changes
introduced by Regulation D have substantially aided issuers in raising capital.
Staff economists analyzed the Tender Offer Advisory Committee's recommendations, the Commission's response to the recommendations and the ensuing legislative package. Three major studies resulted. One, a study of two-tier and
partial tender offers, focused on the empirical evidence concerning these types
of tender offers. Another study examined the impact of targeted share repurchases (greenmail) on stock prices. In the third study, the staff surveyed the
extent of beneficial block ownership in U.S. corporations and examined possible
changes to beneficial ownership reporting based upon the Advisory Committee
Report.
Other issues analyzed during fiscal 1984 included proxy initiatives, shelfregistration of corporate securities, and the impact of corporate charter amendments to thwart takeovers. In a study to determine the effects of optional variable
sales loads the staff examined mutual fund performance, the relative growth of

expenses and revenues from fund

Information Systems Management
EDGAR is only one aspect of the Commission's continuing effort to accommodate its increasing
workload
through
technological
innovation.
Under its
Productivity Improvement by Computer (pIC) program, the number of microcomputers employed by the staff was expanded from 30 to 100 during 1984, a
dramatic expansion accompanied by an intensive training program that reached
nearly 500 staff members over the year. The Commission's User Support Information Center continued to provide the staff with technical assistance in adapting
computer technology to an ever increasing number of operational activities. The
benefits of microcomputer
technology have been highly visible: improved litigation support, market analyses, and support to regional personnel monitoring the
"hot issues" markets.
During 1984, the Commission completed work on a fully interactive and integrated payroll system. The culmination of three years of developmental work, this
system is being considered by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as a
government-wide
prototype. Also during 1984, the staff developed a computerized complaint letter system and automated the agency's Securities Violation
Bulletin, facilitating monthly, rather than quarterly, publication. Finally, the
staff developed a system to provide daily market transaction data to the Division of Enforcement.
Because this in-house
system now provides data
previously acquired from a private vendor, the Commission
is saving approximately $72,000 per annum.

Financial Management
During fiscal 1984, the Commission collected a record $121 million in fees for
deposit to the General Fund of the Treasury. This is the second year in succession
and only the third year in its history that the Cornrnissron has collected fees in
excess of its annual appropriation.
The 1984 figure represents 129% of the
agency's appropriation and eclipses by $23.4 million the previous record amount,
collected in 1983. Fees were derived from four sources: securities registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 (49%), transactions on securities exchanges
(31 %), miscellaneous filings and reporting fees (19%), and registration of brokerdealers (1% ).
The agency continued to improve its financial management
procedures in
furtherance of the government-wide
Reform 88 initiative and the recommendations of the President's Private Sector Commission on Cost Control. Through an
electronic funds transfer system (EFTS) for the transmission of fees from the
securities exchanges, nearly $37 million in fees were transmitted to interest bearing Treasury accounts in 1984, saving the Federal government over $50,000 in
interest revenues.
The staff processed over 39,000 checks from filers and approximately 17,500
invoices, the latter a 6% increase over 1983. In addition, the agency continued its
excellent record in meeting the requirements of the Prompt Payment Act, incur-

53

ring only one interest penalty.
Steps were taken to improve the financial management capabilities of line
divisions. In particular, the staff redesigned the series of financial management
reports provided to division directors and office heads to better meet their need
for periodic summary data on various resource allocations. Another internal
management improvement, initiated by the Comptroller, was the introduction of
General Accounting Office-approved statistical sampling techniques to streamline audits of travel documentation.
Facilities Management
During fiscal 1984, administrative personnel achieved compliance with the
space reduction requirements of Executive Order 12411. Under a plan approved
by the General Services Administration (GSA), physical alterations necessary to
bring the Commission's headquarters and regional offices into compliance with
the order's 135 square foot per employee standard were completed. By year end,
15,600 square feet of space had been eliminated, resulting in a saving of
$200,000. Completion of all alterations will occur during 1985.
Since 1982, when the Commission first occupied its consolidated headquarters building, the staff has continued to upgrade and refine safety and security
procedures. During fiscal 1984, the Commission acquired state-of-the-art motion
detection and alarm systems to better secure proprietary and sensitive information at the headquarters building. The Commission also acquired equipment and
developed procedures to assist in the emergency evacuation of handicapped
employees.
Operating expenses were reduced during the year by replacing and eliminating
obsolete equipment, acquiring surplus printing equipment and furniture from
other agencies at no cost, and substituting external contracting services for certain costly in-house operations. In all, these steps have saved an estimated
$150,000 during fiscal 1984.
A 1984 OMB survey of government printing operations rated the Commission's
printing plant as one of the best among Federal agencies. During 1984, the
printing staff produced nearly 43 million printed pages, and increased productivity by 5% over 1983. Administrative personnel also handled 1.5 million pieces of
mail during the year.
Finally, the staff continued to improve administrative support for the regional
offices. In particular, nationwide telecopying capability was improved with the
installation of new equipment in three regional offices.
Personnel Management
Faced with a rapidly expanding workload, high priority on productivity improvements continues. Personnel actions are executed only after careful analysis
of their ultimate impact on overall division or office operations. During fiscal 1984,
over 7,200 personnel actions were processed. The Commission renewed efforts
to minimize the adverse effects of "grade creep," particularly through a program
to comply with OMB's directive that Federal agencies reduce staff at the GS 11-15
levels by 2% in 1985 and 1986. Further, the Commission has pursued an aggres-

54

sive policy of position management by reviewing the classifications of 210 positions during fiscal 1984.
In fiscal 1984, the performance appraisal system was fully redesigned. Staff was
familiarized with the more demanding written standards through a comprehensive instruction program.
The personnel staff performed a comprehensive review of the position management and classification practices of the Division of Investment Management,
and abbreviated on-site reviews of all regional and branch offices. Where necessary, practices were modified to conform with Commission-wide personnel standards.
Consistent with the commitment to improving the skills and abilities of the staff,
training was provided to 1,020 individuals. In addition, the program of employee
assistance continued during fiscal 1984 with seminars on health care and retirement.

Public Affairs
The objective of the Office of Public Affairs is to communicate information on
Commission activities to those interested in or affected by Commission actions.
Both on-going programs and special projects were used to achieve the objective
during 1984.
The SEC News Digest, published every business day, provides information on
virtually all SEC actions: issuer filings, acquisition reports, rule changes, actions
against individuals or corporate entities, releases, events of interest and upcoming Commission meetings. It is available in the Public Reference Room, and is
published commercially. Press releases prior to, and press briefings after, Commission meetings provide insight Into proposed and adopted changes in policies
and regulation, and are also issued on upcoming events, on-going programs
and/or special projects. In all, 58 news releases were issued during the year.
Information on Commission actions is disseminated every business day through
compilation of Digest notices of administrative actions, litigation releases and
other appropriate material. Where appropriate, Commission actions are brought
to the attention of the national and regional press.
Publication of an annual report provides information on Commission activities
to Congress, the securities bar and other interested parties. Through the Depositary Library System, the report is made available to selected colleges and universities throughout the country. A regular newsletter was published for Commission
employees, and approximately 63,000 requests for information from members of
the public were handled in 1984. More than 300 foreign visitors learned about the
SEC during the year, in programs coordinated by the Office.
Special projects during the year included support for the 50th Anniversary of
the Commission, especially the conception, coordination and publication of a
history entitled "Good People, Important Problems and Workable Laws, 50 Years
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission." The office also assisted on the
Major Issues Conference, the third SEC Forum on Small Business Capital Formation, and the Practicing Law Institute, and updated "Eagle on the Street," an
audiovisual presentation on the Commission. Finally, the Office began the transition to the EDGAR system.

55

Consumer Affairs
During fiscal 1984, the Commission's consumer affairs staff handled more
than 30,000 complaints and inquiries, an increase of more than 8% over 1983. Of
these, 48% involved investor conflicts with registered broker-dealers, 30% concerned issuers of securities, and 4% pertained to mutual funds. The remainder
were related to transfer agents, banks and investment advisers. The increase in
complaints and inquiries largely reflects the high volume of trading in the securities markets.
The staff carefully reviewed each complaint or inquiry. Matters appearing to
entail violations of the Federal securities laws were referred to an appropriate line
division for direct action. With matters not appearing to involve securities law
violations, the staff assisted investors by forwarding complaints to either an appropriate self-regulatory authority or to the entity that was the subject of the
complaint In many instances, the staff was successful in achieving an informal
resolution of the problem. During fiscal 1984, the staff also prepared materials to
assist investors with the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. divestiture, the
Washington Public Power Supply System default, and the Baldwin United Corporation annuities default
During fiscal 1984, 1,743 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and
2,391 requests for confidential treatment were handled, increases over 1983 of
21% and 30%, respectively. The requests for confidential treatment were typically
made in connection with proprietary corporate information, and were carefully
evaluated to prevent the indiscriminate and unwarranted release of information
exempt from the FOIA.ln addition, the staff processed 51 Privacy Act requests. To
ensure conformity in the administration of FOIA, Privacy Act and Sunshine Act
requirements, a seminar was conducted for headquarters and regional office
staff. Finally, the Commission's Public Reference Room processed 198,000 requests for information, an increase of 15% over 1983.
Equal Employment

Opportunity

Hiring of women and minorities has increased significantly. Since 1976, the
number of female attorneys at the Commission has increased from 11% to 32% ;
the number of minority attorneys rose from 5% to 10%. Currently, women comprise nearly 50% of the Cornrmssions workforce, and minorities, 30% .
The Commission, in cooperation with the Securities Industry Committee on
Equal Employment Opportunity, continued to sponsor a scholarship program for
deserving minority students pursuinq careers in the securities industry. Seven
were awarded during the year.
The contributions and achievements of minority groups were recognized with
special programs during Hispanic Heritage Week, Asian-Pacific Heritage Week,
Women's Week, Afro-American History Month, and on the birthdate of Dr. Martin
Luther King. In addition, the staff organized a series of workshops and clinics in
observance of National Secretaries Week
Finally, the Commission continued its program of EEO instruction for the staff.
During a two-day training program for the headquarters staff, more than 100
individuals were instructed in the principles of equal opportunity law and affirm a-

56

tive action, the prevention of discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, and methods for improving employment opportunities for minorities and
women.
Although the Commission is prohibited from accepting reimbursement from
regulated entities, the 1983 Securities Exchange Act amendments gave the Commission the authority to accept payment and reimbursement from other entities
to defray the cost of travel and subsistence expenses incurred by Commissioners
and staff for participation in meetings and conferences concerning functions or
activities of the Commission. During 1984, Commissioners participated in 31
events at a cost of $5,915 to the government The Commission was reimbursed in
the amount of $12,484 by other entities. Overall, staff participated in 217 meetings/conferences reimbursed at $71,747; Federal costs incurred amounted to
$11,206.

From the Minutes of August 28, 1984 Commission Meeting
The Commission notes with deep sorrow and regret the death of George A.
Fitzsimmons, Secretary of the Commission, on August 25, 1984. Mr. Fitzsimmons joined the Commission's staff in 1968 as a trial attorney in the Division of
Trading and Markets. He was appointed Secretary of the Commission by Chairman Ray Garrett, Jr. in 1973. Mr. Fitzsimmons served the Commission with great
dedication and was a trusted adviser to all of his colleagues. The Commission
and its staff extend their deepest sympathy to Mr. Fitzsimmons' family and his
many friends. Chairman John S.R. Shad said, "George was one of the most
highly regarded and well liked members of the senior staff. His institutional memory of past Commission actions has been an invaluable resource to the Commission. He will be greatly missed by all of us."

APPENDIX

Broker-dealers that are self-regulated
through their membership in a national secunties exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers earned revenues
of $37.1 billion in 1983,28 percent above
the 1982 level.' Almost 38 percent of this
increase in revenues stemmed from the
growth of commission revenue, which increased by $3.1 billion.
Trading gains on firms' securities accounts grew $984 million but declined to
23 percent of total revenues. Profits from

underwriting increased $1.4 billion and
rose as a percent of total revenues from
nine percent in 1982 to 11percent in 1983.
Securities commission income increased
42 percent while mutual fund sales increased 138 percent
Expenses grew by $7.2 billion to $31.9
billion in 1983. Revenue and Expenses increased by the same percentage (29%)
but still produced a pre-tax income of $5.2
billion, up 27 percent from the preceding
year.
Assets rose by $51.8 billion to $253.1
billion and liabilities grew $48.7 billion to
$237.0 billion. Ownership equity increased $3.2 billion during 1983 to $16.1
billion at year's end.

Securities Industry Dollar In
1983 For Carrying and Clearing
Firms
Data for carrying and clearing firms
only are presented here to allow for more
detail, as reporting requirements for introducing and carrying and clearing firms
differ and data aggregation of these two
types of firms necessarily results in loss of
detail. Carrying and clearing firms are
those firms which clear securities transactions or maintain possession or control of
customers' cash or secunues, The 87 percent of industry revenues earned by carryIng and clearing firms in 1983 suggests
that this group is a suitable proxy for the
Industry.
Securities commissions
and trading
gains accounted for 27 cents and 24
cents, respectively, of each revenue dollar
In 1983. Together these two items accounted for 51 cents of each revenue dollar earned in 1983 as compared to 52
cents in 1982. In terms of dollars, they accounted for $16.3 bilhon of the $32.2 billion of total revenues earned by carrying
and c1eanng firms. Margin interest income
accounted for seven cents of each revenue
dollar in 1983 compared WIth eight cents
In 1982.
Total expenses consumed 87 cents of
each revenue dollar earned in 1983, an increase over the 1982 level of 86 cents. The
industry's pre-tax profit margin of 13 cents
per revenue dollar in 1983 showed no significant change from 1982.
Interest expense, again the single largest

expense item, rose In 1983 by five percent
to absorb 21 cents of each revenue dollar,
which compares to 24 cents in 1982. In
dollars, interest expense amounted to $6.7
billion, $343 million more than the year
before. Employee-related expenses (registered representatives' compensation and
clerical and administrative employees' expenses) consumed 37 cents of the revenue dollar in 1983, three cent above the 34
cent level in 1982. Registered representatives' compensation while increasmq by 42
percent over the 1982 level, absorbed 21
cents of each revenue dollar in 1983 compared to 18 cents in the previous year. In
dollar terms, employee-related expenses
accounted for $11.9 billion of the $28.0
billion of total expenses.
Other expense
categories consumed about the same proportion of the industry revenue dollar in
1983 as they did in 1982.
Total assets of broker-dealers carrying
and clearing customer accounts rose by
$44.9 billion to $236.3 billion In 1983.
About 89 percent of this Increase in assets
can be attributed to three items: resale
agreements rose $24.9 billion, receivables
from customers grew $8.1 bilhon, receivables from other broker-dealers increased
$7.0 billion.
Total liabilities, including subordinated
debt, increased $42.4 billion or 24 percent
to $222.8 billion with increases in repurchase agreements of $12.6 billion and
short positions in securities of $8.8 billion.
Owners' equity rose 23 percent from $11.0
billion in 1982 to $13.5 billron and total
capital increased 25 percent to $16.3 billion from $13.0 billion In 1982.

Self Regulatory Organizations:
Revenues, Expenses, Pre-Tax
Income and Balance Sheet
Structure
In 1983 the total revenues of self-regulatory organizations ("SROs") rose over $112
million (27.8%) to $516.3 million, representing the largest yearly increase in several years. The New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE), National Association of Securities
Dealers (NASD) and American Stock Exchange (Am ex) accounted for over 70 percent of SROs' total revenues. Most SRO
revenues came from listing, trading and
market data fees. The NYSE reported total
revenues of $216.8 million of which approximately 60% was made up of listing
and trading fees. NASD reported total revenues of $75.1 million. A little over 53% of
this figure was derived from service fees
and member assessments. Amex reported
a total revenue figure of $73.1 million. Approximately 70 percent of these revenues
were derived from transaction and communication charges. Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) transaction fees,
which accounted for 80% of their total revenues in 1983, accounted for all of the
growth in their total revenues.
The total expenses of all SROs were
$434.3 million in 1983, an increase of
17 percent over 1982. The Midwest Stock
Exchange (MSE), Intermountain Stock Exchange (ISE) and Spokane Stock Exchange (SSE) had the largest percentage
increases in total expenses. Conversely, the
Boston Stock Exchange (BSE) was able to
reduce expenses nearly 7 percent.
Aggregate pre-tax income of all SROs
surged to $82.0 million in 1983, an increase of over 149 percent. The PSE is the
only exchange to show a decrease in pretax income. The NYSE reported pre-tax
income of $37.6 million, an increase of
136% over the previous year. NASD's pretax income of $16.1 million represented a
five-fold increase over the previous year.
The Cincinnati Stock Exchange (CSE) reported its pre-tax loss from $58,000 in
1982 to $16,000 in 1983. And the BSE had
pre-tax income of $255,000 in 1983 com-

pared to a pre-tax loss of $788,000 in
1982.
The total assets of all SROs were $883.3
million in 1983, an increase of 33 percent
over 1982. The NYSE's total assets were
$250.5 million, an increase of over 31 percent since 1982. BSE's total assets declined from $17.2 million in 1982 to $8.5
rnilhon, a decrease of more than 50 percent. CSE's total assets declined by 6 percent from 1982.
The aggregate net worth of SROs rose
to $309.0 million from $258.8 million in
1982, an increase of 19 percent, The CSE,
NASD and MSE showed the largest percentage increases over the previous year.
The largest dollar increases were experienced by the NYSE with $17.3 million and
the NASD with $16.1 rnilhon.
Aggregate clearing corporation service
revenue increased by $10 million in 1983
due to the substantial increase in equity
securities trading volume. The approximately 40% increase in volume of transaction processed resulted in only a 16%
increase in clearance services revenue because of the automated efficiencies of the
National Clearance and Settlement System.
Total depository services revenue for
1983 increased approximately 45% to
$101 million. This resulted primarily from a
50% increase in the number of shares represented by immobilized certificates in the
nationally interfaced depository systems.
Contributing significantly to this Increase
was greater institutional utilization of depository services. This increased usage
was induced by exchange and NASD rules
that, beginning January 1983, effecitively
required members and their customers to
use the facilities of a registered securities
depository for the confirmation, affirmation and settlement of Institutional trade
transactions in depository eligible securities. The value of institutional depository assets held in the nauonal depository
system was an estimated $1.1 trillion at the
end of 1983. These assets were held for
963 U.S. banks, including 99 of the largest
100 banks in managed trust assets.
Another area of depository service

95

growth in 1983 was In municipal securities.
Nearly 50,000 municipal issues were depository-eliqible at the end of 1983 compared with approximately 20,000 a year
earlier and less than 4,000 at the end
of 1981. Stimulating growth in c1eanng
and depository service for municipal
issues was the implementation in mid1983 of the Tax Equity and FIscal Responsibility Act which required that municipal
bonds with maturities of more than one
year be In registered rather than bearer
form to retain their tax-exempt status. Additionally, greater use of depository services for municipal securities is expected
because of amendments to the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board Rules G-12
and G-15 approved by the Cornmission in
the fourth quarter of 1983. These amendments require, beginning August 1984, the
use of automated trade confirmation/affirmation and comparison services for municipal securities transactions and, beginmng February 1985, depository
and
clearing corporation delivery and settlement of the vast majority of municipal
transactions. Implementation of these rules
IS expected to add sigruficantly to the use
of depositories for municipal issues which,
at the end of 1983, cornpnsed 5% of the
value of securities in depositories.
Aggregate clearing and depository expenses for 1983 increased by $40 million,
or 22% over 1982 levels. Most of the increases are attributable to the labor-intensive nature of depository activities which
resulted in an $18 million increase in depository employee costs. The $10 million
increase in occupancy costs is largely attributable to the Depository Trust Company's $6.4 million occupancy cost increase resulting from acquisition of additional vault and office space. Additionally,
MIdwest Securities Trust Company contracted for additional vault facilities at a
cost of $2.2 million in order to accommodate its municipal bond program. Midwest's increase is attributable primarily to
the Pacific Securities Depository Trust
Company (PSDTC) offering Midwest's
bearer bond system on a piggyback basis

96

to PSDTC participants.
PSDTC and PCC incurred pre-tax losses
in 1983 of $0.7 and $1.2 million, respectively. These losses would have been substantially greater had their parent corporation, the Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE),
assessed PSDTC and PCC for their $0.3
and $0.8 million pro-rata share of administrative and financial services costs provided by PSE. Subsequently, in an effort to
reduce expenses, PCC and PSDTC decided to consolidate operations in San
Francisco.
Combined clearing and depository net
worth increased modestly to $23 million.
In addition to net worth, participant clearing fund contributions provide financial
protection to the depositories and clearing
corporations in the case of a participant
default Participant clearing funds remained at approximately $210 million for
depositories and $200 million for the
equity clearing corporations while the Options Clearing Corporation's (OCC) clearing fund declined from $370 million at the
end of 1982 to $210 million at the end of
1983. acC's clearing fund had risen in late
1982 proportionate with a surge in trading
volume. OCC determined that the increased trading volume did not warrant a
proportionately higher clearing fund in
part because OCC also held $7.5 billion in
margin deposits at the end of 1982. Therefore, acc changed its formula for determining the requisite fund contribution,
reducing it to its present level.
Equity clearing corporations' settlement
system balances increased 300% because
of the unsettled when-issued trades in secunties of the American Telephone and
Telegraph Company (AT&T). The relative
price stability of those issues and the daily
mark-to-the-market
procedures of the
clearing corporations' settlement systems
reduced the risk associated with the $2 billion net system balance in AT&T issues.
The actual volume of shares processed
was approximately three times that of the
system balances because of the netting effect of the settlement system.

Exemptions For Foreign Private
Issuers
Rule 12g3-2 provides various exemptions from the registration provisions of
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act for the
securities of foreign private issuers. Perhaps the most important of these is that
contained in subparagraph (b) which provides an exemption for certain foreign issuers which submit, on a current basis, the
material specified in the rule. Such material includes that information about which
investors ought reasonably to be informed
and which the issuer: (1) has made public
pursuant to the law of the country of domi-

cile or in which it is incorporated or organized; (2) has filed with a foreign stock exchange on which its securities are traded
and which was made public by such exchange; and or (3) has distributed to its
security holders. Penodically,the Commission publishes a list of those foreign issuers which appear to be current under the
exemptive provision. The most current list
is as of October 5, 1983 and contains a
total of 445 foreign issuers.

Rule 10b-6 Exemptions
Exchange Act Rule 10b-6 is an antimanipulative rule that prohibits trading in
securities by persons interested in a distribution of such securities. During the fiscal year, the Commission granted 20
exemptions pursuant to paragraph (h) of
Rule 10b-6 under circumstances indicating that proposed purchase transactions
did not constitute manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances
comprehended within the purposes of the rule.

Effective registrations for cash sale for
the account of issuers in fiscal year 1983
amounted to $150 billion, ten percent below the $167 billion registered a year earlier. Some $38 billion (25 percent) was
intended for immediate offerings, a decrease of $21 billion (36 percent) from fiscal 1983. Nearly all of this amount consisted of securities registered by business
to be offered to the general public. Such
registrations totalled $37 billion. a decrease of $20 billion (35 percent).
Of this $37 billion, debt securities and
common stock each accounted for $17
billion (46 percent) and preferred stock $3
billion (eight percent). Cash rights offerings (offerings to security holders) came
to $466 million, an increase of 121 percent
from the $211 million of such offerings in
the previous year. Immediate cash offerings by foreign governments in fiscal year
1984 totalled $99 million, a decrease of
$944 million (91 percent) from 1983.
Delayed and extended cash sales registered for the account of the issuer totalled
$113 billion (51 percent of all registrations).
Registrations pursuant to Rule 415, (or socalled "shelf' registrations) amounted to
$71 billion, or 63 percent of this amount
Securities registered for the account of issuers other than for cash sale (in conjunc-

tion with exchange offers, for example)
amounted to $63 bilhon in 1984, or 29
percent of all registrations. Registrations of
securities for secondary offerings (for the
account of secunty holders rather than ISsuers) amounted to $6 billion (three percent) of all registrations in fiscal year 1984.
Of these latter registrations, $2 billion (33
percent) were for cash sale and $4 billion
(67 percent) were for other secondary offerings.
The value of registrations aggregating
$220 billion In fiscal year 1984 consisted
of $64 billion in bonds, debentures and
notes, $9 billion in preferred stock and
$147 billion in common stock. Of the $64
billion of debt securities registered, $17 billion (27 percent) were registered for immediate cash sale to the general public for
the account of the issuer Delayed and extended cash sales accounted for $43 billion (67 percent). Thirty-four percent of
the $9 billion in preferred stock registrations consisted of immediate cash offerings, while delayed and extended registrations for cash sale for the account of issuer
comprised 24 percent of the total. The

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table reflects, the securities laws
provide for a wide range of enforcement
actions by the Commission. The most
common types of actions are injunctive
proceedings instituted in the Federal
district courts to enjoin continued or

120

threatened securities law violators, and administrative proceedings pertaining to broker-dealer firms and/or individuals associated with such firms which may lead to
various remedial sanctions as required in
the public mterest When an injunction is
entered by a court, violation of the court's
decree is a basis for criminal contempt
against the violator.

information concerning the company's financial condition or business operations,
or because transactions in the company's
securities suggested possible manipulation or other Violations.

Foreign Restricted List
The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign
Restricted List which is designed to put
broker-dealers, financial institutions, investors and others on notice of possible unlawful distributions of foreign securities in
the United States. The list consists of
names of foreign companies whose securities the Commission has reason to believe have been, or are being offered for
public sale in the United States in possible
violation of the registration requirement of
Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.
The offer and sale of unregistered securities deprives investors of all the protections afforded by the Securities Act of
1933, including the right to receive a prospectus containing the information required by the Act for the purpose of
enabling the investor to determine whether
the investment is suitable for him. While
most broker-dealers refuse to effect transactions in securities issued by companies
on the Foreign Restricted List, this does
not necessarily prevent promoters from illegally offering such securities directly to
investors in the United States by mail, by
telephone, and sometimes by personal solicitation. The following foreign corporations and other foreign entities comprise
the Foreign Restricted List,
1. Aguacate Consolidated Mines, Incorporated (Costa Rica)

Right to Financial Privacy
Section 21(h)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.s.C 78u(h)(6»)
requires that the Commission "compile an
annual tabulation of the occasions on
which the Commission used each separate subparagraph or clause of [Section
21(h)(2)] or the provisions of the Right to
Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [12 U.S.C
3401-22 (the "RFPA")] to obtain access to
financial records of a customer and include it in its annual report to the Congress." During the fiscal year, the
Commission successfully made five applications to courts for an order pursuant
to the subparagraphs and clauses of Section 21(h)(2) to obtain access to financial

records of a customer. In this application,
the
provisions
of
Subsections
21(h)(2)(A)(iv), (A)(v), (B), and (D)(ii) were
relied upon. The table below sets forth the
number of occasions upon which the
Commission obtained access to the financial records of a customer using the procedures provided by: (i) Section 1104 of
the RFPA [12 U.s.C 3404], applicable to
customer authorizations, (ii) Section 1105
of the RFPA[12 U.S.C 3405], applicable to
admimstrative subpoenas; and (iii) Section
1107 of the RFPA [12 U.S.C 3407), applicable to judicial subpoenas.

SEC OPERATIONS
During fiscal 1984, the Commission estimates that it will collect a record $111.5
million in fees for deposit into the General
Fund of the Treasury. Such fees will
amount to nearly 118% of the Commission's fiscal 1984 appropriation, compared

140

with 110% in fiscal 1983. The four sources
of fees were registration of securities under
the Securities Act of 1933 (53%), transactions on securities exchanges (34%), miscellaneous filings and reporting fees (12% )
and the registration of regulated brokerdealers (1% ).
