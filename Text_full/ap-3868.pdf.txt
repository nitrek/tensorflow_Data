ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17228

In the Matter of
DAVID S. HALL, P.C.
ORDER FOLLOWING
d/b/a THE HALL GROUP CPAs,
PREHEARING CONFERENCE
DAVID S. HALL, CPA,
MICHELLE L. HELTERBRAN COCHRAN, CPA,
and SUSAN A. CISNEROS

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
in this matter on April 26, 2016. Michelle L. Helterbran Cochran, CPA, submitted an answer to
the OIP, and the answer of David S. Hall, P.C. d/b/a the Hall Group CPAs, and David S. Hall,
CPA, is due June 10, 2016, pursuant to my prior order granting an extension.
Today, I held a telephonic prehearing conference, at which all parties except Susan A.
Cisneros appeared. Based on U.S. Postal Service confirmation of receipt, I found that Cisneros
was served with the OIP on May 11. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(i). Ordinarily, her answer to
the OIP would be due twenty days after service. See OIP at 10; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b).
However, I sua sponte granted Cisneros an extension and directed that her answer to the OIP’s
allegations be due June 10, 2016.
I granted leave for all parties to file motions for summary disposition, pursuant to Rule of
Practice 250, 17 C.F.R. § 201.250. I set the following summary disposition schedule and hearing
date:
July 1, 2016:

Motions for summary disposition are due.

July 22, 2016:

Summary disposition oppositions are due.

August 1, 2016:

Summary disposition replies are due.

October 24, 2016:

Hearing begins in Dallas, TX, at a time and location to be
determined.

Also, I directed the parties to confer and file a joint proposed prehearing schedule by June
17, 2016. The proposed schedule should include, at minimum, due dates by which the parties
shall: 1) file and exchange exhibit and witness lists, and exchange (but not file) final pre-marked
exhibits; 2) file and exchange expert reports; and 3) file any motions in limine and objections. In
lieu of prehearing briefs, the parties may make opening statements at the hearing.
The parties are asked to e-mail PDF text-searchable courtesy copies of any filings in this
proceeding to alj@sec.gov. Any documents or exhibits submitted in support of a party’s
summary disposition motion should be emailed as separate attachments, not as a combined PDF.
