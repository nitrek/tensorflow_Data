INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
June 3, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of Respondents
Gold Hills Mining, Ltd., Massive Dynamics, Inc., Medisafe 1 Technologies Corp., and MDU
Communications International, Inc. The revocation is based on Respondents’ failures to timely
file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On April 21, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding under Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with an order instituting administrative proceedings (OIP). The
OIP alleges that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission under Exchange
Act Section 12(g) and have repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the Commission,
in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder.
Respondents were served with the OIP by May 1, 2016, and their answers were due by May 16,
2016. Gold Hills Mining, Ltd., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3850, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1769
(ALJ May 18, 2016). On May 18, 2016, I noted that Respondents had not filed answers and
ordered them to show cause by May 31, 2016, why the registrations of their securities should not
be revoked by default due to their failures to file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding.
Id. Respondents did not attend the telephonic prehearing conference held on May 31, 2016, and
to date have not filed answers or responded to the show cause order.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondents are in default for failing to file answers, attend the prehearing conference, or
otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).
Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the
following allegations in the OIP to be true.
Gold Hills Mining, Ltd., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1129018, is a revoked Nevada
corporation located in New York, New York, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended March 31, 2013, which reported a net loss of over $1.9 million for the prior
nine months. As of April 12, 2016, the company’s stock (symbol GHML) was quoted on OTC
Link (previously, Pink Sheets) operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (OTC Link), had six market
makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
Massive Dynamics, Inc., CIK No. 1519534, is a revoked Nevada corporation located in
Rochester, New York, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended June 30, 2013, which reported a net loss of over $4.59 million for the prior three months.
As of April 12, 2016, the company’s stock (symbol MSSD) was quoted on OTC Link, had seven
market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c211(f)(3).
Medisafe 1 Technologies Corp., CIK No. 1471487, is a void Delaware corporation
located in Jerusalem, Israel, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended June 30, 2013, which reported a net loss of $333,331 for the prior six months. As of April
12, 2016, the company’s stock (symbol MFTH) was quoted on OTC Link, had five market
makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
MDU Communications International, Inc., CIK No. 1086139, is a void Delaware
corporation located in Totowa, New Jersey, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended June 30, 2013, which reported a net loss of over $2.92 million for the prior nine
months. As of April 12, 2016, the company’s stock (symbol MDTV) was quoted on OTC Link,
had six market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule
15c2- 11(f)(3).
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failures to maintain

2

valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive
such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. “Compliance with those requirements is
mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is
not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250,
1268 (D.D.C. 1978). Respondents failed to file timely periodic reports. As a result,
Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will ensure that investors
are adequately protected, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of
the issuer’s violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability
involved, the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future
compliance, and the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway
Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May
31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because the failures
constitute violations of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). Respondents’
violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See Nature’s
Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21,
2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due over a two-year period);
Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May
23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period considered
recurrent). Respondents are also culpable because they failed to heed delinquency letters sent to
them by the Division of Corporation Finance or, through their failures to maintain valid
addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive such
letters. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at
*37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even without proof that a
3

respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally, Respondents have not answered the
OIP, appeared at the prehearing conference, responded to the show cause order, or otherwise
participated in the proceeding to address whether they have made any efforts to remedy their past
violations. They have also made no assurances against further violations.
For the reasons described above, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registrations of each class of Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, under Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrations of each class of registered securities of Gold Hills Mining, Ltd., Massive Dynamics,
Inc., Medisafe 1 Technologies Corp., and MDU Communications International, Inc., are hereby
REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party
may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,
pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is
filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
