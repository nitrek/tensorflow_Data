ORDER GRANTING EXTENSION
Chief Administrative Law Judge Brenda P. Murray has moved, pursuant to Commission
Rule of Practice 360(a)(3),1 for a six-month extension to issue the initial decision as to Edward
M. Daspin in this proceeding. The initial decision is currently due by February 22, 2016.
We adopted Rule of Practice 360(a) to enhance the timely and efficient adjudication and
disposition of Commission administrative proceedings by setting deadlines for issuance of an
initial decision.2 That rule provides for extensions of those deadlines under certain
circumstances if supported by a motion from the Chief Administrative Law Judge and if we
determine that "additional time is necessary or appropriate in the public interest."3 From our
review of the present motion, it appears appropriate in the public interest to grant the Chief
Administrative Law Judge’s request and extend the time period for filing the initial decision.4
