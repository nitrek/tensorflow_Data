In the Matter of
ORDER FOLLOWING
EASYLINK INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On December 23, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its
periodic filings. On January 15, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
stating that the OIP was sent via U.S. Postal Service international registered mail, return receipt
requested, to Respondent’s address in Taiwan shown on its most recent EDGAR filing, but that
tracking information is unavailable for international registered mail to Taiwan.1 The declaration
also stated that delivery of the OIP to Respondent was unsuccessfully attempted via UPS on
January 8, 2016.
On January 19, 2016, I held a telephonic prehearing conference at which only the
Division of Enforcement appeared. The Division had no further information concerning delivery
of the OIP, and I indicated that I would delay issuing this order by fifteen days to allow time for
additional information to become available from the Office of the Secretary. Tr. at 4, 7-8. To
date, the Office of the Secretary has received no information regarding delivery or attempted
delivery of the OIP by U.S. Postal Service.
I find that service of the OIP on Respondent is not yet established in accordance with
Rule of Practice 141(a)(2). See 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), (iv). Service was not effected in
accordance with Rule 141(a)(2)(ii) because service on a corporation or entity by U.S. Postal
Service requires “a confirmation of attempted delivery.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii).
Alternatively, Rule 141(a)(2)(iv) states that service on “a person in a foreign country” may be
made by any “method reasonably calculated to give notice, provided that the method of service
used is not prohibited by the law of the foreign country.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(iv). The
U.S. Department of State website states that “[s]ervice of process in Taiwan can be effected by
international registered mail/return receipt requested.” http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/

Information from the Office of the Secretary indicates that the OIP was mailed on December
23, 2015.

concerning the date of actual or attempted delivery of the OIP by “international registered mail”
(as opposed to UPS), it is not yet possible to establish a date that service of the OIP was effected.
See id.; see also Kim v. United States, 461 F.Supp.2d 34, 40 n.5 (D.D.C. 2006) (indicating that
delivery by Federal Express is not equivalent to certified or registered mail under the federal
rules of civil procedure). Without a definitive service date, it is impossible to determine when
Respondent’s answer is due, when Respondent may be deemed in default, or by what date my
initial decision must be issued. See OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f), .360(a)(2).
I therefore ORDER the Division to file by February 24, 2016, a declaration providing an
update on the status of service of the OIP.
