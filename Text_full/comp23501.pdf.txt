Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“the Commission” or “the SEC”) alleges:

SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1.

Since October 2013, New Jersey investment adviser, John Bivona, has orchestrated a

4 Ponzi-like scheme that has defrauded investors in up-and-coming technology companies.
5

2.

Bivona, together with companies he controls, has raised over $53 million in the SRA

6 Funds, which marketed investments in early-to late-stage, pre-IPO technology companies, most of
7 which are based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
8

3.

Bivona and his companies, Saddle River Advisors, LLC (“Saddle River”) and SRA

9 Management Associates, LLC (“SRA Management”), promised SRA Funds investors that their
10 money would be used only to buy shares in the specific pre-IPO companies they were interested in
11 and to pay specified fees. From the outset, however, Bivona lied to investors and used their money to
12 purchase shares promised to earlier investors in other unrelated funds. Bivona also used the SRA
13 Funds’ bank accounts to pay for a myriad of personal expenses for himself and his family. By
14 December 2013, the SRA Funds were already short several million dollars.
15

4.

Bivona and his companies disguised their misconduct by continually transferring

16 money in and out of multiple bank accounts associated with more than a dozen different funds and
17 entities. Millions of dollars have been funneled to pay for the expenses of earlier funds that Bivona
18 and his companies also manage, while at least $5.7 million has been diverted to family members to
19 pay, among other things, credit card bills, income taxes, a car loan, unrelated defense attorney fees,
20 and the mortgage on a Jersey Shore vacation home. Bivona and his companies failed to provide
21 investors with the promised financial statements that should have revealed their fraud.
22

5.

Bivona steered the lion’s share of the misappropriated money to benefit Bivona’s

23 nephew, Frank Mazzola, who faced SEC fraud charges for an earlier investment scheme, which
24 resulted in the March 2014 entry of permanent injunctions by this Court and the institution of an
25 administrative SEC order barring Mazzola from the securities industry for at least three years.
26

6.

Bivona is currently generating additional cash by soliciting money for a supposedly

27 new investment vehicle, the Fortuna Fund. But this “new” fund is run by the same Saddle River

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1 employees, and Fortuna Fund investment money has recently been diverted to cover SRA Fund
2 expenses.
3

7.

Bivona and his companies have made material misstatements and have violated, and

4 continue to violate, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. To halt their fraud and
5 protect current and future investors, the Commission seeks emergency relief in this action, enjoining
6 Bivona’s—as well as Saddle River’s and SRA Management’s—violations of the anti-fraud
7 provisions of the federal securities laws, freezing assets, requiring Bivona and the companies to
8 conduct an accounting, and appointing an independent monitor over Saddle River, SRA
9 Management, the SRA Funds, and other entities holding assets on behalf of the SRA Funds while this
10 litigation is pending and afterwards.
11

8.

In addition to this fraud, the defendants in this case have engaged in a host of other

12 misconduct that violated federal laws and regulations intended to protect the investing public.
13 Accordingly, the Commission also seeks an order permanently enjoining all defendants from further
14 violations of the federal securities laws, requiring defendants to disgorge ill-gotten gains plus
15 prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.
16
17

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
9.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d), and 22(a) of the

18 Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a)], Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the
19 Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa], and Sections 209 and 214 of the Investment
20 Advisors Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-9, 80b-14]. Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the
21 means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails in connection with the acts,
22 transactions, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
23

10.

Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15

24 U.S.C. § 77v(a)], Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)], and Section 214 of the
25 Advisors Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-14]. Acts, practices, and courses of business that form the basis for
26 the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred in this District.
27

11.

Under Civil Local Rule 3-2(d), this civil action should be assigned to the San

28 Francisco Division because a substantial part of the events or omissions that give rise to the claims

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
A.

Bivona, Mazzola, Saddle River, and SRA Management Solicited Investors to
Invest in the SRA Funds.

22.

In late 2013 and during 2014, Bivona and Mazzola established three investment funds:

SRA I, SRA II, and SRA III (the “SRA Funds”).
23.

Both Saddle River and SRA Management serve as investment advisers to the SRA

Funds. According to the Investment Management Agreement among Saddle River, SRA
Management, and the SRA Funds, SRA Management provides management services to the SRA
Funds, while Saddle River provides investment advice to the SRA Funds. Saddle River and SRA
Management receive compensation for the advice they provide to the SRA Funds. In practice,
Bivona has treated SRA Management and Saddle River (the “Saddle River Defendants”) as one
entity by commingling assets.
24.

The SRA Funds contain several series, and each series purportedly contains shares, or

an economic interest in shares, in one or more particular pre-IPO companies (the “pre-IPO
interests”), most of which are headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. The SRA Funds are
pooled investment vehicles as defined in Rule 206(4)-8(b) of the Advisers Act. Investor money is
pooled together in each of the SRA Funds in order to purchase the pre-IPO interests. According to
each of the SRA Funds’ Operating Agreements, they relied on the exclusion in Section 3(c)(1) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 to not be deemed an investment company under the federal
securities laws.
25.

Bivona, Mazzola, and others who worked for the Saddle River Defendants solicited

investors for the SRA Funds by offering the opportunity to invest in the pre-IPO interests of various
not-yet-public companies, like Dropbox, Inc.; Palantir Technologies, Inc.; Bloom Energy; Square,
Inc.; Twitter, Inc.; and Box Inc. (the last three of which have since become publicly traded).
COMPLAINT

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1

26.

According to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum (“PPM”) and Limited

2 Liability Operating Agreement (“Operating Agreement”) for each SRA Fund, which is signed by
3 Bivona as manager of SRA Management, the money raised from investors was to be used to purchase
4 pre-IPO interests that would be held in separate “Series,” so that investors could make a “separate
5 and distinct investment in a specific company or companies.” Investments in the SRA Funds would
6 be used to obtain an interest in a particular series of the SRA Funds equivalent to a certain number of
7 pre-IPO interests of that particular pre-IPO company.
8

27.

Investors in the SRA Funds hoped to make money on their investment from a

9 “liquidity event” at one of these pre-IPO companies—either through an acquisition of that company
10 by another company or through the company’s initial public offering. If this liquidity event caused
11 the shares to be valued at more than what the SRA Funds paid for the pre-IPO interests, plus
12 expenses, investors would receive a return on their investment. Investors paid to obtain an interest
13 and receive an eventual distribution only for their particular series.
14

28.

From October 2013 through at least November 2015, Bivona and the Saddle River

15 Defendants actively solicited investors to invest in the SRA Funds by, among other things, sending
16 emails to large groups of prospective investors, touting an opportunity to invest in one of the many
17 series contained in the SRA Funds. Frank Mazzola, Bivona’s nephew, sent over fifty emails to
18 prospective investors soliciting investments in the SRA Funds from October 2013 through at least
19 August 27, 2014.
20

29.

To date, Bivona, Mazzola, and the Saddle River Defendants have raised a total of

21 approximately $53.4 million from investors for the SRA Funds, many of whom reside in the San
22 Francisco Bay Area.

The Confidential Private Placement Memoranda (“PPM”) and Operating
Agreements Distributed to Investors Authorized the Saddle River Defendants to

Bivona directed the Saddle River Defendants to send prospective investors a

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1 Bivona’s attention and that “[i]nquiries should be directed to” Bivona. Bivona is also one of two
2 individuals named as managers of the SRA Funds. Bivona also, in his role as manager of SRA
3 Management, countersigned the signature pages of the SRA Funds’ Operating Agreements,
4 subscription agreements with investors, and accredited investor questionnaires. The SRA Funds’
5 PPMs state that they may not be shared without the permission of Saddle River or SRA Management.
6

31.

According to the PPM and Operating Agreement for each SRA Fund, the Saddle River

7 Defendants may charge investors in the SRA Funds various “front-end fees,” including a
8 “management fee” of 2% of the investment amount, a “due diligence fee” of between 1-5% of the
9 investment amount, and an “expense fee” of 1% of the investment amount. After the first year, an
10 investor must also pay the Saddle River Defendants an additional “management fee” of 2% of the
11 investment amount per year, 0.5% to be charged quarterly during the life of the funds, but paid at the
12 time of a liquidity event. The Operating Agreement of each SRA Fund states that the managers will
13 be responsible for paying the operating costs of the fund.
14

32.

The Saddle River Defendants also charge investors in the SRA Funds a “back-end

15 fee,” which equals a percentage of the net profits realized by investors, usually 20%.
16

33.

The Saddle River Defendants negotiate the front-end and back-end fees separately

17 with each SRA Fund investor, and frequently waive or discount one or more of these fees.
18

34.

While the Operating Agreement of each SRA Fund gives discretion to “the Manager,”

19 SRA Management—and hence to Saddle River as well since Bivona treated them as one company—
20 to conduct the business of the funds, they do not permit the Manager to make loans to other funds or
21 other entities or to receive any fees other than the ones enumerated in the Operating Agreement.
22

35.

The PPM and Operating Agreement promised investors that Bivona, Saddle River and

23 SRA Management would maintain “proper and complete records . . . in accordance with generally
24 accepted account principles” and provide investors with annual financial statements prepared in
25 substantial accordance with generally accepted accounting principles by a firm of independent
26 certified public accountants of recognized national standing. The SRA Funds’ investors have never
27 received the promised annual financial statements.

C.

The SRA Funds Purchased Pre-IPO Interests through Clear Sailing.

36.

The SRA Funds did not directly purchase the pre-IPO interests. Instead, Bivona

purchased the pre-IPO interests on behalf of the SRA Funds through Clear Sailing. Accordingly,
Bivona routed millions of dollars of investor money through Clear Sailing. According to joinder
agreements between Clear Sailing and the SRA Funds, the SRA Funds are “members,” and therefore
owners, of Clear Sailing.
37.

During the relevant time period, Bivona controlled the bank accounts for Clear

Sailing, the Saddle River Defendants, and the SRA Funds and authorized all of the money transfers
from those accounts.
38.

Although Bivona controls the Saddle River Defendants and their bank accounts, in

2013—during the pendency of the earlier SEC fraud action against Mazzola—Bivona and Mazzola
transferred ownership of both SRA Management and Saddle River to their wives, relief defendants
Michele Mazzola and Anne Bivona, neither of whom have any experience in the securities industry
or at investment advisers or broker-dealer firms, and neither of whom has performed any work for
Saddle River, SRA Management, or the SRA Funds.
D.

Bivona Misappropriated Over $5.7 Million of Investor Money to Benefit Himself
and His Family.

39.

The SRA Funds’ Operating Agreements permitted money to be used to purchase pre-

17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26

28

IPO interests or to pay the agreed-upon fees. However, Bivona diverted millions of dollars of
investor money to himself and family members that far exceeded the fees to which the Saddle River
Defendants were entitled.
40.

For example, between October 2013 and December 31, 2013, Bivona transferred

$364,000 of SRA Fund investor money to Mazzola, but the front-end fees received by the Saddle
River Defendants totaled only $15,000. Thus, in the first two months of the SRA Funds, Mazzola
pocketed $349,000 more than the SRA Funds were allowed to receive in fees.
41.

Similarly, in March 2014, Bivona diverted $795,000 to Mazzola and relief defendant

Michele Mazzola, $495,000 of which came from the SRA Funds (and the other $300,000 came from
Clear Sailing). Yet by March 2014, the Saddle River Defendants had only earned $208,000 in frontCOMPLAINT

8

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1 end fees from the SRA Funds. By the end of March 2014, therefore, Bivona funneled to the Mazzolas
2 at least $859,000 from SRA Fund money ($364,000 through December 2013 plus $495,000 in March
3 2014), even though the total SRA Fund front-end fees through March equaled only $208,000.
4

42.

All told, between October 2013 and January 2016, Bivona funneled $2.7 million to the

5 Mazzolas originating from the SRA Funds. Bivona steered some of these payments to pay for the
6 Mazzolas’ car loan, taxes, and mortgage on their second home.
7

43.

Bivona also diverted almost $1 million of SRA Fund investor money to his wife, relief

8 defendant Anne Bivona.
9

44.

Bivona testified that the money paid to Anne Bivona and Michele Mazzola

10 represented profit distributions. But, in fact, the money was not paid for value received or as
11 “profits” from the business. According to internal accounting records, of which Bivona is aware, the
12 Saddle River Defendants have suffered net losses every year since 2013 and their balance sheets
13 reflect negative equity of over $1 million.
14

45.

In addition to improperly diverting investor money to his wife and the Mazzolas,

15 Bivona diverted another almost $2 million of SRA Fund investor money to pay for legal fees incurred
16 on behalf of Felix Investments, Mazzola, and other individuals relating to work they performed while
17 at Felix Investments and on an oil and gas project in which Mazzola is involved that has nothing to
18 do with the SRA Funds.
19

46.

Between October 2013 and January 2016, the Saddle River Defendants were entitled

20 to $1.9 million in total fees. But Bivona and the Saddle River Defendants steered $2.7 million of
21 SRA Fund investor money to the Mazzolas; $1 million to Anne Bivona; and $2 million to law firms
22 to pay for legal fees for work performed for Felix Investments. Additionally, Bivona and the Saddle
23 River Defendants had the SRA Funds pay for expenses that should have been paid by Saddle River or
24 SRA Management out of fees earned from the SRA Funds.
25

47.

Thus, Bivona and the Saddle River Defendants diverted at least $5.7 million for his

26 own benefit or the benefit of his family—at least $3.7 million more than the fees the Saddle River
27 Defendants could possibly be entitled to.

48.

Bivona knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the SRA Funds’ Operating

3 reckless in not knowing, that he was not using investor money in the way that was described in the
4 SRA Funds’ PPM.
5

E.

Bivona and the Saddle River Defendants Misappropriated SRA Fund Money To
Pay Earlier Investors And Prop Up Earlier Funds.

49.

Bivona and the Saddle River Defendants also have improperly diverted SRA Fund

6
7

8 money to fund other earlier Bivona-controlled funds, other Bivona-affiliated entities, and even other
9 unrelated entities. They also have improperly commingled money between and among SRA I, SRA
10 II, and SRA III.
11

50.

Large investor money transfers went to earlier Bivona funds in true Ponzi fashion. For

12 example, in November 2013, within a few weeks of launching SRA I, Bivona started transferring
13 money from SRA I to an earlier Bivona-controlled fund called NYPA II. By the end of November
14 2013, Bivona had transferred $985,000 from SRA I to NYPA II. By the close of December 2013,
15 Bivona transferred almost $2.1 million from SRA I to NYPA II and another affiliated fund, NYPA I
16 (together with NYPA II, the “NYPA funds”) to cover shortfalls in these earlier funds—to buy shares
17 for, and pay back, earlier investors in other non-SRA related funds.
18

51.

SRA I also received money from these NYPA funds in order to pay for upfront costs,

19 but the money going out of the SRA I account far exceeded the money coming in. Between October
20 2013 and December 2013, Bivona transferred a net of approximately $1.4 million from SRA I to the
21 NYPA funds. Between October 2013 and September 2014, Bivona diverted a net of at least $2
22 million from all three SRA Funds to the NYPA funds.
23

52.

Even though investors had deposited over $4.7 million into SRA I by the end of

24 December 2013, the SRA I bank account had only $35,000 remaining at that time. Over $2.8 million
25 of this investor money was diverted to uses other than to purchase pre-IPO interests for SRA I
26 investors.
27
28
COMPLAINT

10

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1

53.

In an effort to mask the misuse of funds, Bivona called many of these unauthorized

2 money transfers “loans” in the Saddle River Defendants’ internal accounting records. These “loans”
3 were not documented and had no terms.
4

54.

Since 2013, investor money from the SRA Funds has constantly been used for

5 purposes unrelated to the SRA Funds. At times, the balances in their bank accounts dipped to $1,000
6 or less. When one fund did not have enough money to pay expenses, Bivona transferred money from
7 another fund’s bank account. That second fund’s bank account would then be depleted, and Bivona
8 would transfer money from the third fund’s bank account. This quickly led to a “waterfall” effect in
9 which there were always shortages in fund accounts, leading to ever more unauthorized transfers.
10

55.

Bivona frequently transferred money from one fund to another such that the SRA

11 Funds used investor money for purposes never disclosed to investors, including to pay back another
12 fund’s investors when a deal to purchase pre-IPO interests fell through, to purchase shares for the
13 benefit of other funds, or to pay for another fund’s operating expenses.
14

56.

Bivona knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the SRA Funds’ Operating

15 Agreements did not authorize him to use SRA Fund money in this way. He also knew, or was
16 reckless in not knowing, that he was not using investor money in the way that was described in the
17 SRA Funds’ PPM.

Bivona Has Been Rapidly Dissipating Assets, and Is Attempting to Quickly
Generate Cash Through the New Fortuna Funds.

57.

In March 2015, Bivona represented in sworn testimony before Commission staff that

20

21 he was closing Saddle River and leaving the securities industry. And, in late October 2015, Bivona
22 sent an email to some investors informing them that he was closing Saddle River and would not be
23 accepting any new investments in the SRA Funds.
24

58.

But, according to bank records and an investor welcome letter, on January 27, 2016,

25 the SRA Funds received $150,000 from an investor for an investment in a series containing shares of
26 a technology company.

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1 to the Fortuna Fund— has sent solicitation emails—through March 2016—from a Fortuna Fund
2 email address, “jbivona@fortunafunds.com,” as well as from his law firm’s email address, imploring
3 people to invest in a host of pre-IPO companies through Fortuna. For example, in a February 2016
4 email sent from his Fortuna email account, Bivona targeted an SRA Fund investor: “we have a block
5 of Palantir stock at $8.00 per share which is a great price and the terms are even better. . . . [A]nyone
6 who takes advantage of this opportunity will make a killing. . . . Best Regards, John Bivona The
7 Fortuna Funds.”
8

60.

This email reveals that Bivona’s Fortuna Fund phone number is the same one provided

9 to SRA Funds investors in their subscription agreement welcome letter, and the Fortuna Funds has
10 the same street address as earlier Bivona-controlled funds.
11

61.

In continuing the Ponzi-like nature of the scheme, in January 2016, the Fortuna Fund

12 transferred approximately $75,000 of investor money to Saddle River and SRA II. Bank statements
13 show that Bivona used at least $50,000 to pay the Saddle River Defendants’ operating expenses.
14

62.

As of January 29, 2016, the Saddle River Defendants had just $50,000 in their

15 combined two bank accounts, with only $69 remaining in SRA Management’s account.
16

63.

The SRA Funds’ bank accounts are similarly depleted. Putting aside the $150,000 that

17 was recently received from an investor, as of late January 2016, the SRA Funds had a combined
18 $6,000 left in their three bank accounts.
19

G.

Defendants Also Have Violated an SEC Order and SEC Registration
Requirements.

In addition to the fraud committed by Bivona, Saddle River and SRA Management,

Mazzola has violated an administrative order issued by the Commission barring him, with a right to
reapply in three years, from the securities industry. He also, along with Bivona, Saddle River, and
SRA Management, has violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws in connection
with their offering of the SRA Fund interests. Finally, Saddle River and SRA Management have
violated the broker-dealer registration requirements.

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1

1.

65.

Mazzola Violated an SEC Bar Order, Yet Bivona Permitted Him to
Remain Associated with Saddle River.

In March 2012, the SEC filed an enforcement action in this Court against Mazzola and

4 two affiliated entities alleging fraud and misappropriation of investor money. On March 10, 2014,
5 this Court entered final judgments against the defendants and permanently enjoined the defendants
6 from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In a separate administrative
7 action, on March 20, 2014, the SEC instituted an order barring Mazzola from the securities industry
8 with the right to reapply after three years (the “SEC Bar Order”).
9

66.

The SEC Bar Order included a carve-out period during which Mazzola was permitted

10 to remain associated with Felix Investments and Saddle River (together, the “Felix Entities”) until
11 August 31, 2014 (hereinafter “Carve-Out Period”), for the sole purpose of winding down his affairs at
12 both firms.
13

67.

The SEC Bar Order also included “undertakings.” The SEC Bar Order required that

14 during the Carve-Out Period Mazzola was not permitted to raise new capital, request additional funds
15 from existing investors, or solicit any existing investors to roll their current investment into any other
16 investment with the Felix Entities. And the SEC Bar Order prohibited Mazzola from receiving any
17 compensation for the limited work he was permitted to perform during the Carve-Out Period.
18

68.

The SEC Bar Order stated further that if Mazzola violates any of the undertakings, he

19 would be subject immediately to the terms of the bar order without any Carve-Out Period.
20

69.

Almost immediately after the March 2014 SEC Bar Order against him, Mazzola

21 violated that order by, among other things, raising capital for the SRA Funds and providing
22 investment advice to other investment funds.
23

70.

Since March 20, 2014, Mazzola has sent over fifty emails to prospective and existing

24 investors of the SRA Funds encouraging them to invest in the SRA Funds or asking them to roll over
25 existing investments into new investments with the funds. Some of these emails were sent to
26 hundreds of investors. Others were directed at individual investors and implored those investors to
27 transfer money quickly to secure placement in the funds.
28
COMPLAINT

13

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1

71.

For instance, on March 31, 2014, just days after the institution of the SEC Bar Order,

2 Mazzola sent an email soliciting an investor to purchase securities through Saddle River, asking: “Do
3 you have an interest in Alibaba?” Mazzola followed up with emails that same day and the next, April
4 1, 2014—copying other Saddle River employees—asking that investor to send $500,000: “Felix has
5 [the Alibaba shares] at $55 per share and Felix is cutting their normal fees in half in consideration of
6 the short duration of the investment.… [T]his is a big position for us and we need to close it as
7 quickly as possible. There is a huge demand away from us and they will bid this stock right up to the
8 IPO price because everyone is convinced it will double day one. When do you think you can wire
9 funds? Thanks Frank.”
10

72.

Because Mazzola violated an undertaking of the SEC Bar Order by soliciting investors

11 as early as March 31, 2014, Mazzola was required to disassociate himself from Saddle River and the
12 related entity, Felix Investments, at that time. But Mazzola did not resign from Felix Investments
13 until June 2014 and further did not resign from Saddle River until August 2014.
14

73.

Bivona knew about the SEC Bar Order when it was instituted. From March 20, 2014

15 to August 27, 2014, only Bivona and Mazzola controlled Saddle River, and Bivona has controlled
16 SRA Management during the entire relevant timeframe. None of Bivona, Saddle River, or SRA
17 Management took any steps to supervise Mazzola’s activities at Saddle River or Felix Investments
18 during the Carve-Out Period. Bivona also knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Mazzola was
19 soliciting prospective investors during the Carve-Out Period. Thus, after the SEC Bar Order, Bivona
20 continued to allow Mazzola to remain associated with Saddle River.
21

74.

In late 2014, Mazzola also formed a new firm, called Silverback Management

22 Limited, which launched new funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, called the Silverback
23 Funds. Emails sent from Mazzola’s Silverback Funds email account employed a similarly urgent
24 tone in soliciting investors to purchase securities. One such email stated: “I want you [to] send us $2
25 million to put into Lookout and Evernote. If you give us the shot we will waive all the front-end and
26 management fees and leave in place only the performance fee. In addition we will give you a 12
27 month put on the investments. At any time over the next 12 months if you want out you can put the
28 investments back to us at cost—no questions asked. Lookout, Evernote and Palantir (we are out of
COMPLAINT

14

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1 Palantir stock) are 2015 liquidity events so we only need 12 months!” Mazzola sent this email to
2 multiple investors. Mazzola’s emails were sent to numerous investors who reside in the United
3 States.
4

75.

Mazzola made these solicitations from the United States, and email solicitations with

5 Mazzola’s Silverback contact information were sent to U.S. investors.
6

76.

In further disregard of the SEC Bar Order, Mazzola drafted emails that he directed

7 other Saddle River employees to send to prospective and existing investors. In one such email,
8 purportedly from Bivona, Mazzola encouraged investors to invest in a particular pre-IPO company;
9 the email was signed “Best, Frank.” Bivona was also copied on an email sent by Mazzola discussing
10 the merits of a possible investment.
11

77.

In violation of the SEC Bar Order, Mazzola has also continued to provide investment

12 advice to the Silverback Funds. He has opined about which pre-IPO companies’ shares the
13 Silverback Funds should acquire.
14

78.

Also, notwithstanding the SEC Bar Order prohibiting Mazzola from receiving

15 compensation for work done on behalf of the Felix Entities after March 20, 2014, Bivona, Saddle
16 River, and affiliated entities paid almost $3.2 million to Mazzola, or for his benefit, between March
17 20, 2014 and January 26, 2016, for work performed after the SEC Bar Order was instituted.

Bivona, Mazzola, and the Saddle River Defendants Offered and Sold SRA
Fund Securities Without Filing a Registration Statement.

Bivona, Mazzola, and the Saddle River Defendants raised over $14 million from

21 investors from March 10, 2014, when Mazzola was permanently enjoined from violating the anti22 fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, until August 27, 2014, when Mazzola resigned from
23 Saddle River.
24

80.

No registration statement was filed for this offering, as was required.

25

81.

The Form Ds filed by the SRA Funds with the Commission indicate that the funds

26 relied on the “private placement” exemption from registration under Regulation D, Rule 506(c) of the
27 Securities Act.
28
COMPLAINT

15

Case No. 3:16-cv-1386

1

82.

But the SRA Funds are disqualified from claiming an exemption under Rule 506(c) of

2 Regulation D. This is because under Regulation D, Rule 506(d), a “Covered Person” of the SRA
3 funds had a “Disqualifying Event.”
4

83.

Mazzola is a “Covered Person” because he was an investment manager and promoter

5 of the SRA Funds from March 10, 2014 to August 27, 2014.
6

84.

Mazzola had a “Disqualifying Event” on March 10, 2014, when this Court entered a

7 final judgment against him, permanently enjoining him from committing further violations of the
8 federal securities laws.
9

85.

12

No other exemption from registration applies.

86.

The Saddle River Defendants Failed To Register With The SEC As
Brokers.

Bivona and other employees of the Saddle River Defendants acted as brokers while

13 soliciting investors for the SRA Funds. They had all previously been engaged in the same solicitation
14 activities at Felix Investments, a former registered broker-dealer.
15

87.

Several people who worked for the Saddle River Defendants actively solicited

16 investors, provided valuation advice, opined on the merits of investments, and received orders and
17 money from investors. These salespeople were not paid a salary, but were instead paid
18 commissions—noted in the Saddle River Defendants’ accounting records as “commission
19 expenses”—equal to a percentage of front-end fees. Bivona testified under oath that the commissions
20 were equal to 50% of the due diligence fees received by SRA Management from the SRA Funds for
21 those investors they introduced to the funds. Bivona also testified that he and Mazzola were eligible
22 to receive these commissions.
