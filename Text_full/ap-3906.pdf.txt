LARRY M. PHILLIPS

SCHEDULING ORDER

On April 19, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondents.
On June 2, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a prehearing conference statement,
containing a joint proposed prehearing schedule. Separately, the parties confirmed with my
office that they agree to a hearing starting on November 7, 2016.
I set the following procedural schedule, based on the parties’ proposed schedule and
supplemented with additional deadlines:
September 12, 2016: File and exchange expert reports.
Subpoenas for the production of documentary evidence are due.
Parties are responsible for requesting and serving their own
subpoenas. The subpoena forms to be used are online at
http://www.sec.gov/alj.
September 26, 2016: File and exchange witness and exhibit lists.
Exchange, but not file, copies of pre-marked exhibits.
Subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses are due.
October 3, 2016:

Motions made under Commission Rule of Practice 231, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.231, if any, are due.

October 11, 2016:

File and exchange motions in limine and objections to exhibits and
witness lists.

October 17, 2016:

File and exchange prehearing briefs and oppositions to motions in
limine.

October 19, 2016:

File any written stipulations and participate in final telephonic
prehearing conference at 1:00 p.m. EDT.

November 7, 2016:

The hearing will begin at a time and location to be determined in
Los Angeles, California. After the close of the parties’ evidentiary
presentation, I will establish a post-hearing schedule for the filing
of briefs and exhibits.

The parties also proposed to take depositions of experts seven weeks before the hearing.
The parties may conduct depositions on their own terms, as they have agreed. However, absent a
motion and appropriate order in accordance with Rule of Practice 233, 17 C.F.R. § 201.233, such
depositions cannot be used in lieu of live hearing testimony. See Rules of Practice, 60 Fed. Reg.
32738, 32765 (June 23, 1995) (“Depositions under the Rules of Practice are used only to
preserve testimony of a witness who would be unlikely to be able to attend the hearing.”). Also,
I will not entertain any motions or objections that may arise as a result of depositions taken
outside the scope of Rule of Practice 233, and such depositions may be used only for the limited
purpose of impeachment at the hearing.
Witness lists shall include witnesses’ names, occupations, addresses, and a brief summary
of their expected testimony. 17 C.F.R. § 201.222(a)(4). Exhibit lists shall be emailed to my
office at alj@sec.gov in Microsoft Excel or Word format and include exhibit numbers, a
description of each exhibit, and Bates-stamp numbers, if any. Exhibits shall not be filed with the
Office of the Secretary until after the hearing concludes. In addition to the required filing with
the Office of the Secretary, electronic courtesy copies of filings should be emailed to
alj@sec.gov in both PDF text-searchable format and, when possible, Microsoft Word format.
