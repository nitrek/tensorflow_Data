GRANTING WAIVERS FROM BEING
INELIGIBLE ISSUERS

I.
In March 2014, the Division of Enforcement (the “Division”) announced the
Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation Initiative (the “MCDC Initiative”), a selfreporting program intended to address potentially widespread violations of the federal securities
laws resulting from misrepresentations in municipal bond offering documents about prior
compliance with continuing disclosure obligations. 1
Pursuant to the MCDC Initiative, the Division agreed to recommend that the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) accept settlement offers from underwriters that selfreported certain violations and that agreed to consent to certain standardized settlement terms.
The MCDC Initiative resulted in a large number of underwriters and other participants
self-reporting potential non-scienter based violations of the federal securities laws and has
generated much-needed attention within the municipal underwriter community about continuing
disclosure compliance, the disclosure process, and due diligence. The MCDC Initiative has
allowed the Commission to address an industry-wide problem, in part through cooperation and
other significant remedial undertakings by the participants, while avoiding the expenditure of

significant resources typically associated with identifying and conducting full investigations of
potential securities law violations.
II.
The Commission has issued several separate orders (“MCDC Orders”) instituting
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against certain municipal underwriters who
participated in the MCDC Initiative (the “MCDC Underwriters”). 2 These proceedings are
consistent with the previously announced terms of the MCDC Initiative and are brought pursuant
to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) (or, alternatively, Section 15B of the Exchange Act for
underwriters solely registered with the Commission as municipal securities dealers) for willful
violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act for failure to conduct adequate due diligence
on certain municipal securities offerings. Specifically, the MCDC Underwriters failed to form a
reasonable basis for believing the truthfulness of certain material representations by municipal
issuers in official statements issued in connection with those offerings. The MCDC Orders,
which state that they are being issued pursuant to the MCDC Initiative, require that the
respondents cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations
of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and undertake to retain an independent consultant to
conduct a compliance review and take reasonable steps to implement the consultant’s
recommendations, among other things. The MCDC Orders trigger a number of disqualifications
from exemptions available under the Securities Act for the MCDC Underwriters, and for certain
issuers which have MCDC Underwriters as subsidiaries (“MCDC Issuers”).
III.
Waivers of Disqualification Under Rule 262 of Regulation A and
Rules 505 and 506 of Regulation D
Rule 262 of Regulation A and Rules 505 and 506 of Regulation D provide for
disqualification from exemptions from registration under the Securities Act for certain offerings
if, among other things, the relevant entity is subject to a Commission order pursuant to Section
15(b) or 15B(c) of the Exchange Act that places limitations on that entity’s activities, functions,
or operations, including the retention of an independent consultant. See 17 C.F.R. §§
230.262(a)(4)(ii), 230.505(b)(2)(iii), and 230.506(d)(1)(iv)(B).
The Commission has the authority to waive the Regulation A and D disqualifications
upon a showing of good cause and without prejudice to any other action by the Commission, if
the Commission determines that it is not necessary under the circumstances that an exemption be
denied. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 230.262(b)(2), 230.505(b)(2)(iii)(C), and 230.506(d)(2)(ii).
Ineligible Issuer Waiver
Under Clause (1)(vi) of the definition of ineligible issuer in Rule 405 of the Securities
Act, an issuer becomes an ineligible issuer and thus unable to avail itself of well-known seasoned

issuer status, if “[w]ithin the past three years (but in the case of a decree or order agreed to in a
settlement, not before December 1, 2005), the issuer or any entity that at the time was a
subsidiary of the issuer was made the subject of any judicial or administrative decree or order
arising out of a governmental action that: (A) Prohibits certain conduct or activities regarding,
including future violations of, the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws . . .” See 17
C.F.R. § 230.405(1)(vi).
Under the second paragraph of the definition of ineligible issuer in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act, an issuer shall not be an ineligible issuer if the Commission determines, upon a
showing of good cause, that it is not necessary under the circumstances that the issuer be
considered an ineligible issuer. See 17 C.F.R. § 230.405(2).
Waiver from Regulation E Disqualification
Regulation E provides an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, subject to
certain conditions, for securities issued by certain small business investment companies and
business development companies. Rule 602(c)(3) makes this exemption unavailable for the
securities of an issuer if, among other things, any underwriter of the securities to be offered is
subject to an order of the Commission entered pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act.
See 17 C.F.R. § 230.602(c)(3). Rule 602(e) provides, however, that the disqualification shall not
apply if the Commission determines, upon a showing of good cause, that it is not necessary
under the circumstances that the exemption from registration pursuant to Regulation E be denied.
See 17 C.F.R. § 230.602(e).
Good Cause
In light of the participation of the MCDC Underwriters in the MCDC Initiative and their
agreement to consent to its terms, assuming the MCDC Underwriters comply with the terms of
the MCDC Orders, and in light of the benefits of the MCDC Initiative discussed herein, the
Commission has determined that good cause exists for not denying the various exemptions from
registration discussed herein, and for MCDC Issuers to receive waivers from being ineligible
issuers that results from the entry of the MCDC Orders.
IV.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission has determined that pursuant to Rules 262(b)(2),
505(b)(2)(iii)(C), 506(d)(2)(ii), and 602(e) of the Securities Act and Paragraph (2) of the
definition of ineligible issuer in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, the requisite showings of good
cause have been made.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Rules 262(b)(2), 505(b)(2)(iii)(C),
506(d)(2)(ii), and 602(e) of the Securities Act, and Paragraph (2) of the definition of ineligible
issuer in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, that waivers from the application of the disqualification
provisions of Rules 262(a)(4)(ii), 505(b)(2)(iii), 506(d)(1)(iv)(B), and 602(c)(3) of the Securities
Act, and waivers from being ineligible issuers under Rule 405 of the Securities Act, resulting
from the entry of the MCDC Orders against the MCDC Underwriters are hereby granted, as
3

reflected in the attached appendices. Nothing in this Order shall effect any pre-existing
disqualification or ineligibility under the above provisions and nothing in this Order shall be
interpreted to waive or limit any conditions or undertakings which are in place as a result of any
prior waiver granted to any MCDC Underwriter or MCDC Issuer. Failure to comply with terms
of the MCDC Orders would require us to revisit our determination that good cause has been
shown and could constitute grounds to revoke or further condition the waiver. The Commission
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to revoke or further condition the waiver under those
circumstances.
Because of the unique nature of the MCDC Initiative, this Order and the circumstances
under which it was issued shall not be relied upon by any entity that may seek a waiver in the
future from the disqualifications discussed herein.

By the Commission.
