OF 1940

COMPANY ACT

The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires the registration
of and regulates investment companies, that is, companies engaged
primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, and trading-in
.seeuritdes. Among"<1filrer
things, the Act requires complete disclosure of the flnances and the investment policies of these companies, thus insuring to investors full and complete information
with respect to their activities; prevents such companies from
changing the nature of their business or their investment policies
without the approval of the stockholders; prohibits persons guilty
of security frauds from serving as officers and directors of such companies; prevents underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from
constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies; requires management contracts in the first instance to be submitted to security holders for their approval; prohibits transactions
between such companies and their officers and directors and other
insiders except on the approval of the Commission; prohibits the
issuance of senior securities of such companies except in specified
instances; and prohibits pyramiding of such companies and cross
ownership of their securities. The Commission is authorized to
prepare advisory reports upon plans of reorganizations of registered
investment companies upon request of such companies or 25 percent
of their stockholders and to institute proceedings to enjoin such
plans if they are grossly unfair. The Act also requires face-amount
certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet
maturity payments upon their certificates.

ENACTMErofT

The Investment Company Act of 1940 (Public No. 768 76th
Congress) was approved on August 22, 1940 and became generally
effective on November 1, 1940. This legislation was enacted after
extensive hearings before subcommittees of the Banking and Currency
Committee of the Senate and the Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee of the House of Representatives. The original bill from
which the statute as enacted was evolved was based upon the Commission's report and recommendations resulting from its detailed
study of investment companies and investment trusts made pursuant
to the direction of Congress contained in Section 30 of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.1

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

Representatives of the investment companies opposed certain
provisions of the original bill and suggested alternative regulatory
provisions. With the approval of the Congressional committees /
concerned, the Commission and the industry endeavored to work out
a compromise measure acceptable to both, and ultimately succeeded
in doing so. It was this compromise measure, with certain modifications, which was enacted into law
the Investment Company Act
of 1940.
The fact that this legislation was endorsed both by the Commission
and the great majority of the persons whom it proposed to regulate
excited considerable comment at the time of its passage 2 and deserves
some mention at this point. The Commission, while of the opinion
that "if you do not have a comprehensive and effective program of
regulation, it is probably better to have none," 3 felt that the compromise bill sufficiently carried out the Commission's major objectives
and accordingly recommended its enactment.'
Representatives of
the industry, on their part, conceded that "abuses have existed in the
industry and * * * legislation is necessary to prevent their
oontinuauce,"! and joined in advocating passage of the compromise
bill.
This cooperative relationship between the Commission and the
industry has in general been preserved in the administration of the Act.
The Commission believes that, while adhering scrupulously to the
statute, it has given appropriate weight to the spirit in 'which it was
conceived. Persons closely associated with the industry have frankly
recognized that the Act is not "a complete cure of all possible evils in
the investment company field," but is rather based upon a desire "to
proceed cautiously and experimentally, attempting to prevent the
main abuses which have been known to exist." 6
It is probably safe to say that the Investment Company Act of
1940 represents the minimum workable regulation of investment
companies. On the other hand, it does not follow that this minimum
regulation is necessarily inadequate. Thus far the Commission has
had only 8 months' experience in the administration of the Act.
Further experience will presumably indicate a need for minor amendments and may OJ: may not indicate a need for major amendments.
If and when amendment seems advisable, the Commission has full
power under Section' 46 (a) of the Act to make appropriate recommendations to the Congress and will not hesitate to do so.

GENERAL NATURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS

In part, perhaps, because the statute was the res ult of a compromise, but in greater measure because of the diversity of companies
it covers and the intricacy of the problems they present, the Investment Company Act of 1940is a complex and elaborate piece of legislation, calling for the use of a great variety of administrative procedures
and techniques. The Act contains flat statutory prohibitions the
violation of which may give rise to either injunctive or criminal
proceedings in the courts; provisions-which authorize the Commission
to institute injunctive proceedings but the' violation of which is not a
criminal offense; requirements for filing financial and other data with
the Commission, which is then open to public inspection; requirements
for the transmission of financial and other data to security holders;
provisions authorizing the Commission to render advisory reports to
security holders; provisions authorizing the Commission to adopt
rules and regulations in some circumstances for the purpose of giving
content to statutory prohibitions which would otherwise be inoperative and in other circumstances for the purpose of relaxing statutory
prohibitions which would otherwise obtain; provisions for administrative orders in proceedings initiated in some cases by the Commission
and in other cases by the companies or persons affected; and provisions
for the further study of certain aspects of investment company
operations. Fortunately, most of these procedures have been employed in the same or a comparable form in one or more of the statutes
already administered by the Commission, so that no serious difficulties have been encounte-ed in fitting the administration of the new
Act into the framework of the Commission's previous practice.
For the purpose of administering the Investment Company Act
of 1940 (together with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940), the
Commission created a new division of the staff, the Investment
Company Division. The organization and functions of the new
division are generally similar to those of the older divisions of the
Commission .
. -The principal problems faced by the Commission during the first
eight months of its administration of the Act can conveniently be
grouped into seven categories, namely, (1) determining which companies are investment companies .subject to the Act and which are
not investment companies or are entitled to exemption; (2) the
Classification of companies subject to the Act; (3) prescribing the
information to be filed with the Commission and that to be transmitted to security holders; (4) the administration and enforcement of
those provisions of the Act which regulate the relationships and trans-actions of -persons who are"ltffiliated with investment companies;
(~) matters relating to' the distribution, redemption, and repurchase

REPORT

of securities issued by management companies; (6) reorganizations of
investment companies; and (7) the treatment accorded certain
special types of companies, such as unit investment trusts, periodic
payment plans, and face-amount certificate companies.
THE "INVESTMENT

COMPANY"

CONCEPT

Although the terms "investment company" and "investment trust"
have been part of the language of the financial community for some
time, a definition precise enough to distinguish them sharply from
holding companies on the one hand and operating companies on the
other did not exist prior to the enactment of the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The distinctive feature of the Act in this connection is
its use of a quantitative or statistical definition, expressed in terms
of the portion of a company's assets which are investment securities.
Thus the statute provides, inter alia, that a company is an "investment company" if it is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns investment
securities (defined to exclude securities of majority-owned subsidiaries
and of other investment companies) exceeding 40 percent of its total
assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items).
With this quantitative test as a starting point, the statute then
proceeds to carve out exceptions. Certain types of companies are
excluded from-the investment company category by express statutory
exceptions. These types include such organizations as banks, insurance companies, savings and loan associations, small loan companies,
public utility holding companies, and charitable corporations. In
addition, the Act provides machinery whereby the Commission may
declare by order upon application that a company, notwithstanding
the quantitative definition, is nevertheless not an investment company. Thus, companies that believe that the application of the
quantitative test would unreasonably cause them to be classified as
investment companies are given the opportunity of obtaining administrative dispensation by showing that they are primarily engaged in
a business or businesses other than that of investing, reinvesting,
owning, holding, or trading in securities, either directly or through
majority-owned subsidiaries or through controlled companies conducting similar types of businesses.
The experience of the Commission, during the 8 months the
Act has been in effect, indicates clearly the general feasibility of
working with the definitions of "investment company" contained in
the Act and the administrative procedures provided in relation to
them. During that time only 27 applications for declarative orders
were filed. Of the applications which have so far been studied,
7 have been withdrawn by the applicants at some stage during
the course of the administrative proceeding. Most of the with-

PART I-THE

INVESTMENT CuMPANYACT OF 1940

drawals resulted from the informal exchange of views with representatives of the particular companies involved. Of the 4 cases which
were formally decided by the Commission prior to the end of the past
fiscal year, all were clear cases for administrative relief, and in each
the order prayed for was granted. It is true that knotty questions
have been raised by some of the applications, but those questions
relate to so few companies that they do not interfere with the effective
regulation of the field as a whole.
EXEMPTION OF COMPANIES FROM THE INVESTMENT COMPANY
ACT OF 19.10

In addition.to ,the provisions for excluding certain types.of'orglfIIizations from the concept of "investment company," the Act contains
certain exemptive provisions applicable to companies which, while
admittedly investment companies, should for one reason or another
be relieved from some or all sections of the Act. Several of these
exemptive provisions are provided by the statute itself, but three
subsections of the Act leave exemption in whole or in part to administrative determination.
In Section 6 (b) the Commission is directed to exempt by order any
employees' securities company from the provisions of the Act, to the
extent that such exemption is consistent with certain specified standards. To date, 7 companies have filed applications for exemption
under thiS section.7 The most important are those applications filed
by 4 investment companies holding funds for the benefit of more than
40,000 employees of General Electric Company. The total assets of
these 4 companies amount to more than $200,000,000.
The disposition of such applications presents many difficult problems
and requires constant use of the Commission's informal conference
procedure, for Section 6 (b), in effect, directs the Commission to study
in detail the history and operations of each such company and to
determine the effect which each section of the Act will have on one or
more aspects of the applicant's business. After this is done, the
Commission must, in effect, accommodate the Act to the particular
circumstances of the employees' securities company involved, in the
light of the considerations enumerated in Section 6 (b). This process,
in relation to the applications of the four companies affiliated with
General Electric Company, has almost run its course. Formal hearings have been set, and opinions and orders should be issued in the
near future. The other applications under Section 6 (b) are in some
stage of the same process.

, SEVENTH ANNUAL 'REPORT

Section 6 (d) of the Act directs the exemption by rule or order,
to the extent consistent with the public interest and the protection of
investors, of certain small closed-end investment companies whose
securities are offered intrastate.
At the end of the fiscal year the
three applications filed under this section were pending.
The remaining exemptive provision, and in many ways the most
important, is Section 6 (c) which reads as follows:
"The Commission, by rules and regulations upon its own motion, or by'
order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any
person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities,
or transactions, from any provision or provisions of this title or of any rule
or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
,of this title."

Sixty-two applications have been filed seeking orders under this
section, of which 20 had been disposed of at the close of the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1941. Many of the applications requested orders
which amounted to little more than the formal expression of minor
administrative determinations.
For instance, requests were made for
additional time in which to file with the Commission or to transmit
to-security holders documents and other forms of information; requests, in effect, for stays pending the outcome of proceedings instituted under other provisions of the Act; and requests for temporary'
exemption from specified provisions because of a variety of circumstances. For the purposes of such applications, the exemptive power
vested in the Commission has helped to eliminate many small but
irritating inconveniences, particularly those which inevitably occur
during, the period of adjustment to new regulatory law, without
sacrificing substance or principle.
Some of the applications filed under Section 6 (c), however, have
requested sweeping substantive
exemptions. Such applications
involve considerations in many respects similar to those discussed in
relation to applications filed by employees' securities companies under
, Section- 6- (b). During the period between the effective date of the
Act and the close of the fiscal year, only one application for complete
exemption from the Act was granted under Section 6 (c). This order
related to an unusual situation-an
investment company created to
hold the assets of the New York agency of a European bank with no
known American investor interest in either the investment company,
the agency, or the bank. The exemption, however, was granted for
oo~l~~
..
It will be noted that the exemptive function of the Commission may
be exercisen bot only' by order on application but also by: rule on the
Commission's own motion. No rules have been adopted under this

PART I-'l'HE

INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940

7

section giving complete exemption to any class of companies. The
few rules which have been adopted are principally of two types:
procedural rules and rules de minimis:
A typical example of a procedural rule is Rule N-6C-3, which provides, in effect, that any employees' securities company which filed
an application under Section 6 (b) of the Act prior to November 15,
1940, is exempt from the provisions of the Act applicable to investment
companies until- -the Commission has finally determined the applica-
tion. Such' a rdle' is, ill effect"a stay pendente lite and is comparable
the procedural orders of exemption to which reference has already
been made.
An example of a rule de minimis is Rule N-15A-1. The Act contains a number of provisions regulating investment advisers of investment companies and the contracts pursuant to which they give their
advice. Among these provisions is a requirement that investment
advisory contracts be approved by the shareholders of the investment
company concerned. Since the remuneration under such contracts
commonly is as high as one-half of 1 percent of the value of the assets
of the investment company per year, the essential soundness of this
requirement of shareholder approval is obvious. An occasional
company, "however, may retain an investmerit adviser for special
purposes under an arrangement providing for such small compensation
that to require shareholder approval of the contract would be an
, unnecessarily cumbersome procedure which, instead of protecting the
shareholders in any substantial sense, would merely distract their
attention from more important aspects of the investment company's
operations.
, Rule N-15A-l was therefore adopted. It provides, in effect, that
an investment adviser of a registered investment company may act
under a contract which has not been approved by the voting securities
of the registered company in accordance with the provisions of Sec.
tions 15 (a) and (e) if such adviser is not otherwise affiliated either
with the registered company or with a principal, underwriter
thereof; if his compensation either is not more than $100 a year or
is not more-than '$2;500 a 'year and one-fortieth of 1 percent of
the company's net assets as determined in accordance with the rule;
and if the aggregate compensation of all investment advisers of such
registered company either is not more than $200 a year or is not more
than one-twentieth of 1 percent of the company's net assets.

to

CLASSIFICATION OF IJ'!{VESTMENT COMPANIES

-Inveimnen.t companies are divided by the statute into three classes,
namely, management companies, unit fDVElstment'trusts, and faceamount certificate companies.

8

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

The management company is the most familiar type of investment
company. Organized as a corporation, association, or business trust,
it normally has a board of directors or trustees who have more or less
freedom in selecting the investments to be made by the company and in
otherwise managing the company's affairs. -

Management companies are further divided by the Act into closedend and open-end companies. The peculiarity of the open-end
company is that it issues redeemable securities, the holders of which
are entitled to withdraw from the company at any time by presenting
their shares and receiving their proportionate value of the then assets
of the company. Ordinarily, an open-end company is continuously
engaged in .selling and redeeming its own securities, and.this constant
process of sale and redemption presents serious regulatory problems.
Closed-end companies are management companies whose securities
are not redeemable and which ordinarily are not engaged in the
continuous distribution and redemption of their securities, and which
consequently present problems of a different character.
The statute also subdivides management companies, whether c1osedend or open-end, into diversified and non-diversified companies.
The distinction here is between the company whose investments are
diversified among the securities of numerous issuers and the company
which concentrates its investments in the securities of a few issuers
or in blocks of voting securities which enable it to exercise a controlling
influence-in the affairs of the issuer. The statute contains a statistical
test for determining whether a management company is diversified
or non-diversified.
Unit investment trusts are organizations where portfolio management has been entirely eliminated or reduced to a minimum. Characteristically, the holder of a share in a unit investment trust has
merely an undivided interest in a package of specified securities, which
are held by a trustee or custodian. Few, if any, unit trusts are actively
selling their shares today, with the exception of the shares being sold
on a periodic payment basis.
The peculiarities of the face-amount certificate, company are twofold. First, it publicly distributes certificates which are not equity
securities representing a fluctuating interest in a fund, but evidence
of indebtedness providing for the payment of a fixed amount at
maturity.
Second, these certificates are predominantly sold on a
periodic payment basis, providing for the payment by the holder of a
definite amount at specified periods. In order to give certificate
holders some assurance that they will receive the amount promised
them at maturity, the Act contains elaborate provisions requiring
the setting up of reserves and the deposit by the companies of qualified
investments equal to the reserves. It is the administration of
these reserve requirements, together with supervision of the continuous

PART I-THE

INVESTMENT COMPANYACT OF 1940

9

selling in which these companies usually engage, which present the
,principal problems in the regulation of this class of investment
companies.
A proper determination of the classification and subclassification
of an investment company is essential to the administration of the
Act. A number of sections of the Act apply to all companies, regardless of classification, but because of the difference in problems presented by different types of companies, other sections of the Act
relate only to one or two classes of companies, or in some instances
only to a particular subclass of management companies.
IN;FORMATIONAL

REQUIREMENTS

Registration Statements.

The first step in the general scheme of regulation provided by the
Act is the requirement that investment companies shall register with
the Commission. A company registers under the Act by filing with
the Commission a notification of registration. For this purpose the
Commission has prepared Form N-8A, a short form which requires
little more than the identification of the company and its management,
and the classification of investment company within which the registrant considers itself to be. As of June 30, f941, 436 companies with
total assets of approximately $2,500,000,000 were registered under the
Act. Of these, 11 were registered as face-amount certificate companies, 181 as closed-end management companies, 141 as open-end
management companies, and 81 as unit investment trusts. Twentytwo companies are of doubtful classification.
The next step in the course of registration is the filing with the
Commission, in accordance with rules, regulations, and forms promulgated for the purpose, a detailed registration statement containing
complete information regarding the company. Most of the required
information is similar to that required in registration statements filed
under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. In addition, however, the Investment Company Act of 1940
requires the registration statement to contain a recital of the policy of
the registrant with respect to certain specified subjects, such as
issuing senior securities, borrowing money, engaging in underwriting,
making loans, or investing in real estate or commodities. These
required statements of policy, which must be as specific as is practicable, constitute one of the keystones of the Act. Once having stated
such a policy in its registration statement, a registrant may not
deviate from it without the consent of a majority of its outstanding
voting securities.
The first form for a detailed registration statement was promulgated by the Commission on May 23, 1941. It is designated Form
N-8B-1 and applies to all registered management companies. Tenta.-

J

10

SEVENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

tive drafts Gf the form were submitted to all registered management
companies for their comments and suggestions before the definitive
form was adopted.
Because of the importance of the portion of Form N-8B-1 dealing
with recitals of policy, members of the Commission's staff have been
made available for conferences with investment companies, prior to
the filing of the registration statement, concerning the problems of the
company in answering the items in that part of the form. A considerable number of such conferences have been held.
In connection with the informational requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Congress has directed the Commission
to avoid duplication where reports and statements are also required to
be filed under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. That policy has been carried into effect. Thus by rule,
it has been provided that a company may, under proper circumstances,
file copies of Form N-8B-1 in lieu of the annual report for the 1940
fiscal year required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Similarly, rules have been adopted which are designed to allow companies having statements and reports already on file under the other
Acts to file copies of such statements and reports in lieu of equivalent
data required in Form N-8B-1.
The Commission is presently engaged in developing a procedure whereby registration statements
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may be filed on a single form. Similar steps are
being taken to correlate the information filed under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 with that required for the registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933, so that copies of registration
statements and reports filed under the former Act. may be used for
the registration of subsequent issues of securities under the latter Act
in lieu of the equivalent information otherwise required.
Forms of registration statements for classes of investment companies other than management companies are in preparation.
Periodic Reports to the Commission.

The Act requires registered investment companies to file annual
reports with the Commission containing such information as is
presently obtained from investment companies filing annual reports
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, in addition, the
Commission may require semi-annual and quarterly reports in order
to keep current the information contained in registration statements.
The Commission has already adopted a rule requiring annual reports to be filed for each fiscal year after the filing of the registration
statement, and a form is now in preparation for this purpose. It is
the intention of the Commission to promulgate a single form which will
satisfy the requirements of both the Investment Company Act of 1940
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Any, action concerning semi-annual and quarterly reports will
naturally be deferred until the forms for annual reports have been
prepared. However, the Commission has been receiving, as required
"by the Act, copies of all periodic reports containing financial statements which are transmitted by registered investment companies to
their security holders.
Reports and Other Information Sent to Security Holders.

Under the Act certain information is required to be transmitted
to stockholders. by registered investment companies at various times,
and under various circumstances. Thus, reports of condition must be
rendered at least semi-annually. This requirement has already been
.implemented by rules applicable to management companies and to one
type of unit trust. The significance of this requirement cannot be
overestimated, when it is considered in the light of the power given to
the Commission to bring about some standardization in the substance
of information made public, particularly statements of accounts.
Other provisions designed to keep security holders better informed
on matters relating to their investments are likewise important.
When a dividend is paid by a registered company from a source other
than certain types of income, or accumulated income, the payment to
the security holder must be accompanied by a written statement
indicating its source. The Commission has adopted a rule furthering
.this provision and all registered companies are now operating under it.
The Act also provides that any solicitation of proxies, authorizations,
and consents of security holders shall be made only in accordance with
the rules of the Commission."
F1nancial Requirements.

An especially important part of the informational requirements of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 are those relating to financial
statements and accounts. The Act authorizes the Commission to
require a reasonable degree of uniformity in the accounting practices
of investment companies, and work along this line has already been
begun. Meantime, Regulation S-X, which is a compilation of the
accounting requirements of the Commission developed in the adminis:tration of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
,of 1934, is being employed under the Investment Company Act of
,1940, with appropriate modifications. It has thus been possible to
make provision for full and informative financial data in registration
statements filed under the Act without unduly hastening the Commission's long-range program for developing uniform accounting
~~actices in the industry.

REPORT

PERSONS

Section 1 of the Act states, among other things, that the national
public interest and the interest of investors are adversely affected"when investment companies are organized, operated, managed, or their
portfolio securities are selected, in the interest of directors, officers, investment advisers, depositors, or other affiliated persons thereof, in the interest
of underwriters, brokers, or dealers, in the interest of special classes of their
security holders, or in the interest of other investment companies or persons
engaged in other lines of business rather than in the interest of all classes of
such companies' security holders."

This declaration is based upon the disclosure of abuses in the
reports of the Commission to the Congress on its study of investment
companies. In order to eliminate such conditions as far as possible
and to insure that the interests of all classes of security holders are
paramount in the operation of investment companies, the Act contains a number of provisions imposing limitations and prohibitions
with respect to the eligibility and activities of 'persons affiliated.;;with
investment companies and the transactions of such affiliated persons
with those companies. It is in relation to these provisions that the
Commission is delegated some of its most important administrative
functions under the Act.
E6gibility of Officers and Directors.

First, there is the provision that a person may not serve as an officer
or director of or perform certain other functions for a registered company if he has been convicted of certain crimes involving security
transactions, or if by reason of similar misconduct has been enjoined
from specified activities. The Commission is directed to give relief
from those prohibitions under proper circumstances by order upon
application. Fifty applications for such relief have been filed and so
far 10 of them have been granted with regard to affiliated persons of 4
companies. In all of these cases a consent injunction entered into
prior to the enactment of the Investment Company Act of 1940 was
the disqualifying element.
.
Transactions

with Investment

Companies.

By far the most important provision concerning the activities of
affiliated persons is that which, with certain exceptions, prohibits any
affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of a registered
company from selling to, or buying or borrowing property from, the
investment company or any company it controls. The prohibition is
supplemented by a provision that the Commission shall exempt by
order upon application any proposed transaction if evidence establishes that its terms are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching,' and ..•that it is censistent.- with. the-compa.nyJs .•reeiilds > of

policy in its registration statement and with the general purposes of
the Act.
From the effective date of the Act to the close of tbe fiscal year, 12
applications to exempt transactions between affiliated persons and
investmeat companiea.or companies controlled- by them were filed.
During the fiscal year the Commission disposed of 7 of these applications. The disposition of such applications requires a nice balance
of conflicting factors which points up the need in such cases for the
review of a specialized agency. On the one hand, in most of the
situations resolved, there was the necessity of a speedy determination
because the transactions depended a great deal on security markets.
On the other hand, many of the issues involved in the determination
of fairness were of a complicated nature, requiring the fullest use of
financial experience and a delicate exercise of administrative judgment.
An illustration of the complicated nature of issues presented in
these proceedings can be found in an application of Aviation and
Transportation Corporation. This corporation (hereinafter called
ATCO) controlled The Aviation Corporation (hereinafter called
AVCO) through stock ownership. AVCO proposed to issue additional
stock and to give its existing stockholders preemptive rights to subscribe to such stock at discounts from the market prices. A special
arrangement was to be made with ATCO, so tha.t the latter company
would subscribe not only to the portion of the new issue to which it,
was entitled because of its stock ownership in AVCO, but would also
have a commitment to take up a portion of the securities not purchased by the other AVCO stockholders. The remainder of such
securities were to be publicly issued by underwriters, and, to the extent
the underwriters could not dispose of them, ATCO would acquire
them within the limits of its resources. In payment for the shares
ATCO would transfer all its non-cash assets (except its AVCO stock)
at designated values and the difference between the amount due and
the value of the assets to be transferred would be paid in cash. The
non-cash assets consisted of investment securities. Mter the consummation of the proposed transaction, ATCO, the registered investment company, intended to dissolve and to distribute in kind to its
security holders all its stock in AVCO-its only remaining non-cash
f£8set:, In the proposed group of underwriters who were. to distribute
the securities to the public were persons affiliated with the investment
company, and for their services the underwriting group would, of
course, receive commissions.
This case presented to the Commission the following issues:
(1) Whether the offering price of the securities issued by
AVCO was fair in relation to market values.

14

SEVENTH

REPORT

(2) Whether the valuations placed on the assets .of,ATOQ
which were to be exchanged for AVCO securities were fair.and
reasonable.
(3) Whether the underwriting fees obtained by the persons
affiliated with ATCO would not result in overreaching on their
part.
(4) Whether the entire transaction, including the proposed.
dissolution was within the policies of ATCO and consistentwith the enumerated purposes of the Act.
All these issues required speedy determination because the trans.'
actions depended to a great extent on market conditions with respect
to the outstanding securities of ATCO and AVCO. The application
ultimately was granted.
l
. Another case involved different considerations. A company that
was a principal underwriter of a registered open-end company applied
for an order permitting it to sell to the investment company certain
securities which it was distributing publicly as a member of a selling
syndicate. The application was the first of its kind, and up to th.at
time the Commission had not announced its policy in relation to trans":'
actions of that general character. The Commission also recognized;
that the circumstances in this case were exceptional and, accordingly,
permitted the consummation of the transaction.
The importance of
the case, however, is that the Commission, in its opinion, announced'
for future guidance of registered companies that the burden upon an,'
applicant in any such case to show that a transaction of the kind here'
involved is consistent with the purposes of the Act is a heavy one and'
cannot be met merely by proof that the sales price is fair.'
;
Judicial Sanctions.

. The provision discussed above, which, in effect, req~es" persop.s,
affiliated with investment companies to obtain permission of the Com-.
mission in order that they may have certain dealings in money or:
property with such investment companies, is not the only kind of,
control the Congress gave to the Commission over the, activities of.
such persons. Another such control is the power vested in the.'
Commission to seek judicial sanction, i. e., an injunction, ag8.inaf
any person for gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect
of any registered company that such person serves in any of certain
designated capacities. In one instance, the Commission believed
that the management of an investment company, with knowledge.
that they intended to dissolve such company, had acquired substansial.
blocks of the company's preferred stock from the public ~t a:' cost
less than the value of that portion of the assets of the company to
which such stock would be entitled on dissolution. At the suggestion
of the Commission the management agreed to surrender to the com-

PART I--THE

INVESTMENT'COMPANY

ACT OF 1940

15

pany the stock they had acquired at a price equivalent to the cost
'Of such shares to the management.
As a result, the remaining
holders of the company's preferred stock received a substantially
higher proportion of the company's assets than they would otherwise
have obtained.
Protection

Against Theft ami Embezzlement.

The Investment Company Act of 1940 has two provisions involving
administrative functions, the purpose of which is to protect investment
companies from theft and embezzlement by affiliated persons. First,
there is a requirement with respect to the safekeeping of the securities
and investments of such companies i and second, a provision concerning
the bonding of persons connected with such companies who have
access to securities and funds.
The safekeeping requirement in effect provides that the securities
and similar investments of registered management companies shall
be placed in the custody of a bank or in the custody of brokers who
.are members of a national securities exchange subject to rules and
regulations of. 'the Commission.
The Commission is also given the
power either by order on application or by rule to permit such
companies to maintain in their own custody their securities and
investments.
Soon after the effective date of the Act, the Commission adopted
rules governing companies whose securities were in the custody of
brokers. These rules require the execution of a written contract
between the registered company and the broker which provide for
physical segregation of the securities, prohibitions against hypothecation of or the creation of liens On such securities, and periodic
examinations of such securities by the company's public accountants.
With regard to the power of the Commission to permit management
companies to retain custody of their securities, 59 applications for
'Orders were filed. The Commission analyzed these applications,
classified the, 'various methods employed to protect the securities
maintained in this fashion, and, on the basis of the study, proposed to
the interested companies uniform standards representative of the better
practices as disclosed in the applications. The proposals were discussed with representatives of the industry and accounting societies,
and submitted to the applicants for their suggestions,"
. .The provision concerning the bonding of persons having access to
the securities and funds of registered management companies authorizes the Commission to adopt rules in that regard. Such rules are
now in process of preparation.
• Since the close of the llscal yeer, the proposed standards heve been revlsed In the light or the eomments
ftC81ved and on .July 31, UKl, Rule N-17F-2 embodying them was promulgated.

Informal Matters under Other Requirements.

The Act contains a group of provisions involving various classes
of persons affiliated with investment companies, which provisions,
by their terms, do. not take effect until some time afte:r:.the effective
date of the Act. The purpose of the waiting period is to give the
investment companies and the classes of persons concerned an
opportunity to revise their relations to comply with the respective
requirements. Among other things, such revision may require
amendments to charters and bylaws, special meetings of security
holders, and a vote of security holders on a variety of possible matters.
In this group of provisions are the following: that no more than 60
percent of the members of the board of directors of a registered company shall be investment advisers, affiliated persons of an investment
adviser, or officers or employees of such company; that a registered
company cannot employ as broker or principal underwriter a director
or officer or a person affiliated with a director or officer, unless a
majority of the board of directors are not such persons; that investment advisers shall serve as such only under a written contract with
certain prescribed terms; that neither the charter, certificate of incorporation, or bylaws of any registered company shall contain provisions
which purport to protect any director or officer against any liability
to the company or its security holders to which he would otherwise
be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence,
or reckless disregard of the duties in the conduct of 'his office; that
investment advisers and underwriters should not be similarly protected; and that security holders shall ratify the selection of the
independent public accountant.
Various problems have already been raised by companies now in the
process of revising their operations to comply with these provisions
when they become effective. Among those problems is the question
of how far the limitations placed on charters and bylaws prevent
indemnification of directors and officers for liabilities or expenses
resulting from litigation arising out of their activities in connection
with a registered company. The Commission has interpreted the
relevant provision to prohibit such indemnification for expenses and
the amount of any judgment handed down against such persons.
Where suits are settled, indemnity may be offered only where the
reasonable expenses of prosecuting a case to judgment would exceed
the amount paid in settlement. Without such limitations, the officers
and directors of investment companies would be in a position to shift
from themselves to the security holders whose investments had been
impaired the liability for any loss caused by their misconduct.
D1STRmUTION, REDEMPTION, AND REPURCHASE OF SECURITIES
Redeemable Securities.

It is the practice of open-end investment companies to sell their
securities at prices based upon the value of their underlying assets and

PART I-THE

INVESTMENT COMPANYACT OF 1940

17

to agree to redeem them at prices similarly based. Prior to the enactment of the Act, almost all open-end companies determined the market value of their underlying assets at 3 p. m., the time of the closing
of most stock exchanges on which their portfolios were listed. The
selling price of the shares based on this computation remained fixed
until 3 p. m. of the next day when a new calculation was made. The
effect of this one price system was often damaging to security holders.
For example, if the asset value was $10 a share at 3 p. m. on Monday
and at 12 noon of the next day because of a rise in market values the
asset value was $15 a share, nevertheless the public could purchase
such shares at a price to net the company $10 a share. Under such
circumstances the value of the existing shareholder's stock would be
'substantially
diluted. Moreover.vmsiders such as directors" and
officers and underwriters who could obtain shares without payment
of a sales load could purchase them at $10 a share and redeem them
at $15 a share, since the redemption price per share was computed
almost unanimously on the basis of the market value of assets at the
time of the redemption.
The Act seeks to prevent these abuses by providing that any
securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 may adopt rules setting out methods of computing prices at
which their members may purchase, sell, or redeem open-end securities
and the minimum time that must elapse between purchases and rademptions of such securities. Such associations may also adopt rules
limiting and prescribing the method of computing the commissions
their members may take on transactions in the securities in order to
avoid excessive sales loads. After 1 year from the effective date of
the Act, the power to make rules concerning these matters vests in
the Commission. To the extent that such rules may be inconsistent
with the rules of any registered securities association, the latter will be
superseded. In this manner the Act in effect gave the organized
security dealers a year to work out for themselves the highly complicated and technical problems involved.
The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., an association
registered under the Securities E~change Act of 1934, has Jtlready
adopted such regulations. Among other things, the regulations provide that prices, heretofore computed generally only once a day,
shall be computed twice daily. The effect of this rule is to diminish,
but not to eliminate, possible dilution in the value of the shares of
existing stockholders. Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the rules of these associations become effective unless the
Commission takes affirmative action with respect to them. In the
instant case the Commission, without indicating approval, allowed
the rules to become effective.

Closed-end Companies.

, Registered closed-end companies are prohibited from purchasing
securities of which they are the issuer, except (1) on national securities
exchanges or other open markets designated by the Commission under
specified circumstances, (2) pursuant to tenders, or (3) under such
other circumstances as the Commission may permit by rule, regulation,
or order. The primary purpose of this provision is to eliminate
unfair discrimination in these transactions
, The Commission has adopted a rule (Rule N-23C-1) as to repurchases of securities of closed-end companies other than on an exchange or by tender which, in effect, permits a registered investment
company to purchase only its most senior security for cash under the
following circumstances: the securities involved are not listed on an
exchange; the seller is not an affiliated person; the purchases do
not exceed more than 1 percent of such securities outstanding:
the
securities are bought pursuant to a firm commitment: the price paid
~
 not above market or asset value, whichever is lower: the issuer
discloses to the seller the underlying asset value of the subject securities ; no brokerage commission is paid; the purchase is made without discrimination; and if the security is.a stock, notice of int~ntion
to purchase must have been given to the stockholders at large. In
any case the issuer must file reports of its repurchases with the
Commission on Form N-23C-1 provided for that purpose.
.
During the past year, 17 applications for orders involving special
situations were filed with the Commission.
Many of them were with
respect to purchases by investment companies of their own securities
from the British Government.
Of the 17. applications filed, 11 were
granted and 6 were pending ~t the close of the fiscal year. :.
"
" Although the Act does not expressly impose Iimitations on repurchases by closed-end companies of their own securities except for a
requirement of prior notice to shareholders of the company's intention
to repurchase, such repurchases may be of advantage to $~management and detrimental to public shareholders.
However,}t has already
beep. pointed out that the Act confers upon the Commission 1J?epower
to seek an injunction of gross abuse of trust by managements.
The
existence of this power has enabled the Commission to prevail :upop.
the management of one investment company to circumscribe rep~chase of jthe company's preferred stock on ,a stock exchange so as to
prevent the management from gaining an advantage at the expeqs~ of
selling shareholders.
In this case the management held a substantial block of the compsny'~ common stock which had no asset value. Dividends oil the
company's preferred stock were passed although the company ~egallY
was in s' financial position to meet the dividend requirements..
Instead, the management caused the company to buy substantial blocks

PART I-JI'HE

19

INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940

of the preferred stock on the stock exchange at prices substantially
less than the liquidating value of such stock. This practice tended
td build 'up value in the' Common stock and thus served the interest
of the management.
On the other hand, to prevent the company
from repurchasing the preferred stock would result in a substantial
decline in the market value of the stock since the company was vir.tually the only buyer. After several conferences with the management,:a plan was worked out which permitted repurchases in sufficient
amount to maintain a satisfactory market for such stock but which
prevented the management from profiting on the repurchases through
an enhancement in the asset value of the common stock held by the
management.
The plan also required the company to payout
all
:cuiTent earnings as dividends on the preferrred stock.
I,

PLANS OF REORG'ANIZATION

In connection with any reorganization 10 involving a registered
investment company, the Act provides that copies of all the documents
'relevant to the solicitation of proxies, consents, and other type of
action of security holders be filed with or mailed to the Commission.
The Act 8:1sovests in the Commission two functions With reference to
-reorganizations:
First, the Commission is authorized, if requested
-by anyl participating registered investment company or the holders
'Of 25 percent of any class of its outstanding securities, to render an
advisory report in respect of the fairness of' any plan of reorganization
and its effect upon any class or classes of security holders. Second,
ft~niay' seek to enjoin the consummation of any such plan in the courts
~:h 'the ground that-it is grossly unfair or constitutes gross misconduct
or gross abuse of trust on the part of officers, directors, or other specined persons sponsoring' the plan.
" -With respect to the :first--the power to render advisory reports on
request--two'such
requests have been received. In both cases advisory reports were prepared and distributed to the interested security

holders. ' "

" '

'

The first case involved a plan of reorganization proposing the
:COnsolidation of two investment companies followed by offers of the
'consolidated company to' exchange its securities for outstanding
'securitieS of three other investment companies which were thereafter
,to 'dissolve.
The companies involved were Standard Investing
'Corporation, . International
Equities Corporation, Central Capital
Vorponttion; Atlantic Securities Company of Boston, and Beacon
Participations, 'Inc. All of these companies were affiliated end were
the edrapohent companies in a system of investment companies known
as :the Henderson Group. Standard Investing Corporation and

of assets, and reeapltallzatlons.

20

SEVENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

International Equities Corporation were the consolidating companies,
the other three the dissolving companies.
The complicated issues presented by this reorganization can be
indicated merely by pointing out the complex capital structures of
the companies (which created sharp conflicts of interest among the
holders of the various classes of securities) and the types of assets
which had to be valued (as a basis for determining the fairness of the
treatment accorded by the plan to the various security holders). As
to capital structure, Beacon Participations, Inc., had outstanding two
classes of preferred stock and common stock; Atlantic Securities
Company of Boston had outstanding debentures, a preferred stock,
and' a common' stock; Central Capital Corporation had outstanding
only-common stock; Standard Investing Corporation had.outstamling
debentures, preferred stock, and common stock; International
Equities Corporation had outstanding two classes of stock with
different claims against the company's assets and profits. Various
degrees of cross-ownership and circular-ownership existed among the
companies and all of the companies were controlled by another
company which was not being reorganized.
The underlying assets of these companies, upon, the valuation of
which depended in a large measure the fairness of the treatment
accorded to all the classes of security holders involved, were as
follows: .real estate and hotel companies, seryice companies, a company manufacturing fiber containers, an' aViation accessory company,
and diversified investment securities.
After numerous conferences between the management of these
companies and members of the Commission's staff some features of
the original tentative plan desired by the management were altered.
In the report of the Commission addressed to the security holders, the
plan was carefully explained; the capital structures were outlined; the
methods of evaluating the assets, particularly the assets having no
quoted market values, were discussed; and the effect of the plan on
the, existing rights and privileges of each of.the outsta.nding"cl.a.ssea-of
securities were analyzed and defined. .
It..
was indicated. to -the security holders th&t~the Commission did
not recommend or approve the plan. The stated purpose of the
Commission was to assist security holders in exercising their judgment
whether or not to accept the plan of reorganization. It was, however,
the opinion of the Commission that the plan, on the basis of certain
specified assumptions, was sufficiently within the limits of fairness to
justify its submission to the security holders for their consideration.
The second case involved the proposed consolidation of Liberty
Share Corporation and Western New York Securities Corporation.
The situation in this case was simpler. Liberty Share Corporation
had outstanding only one class of stock and its assets consisted chiefly

PART I-THE

INVESTMENT COMPANYACT OF 1940

21

of cash, some bank stock, an oil property, and over 30 percent of the
securities of the other consolidating company. Western New York
Securities Corporation, beside cash and some stock of Liberty Share
Corporation, held securities in over 35 different companies. The
chief problems in this case were (1) the determination as to the
reasonableness of the method of computing the relative interests
the security holders of the respective companies were to receive
in the consolidated company and (2) .the determination as to the
propriety of the appraised value on the oil property owned by
Liberty Share Corporation. These problems were pointed out to
the security holders in the report of the Commission, which report
contained an analysis of the assets and capitalization of each of the
companies, the plan, and its effect on the rights and privileges of the
outstanding securities.
The function of the Commission in preparing advisory reports for
the assistance of security holders of reorganizing investment companies fills a long-felt need. It enables security holders who often do
not possess great financial knowledge to obtain an impartial analysis
of the effects of a plan of reorganization on their securities, thus
enabling them to arrive at an informed judgment as to the merits of
the plan .
Although the Commission has authority to submit advisory reports
only when requested by the reorganizing company's management or
by 25 percent of its security holders, the existence of its power to seek
an injunction restraining any grossly unfair plan of reorganization
has resulted in the submission of several plans for informal consideration as to fairness before solicitation of secunty holder approval.
The need for this type of analysis is particularly acute in the case of
voluntary reorganizations which are at present substantially unsupervised by any governmental agency, administrative or judicial.
PERIODIC

PAYMENT

PLAN CERTIFICATES
TRUSTS

AND UNIT INVESTMENT

Many investment companies issue periodic payment plan certificates, that is, a type of investment contract whereby the holder
makes payments on an installment basis and obtams an undivided
interest in certain specified securities or in a unit or fund of securities."
One of the main problems in relation to the sale of such securrtaes is
the cost to the purchaser, namely, the "sales load". Since these
periodic payment certificates are sold to persons of small means, who
frequently default in their payments, the sales load, if it is deducted in
11 This type of security, representing as it doe. a participating or equity interest in specified assets should
not be confused with the face amount certl1lcate which represents an unconditional promise of its issuer to
payaspecl1led sum at aspeclficd or ascertainable future date and is tho; a claun by the holder of the security.

424232-42-3 _

22

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

its entirety from the early payments, will result in substantial loss to
those investors whose payments lapse early in the period of the contract.
The ~<\.ctcopes with this problem by providing that the sales load
on such certificates shall not be more than 9 percent of the total payments. Not more than one-half of this sum may be deducted during
the first year and the balance must be spread proportionately over
the entire period of the contract. However, the Commission is
authorized, upon application or otherwise, to grant qualified exemptions from the sales load requirements to smaller companies whose
operating costs are relatively higher than those of larger companies.
Fourteen applications have been received requesting such relief.
Seven of them have been joined in one proceeding. In respect of
those seven, the' Investment Company Division is contesting the
relief sought on the grounds either that the companies involved are
not smaller companies within the meaning of the Act or that it
does not appear they are subjected to higher costs on that account;
that in either case it is not consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes of the Act to grant the applications. Briefs have
been filed and the Commission has heard oral argument on the
cases."
At the present time the certificates of unit investment trusts are
sold almost entirely to investment compames issuing periodic payment plan certificates and form the underlying security which the
investor purchases through his periodic payments. The Act designates the types of financial institutions which may act as trustee for
such trusts, prevents the charging of expenses against such trusts
before they are incurred, and seeks to insure that all of the securities
and other assets of the trusts will be held intact for the benefit of
investors.
FACE-AMOUNT

CERTIFICATE

COMPANIES

In discussing above the different types of investment companies
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 it was indicated that
among the chief problems presented under the Act by face-amount
certificate companies were those of certificate reserves and of selling
methods. Since January 1, 1941 (the effective date of the Act for
this type of investment company), the efforts of the Commission in
relation to this type of company have been directed mainly to the
enforcement of the reserve requirements and certain related provisions
of the Act pertaining to eligibility of assets, custody of assets, and
certain provisions relating to cash surrender and loan values.
12 On November 6,1~1, the Commission issued its findings and opinion in these proceedings, denying the
applications on the ground that the applieants had failed to show that exemption was necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors. Anuricall ParticiPati01l3,lllc .•
et at., Investment Company Act ReleBSPNo. 249.

PART I-THE

INVESTMENT COMPANYACT OF 1940

23

Probably the most important of these provisions arc those requiring
the establishment of reserve liabilities on an actuarial basis and the
maintenance of eligible assets against such reserves. As the basic
reserve requirement the Act requires a reserve be set IIp from each
installment payment in an amount which, improved at the rate of
3~ percent compounded annually, will, together with similar amounts
from-all other such payments, equal the face amount of the certificate
at its maturity. Any face-amount certificate company in business
before the effective date of the Act which continues. to issue faceamount certificates thereafter is required to maintain these reserves
not only on the newly issued certificates hut on all certificates issued
and outstanding. Additional reserve requirements embrace deficiency
reserves in the case of companies whose effective reserve rate is less
conservative than that required by the Act and reserves against
various kinds of special contract provisions.
The Investment Company Act of 1940 in its application to faceamount certificate companies thus differs somewhat in concept from
the Act in its application to the more common types of investment
company. A very close resemblance to State statutes regulating life
insurance companies may be noted. It is obvious, therefore, that in
administering these sections of the Act important actuarial questions
arise in addition to the usual legal, accounting, financial, and selling
problems. In its efforts to obtain compliance with these requirements the Commission has devoted much time to conferences and
correspondence, much of it of a highly technical nature.
As of the end of the fiscal year there were 11 companies registered
under the Act as face-amount certificate companies. It is impossible
to state with accuracy how many of these companies intend to continue in active operation, that is to say, to continue selling their faceamount certificates. The largest company in this field is Investors
Syndicate which had assets on a consolidated basis at the end of the
fiscal year of approximately $176,000,000. This company discontinued the sale of its certificates at or prior to the effective date of the
Act, although it registered and has otherwise indicated its intention
to comply with all the applicable sections of the Act. Thus, Investors
Syndicate is not required to maintain the reserves previously mentioned, nor is it required to comply with certain other provisions since
those requirements pertain only to companies which have engaged in
the public distribution of its securities after the effective date of the
Act. In lieu of offering its own securities, Investors Syndicate organized a subsidiary face-amount certificate company-Investors
Syndicate of America, Inc.-whose structure and securities were expressly
devised to meet the requirements of the Investment Company Act of
1940 and in particular the provisions of Section 28'. Investors Syn-

24

SEVENTH ~AL

REPORT

dicate acts as the underwriter for its subsidiary in the distribution of
its face-amount certificates and as the manager of its assets.
Fidelity Assurance Association, formerly known as Fidelity Investment Association, likewise discontinued the sale of its face-amount
certificates prior to January 1, 1941, and at the end of the fiscal year
was in reorganization proceedings in the United States District Court
at Charleston, W. Va., under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act.
The future activities of this company are, of course, largely dependent
upon the outcome of these proceedings.
A number of companies somewhat smaller than the foregoing companies have registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940
and have also filed registration statements under the Securities Act
of 1933, thus indicating their intention of going forward with their
selling program as soon as they have worked out the technical details
of compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the
other applicable statutes.
An interesting variant of the face-amount certificate company was
found in a number of States. An insurance company (usually a fire
or casualty company) is organized under State laws and an affiliated
company organized by the promoters of the insurance company. The
affiliated company then offers to the public a face-amount certificate
under the terms of which the purchaser is to pay to the issuing company
$1,200 over a lO-year period in monthly or other periodic installments, on the representation that at the end of the period the
purchaser will receive back in cash the total of his payments to the
company plus a specified number of shares of stock in the insurance
company. These shares, under the plan, are purchased by the faceamount certificate company out of the earnings on the payments of
the installment purchasers to the face-amount certificate company
which are to be invested in various media. It is urged by these enterprises that the plan not only returns all the principal to the investor
but finances the insurance company and secures a wide distribution
of its stock which promotes good will. While 4 such companies registered under the Act during the fiscal year, no company of this type
has yet revised its structure so that it could comply fully with the
provisions of the Act -
and proceed with its selling program. The
sales of 'the securities of all the companies of this type had been
discontinued pending compliance with the Act,
In addition to the 11 face-amount certificate companies registered,
there were perhaps 10 or 15 other companies throughout the country
which had corresponded with or had been discovered by the Commission. With respect to these companies, disposition is being made
of the questions as to their status and compliance.
The assets of the registered face-amount companies amounted
approximately to $215,000,000 at June 30, 1941.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT
OF 1940

ADVISERS

ACT

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
investment advisers, that is, persons engaged for compensation in the
business of advising others with respect to securities.
The Commission is empowered to deny or revoke registration of such advisers if
they have been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct in
respect of security transactions.
The Act also makes it unlawful for
investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud or
deceit; requires investment advisers to disclose the nature of their
interest in transactions executed for their clients; prohibits profit
sharing arrangements;
and in effect prevents assignment
of
investment advisory contracts without the client's consent.

ENACTMENT AND GENERAL NATURE OF ACT

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 was enacted on August 22,
1940, largely as a result of the Commission's study of and report to the
Congress on investment advisory services 1 conducted ancillary to its
study of investment trusts and investment companies pursuant to
Section 30 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. This
new statute became effective on November 1, 1940. On and after
that date it became unlawful for individuals or organizations to use the
mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, including the facilities of any national securities exchange, in connection with
their business as investment advisers, unless they were effectively
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Act covers all individuals, partnerships, corporations, or other
forms of organization which for compensation engage in the business
of advising others, either directly or through publications or writings
as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing
in, buying, or selling securities, or who for compensation and as part of
a regular business disseminate analyses or reports concerning securities.
Exempted from the provisions of the Act, however, are newspapers,
magazines, and :financial publications of general and regular circulation;
brokers and security dealers whose investment advice is given solely as
an incident of their regular business for which no special fee is charged;
banks; certain bank holding company affiliates; individuals or organizations which give advice solely with reference to securities issued or
1 Report of Commission to Congress on "Investment
Counsel, Investment Management, Investment
Supervisory, and Investment Advisory Services." August 1939.

SEVE~

~AL

REPORT

guaranteed by the United States or corporations in which it is
interested; and lawyers, accountants, engineers, and teachers whose
investment advice, if any, is furnished solely incidental to the practice
of their professions.
Exception from the registration requirements of this .Act is provided
for: (1) individuals or organizations which act as investment advisers
solely for investment and insurance companies; (2) individuals or
organizations all of the clients of which are residents of the State
in which they do business, provided no advice is given with respect to
securities traded on national securities exchanges; and (3) individuals or
organizations which do not hold themselves out as investment advisers
generally to the public and which have had during the preceding year
less than fifteen clients.
Registered investment advisers are prohibited from employing any
device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client,
or to engage in any transaction, or practice, or course of business
which operates as a fraud or a deceit upon any client or prospective
client. These fraud provisions are similar to those under the Securities .Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange .Act of 1934. Furthermore, if an investment adviser acts as a principal for his own account
in connection with the sale of any security to or purchase of any
security from a client, he must disclose to such client, in writing, the
capacity in which he is acting with respect to such transaction, and
obtain the consent of the client to such transaction.
REGISTRATION

OF INVESTMENT

ADVISERS

Application for Registration.

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted Form 1-R, the form

to be used by investment advisers in applying for registration with
the Commission. This application for registration requires information relating to. the form of organization of investment advisers, their
partners, officers, directors, controlling persons, employees, the nature
of their business, the nature and scope of authority with respect to
investment advisory clients' funds and accounts, and the basis of
compensation for the investment adviser.
Form l-R was sent to approximately 1,400 persons. Of this number, 605 were effectively registered as at November 1, 1940. Approximately 250 claimed that they were not encompassed by the .Act or
that they were excepted from the registration requirements of the
Act. Between November 2, 1940, and June 30, 1941, 196 additional
persons became registered under the Investment .Advisers Act.
On June 12, 1941, the Commission effected a general check-up of the
persons who failed to communicate in any way with the Commission
with respect to their registration applications. .As at June 30, 1941,

PART II-THE

the Commission has been able to clarify the records with respect to
approximately 370 additional persons.
The following table sets forth information with respect to the status
of the registration of investment advisers under the Act as at the end
of the fiscal year:

The registrants which withdrew tbeir applications had determined
prior to effective registration to discontinue tbeir activities as investment advisers. One application was witbdrawn at the suggestion of
the Commission.
It was found that the registrant in question had
been in the Wisconsin State Prison since 1930 on a charge of assault
with intent to murder and was not subject to parole until 1942.
The largest number of registrants which requested withdrawal of
their effective registration claimed that they had discontinued their
activities as investment advisers. In some cases they had consolidated with other investment adviser firms; in other instances they
entered other employment.
The Commission has by order cancelled the registration of nineteen
firms after finding that they were no longer engaged in investment
'advisory activities.
In some instances, the reason for the cancellation
was due to the fact that the firms were dissolved. In nine cases, the
old :firms were succeeded by new investment advisers.
The Commission has authority by the provisions of Section 203 (d)
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to deny registration if an
applicant, within the ten years prior to registration, has been convicted
of a crime in connection with security transactions or if he is enjoined
by a court in connection with a security or financial fraud, or if his
application for registration is materially misleading.
In the exercise
of this power, the Commission has denied registration to one investment adviser. The Commission found that this registrant while
acting as a broker had been enjoined on April 18, 1940, by the Superior
Court of New York from engaging in various acts and practices in
connection with the purchase and sale of securities. He had been
guilty of selling securities at prices which represented a very high
percentage of profit to him. His customers in every case were elderly

people of modest means, having little knowledge of financial matters,
who relied on the applicant's knowledge of securities and investments,"
The Commission has excepted by order, pursuant to Section 202 (a)
(11) (F), the following three institutions from the provisions of the
.Act: Marine Midland Group, Inc., First Service Corporation, and
Savings Banks Association of Maine. The Commission found after a
hearing that these institutions were, on the basis of their present
activities, not intended to be encompassed by the Investment .Advisers
.Act of 1940.
.
Semi-annual

Report of Registered Investment

Advisers.

To maintain reasonably current the information contained in the
registration application, the Commission has adopted Form 2-R as
the form for semi-annual reports to be made by all registered investment advisers. This form is required to be filed with the Commission
by each such investment adviser within 10 days after June 30 and
December 31 of each year. Each registered investment adviser is to
disclose on this form that after an examination of his original application he finds either that (1) no changes have been effected in his
business so that no amendments are required to the registration application, or (2) that changes were effected so that amendments are
required for items in the original registration application. These
corrections are to be supplied by using those pages of Form 1-R
which include the items that require amendment.

By number oj employees and jorm oj organizati.()n.-ApproximQ.tely
50 percent of the investment advisers effectively registered with the
Commission are sole proprietors. The total number of their personnel,
both part time and full time, constitutes only approximately 10 percent of the total personnel of all effectively registered investment
advisers. Six firms, or less than 1 percent of the registered investment
advisers, employ approximately 25 percent of the total personnel
employed by all registered investment advisers. Among these 6 is
1 firm which is engaged exclusively in giving continuous investment
advice on the basis of the individual needs of each client, and employs
173 full time persons. This constitutes the largest full time personnel
of any registered investment adviser. The remaining 5 firms are
engaged in part in selling uniform publications, and employ a large
number of part time personnel. A large proportion of these persons
functions in part as salesmen. Among these 5 firms is included 1
firm of which practically 80 percent of the personnel is employed on a
part time basis. The following table shows the status of registered

By method oj compensation.-The Investment Advisers Act of 1940
makes it unlawful for registered investment advisers to enter into any
profit-sharing arrangements with their clients on or after the effective
date of the Act. As at November 1, 1940, '60 firms indicated that they
had such profit-sharing agreements with their clients.

PART II--THE

INVESTMENT

ADVISERS ACT OF 1940

35

Approximately 35 percent or 283 of the effectively registered investment adviser firms base their compensation on a percentage of the
value of the funds under their supervision. The average fee is onehalf of 1 percent per year of the value of the funds supervised. In
most of these cases the fee is payable quarterly and usually in advance.
In a few cases an average minimum of approximately $300 is charged.
Approximately 30 percent or 227 of the effectively registered firms
charge a flat fixed fee. Some firms base their fee on a daily rate. The
average fee of this kind is about $25 a day. In other cases, the charge
is determined by the number and character of securities under supervision. For example, some firms may charge $1 for each stock in the
client's portfolio under their supervision and $2.50 for each bond.
Some firms, on the other hand, charge an annual fixed fee varying
from $100 to $500 a year to supervise a client's portfolio.
In cases where the investment adviser sells uniform publications,
his compensation is usually based on a fixed subscription for the
publication. Ope hundred forty-six firms use this method of compensation. In some instances the fees are as low as $5 a month for
the publications.
Thirty-three investment advisers indicated that they fix their compensation through individual negotiation with each client. In most
cases they indicated that the fee was dependent on the amount of
work required in supervising individual portfolios.
By nature of investment advisory service.-The Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 provides that only those investment advisers who are
primarily engaged in furnishing continuous investment advice as to
the investment of funds on the basis of the individual needs of each
client can represent, after November 1,1940, that they are investment
counselor can use the name "investment counsel" as descriptive of
their business.
An examination of the applications for registration filed under the
Act discloses that approximately 300 persons indicated that they were
primarily engaged in furnishing this personalized investment service.
Approximately 165 firms indicated that their investment advisory
service consisted only of the sale of uniform publications.
These
persons, of course, could not use the designation of "investment counsel"
as descriptive of their activities. Likewise, persons who were engaged
in furnishing personalized investment service and also issued
uniform publications, or were conducting businesses other than that of
investment adviser 3 cannot use the designation of "investment counsel"
as descriptive of their activities. It was found upon an examination
of the applications for registration that 283 firms were included in
this category .
• See p, 34. supra, for a description or the various other businesses conducted by Investment advisers.

Part III
PARTICIPATION
OF THE COMMISSION
IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS
UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1938, affords
appropriate machinery for the reorganization of corporations (other
than railroads) in the Federal courts. The Commission's duties
under Chapter X are, first, at the request or with the approval of
the court to act as a participant in proceedings thereunder in order
to provide, for the court and investors, independent expert assistance on matters arising in such proceedings, and, second, to prepare,
for the benefit of the courts and investors, formal advisory reports
on plans of reorganization submitted to it by the courts in such
proceedings.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

During the past fiscal year, the Commission actively participated
in 143 reorganization proceedings involving the reorganization of 176
companies (143 principal debtor corporations and 33 subsidiary debtors).' The proceedings were scattered among Federal district
courts in 28 States, and involved the rehabilitation of companies
engaged in such varied businesses and industries as shipbuilding, oil
and gas production and transmission, manufacture of engines, lumber
products, electrical and metal supplies, coal mining, wheat and flour
mills, wholesale drugs, and many others. The aggregate stated assets of these 176 companies totaled approximately $2,214,638,000,
and their aggregate indebtedness totaled approximately$1,354,357,OOO.2
In the development of administrative law the Commission's functions under Chapter X possess aspects to some extent novel. In
the first place, its work in this sphere is done as a party to the proceedings before the court. The Commission does not initiate proceedings or hold its own hearings, nor has it the power to adopt rules
and regulations governing these cases. In the second place, the

the Federal courts, affording the latter the views of experts in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance.
In the exercise of its functions under Chapter X the Commission
has continued in its endeavor to assist the courts in achieving equitable, financially sound, expeditious, and economical readjustments
of the affairs of corporations in financial distress. To aid in attaining
these objectives the Commission has stationed qualified staffs of
lawyers, accountants, and analysts in its various regional offices and
has assigned them exclusively to the performance of the Commission's duties under Chapter X. The presence of these staffs in the
field permits them to keep in close touch with all hearings and issues
in the proceedings and with the parties, and makes them readily
available to the courts, thus facilitating the work of the courts and the
Commission. During the fiscal year the Commission also submitted
briefs as appellee or as amicus curiae in various appeals raising significant legal questions in Chapter X proceedings.
Because the Commission's advisory reports on plans of reorganization are usually widely distributed, this aspect of the Commission's
work under Chapter X stands out most prominently. These reports
by no means, however, represent the major part of the Commission's
activities in these cases. As a party to a Chapter X proceeding,
the Commission is actively interested in the solution of every major
issue arising therein from the time it becomes a participant to the
close of the proceeding. The Commission has felt that to perform its
duties as a party adequately it is required to undertake in every case
the same intensive legal and financial studies which are required for
the preparation of formal advisory reports, whether or not such reports
are required or will be requested. In all cases such studies are essential in order to consider and discuss various reorganization proposals
while plans are in the stage of formulation, and in cases where the
plans are not submitted to the Commission for advisory report it is
necessary that the Commission be prepared to comment fully upon
all proposed plans at hearings on their approval or confirmation.
During the past fiscal year the Commission submitted 5 formal
advisory reports on plans of reorganization. In addition, 4 supplementary advisory reports were filed in proceedings where advisory
reports had previously been submitted, and 1 other advisory report
and 2 supplementary advisory reports were in the course of preparation at the end of the fiscal year. In 50 other cases, which had reached
the plan stage in the proceeding and in which no formal reports as
such were to be submitted, the Commission made extensive studies
of the debtor's problems, and participated in conferences with respect
to the formulation of plans or at the hearings thereon presented to the
court analyses of the Commission's views and its recommendations
with respect to them.

REORGANIZATIONS

In its Sixth Annual Report 3 the Commission emphasized that it
has been in an advantageous position to encourage the development
of uniformity in the interpretation of Chapter X of the Bankruptcy
Act and in the procedure thereunder. Thus, the Commission has
often been called upon by parties, referees, and special masters for
advice and suggestions with regard to matters of procedure and the
form and content of necessary orders in the proceedings. Thereby,
the Commission has been able to afford substantial aid out of the store
of experience accumulated through participation in many reorganization cases. The Commission has also been able, in this manner, to
save the court officers and the parties much of the effort that would
have been entailed in handling such questions de novo, as well as the
time and expense involved in retracing steps improperly taken.
This work of the Commission has been of special value due to the fact
that the solutions of most procedural and interpretative questions are
not likely to find their way into the official or unofficial reports and
are, therefore, largely unavailable outside of the particular district of
their decision. The Commission has also proceeded, primarily
through the method of informal suggestion and conference, to call to
the attention of parties any violations of or lack of compliance with
the procedural provisions of Chapter X. 'These activites continued
with increased success during the past fiscal year.
Another important phase of the reorganization proceeding to which
the Commission has been giving increasing attention relates to the
drafting and preparation of corporate charters, bylaws, trust indentures, voting trust agreements, and other similar instruments which
are to govern the internal structure of the reorganized debtor after
the reorganization proceedings are consummated. In general, the
Commission has striven to obtain the inclusion in these instruments
of various provisions which will assure to the investors a maximum of
protection. Thus, special attention has been given to (1) provisions
which comply With the statutory requirements that security holders
receive complete and reasonably up-to-date information with regard
to the enterprise, and (2) provisions setting up adequate machinery
whereby the investors may act together for the protection of their
interests and enforcement of their rights. In these matters the
Commission has proceeded generally through the method of informal
conferences and recommendations to the trustee and other parties
who may have the primary responsibility for the preparation of the
instruments. In cases where this method proved unsuccessful to
obtain a revision of an instrument, and the need for revisions was
deemed sufficiently important, the matters were brought to the
attention of the judge in open court.

ON CHAPTER

X REORGANIZATIONS

in which the Commission Participated.

During the period from September 22, 1938 (the date the amended
Bankruptcy Act became fully effective) to the beginning of the fiscal
year, the Commission had filed its notice of appearance in 134 proceedings involving the reorganization of 168 corporations (134 principal debtor corporations and 34 subsidiary debtors). During the
. past fiscal year, the Commission filed its notice of appearance in 40
additional proceedings involving the reorganization of 45 corporations
(40 principal debtor corporations and 5 subsidiary debtors). The
Commission filed its notice of appearance at the request of the judge
in 16 proceedings, while in the remaining 24 the Commission entered
its appearance upon approval by the judge of the Commission's motion
to participate. Of the 40 proceedings, 35 were instituted under Chapter X, and 5 under Section 77B. The debtors involved in these 40
proceedings had aggregate stated assets and aggregate indebtedness
of approximately $134,813,000 and $97,621,000, respectively.'
Of the total of 174 proceedings in which the Commission became
a party from September 22,1938 to June 30, 1941,3 were closed in the
1939 fiscal year, 28 (involving 6 subsidiary debtors) were closed in the
1940 fiscal year, and 29 (involving 6 subsidiary debtors) were closed in
the 1941 fiscal year. (As used here, tbe word "closed" means that a
final decree had been entered, or that the proceeding had been dismissed or otherwise terminated, or that reorganization was so near
completion that active participation by the Commission was no longer
necessary.) The remaining 114proceedings, in which the Commission
was actively participating as of June 30, 1941, involved 141 corporations (114 principal debtor corporations and 27 subsidiary debtors).
These debtors had aggregate stated assets of approximately $1,894,327,000 and aggregate listed liabilities of approximately $1,201,782,000.4 Tables 38 to 42 of Appendix II, pages 307 to 308, contain
further statistical information of reorganization cases instituted underChapter X and Section 77B in which the Commission filed a notice
of appearance and in which it was actively interested in the proceedings during the past fiscal year.
All Reorganizations

Section 265a of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, provides that the
clerks of the various Federal district courts shall transmit to the
Commission copies of every petition for reorganization filed under
Chapter X and copies of other specified documents filed in the proceedings. The Commission has analyzed and compiled the information in these petitions and documents and makes the information
available, for public use, by issuing periodic statistical analyses of'
proceedings under Chapter X.

THE COMMISSION

AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

As stated previously, Section 208 of the Act provides that the
Commission shall become a party to a proceeding under Chapter X
if requested by the judge, and may become a party upon its own
initiative with the approval of the judge. The Commission has not
considered it appropriate or necessary that it move to participate in
every Chapter X case. Apart from the fact that, with cases being
instituted at the average rate of approximately 300 a year, the administrative burden would be very large, many of the cases are small,
involving only trade or bank creditors and a few stockholders. As a
general matter the Commission has deemed it appropriate to move to
participate only in proceedings in which a definite public investor interest is involved. As a rough, practical test, proceedings are considered to have a public interest sufficient to warrant Commission
participation if they involve securities outstanding in the hands of the
public in the amount of $250,000 or more. But mere size of public
investor interest is, of course, not the only criterion. Often, the
Commission may deem it appropriate to enter smaller cases where an
unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed, where the public
security holders are not adequately represented, where the proceedings
are being conducted in violation of important provisions of the Act,
or where other facts indicate that the Commission may perform a
useful service by participating. On occasion, also, the Commission
has entered smaller cases in response to a request by the judge.
By reason of the immediate availability of a large portion of the
Reorganization Division staff in the field at the location of the proceedings themselves, and because the provisions of the amended Act
require the prompt transmission to the Commission of all petitions
for reorganization filed under Chapter X, the Commission's consideration of the question of participation is greatly facilitated. In cases
involving a substantial amount of public investor interest, the Commission's appearance in the case as a party is generally noted within
1 or 2 weeks after the original petition is filed. In smaller cases
where the desirability of participation may not be immediately
apparent, a preliminary study is promptly undertaken to obtain the
data necessary to decide the question.
As soon as the Commission has become a party to a proceeding,
the first effort of the Commission is to assemble and analyze all
available information concerning the debtor and its affairs. This
information normally relates to the physical and financial condition

42

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

of the company, the causes of its financial collapse, the quality of its
management, its past earnings and future prospects, and the reasonable worth of its properties. In obtaining this information the
members of the Commission's staff who are assigned to the various
regional offices of the Commission generally work on the scene in
consultation with the trustee of the debtor, his counsel, and the
other parties to the proceeding. The information thus acquired is
complemented by independent examination of the debtor's books
and records by the accountants and by independent research of the
analytical and financial staff of the Commission with respect to general
economic factors affecting the particular company and competitive
and market conditions and prospects in the particular industry. The
results of these studies provide a solid factual basis for the future
direction of the Commission's activity in the case.
As a party to the proceeding the Commission is represented at all
important hearings and, on appropriate occasions, files legal and financial memoranda in support of its views with respect to the various
problems arising in the proceeding. However, the activities of the
Commission as a party are not limited to those formal appearances and
formal memoranda. Of equal, if not greater, importance, is the
function performed in regularly participating in informal conferences
and discussions with the parties to the proceeding. These conferences
generally take place in advance of formal hearing and argument on
the various important issues arising in connection with the formulation
of a plan or the administration of the estate, with a view to ascertaining
if these issues may be worked out in terms of practicable solutions
consistent with the purpose of the proceedings. By consultation and
discussion before formal action or hearing, the Commission has often
been able to bring facts, arguments, or alternative solutions to the
attention of the parties which they had not previously considered,
and parties have often been prompted thereafter to modify or alter
their proposed action. Frequently a course of action suggested during
the conference meets the approval of all concerned. In general, the
Commission has found these informal round-table discussions an
effective means for cooperation and of great value in expediting the
proceedings.
There is a multitude of diverse issues with which the Commission
is concerned as a party to a Chapter X proceeding. To illustrate
the scope of the Commission's activity, a brief account is presented
below of some of the issues which arose in representative cases in
which the Commission participated during the past fiscal year.
These are necessarily but a minute sampling of the manifold issues,
wholly 'S:partfrom 'the preparation of advisory reports, with which the
Commission was concerned in the 143 cases in which it was participating during the year.

PART III-eORPORATE

REORGANIZATIONS

43

(1) .A. voluntary petition for the reorganization of a relatively small
manufacturing company was filed late in 1938. The petition was
approved by the court and a trustee was appointed. After a preliminary investigation and inquiry into the affairs of the debtor, the
Commission determined, in view of the small amount of public
investor interest involved, to defer the matter of participation but toobserve closely developments in the proceedings. In August 1940,
the reorganization being no nearer consummation than it was when the
petition was filed, and it appearing that the bondholders were not
being adequately represented by disinterested parties, that there waa
a need for independent investigation of certain charges of fraud and
mismanagement, that fees were being sought which seemed excessive,
and that there had been a failure to observe important procedural
requirements of Chapter X, the Commission filed a motion for leave
to file its notice of appearance, which motion was granted.
Immediately after the Commission became a party to the proceeding, conferences were held with the trustee and other parties concerning the future progress of the case. The requirements of the statute
concerning the investigation by the trustee of the affairs of the debtor
and the transmission to the security holders of a report of the results
of the investigation, were emphasized to the trustee. Also, the Commission assembled all available information relating to the debtor and
undertook an independent investigation oovering, inter alia, such
matters as possible causes of action for mismanagement and fraud, the
relationship between the debtor and certain affiliated companies, and
the amount and propriety of fees charged in connecnon with a prior
voluntary reorganization.
After preparation of the trustee's report of the results of his
investigation of the property, liabilities, and financial condition of
the debtor, a draft of such report was submitted to the Commission
for its views. In the opinion of the Commission the report was inadequate to fulfill its primary purpose, viz., to give the security
holders full and accurate information concerning the affairs of the
debtor so that they may be in a position to make suggestions with
respect to a plan and to vote on a plan on the basis of an informed
judgment. Representatives of the Commission conferred with the
trustee and the report was amended in accordance with the Commission's suggestions for improvement. The report was sent to
security holders and filed with the court in November 1940.
.A. plan of reorganization was then filed by the trustee in December
1940. Upon consideration and analysis of the plan, the Commission
was of the view that the plan was neither fair nor feasible and, accordingly, filed a comprehensive memorandum stating its objections to
the plan. Inter alia, the Commission pointed out that (1) the securities to be issued to senior claimants did not provide for full compensa-

44

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

tory treatment for their claims; (2) there was an unfair distribution of
voting power as between the various classes of claimants; and (3)
the plan provided for a capital structure which was needlessly complex. Thereafter, the trustee filed an amended plan of reorganization
which substantially met the objections raised by the Commission to
the original plan. Alter hearings on the amended plan, it was approved by the court on March 19, 1941, and was thereafter accepted
by the security holders and confirmed on May 1, 1941.
After confirmation of the plan the Commission continued to be
active in the proceedings. The proposed new trust indenture, chattel
mortage, voting trust agreement, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of the reorganized company were examined. During informal
conferences with the parties to the proceeding, the Commission made
numerous suggestions for the revision of these instruments, which
were adopted. In general, these suggestions were designed to assure
greater protection for the interests of the public security holders.
The Commission also participated in the hearings and submitted
to the court its recommendations with respect to the applications for
allowance of compensation for services rendered and reimbursement
of expenses incurred by the various parties. In addition, the Commission submitted its views with respect to the proper procedure to
be followed in these matters and pointed out that the amounts requested by certain of the applicants were unreasonable because the
services rendered by them were unnecessary and duplicative; and
that certain of the requests were excessive in the light of the size of
the estate, its ability to pay, and the benefit to the estate from the
sen-ices rendered. Further, the Commission indicated that certain
of the applicants should be denied any compensation because their
services did not result in any benefit to the estate or contribute to the
plan of reorganization, and that certain other applicants should be
denied any compensation because they represented conflicting interests, on the basis of the recent United States Supreme Court decision
of Woods v. City National Bank and Trust 00. of Ohicago.6
Thus, within less than a y,ear after the Commission became a party
to the proceedings, a plan of reorganization has been confirmed and,
except for the decision of the court on the applications for allowances,
the reorganization has been completed.
(2) In another case, a voluntary petition was approved by the judge
and a trustee was appointed for a debtor which had discontinued its
manufacturing operations and was engaged in the leasing of its various
plants and buildings. Over $1,000,000 of the debtor's first mortgage bonds were widely distributed in small amounts in the hands of
the public. In view of this substantial public investor interest the

Commission moved promptly to participate in this case, and filed its
notice of appearance with the approval of the judge.
The following are some of the matters which the Commission considered during the course of the proceeding:
(a) After examining into the facts bearing upon the qualifications and disinterestedness of the trustee in accordance with the
standards prescribed by Sections 156 and 158 of Chapter X, the
Commission determined that there was no basis for objecting to the
retention of the trustee in office.
(b) A petition for an order fixing the time and manner of presen.tation of claims was filed in the proceedings. The Commission pointed
out to the trustee that the order on such petition should provide that
individual bondholders be allowed to file proofs of claim, even though
the trustee under the indenture for the bonds was also authorized to
file a claim on behalf of all bondholders, because under the provisions
of Chapter X only those bondholders who file proofs of claim could
be counted in connection with voting on a plan of reorganization.
The Commission also recommended that forms of proof of claim be
sent to all bondholders, to make it unnecessary for individual bondholders to obtain the services of counsel in preparing their proofs
of claim. These recommendations of the Commission were adopted
by the trustee.
(c) The trustee had presented to the court ex parte applications,
asking approval of proposed leases and authority to expend substantial sums of money for repairs. The Commission opposed the presentation of such matters ex parte. In discussions with the trustee,
it was pointed out that, even if the matter was not of sufficient importance to require notice to all security holders, notice should at
least be given to all parties to the proceedings, with which the trustee
agreed. Again, the trustee requested from the court authority to sen
certain of its machinery and equipment. The Commission discussed
with the trustee the proper procedure to be followed in this matter
and, as suggested by it, notice of the proposed sale was sent to all
security holders; the sale was held by public auction, subject, however, to subsequent approval by the judge; and an opportunity was
given all security holders to object to the terms of the sale before the
judge.
(d) In July 1940, the trustee filed a plan of reorganization with the
court. After examination thereof, the Commission advised the trustee
that his plan was in many respects incomplete and that it disregarded
the requirements of fairness and feasibility in that there was no attempt made in the"plan to recognize the respective priorities of the
claimants. Thereafter, the plan of reorganization was discussed
with the trustee and other parties before the date set for hearing on
the plan. These conferences led to a satisfactory plan of reorganize-

46

SEVENTH ~AL

REPORT

tion, worked out with the trustee and the parties, which was filed with
the court. After hearings thereon the plan was approved by the
court; two alternative plans proposed by other parties were opposed
by the Commission and rejected by the court.
(e) In connection with the plan which he later approved, the judge
raised certain legal and procedural questions and requested that the
Commission and certain other parties submit their views: The plan
provided for a gradual liquidation of the debtor's assets and the
principal question raised by the judge was whether such a plan was
permissible under the statute.
The Commission expressed the view
that such a plan is within the statutory definition of a plan of reorganization.
Activities with Regard to Allowances.

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of allowances to the various parties for services rendered and expenses
incurred in the proceeding. In this matter the general practice of
the Commission has been, initially, to make certain that the individual
applications contain full information as to the nature and the extent
of the services and expenses for which allowances are sought, that the
necessary affidavits are submitted, and that adequate notice of the
hearing on the applications is given to the security holders. A
detailed study is then made by the Commission of the amount and
kind of work performed by the different applicants. At the hearing
on the applications, the Commission advises the judge with respect
to its recommendations concerning the merits of the respective
applications and the total charges with which the estate can be
burdened, in light of its financial condition and related factors.
The Commission has been able to provide considerable assistance
to the Federal courts in dealing with this problem. The Commission
itself may not receive allowances from the estate for the services it
renders, and is able to present a wholly disinterested, impartial view
of the problem. It has sought to assist the courts in protecting
reorganized companies from excessive charges while, at the same time,
equitably allocating compensation on the basis 'of the claimants'
contributions to the administration of the estate and the formulation
of a plan. In this connection, it has been deemed important that
unnecessary duplication of work shall not be compensated and that
the aggregate of allowances shall not exceed an amount which the
estate can afford to pay. With these objectives in mind, the Commission may undertake to make specific recommendations to the courts
as to the amount to be allowed in cases where the Commission has
been a party throughout the proceeding 'and is thoroughly familiar
with the activities of the various parties and all significant developments in the proceedings; in other cases, e. g., where it has entered the
proceeding at an advanced stage, the Commission has undertaken at

PART ITI--CORPORATE

REORGANIZATIONS

least to advise the court generally as to whether it considers the requested amounts reasonable, moderately excessive, or exorbitant, and
the reasons for these views.
PLANS OF REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER X

The Act requires, as a condition to confirmation of a plan of reorganization, that the judge be satisfied that the plan is "fair and
equitable, and feasible." The consummation of a plan which meets
these requirements is, of course, the ultimate objective of any reorganization proceeding. The Commission's primary function under
Chapter X is to aid the courts in the attainment of this objective.
In appraising the fairness of plans the Commission has consistently
taken the position that, to be fair, plans must provide full compensatory treatment for claims and interests of creditors and stockholders
according to the order of their legal and contractual priority, either in
cash or new securities or both. The implications of this principle have
been followed consistently by the Commission, and its position has
been fully sustained by the decision of the Supreme Court in Oase v.
Los Angeles Lumber Products 00., Ltd.,6 in which the principle was
reiterated and given new vigor in its application to Chapter X
proceedings.
The requirement of feasibility relates to economic soundness of the
proposed financial structure. In a recent opinion, the Commission
stated that the essence of feasibility "may be said to be that a plan is
of such a character that it gives reasonable assurance that the reorganized enterprise will operate economically and efficiently, will be
able to perform the purposes of its existence and will not so far as
foreseeable result in the necessity for another reorganization with its
In appraising the
attendant expense and injury to iuvestors.i'"
feasibility of plans the Commission has given consideration to such
matters as the adequacy of working capital, the relationship of the
funded debt or capital structure to property values, the ability of
corporate earning power to meet interest and dividend charges, the
effect of the proposed new capitalization upon the company's prospective credit, and the desirable objective that new securities shall not
by their terms or otherwise be deceptive to subsequent purchasers.
Determination

of V:-alue.

A prerequisite to the formulation of a fair and feasible plan of
reorganization is the determination of the value of the debtor's enterprise for reorganization purposes. The Commission has consistently
adhered to the position that, for reorganization purposes, the capitalization of reasonably prospective earnings. is the most reliable method
of valuation; that the value so found should be the controlling factor
• 308 U. S. 106.

Holding Company Act Release No. 2042

48

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

in arnvmg at an appropriate capital structure for the reorganized
debtor and should provide the basis of allocation of new securities
among the debtor's creditors and stockholders. The position which
the Commission has consistently urged with respect to valuations was
fully sustained by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in
Consolidated Rock Products Co. v. DuBois, decided March 3, 1941, in
which the Commission participated as amicus curiae. The Court's
opinion, per Douglas, J., contained the following controlling statement
on the problem of valuation in reorganization proceedings:
"In the second place, there is the question of the method of valuation.
From
this record it is apparent that little, if any, effort was made to value the whole
enterprise by a capitalization of prospective earnings. The necessity for such an
inquiry is emphasized by the poor earnings record of this enterprise in the past.
Findings as to the earning capacity of an enterprise are essential to a determination of the feasibility as well as the fairness of a plan of reorganization. Whether
or not the earnings may reasonably be expected to meet the interest and dividend
requirements of the new securities is a sine qua non to a determination of the
integrity and practicability of the new capital structure.
It is also essential for
satisfaction of the absolute priority rule of Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products
Co., supra.
Unless meticulous regard for earning capacity be had, indefensible
participation of junior securities in plans of reorganization may result.
"As Mr. Justice Holmes said in Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co.
v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217, 226, 'the commercial value of property consists in the
expectation of income from it.' And see Cleveland, Cmcinnati, Chicago & St.
Louis Ry. Co. v. Backus, 154 U. S. 439, 445. Such criterion is the appropriate
one here, since we are dealing with the issue of solvency arising in connection with
reorganization plans involving productive properties. It is plain that valuations
for ot her purposes are not relevant to or helpful in a determination of that issue,
except as they may indirectly bear on earning capacity.
Temmer v. Denver
Tramway Co., 18 F. (2d) 226, 229; New York Trust Co. v. Continental & Commercial Trust & Sav. Bank, 26 F. (2d) 872,874. The criterion of earning capacity
is the essential one if the enterprise is to be freed from the heavy hand of past
errors, miscalculations, or disaster, and if the allocation of secunties among the
various claimants is to be fair and equitable. In re Wickwire Spencer Steel Co.,
12 F. Supp. 528, 533; 2 Bonbright, Valuation of Property, pp. 870-881, 884-893.
Since its application requires a prediction as to what will occur in the future, an
estimate, as distinguished from mathematical certitude, is all that can be made.
But that estimate must be based on an informed judgment which embraces all
facts relevant to future earning capacity and hence to present worth, including,
of course, the nature and condition of the properties, the past earnings record, and
all circumstances which indicate whether or not that record is a reliable criterion
of future performance. A sum of values based on physical factors and assigned
to separate units of the property without regard to the earning capacity of the
whole enterprise is plainly inadequate.
See Finletter, The Law of Bankruptcy
Reorganization, pp. 557 el seq. But hardly more than that was done here. The
Circuit Court of Appeals correctly left the matter of a formal appraisal to the
discretion of the District Court. The extent and method of inquiry necessary for
a valuation based on earning capacity are necessarily dependent on the facts of
each case."

To illustrate various aspects of the fair and feasible plan which have
arisen in cases in which the Commission was not required to file a for-

PART llI--CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS

49

mal advisory report and to indicate the position of the Commission
with respect thereto, a number, of examples are given below.
In one of the proceedings in which the Commission participated
during the past fiscal year, the debtor's only asset, an apartment hotel,
had an estimated value considerably less than the amount of the first
mortgage bondholders' claims. Nevertheless, a plan of reorganization
proposed by the debtor provided for participation by both second
mortgage bondholders and stockholders. It was proposed that a loan
would be obtained, part of the proceeds of which would be used for
improvements and the remainder to be distributed to bondholders on
the basis of approximately 28 cents on the dollar. The preferred stock
of the reorganized company would be divided equally between the first
mortgage bondholders and the second mortgagees, while the stockholders would retain their present interests. The Commission successfully opposed the plan on the ground that it was unfair in recognizing
junior interests for which there was admittedly no equity. The
Commission also was of the opinion that the plan was not feasible
since the value of the assets was probably less than the amount
of the proposed new mortgage; furthermore, it seemed extremely
doubtful whether, even after rehabilitation, the earnings would
be sufficient to pay interest and amortization charges. Subsequently, the trustee proposed a plan which provided for complete
elimination of all interests junior to the first mortgage bondholders.
Under the trustee's plan the bondholders would have received all of a
new issue of preferred stock and 40 percent of the new common. The
remainder of the common stock was to be sold for cash to an experienced hotel operator. Although the Commission did not object
to the trustee's plan, it made several suggestions with respect to minor
modifications, most of which were adopted. Subsequently the plan
was accepted by the bondholders and confirmed by the court.
In another proceeding in which the Commission is participating, the
debtor carries on, directly and through a number of wholly-owned
subsidiaries, the business of subdividing and developing real estate,
operating hotels, cottages, a water supply company, a lumber and
supply company, and owning and leasing farm properties, dam sites,
and other properties. The debtor has outstanding in excess of
$800,000 principal amount of first mortgage bonds which are secured
by certain of the debtor's properties and all of the outstanding shares
of one of its subsidiaries. The debtor also owes approximately $250,000
to a bank secured by certain other properties of the debtor and the
shares of another of the debtor's subsidiaries, viz., a hotel subsidiary.
All of the preferred and common stock of the debtor is closelv held
by persons who are also creditors of the debtor.

this plan provided for the continued existence of the debtor and the
organization of a new corporation which was to acquire all of the assets pledged as security for the first mortgage bonds. All of the common stock of the new corporation was to be distributed to the bondholders. A new loan of approximately $195,000 was to be made by
the bank to the new corporation, which loan was to be secured by a
pledge of all of the bondholders' assets. Of the loan, $120,000 was
to be used to purchase furniture and equipment from the hotel subsidiary and the balance was to be used to pay all reorganization expenses, outstanding trustee certificates, all claims requiring payment
in cash, and unsecured obligations of the hotel subsidiary. The entire $120,000 secured by the hotel subsidiary upon the sale of the
furniture to the new corporation was to be returned directly to the
bank, $30,000 by way of payment of a note to the debtor pledged by
the bank and the balance by virtue of the hotel subsidiary's guaranty
of the bank loan.
After careful analysis of all available information, the Commission
came to the conclusion that the plan, on its face, was unfair as well
as lacking in feasibility. In the first place it was the belief of the
Commission that the plan, in essence, operated to improve the status.
of the bank claim at the expense of the bondholders. It appeared
that two of the directors of the debtor were also directors of the bank.
Under the plan, the bondholders were required to accept equity secu-rities in a new corporation and pledge all the assets of the new corporation to secure a new loan of $195,000 from the bank from which they
were to receive no benefit and the necessity of which was not shown;
Also, the bondholders were being foreclosed of any right to a deficiency
claim against other assets of the debtor without any determination of
the value of their security. The bank, on the other hand, which had
a $250,000 claim against the debtor, secured by a small portion of the
assets, would, upon consummation of the proposed plan, have a
$325,000 claim, $195,000 of which would be secured by a first lien
against all of the property which now secured the bonds, and the
balance of $130,000would be secured by all the property now securing
its present $250,000 claim.
Also under the plan, the present stockholders were to receive all of
the stock of the debtor without any determination that there was any
equity over the secured claims. Further, it appeared that the stockholders had obtained possession of approximately two-thirds of the
bonds, at least a substantial portion of which had been acquired undercircumstances which might afford substantial grounds for the subord-ination of the claims of such bonds to the claims of the public bondholders. In the opinion of the Commission, approval of any plan as.
fair before this question had been fully explored was unwarranted.

The Commission also noted thac the trustee had failed to investigate causes of action available to the estate, based upon the possible
violation of the trust indenture on the part of the directors and the
indenture trustee with respect to partial releases of the security
underlying the bonds which were in default. Further, in the opinion
of the Commission, the plan was not feasible (1) because it appeared
that both the debtor and the new corporation would begin operations
with a large secured indebtedness and with no apparent source of
income sufficient to meet the fixed charges on this indebtedness or to
meet its payment at maturity; and (2) because it did not appear that
either corporation would begin operations with sufficient working
capital and since substantially all of the assets were to be pledged,
there was little likelihood that either corporation would be able to
later obtain funds for working capital.
The Commission's objections to the plan were incorporated into a
memorandum which was filed in the proceedings. Also, counsel for
the Commission participated at the hearing on the plan and presented
the views of the Commission with respect to the plan in open court.
In accordance with the position urged by the Commission the court
disapproved the plan. A new plan is now in the process of being
formulated.
In another case, the debtor owned a hotel which, on the basis of
prospective earnings, had a value considerably less than the amount
due on the first mortgage certificates. A plan was proposed which
gave no recognition to any class below the first lienors. It called for
an extension of the entire mortgage at a modified interest rate payable
if earned. The property was to be administered by three trustees,
the successor trustees to be appointed by the court.
The Commission was opposed to the trustee mechanism, urging
instead a corporate arrangement which would, inter alia, increase
certificate holders' control of their affairs. Also, it took the position
that the plan was not feasible unless the proposed mortgage was
reduced to a figure duly proportionate to the valuation.
Primarily as a result of informal conferences with the parties, the
original plan was amended to eliminate these objectionable features.
In the final plan, the bonds were extended 10 years, the new mortgage
was 50 percent of the total face amount of the outstanding bonds, and
a new corporation was provided as the vehicle. As a result of these
major changes, the Commission did not oppose approval of the plan.
ADVISORY REPORTS

ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

As has been pointed out, in order to be in a position to render the
utmost assistance to the court with respect to the legal and financial
problems arising in the course of the proceedings, the Commission
undertakes its own comprehensive examination of the financial

52

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

condition of the debtor, including the factors bearing upon its earnings and valuation. Accordingly, when the proceeding reaches the
stage of preparation and submission of plans, the Commission is in a
position to discuss its views thereon with the parties and to present
its recommendations on the plan in open court or, if required to do so,
to submit a formal advisory report expressing its opinion with respect
to the proposed plans.
The usual procedure in the reference of a plan to the Commission
for such report is as follows: after the trustee has filed a plan a hearing
is held at which the plan and objections thereto are considered. Also
any other plans or amendments to the trustee's plan which may at
that time be submitted by creditors, stockholders, or the debtor may
be considered at this hearing.. At this stage of the proceeding it is
the concern of the attorneys representing the Commission to see that
an adequate factual record is made to enable the judge to decide
whether anyone or more of the plans are worthy of consideration, and
to supply the factual groundwork for the Commission's report. If the
record develops inadequately, the Commission's attorneys endeavor
to remedy the deficiencies either through the trustee's witnesses or by
calling their own experts. Frequently, the Commission has cooperated with the appropriate parties in the preparation for such hearings,
during which it goes over the matters necessarily to be considered,
and aids in the formulation of the record. After such hearing, if the
judge finds anyone or more of the plans worthy of consideration, they
are referred to the Commission, which then prepares and submits its
report. If a plan is then approved by the judge as fair and equitable,
and feasible, it is transmitted to the security holders for their acceptance or rejection, accompanied by a copy of the judge's opinion on
the plan and a copy of the Commission's advisory report or a summary
thereof prepared by the Commission. In this manner, the advisory
report serves also to aid security holders in their decision to accept or
reject the plan.
During the past fiscal year the Commission submitted formal
advisory reports on five plans of reorganization. A brief summary of
these reports follows:
Mortgage Guarantee Company, Debtor, and Saratoga Building and
Land Corporation, Druid Park Apartments Company, and Wyman
Park Apartments Company, Subsidiaries.-The business of the debtor
and its subsidiary companies was investing in mortgages on real estate
and selling guaranteed participations in these mortgages to the public.
The debtor also acted as agent for the certificate holders in the collection of interest and in the performance of similar duties. Financial
difficulties, which struck the debtor at the beginning of the depression,
led to a voluntary plan of reorganization in 1933, the principal feature
of which was a reduction in the interest received by the certificate

PART m-cORPORATE

REORGANIZATIONS

53

holders. In 1937, steps were taken toward a second voluntary plan.
Inability to secure sufficient assents, however, led to abandonment of
the 1937 plan and to the filing of the debtor's petition on September
16, 1939.
The reorganization was complicated by the fact that, during the
years preceding the filing of the petition, the debtor, pursuant to the
terms of the certificates, had foreclosed and taken title to many of the
properties on which mortgage participation certificates had been sold.
These properties, referred to as the debtor-owned properties, were
treated differently in the final plan from other properties on which
the mortgages had not as yet been foreclosed, referred to as the thirdparty mortgages. The first attempt at a plan of reorganization,
formulated by the independent trustee, contemplated pooling all of
the properties and mortgages and pledging them with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation as security for a loan, the proceeds of
which would be used for distributions to the certificate holders. This
plan failed, however, because of the decision of the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation that the debtor did not have title to the properties. Another plan was then formulated by the trustee. In this
plan the right to alter the liabilities of the debtor to the certificate
holders was asserted only in connection with the so-called debtorowned properties.
The debtor and- its subsidiaries were dearly insolvent. The liability of the debtor on its. guarantee of first and second mortgages
exceeded by $6,434,000 the appraised value of the properties which
secured the mortgages. In addition, the debtor was liable on notes
payable to the extent of $335,000, and had sundry liabilities of
$87,000. As against liabilities of $6,856,000 (exclusive of its liability
on the guarantees covered by the appraised value of the properties)
the debtor had free assets of only $485,000.
This case reflected the value of continued discussion between the
Commission and participants in the reorganization at every stage of
the proceedings up to the final consummation of the plan. As
originally submitted, the plan did not contain all of the safeguards
which certificate holders eventually received, and did not fully
comply with the principle that senior creditors are entitled to full
recognition of their claims before junior creditors may participate.
In frequent conferences with the trustee and with representatives of
certificate holders, the Commission was able to obtain adoption of
many suggested amendments. Changes suggested by the Commission to the trustee included drastic revisions of the clauses pertaining
to the allotment of partici.patiDn in the new company, sinking fund
provisions, and control- of the new company. These were adopted
by the trustee and were filed by him as amendments to his plan prior

to the court's submission of the plan to the Commission for advisory
report.
As finally submitted the compulsory features of the plan, i. e., its
effect as binding the minority of creditors if two-thirds of them
accepted it, applied only to certificate holders in the debtor-owned
properties. A new company was set up, the stock of which was
placed in a voting trust for 10 years. Three voting trustees were
named, all of whom were independent of the debtor and were men of
experience and standing in. the real estate or related fields. The
assets of the debtor were to be transferred to the new company.
The activities of the new company were to be devoted to the liquidation of the properties for the benefit of the certificate holders, and
to their management pending liquidation. An attempt was to be
made to liquidate the properties within a 5-year period. Prior to
liquidation of, and payment of the certificate holders in, any particular
mortgage, interest at the rate of 4}~percent was to accumulate and
be paid if earned. An additional 1 percent of interest was to accumulate, but was not to be paid until final distribution resulting from
liquidation of each property. On vote of two-thirds of the certificate
holders of each property, not only might the servicing of the property
be transferred to an outside agency, but its sale at any price could
also be compelled. A sinking fund was created out of which certificates might be retired. So far as free assets existed, they were to
be devoted to payment of unsecured creditors, the largest' part of
whom were the certificate holders to the extent of their deficiency
claims.
The Commission recommended acceptance of this amended plan,
but suggested amendment of other provisions which granted participation to holders of certificates in third-party mortgages on a voluntary basis. Under the plan certificate holders in these mortgages
might, by action of a majority, appoint the new company as their
agent to service the mortgages and to take steps in their behalf.
SUChan action had no effect on any minority who might refuse to
appoint the new company as their agency. In the event of foreclosure by the new company on their account, however, the assenters
surrendered rights which they would have had upon foreclosure .in
the usual manner. The Commission, therefore, recommended
amendment of this portion or'the plan. The plan as submitted :was
approved by the court and submitted to the certificate holders.
The Higbee Oompany.-Under the plan proposed in this ease the
holders of the Senior Bank Indebtedness for their claim of $591,930
received $150,000 in cash and $44l,930 in notes bearing 4 percent
fixed interest and maturing serially within, 4 years. Holders of the
Senior Rent Indebtedness of $846,922 received an equal par value of
4 percent notes maturing in 7 years. Holders of th~~}llliQrIndebted-

ness, which aggregated $1,951,727, received as a compromise $600,000
in 4 percent 10-year notes and new $1 par common stock at the rate
of 1 share for each $100 of the balance of their claim. They would
thus receive a total of 13,517 shares, or about 51 percent of the total
new common stock.
The holders of the First Preferred Stock, having a claim of $1,139,900
principal and $738,085 dividends, accrued to February 1, 1941, received new 5 percent cumulative $100 par preferred stock for the par
amount of their claim and one-third of the accrued dividends. For the
balance of their accrued dividends, they received new common stock
at the rate of 1 share for each $100 claim, or an aggregate of 4,921
shares. Valuing the new common stock on the basis of the Commission's estimated valuation of the debtor's assets, as discussed below,
the First Preferred Stock would receive a value of between $1,915,000
and $1,953,000 for its claim of $1,877,985.
The holders of the Second Preferred Stock, having a claim totaling
$783,637, were given 1 share of new common stock for each $100 due
them. The 7,836 shares they would receive would have an aggregate
value of between $843,000 and $902,000 on the basis of the Commission's valuation. The present common stock did not participate in
the plan.
The debtor submitted no specific valuation in support of the plan,
but in view of the capitalization proposed and the basis on which
the new common stock was to be allocated, it was evident that a valuation of at least $6,000,000 was presupposed. The Commission, using
the 1941 fiscal year earnings of $617,000 before Federal income taxes,
less an adjustment of $25,000 for executive salaries, concluded that
this base of $592,9°0 was a reasonable measure of the company's earnings for purposes of valuation. Capitalizing these earnings at a rate
which seemed appropriate in the light of rates of capitalization ap
plicable to comparable department stores and adding excess working
capital to the result, the Commission determined that a value within
a range of approximately $6,100,000 to $6,300,000 did not appear
unreasonable. These figures compare with indebtedness and claims
of preferred stockholders under the old capitalization totaling $6,052,000. Under the proposed plan, debt and preferred stock would
total $3,274,752, leaving a substantial equity for the new common
stock.
The plan is unusual in that it provides for the accumulation of
dividends on the new preferred stock for a period of from 5 to 10
years. Usually such a proposal would not be considered feasible, but
.it was viewed as acceptable in this case because the accumulation will
be due not to lack of earnings, but rather to a predetermined policy
of applying, earn~s jo payment of all outstanding debts aa quickly
as possible. No.dividends are to .be paid on the new common stock

56

SEVENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

until payment has been made in full of all notes and all accumulations
of dividends on the new preferred stock.
The plan provided that holders of the new preferred stock, voting
as a class, were entitled at all times to elect three members of the
board of directors, holders of the 7-year notes one member, and
common stockholders the remaining three. However, after the
retirement of the 7-year notes, the common stockholders were to
elect four members, a majority. In accordance with the.recommendation of the Commission, the plan was amended to provide that, after
retirement of the senior indebtedness, the preferred stockholders
should elect a majority of the board of directors until all accumulated
dividends on the stock have been paid, and at any time thereafter
upon default of six quarterly dividends.
The major problem presented in this proceeding involved the proposed compromise of the junior indebtedness and its effect on the
public investors-the
two classes of preferred stockholders. This
junior indebtedness consisted originally of a $1,500,000 loan from The
Cleveland Terminals Building Company, to enable Higbee to move
into its new store. The Cleveland Terminals Building Company,
which was controlled by the Van Sweringen Brothers, owned all the
common stock of the debtor. After various intermediate transactions,
the two notes evidencing this loan were purchased for $600,000 in 1937
by a director of Higbee and an associate.
It has been contended that these notes should (1) be completely
subordinated to claims of preferred stockholders or (2) be limited to
$100,000, the amount for which they were carried on the books of
Midamerica Corp., which was an intermediate holder among whose
officers and directors were the Van Sweringen Brothers, or (3) be
allowed only in the amount paid by the last purchaser-$600,000.
Litigation of the issues presented by these contentions would have
required the solution of many difficult factual and legal questions.
In addition, if the disputed question of ownership of these notes were
reaolzed.in favor of certain of the claimants, the full amount of the
notes together with interest might ultimately be determined to constitute a claim ahead of the preferred stock. The Commission, under
the circumstances, was of the opinion that the proposed compromise
could not be said to be unfair.
The compromise would relieve both classes of the old preferred stock
of the possibility that a claim jn excess of $600,000 for the junior
indebtedness would be allowed. On the other hand, if litigation were
to result in eliminating the $600,000 prior claim, their position would
be improved. The Commission concluded, however, that even with
-el:iiti:inition of't,lIese prior' claims the -First Preferred' Stockholders'
claims in amount would be no larger than at present, and that it was
questionable whether the value of the securities .they would receive

PART m--CORPORATE

REORGANIZATIONS

51

in such event would materially exceed the provision made for them
in the present plan. As to the effect on the Second Preferred Stock,.
which represented a residual claim in this case, the Commission concluded that the company's new common stock would have an asset
value in excess of the rate at which it was to be allocated to the
Second Preferred (one share for each $100 claim), and that, considering all elements, the proposed compromise did not appear detrimental to the interests of this group.
The Commission, on March 20,1941, filed its report approving the
plan as amended. The court approved the plan on July 2, 1941.
Atlas Pipeline Oorporation.-The trustee's plan in this case provided
for the issuance of $1,01l,400 of 4~ percent first mortgage bonds;
$435,000 of 4 percent preferred stock; and $100,000 of common stock
with a par value of $20. The first mortgage bondholders were to
receive $961,400 of the new 4~ percent first mortgage bonds, which
in-faoe-arnount corresponded to the principal amount of their claims
plus interest. The remaining $50,000 of the new bonds were subscribed by the American Locomotive Company under a guarantee by 8
Producers Group which controlled substantial oil production in the
area. The Producers Group was to take the stock at cost plus interest
over a period of 5 years. The second mortgage bondholders received
the new preferred stock equalling one-third the amount of their claims
without interest. Because of debtor's insolvency the common stockholders were eliminated. The new common stock was to be purchased
by the Producers Group for $100,000; and the common stock could
not be divested of control for at least 3 years because of failure to pay
. preferred dividends. Further, the debtor agreed to purchase all
crude oil from the Producers Group. The Producers Group was to
advance short term secured credit during the life of the purchase
contract up to $200,000 if additional working capital was needed.
Under the plan complete control was given the Producers Group
for 3 years. The first mortgage bondholders took a reduced interest
rate, extended the maturity of their bonds, accepted a reduced sinking fund requirement, lost their conversion privilege, and gave up
their lien on approximately $150,600 in cash held by the indenture
trustee. The second mortgage bondholders accepted 4 percent preferred stock having a par value equal to one-third the principal
amount of their claims, and gave up their creditor position entirely.
From the Commission's investigation, it appeared that there was
no adequate support for the estimated annual earnings or future
economic life 'of..the-debtor; and financial- judgment dictated a higher
capitalization rate in arriving at going-concern value.
The Commission concluded that the plan was neither feasible, fair,
nor equitable. The debtor's present liquidation value might exceed
its value as a continuing entity, its earning prospects were uncertain,

'58

SEvENTH ANNUAL REPORT '':'-:;,'.--

and its remaining economic life limited by advancing obsolescence.
The debtor would emerge from reorganization with an unsound and
unbalanced financial structure. The new bond issue would represent
92 percent of what the Commission found the going-concern value to
be and 65 percent of the total capitalization. The equity investment
of the Producers Group on the other hand would amount only to 7
percent of the total capitalization and less than 10 percent of what the
Commission found the going-concern value to be. In addition, the
bondholders would place the fate of the corporation in the hands of
the Producers Group under ~
 contract of questionable benefit, and
despite the conflicting interests of the Producers Group. The Commission concluded that the benefits to the bondholders were inadequate
to compensate them for the risks involved and that the proposed plan
created a situation similar to that condemned in Taylor v. Standard

Gas &; Electric 00.8
The Commission suggested three alternatives for the debtor: (1)
if continued operation were found desirable, there was nothing to
show that the debtor could not obtain the funds necessary, above the
amount of its own earnings, from banks, etc. (therefore the contribution of the Producers Group was not shown to be essential); (2) the
record showed interest in the debtor's property by other producers,
and out of such interest a satisfactory plan might develop; and (3)
if no reorganization could be effected on a fair and feasible basis, a
liquidation of the enterprise offered brighter prospects than liquidation at the end of the company's relatively short economic life,"
Ulen &; Oompany.-Both plans submitted in this case provided for
the liquidation of the company's assets. The debtor had outstanding
$4,306,185, principal and accrued interest, of 6 percent debentures;
an unsecured note of $67,524, including accrued interest; two series
of preferred stock; and some common stock. Thus the creditors'
claims amounted to $4,373,709. The trustee found the value of
debtor's assets to be $1,279,327; and tbe debenture holders' committee
set it at $2,969,350-both far below the amount of the creditors' claims.
The trustee's plan provided for the issuance of $800,000 of lO-year
6 percent cumulative income debentures, and 400 shares of new common stock. Each general creditor, including debenture holders,
would receive one $200 income debenture, and one share of stock for
each $1,000 of principal claim. After payment of expenses, etc., all
cash in the hands of the trustee would be distributed pro rata to the
creditors in final settlement of their claims for interest. Unpaid
interest on the new debentures would accumulate.
The debenture holder committee's plan differed in two important
respects. Instead of income debentures, it provided for $3,967,924.69
• 306 U. S. 307 •

• The plan proposed by the trustee was approved by the court on 1uly 16, 1941.

of unsecured liquidation certificates carrying interest at 6 percent, if
earned. The second basic difference was that whenever the net pro<leedsfrom the liquidation of assets amounted to $25,000, the board of
directors was required to apply 75 percent of such proceeds to the
retirement of liquidation certificates, either by purchase through
tenders or in the open market, and only in the event that retirement
of the liquidation certificates could not be effected through tender or
purchase would resort be made to pro rata distribution.
Under both plans the holders of the present preferred and common
stock were to receive no recognition.
The Commission found both plans fair in excluding stockholders
from participation, and thought both plans sound in their underlying
purpose to discontinue the business and liquidate. But on the score
of feasibility it was pointed out that in order to avoid the issuance of
deceptive securities, funded debt, even in a liquidation plan, should
bear such a relation to the value and nature of the company's assets
as to provide adequately for the payment of interest charges and the
ultimate repayment of the principal. Largely due to the fact that
many of debtor's investments were in foreign countries now involved
in the war, any income, therefrom was highly questionable. In the
view of the Commission, no appellation of the new company as a
Realization Corporation and no form of descriptive legend on the
proposed securities would adequately offset the misrepresentation
implicit in the promise of repayment of principal and the promise
ultimately to pay interest, in light of the high degree of uncertainty
attending these contingencies.
The Commission further noted that if the plan was to provide for
any funded debt, the pro rata method of distribution provided for
in the trustee's plan was preferable to retirement of "liquidation
certificates" by purchase either through tender or in the open market
as provided in the debenture holders' plan.
Mter the Commission had filed its advisory report the trustee filed
amendments to his plan, in which petition he was joined by the proponents of the altern-ative debenture holders' plan. The amended
plan 10 eliminated the provision for funded debt. The securities to
be issued under the plan consist solely of about 400,000 shares of
eommon stock, with a lO-cent par value, to be distributed to the
debtor's general creditors, including its debenture holders, at the rate
of 100 shares for each $1,000 in principal amount of creditors' claims.
The Commission approved the amended plan because, in providing
for the issuance solely of common stock, it eliminated the unsound
and misleading characteristics which would necessarily inhere in the
issues of funded debt originally proposed in this case.
If On July 8, 1941,Judge Goddard approved the trustee's amended plan and disapproved the debenture
.holders' oommlttee's alternative plan In accordance with the recommendation of the Commission.

SEVENTH ~AL

REPORT

McKesson &, Robbins, Inc.-The debtor was engaged in the manufacture and Nation-wide wholesale distribution of drugs and drug
sundries and liquor operating in 37 States and the Territory of Hawaii,
with net sales averaging well over $100,000,000 annually. Its president
and active directing head for the decade from its incorporation until
the filing of the petition for reorganization had been Phillip M.
Musics, alias F. Donald Coster, who committed suicide a week after
the commencement of the proceedings. Although Coster's notorious
frauds and depredations had resulted in his withdrawal of approximately $2,870,000 from the business and the inflation of reported
assets by some $21,000,000, the trustee's investigation disclosed that
his fraudulent activities had been wholly confined to the crude drug
department and to the Canadian subsidiary and did not pervade the
other departments of the business.
The Commission became e party to the proceedings on December
8, 1938, the same day that the voluntary petition for reorganization
was filed and William J. Wardell, the disinterested trustee, was
appointed.
Extensive investigations of the debtor's affairs were undertaken by
the trustee and his counsel and accountants, and detailed reports of
their findings were distributed to the company's security holders and
the parties to the proceedings in accordance with the provisions of
Section 167 of the Act. The facts disclosed by these inquiries enabled the trustee to assert very substantial claims against the debtor's
former directors, accountants, and others, and as a result more than
$2,500,000 in cash and property was recovered for the estate.
The submission of suggestions for plans of reorganization was invited by the trustee, and on November 7, 19:4:0,the trustee filed his
proposed plan of reorganization.
From time to time during the
interval between the filing of his plan and the court's submission
thereof to the Commission for advisory report on February 20, 1941,
numerous amendments were adopted by the trustee as the desirability
therefor was disclosed.
The plan, as finally proposed, provided for the payment in cash in
full of all priority debt. Interest on all other debt was also to be paid
in cash, and the principal amount of such other debt was to be paid
40 percent in cash, 40 percent in new 15-year 4 percent sinking fund
debentures, and 20 percent in new 5H percent cumulative redeemable
preferred stock. The plan provided also that the trustee was to
procure an underwriting for the new debentures and new preferred
stock otherwise issuable to creditors (to be underwritten by the
trustee) if this were possible upon terms to net the estate the par or face
value of these securities. In its advisory report the Commission
pointed out that the plan would appear to require creditors to accept
certain sacrifices (e. g., change of status from creditor to stockholder

PART ill-CORPORATE

REORGANIZATIONS

61

with respect to 20 percent of their claims, an extension of maturity
for 15 years of 40 percent thereof, and a reduction in the rate of return
upon their claims), but that in the event of an underwriting the plan
would nonetheless be fair to them since they would realize in cash the
full value of their claims with interest. It was pointed out further
in the report that even if no underwriting were possible, market
conditions then prevailing indicated that the debentures and preferred
stock provided for in the plan would sell at par or better, and thatif
such conditions continued to prevail without substantial change until
confirmation of the plan, the package of securities and cash allocable
to creditors would have an aggregate value equal to the full amoun t of
their claims with interest, and that in that event, the plan would also
provide full compensation to creditors. and would be fair and equitable
within the applicable judicial and statutory standards.
The report
contained the cautionary comment that there should be reserved for
further consideration what changes would be necessary in the plan in
order to give creditors full compensation for their claims, in the light
of the sacrifices imposed upon them by the plan, in the event that
market conditions at the time of confirmation of the plan would not
permit creditors to realize the full value of their claims.
The new debentures and preferred stock were in fact successfully
underwritten, and creditors were paid the principal and interest of
their claims in cash in full.
The trustees' plan was predicated upon an over-all value of the
debtor's estate of $76,900,000, of which approximately $16,900,000
was excess cash. After providing for the claims of creditors, an
equity of approximately $43,800,000 remained. Under the plan, this
equity was capitalized by the issuance of 1,685,901 shares of common
stock of a par value of $18 per share. The preference shareholders
were to receive about 81 percent of the new common stock,represcnting
in terms of the trustee's valuation $35,596,000. The Commission approved this allocation after concluding that the new securities were of
a value commensurate with the interest of the preferred shareholders.
The holders of the old common stock were allocated about 19 percent
of the new common stock. This was fair since the class was to receive
the full residual equity after no more than' equitable provision was
made for creditors and senior stockholders.
The Commission concluded that the new capital structure was
sound, that the working capital appeared to be sufficient, and that
the provisions respecting management and control were appropriate.
Therefore, it found the plan to be both equitable and feasible, and
recommended that it be approved. The plan was approved by the
court. Subsequently, several slight modifications were ratified by the
court to facilitate the underwriting of the securities.

REPORT

In December 1938, the Commission undertook an investigation of
the auditing practices followed by McKesson & Robbins and its accountants, and in December 1940, it issued its report thereon. In
this report 11 the Commission concluded that the general adoption of
changes in respect to the appointment of auditors and the determination and execution of the audit program would have a salutary effect
upon auditing practice in the United States, and suggested specific
procedures that appeared to have certain advantages over others
that had been proposed." Consistently with our general practice in
cases under Chapter X counsel for the Commission participated in
the preparation of the numerous documents required for the consummation of the plan and the launching of the reorganized McKesson
& Robbins, Inc., and the corporate by-laws finally adopted with the
approval of the court include provisions which carry fully into effect
the program suggested by the Commission.
APPEALS
Although the Commission may not appeal or file any petition for
appeal in a proceeding under Chapter X, it may appear-in proceedings
before the appellate court in the event that appeals are taken by other
parties in cases in which the Commission is participating.
Thus,
during the fiscal year the Commission participated as a party appellee
in 9 cases in the appellate courts. In 4 other cases the Commission
participated in appeals in reorganization proceedings as amicus curiae.
Of these 13 cases, 4 were before the Supreme Court of the United
States and the remaining 9 were before the circuit courts of appeals.
In 12 of the 13 cases the position urged by the Commission was upheld
by the courts; in 1 case the court decided adversely to the position of
the Commission.
Five of the appeals in which the Commission participated involved
questions dealing with allowances, and in all of them the position
urged by the Commission was sustained.
In the Matter oj Keystone Realty Holding Oompany.lS-In this case
the district court, in a Chapter X proceeding, granted to an attorney
for the debtor and an attorney representing a bondholder allowances
out of the debtor's estate as compensation for services rendered in
connection with a prior insolvency proceeding in the State court. On

appeal from the orders granting these allowances, the Commission
took the position that the District Judge had power under Section 258
to make allowances for services rendered in the prior proceeding but
that the Judge abused his discretion in making such allowance at this
particular stage of the proceeding.
The court sustained the position
of the Commission holding that it was an abuse of discretion for the
district court to direct payment of these allowances, even though for
completed work, where the ultimate success of the reorganization was
doubtful and the total amount to be available for allowances was not
known.
In re Mountain States Pouier Co.14-In this case the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of compensation or
reimbursement of expenses to a member of a committee, who was also
a member of a brokerage firm which, during the pendency of the
reorganization proceeding, purchased and sold securities of the debtor
for its own account.
The decision was predicated on the holding that,
as to allowances to persons in a fiduciary or representative capacity
who trade in securities of the debtor while acting in the proceeding, the
law applicable to proceedings under Section 77B was similar to
Section 249 of Chapter X, the latter being no more than a codification
of the existing law. The circuit court of appeals also held that the
allowances granted by the district court to certain other applicants
were so inadequate as to constitute an abuse of discretion and ordered
that the allowances to these applicants be increased.
In the matter of Porto Rican American TobaccoCompany!S-In this
case it was contended that since Section 206 of Chapter X accords the
debtor the right to be heard on all matters arising in a Chapter X
proceeding and Section 169 recognizes that the debtor may propose
plans or amendments thereto and submit objections to plans, it is
implicit in the statute that the debtor may be represented by an
attorney who shall be compensated out of the estate whether or not
his services were beneficial. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit rejected this contention, ruling that, in order to be
compensable, services performed by the attorney for a debtor must
be beneficial. Also, the court pointed out that where a trustee has
been appointed by the court and the trustee has his own attorney, if
an attorney for the debtor without prior court authority performs
legal services which fall within the scope of the administrative duties
of the trustee or his attorney, the attorney for the debtor must be
regarded as a volunteer and even if his services have been beneficial,
he may be denied compensation out of the estate.

investigate and study the debtor's lease situation, was denied com":
pcnsation out of the estate for his services by the district court. On
appeal from the denial of compensation, the Commission urged in
support of affirmance of the district, court order that the appellant
was not entitled to compensation since he had failed to establish
that his services were necessary, non-duplicative, and beneficial.
The circuit court of appeals affirmed the order of the district court
on the ground (1) that there was no clear evidence that the services
were beneficial, and (2) that the services of the appellant in examining
leases 'were administrative services such as the debtor in possession
or the trustee was charged with the duty of performing in connection
with the administration of the estate and that the appellant who
acted without prior court authorization cannot recover from the
estate for such services.
In the Matter oj Balfour Manor Apartments Gompany.-An order
was entered by the district court granting allowances. Subsequently
the district court directed that a rehearing be held for the reconsideration of its prior order. Without making any mention of this
order for rehearing, one of the applicants filed a petition for leave
to appeal from the original order of the district court with respect
to allowances. The petition was granted and the appeal allowed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on May 10,
1941. The Commission moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground
that there was no final order from which an appeal would lie. On
October 14, 1941, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
entered an order granting the motion of the Commission to dismiss
the appeal.
"Deep Rock Oil" cases.-Three briefs were filed on behalf of the
Commission in connection with further controversies which arose
out of the same reorganization proceeding which was before the
Supreme Court in the so-called "Deep Rock" case," One of these
briefs was presented to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit and the other two were presented to the Supreme Court. In
the "Deep Rock" case, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit which
had affirmed orders of the district court confirming a plan of reorganization for Deep Rock Oil Corporation.
The Supreme Court disapproved the plan because of the participation accorded to the claims
of Standard Gas & Electric Company, the parent of the debtor, Deep
Rock Oil Corporation. The Court held that the abuses in the management of Deep Rock by Standard required that Standard's claim as
a creditor be subordinated to the interests of the debtor's preferred
stockholders.
Upon the return of the case to the district court,
Standard filed an amended claim and petitioned for its allowance. The
court decreed that Standard's claim was subordinate to the claims

and interests of all other creditors and of the preferred stockholders'.
Since the value of the debtor's assets was less than the amount of these
prior claims and interests, the court held that Standard's claim was
riot entitled to participation, whatever its amount. Hence the court
refused to allow the amended claim. From this decree of the district
court, Standard appealed to the circuit court of appeals, which affirmed
the decree. IS Standard then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to
review the decision of the circuit court of appeals. In the brief presented to the Supreme Court on behalf of the Commission in opposition to the petition for the writ of certiorari, it was urged that the
district court properly construed the mandate of the Supreme Court
and that its decree followed inevitably from the requirement of subordination directed by the Supreme Court and from the application
to the case. of well-settled principles of law. The Supreme Court
denied Standard's petition for a writ of oertiorari:" Thereafter, the
district court approved the plan, which excluded Standard from participation, and after acceptance by the security holders, confirmed the
plan on July 24, 1940. Standard appealed from the orders of approval
and confirmation and the appeals were consolidated. The Commission and the other appellees filed a brief urging that the circuit court
of appeals dismiss Standard's appeal or affirm the orders appealed
from. The circuit court of appeals in a unanimous opinion affirmed 20
the orders of the district court. Again Standard petitioned for a
writ of certiorari to review the decision of the circuit court of appeals.
In the brief filed on behalf of the Commission, it was urged that the
petition be denied on the ground that this second petition for a
writ of certiorari was in effect an attempt to secure review by the
Supreme Court of questions which the Court had refused to review
when it denied the Standard's earlier petition for certiorari. Oil
April 14, 1941, the-Supr-eme Court-denied the petition.
In the Matter of American Fuel and Power 00., Inland Gas Oorporation, Kentucky Fuel Gas Oorporation.-In this case the district 'court
approved a proposed settlement whereby Columbia Gas & ElectricCorp., the parent company, would surrender its bonds, debentures, and
stockholdings of the debtor companies in exchange for a substantial
cash payment and release from pending lawsuits brought by the
trustee against Columbia for violation of the anti-trust laws. J t
uncontroverted that the material facts of Columbia's misconduct as
alleged in the anti-trust suits were provable, and although the district
court assumed the truth of the allegations it approved the settlement
on the theory- that substantial doubt existed as to whether Cohimbia's securities might not nevertheless be entitled to parity treatment
with those held by the public. On appeal to the Circuit- Court of

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

Appeals for the Sixth Circuit by two committees representing public
investors, the Commission contended (1) that without regard to the
adequacy of the assumed facts as a good cause of action under the
anti-trust laws they were adequate to establish a breach of fiduciary
obligations owing by Columbia to the debtors and other holders of
the debtors' securities; (2) that on the basis of such assumed facts
and under equitable principles announced by the Supreme Court
in Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric 00., 306 U. S. 307 (1939), Pepper
v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295 (1939), and other recent cases, Columbia's
.claims were required as a matter of law to be ranked subordinate to
other claims, in which event its claims would be admittedly worthless
and .their surrender would constitute no consideration for the settlement; and (3) that the proposed settlement should therefore have been
rejected and the issue of subordination tried on the facts. In an
opinion rendered August 15, 1941 the Circuit Court of Appeals, on a
somewhat different rationale, reversed "the order approving the settlement and directed the district court to reject all of Columbia's claims
and interests which should be found to have been acquired in violation
of the anti-trust laws.
In connection with appeals in four reorganizations, the Commission obtained leave to file briefs as amicus curiae because of the
significance of the issues involved. Two of the briefs were presented
to tb.e Supreme Court and two to the circuit court of appeals.
In the Matter oj Julius Roehrs 00mpany.2L-The debtor filed a
petition under Chapter X. The district court, by order, directed the
debtor to file its plan of reorganization within 5 days and to offer
proof for the purpose of demonstrating its good faith and its ability
to carry out its plan. The debtor filed a tentati ve plan of reorganization and a hearing was held. The court was not satisfied that the
petition was filed in good faith and dismissed it. An appeal was
taken by the debtor.
Pursuant to leave granted by the circuit court
of appeals, the Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae in which it
urged that the district court was in error when it required the debtor
to, file, its. plan and prove its ability to 'Consummate' this plan as a
prerequisite to approval of the petition,
The circuit court of 'appeals
ruled that the district court had applied an erroneous test of good
faith, reversed the order dismissing the petition, and remanded the
proceedings.
111. the Motter of 11 West 4200 Street, Inc.22-This appeal raised a
procedural question. Because the problem was of general application
under Chapter X the Commission, although not a party to the proceedings below, obtained leave to submit a brief as, amicus curiae.

motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, since that procedure is inconsistent with the
procedural provisions of Chapter X which relate to summarv determination of factual issues arising out of a petition for reorganization.
The court ruled adversely to the position urged by the Commission.
Oase v. Jenney, In the ¥atter of Los Angeles Lumber Products
Oompany, Ltd.23-This
controversy arose in the same proceeding
which was before the Supreme Court in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber
Products 00., Ltd.,24 discussed in the Commission's Sixth Annual
Report." After the remand of the cause to the district court in
conformity with the opinion and decree of the Supreme Court, a
new plan of reorganization for the debtor was formulated and confirmed by the district court. Under this plan the assets of the debtor
were to be transferred to a new corporation which would issue 859,628
shares of $1 par value common stock. The stock to be issued was
to be distributed only to bondholders of the debtor and represented
the entire capitalization of the new corporation. Upon a finding
that the debtor was insolvent, the stockholders of the debtor were
excluded from all participation in the plan. Thomas K. Case, an
appellant in Oase v. Los Angeles Lumber Products 00., Ltd., supra,
filed objection to the new plan. His objections were overruled. He
then filed with the Supreme Court a motion for leave to file a petition
for writ of mandamus or prohibition on the ground that the new plan
was not fair and equitable and the order of the district court confirming it failed to comply with the mandates of the Supreme Court.
The Commission presented to the Supreme Court a memorandum in
opposition to the motion in which it took the position that the amended
plan did not contravene the mandate of the Supreme Court. On
October 14, 1940, the Supreme Court denied the motion.

reversing an order of the district court confirming a plan of reorganization of the debtor and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries. On March
3,1941, the Supreme Court rendered its opinion affirming the decision
of the circuit court of appeals. The Commission, as amicus curiae,
submitted a memorandum urging that the petition for certiorari be
granted, and a brief in which it urged the affirmance of the decision
of the circuit court of appeals which had reversed the order confirming

ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935deals with holding
companies having subsidiaries which are electric utility companies
or which are engaged in the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas. The Act was passed for the express purpose of eliminating certain evils and abuses which the Congress had found to exist in
connection with the activities of such companies, and was intended
for the protection of both investors and consumers. It provides for
the registration of holding companies; elimination of uneconomic
holding company structures; supervision of security transactions
of holding companies and their subsidiaries; supervision of acquisitions of securities and utility assets by holding companies and their
subsidiaries; and the supervision of payment of dividends, solicitation of proxies, inter-company loans, and service, sales, and
construction contracts.
The Commission must pass upon plans for
the reorganization of registered holding companies or their subsidiaries, and must require the geographic and corporate simplification of public utility holding company systems. The Commission
does not have the power to regulate public utility rates.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The past fiscal year has witnessed important developments in
both the activities of and the problems confronting the Commission in
its administration of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
Substantial advances have been made during this period in securing
compliance by the major holding-company systems with the integration and simplification provisions of the Act. Further progress has
also been achieved in improving the financial structure of companies
in holding-company systems, as an incident to the exercise of jurisdiction over security issues and of control over dividend policies and
intercompany payments.
Other important developments have included the requirement of competitive bidding in connection with
sales of securities subject to the provisions of the Act, and the requirements, pursuant to Section 13, that holding companies pay the entire
salary expenses of such of their officers as are also officers of service
companies and of operating companies. In addition, there has been
complete revision of the rules and regulations of the Commission
under the Act.
As of June 30, 1941, there were registered with the Commission,
pursuant to the provisions of the Act, _147.public-utility holding

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

companies, the total consolidated assets of which amount to $15,129,000,000. These 147 registered holding companies constitute 53
public-utility holding-company systems, which include 1,457 holding,
subholding, and operating companies. Since the total assets of the
privately owned electric and gas utility industry (including natural
gas) are estimated to be approximately $22,000,000,000, the assets of
registered public-utility holding-company systems represent about 68
percent of the total private industry. Prior to the end of the fiscal
year, the defens-eprogram had already reached the point where expansion of power supply facilities was recognized to be of vital importance,
This aspect of the program has received increasing impetus in subsequent months. Our Commission has collaborated with other Government agencies interested in this program, our contribution being primarily related to the financial aspects of that portion of the program
which involves new construction by registered holding companies
and their subsidiaries.
The operating companies in registered holding-company systems
constitute a large proportion of the industry affected by the program.
Over 70 percent of the total additions to steam capacity included in
recent estimates as to requirements for the years 1943 to 1946, inclusive, were tentatively assigned to the areas served by these companies.
We have been closely following the plans for expansion of power
supply facilities in an effort to determine the amount which the various
companies subject to the Act may be called upon to spend for new
construction; to determine how much cash individual companies and
holding-company systems as groups can generate from their own
operations, i. e., the sum of the earnings available after meeting their
obligations to security holders and the non-cash items in their expense
accounts, such as provisions for amortization and depreciation.
These studies make it possible to anticipate demands for raising
additional capital and to study in advance the problems which this
will involve. It is, of course, of paramount importance that funds be
r..na4~available just as soon, as called for by the construction progr.a1U,
but by advance planning, it should be possible to make a wise choice
among alternative methods of financing with a view to preserving the
financial integrity of the companies subject to the Act, keeping them
in the best possible position to meet any future wartime demands,
and leaving them in the best possible position to meet the shock of
readjustment to a peacetime economy. With these considerations in
mind, our studies are directed to the amounts which the individual
companies and the holding-company groups could safely raise through
bonds, short-term notes, and preferred stocks, and the balance that
must be provided from some form of'm equity investment'.
. Although there is necessarily some uncertainty as to the ultimate
expansion of electric utility facilities, it does appear certain that, for

PART !V-PUBLIC

UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

71

:several years at least, increases in generating capacity will be limited
-only by the ability of manufacturers to produce the essential equipment. While 'a substantial portion of the new generating facilities
presumably will be in hydroelectric projects financed by the Federal
'Government, the private electric utilities will be called upon to
make capital expenditures not only for steam generating facilities,
.but also for related additions to transmission and distribution facilities.
The aggregate cost will be far in excess of what the utilities have
been expending on new construction in recent years. In fact, during
the years from 1933 to 1940, comparatively little new capital has been
raised by the electric utility industry from the sale of securities. Construction expenditures have been financed in large part from earnings.
This was possible partly because of the slowing up of the growth of
power demand in the early years of the depression, and partly because
construction in the years immediately preceding the depression had
been in advance of immediate demands for energy. Both of these
factors have diminished in importance in recent years and, when the
demands of the defense program are added to the normal growth in
power demand, it becomes clear that the industry is confronted with a
problem of raising and conserving cash in an amount far in excess of
what has been called for by the pre-war economy. Providing these
facilities is of paramount importance and this, of course, means that
such construction must be financed. This will ptoY<l no easy chalIenge-e-and it is possible that some Federal aid may be necessary.
As to the ability of the industry to meet this challenge, it must be
remembered that in the heyday of the promotion of ever greater
holding-company systems, the operating companies were bled. In
many instances depreciation accruals were inadequate and capital
was paid out as dividends in the guise of income, while at the same
time the companies were subjected to ever increasing burdens in the
form of debt and other senior securities and in some instances exorbitant or unearned charges for so-called service or management fees.
Moreov-er, the complicated holding-company
structure which was
~up'eriIhItoS'ed ''lias proven ill-equipped to meet .the .nieds of the subsidiaries for-equity money.
In some instances, despite the upward
flow of dividends to holding companies, there are still large arrearages
of dividends on holding-company
preferred stocks which, until
eliminated, are virtually an insuperable obstacle to holding-company
financing.

construction has related primarily to the following espeets of administration of the Act:
1. Enforcement of Section 11 (b) (1) to the end that there may be
greater progress toward the integration of the industry along logical
regional lines, and that managerial responsibility may gravitate away
from one or two financial centers toward the territories served.
2. Elimination of unnecessary complications 'in the financial structure of holding companies, in accordance with Section 11 (b) (2),
so as to remove present-day obstacles to the raising of additional
capital.
Compliance with the integration and corporate simplification standards of the Act are interrelated since, in many instances
as the holding companies reconcile themselves to the narrowing of the
area of their operations, they will find that the same transaction
which accomplishes a divestment of a non-retain able subsidiary may
also be a step in corporate simplification.
For example, the holding
company's interest in such a subsidiary may be exchanged for its
own outstanding senior securities, or the cash proceeds from the sale
of certain of their holdings can be used to reduce their top-heavy
debt structures, or can be a basis for additional equity investment in
other subsidiaries which require strengthening.
3. Increasing emphasis on requiring more adequate provisions for
depreciation and more conservative dividend policies so as to preserve
available cash in the operating companies, and to minimize the necessity to seek outside sources of additional capital.
What, if any,
change in emphasis may result from the transition from preparation
for war to actual entry into the war cannot now be predicted.
It
would seem obvious, however, that there can be no slackening in the
effort to put the industry in a financial position to meet whatever
demands may be placed upon it. It is significant in that connection
that in the first three weeks after the outbreak of war, a number of
companies have ..been pressing forward to avail themsslvea of the
machinery provided in the Act for effectuating voluntary compliance
with the provisions of Section 11.
Each of the above aspects of Commission activity are discussed in
separate sections of this report.
INTEGRATION AND CORPORATE SIMPLIFICATION OF PUBLIC-UTILITY
HOLDING.COMPANY SYSTEMS

The past fiscal year has been one of very substantial progress in the
geographical integration and corporate simplification of public-utility
holding-company systems required by Section 11 (b) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

tunity to take voluntary steps to comply with Section 11, which
opportunity was unfortunately neglected in favor of costly litigation
directed against the. constitutionality of the Act. After the termination of the period of litigation by the decision of the Supreme Court
in March 1938, upholding the constitutionality
of the registration
provisions, the Commission gave all holding companies a further
opportunity to submit to the Commission their plans for voluntary
compliance.
Most of the plans submitted, however, although helpful
in some respects, amounted to little more than arguments attempting
to justify the retention of the existing scattered holdings.
It finally became evident that compliance with the Act could be
achieved only by the institution of affirmative proceedings, pursuant
to the statutory direction in Section 11 (b). Accordingly in the spring
of 1940, as reported in our last Annual Report 1 the Commission instituted integration proceedings with respect to nine major utility holdingcompany systems and corporate simplification proceedings with
respect to three major systems. In the past fiscal year a number of
additional proceedings were instituted principally to effect compliance
with the corporate simplification standards of Section 11 (b) (2). The
two classes of proceedings are interrelated, in that action taken to
comply with the geographical standards may also be a step toward
achieving corporate simplification, and steps taken in the direction of
corporate simplification may serve to eliminate substantial problems
which would otherwise require determination in proceedings under
Section 11 (b) (1). At the close of the fiscal year, proceedings involving
integration or corporate simplification, or both, were pending with
respect to the 14 holding-company systems named below, which
systems had consolidated assets .aggregating $10,219,000,000, or 67
percent of the consolidated assets of all registered holding-company
systems: 2

SEVENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

The heads of some of the largest holding-company systems havestated publicly to their security holders that the enforcement of
Section 11 will not prejudice their interests. William G. Woolfolk,
president of The United Light and Power Company, in April 1941,
reported to his security holders:
"In the rearrangement of properties by way of compliance with the Act, we
have noted no indication that the regulatory authorities will be other than helpful
in protecting the investor, and out of what must now seem to you a complex
and nebulous situation, your management foresees in the reasonably near future
the emergence of a company which, though smaller perhaps, will be in every way
creditable.
To this end we are bending our every effort."

Leo T. Crowley, chairman of the board and president of Standard
Gas and Electric Company, in a message to his stockholders, in March
1941 stated:
"The management of your Company has continued to devote its attention tothe two major problems affecting the Company; namely, ipt'1~~Hon ~d reeapitalization. The solution of these problems has been viewed not merely as a means
of compliance with the requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, with which they are so often associated in the public mind, but also as a
necessary and practical treatment of obvious corporate needs. The two problems
might well be classed as one in view of their equal importance from many standpoints. The method of solution of the first-integration-seems
to present the
only feasible way of meeting the second."
(Italics supplied.)

A number of factors prompt increasing compliance with Section 11.
There is an increasing necessity, largely rising out of National defense
requirements, of securing funds for the financing of new construction.
There are concrete indications that many holding companies, particularly in scattered systems, actually block needed operating company
financing. Thus, holding companies, desirous of retaining control of
operating companies, refuse to permit the-operating .company to issue
common stock in situations where common stock can be sold on
favorable terms and where further debt or preferred stock financing is
inappropriate.
Moreover, their policies of inadequate depreciation
and excessive dividends have taken away many millions of dollars
from operating companies which should have been used for new plant
construction.
The difficulties of financing essential power expansion under present
holding-company control-where the holding company is unable to
raise the money itself and where its control of the operating company
is an obstacle to the latter's financing-has thus accelerated a realization of the need for the severance of such control. An independent
operating company is in a position to make 'its own dooisien"as to its
depreciation and dividend policies and as to the form of security most
appropriate for the financing of its needs. It may issue common
stock-a source of funds generally closed to the operating subsidiaries
of holding-companies. Moreover, the remaining properties of the

PART IV-PUBLIC

UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

75

holding-company system which may be retained under Section 11
frequently benefit materially from the sale of outlying system properties. Thus, the present emergency and the need for rapid expansion
of the Nation's power resources have served to reinforce the desirability of a rapid compliance with Section 11.
There is also a growing recognition in financial circles and among
investors that many holding companies are a source of economic
loss to investors. Senior security holders in many holding companies-holders of debentures and preferred stock-especially have
indicated their views in this respect and, in some cases, are organizing
to protect their interests. Superfluous holding companies merely
serve to reduce the return on the common stock investment in operating companies-the
liberal holding company salaries, additional
Federal and State taxes, and all the other heavy expenses of running
the holding company, are items deducted before the investor in the
holding company secures any return. Studies of independent statistical agencies indicate that the Itbreakup" value of many holding
companies is greater than the present market value of their outstanding securities. In other words, the market appears to consider such
holding companies (with their heavy expenses and taxes) and the
holding-company management to be liabilities rather than assets.
That the provisions of Section 11 are not to be applied indiscriminutoly as a "death sentence," but with full regard to the protection
of investors, is well illustrated in the proceeding with respect to The
North American Company system. While that proceeding was pending before the Commission for decision, North American Light & Power Company, a subholding company in The North American
Company system controlling numerous subsidiary public-utility operating companies and a party to the integration proceeding, announced
its intention to liquidate and dissolve. In a letter to its security
holders, the company stated that such action was being taken in
anticipation of the Commission's decision in the pending proceeding;
that upon liquidation of the company its preferred stockholders would
not receive their full preferential amount of $152.50 a share, which
included dividend arrears of $52.50 a share; and that accordingly, the
common stockholders would receive nothing. It was also stated that
The North ~erican
Company, the top holding company, owning 44
percent of the preferred stock, 85 percent of the common stock, and
62 percent of the outstanding debentures, had indicated its intention
to vote its shares in favor of the dissolution and liquidation which
was proposed to be accomplished under the aegis of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware. The company did not propose
to submit the plan of liquidation to the Commission as appeared to
be required by the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935.

76

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

The Commission informed the company of its doubts as to the
propriety and validity of the contemplated procedure. After efforts
to evolve a satisfactory solution failed, the Commission was forced to
institute proceedings and enter an order forbidding The North American Company and North American Light & Power Company from
taking steps to dissolve the latter except in accordance with appropriate orders of the Commission. In its opinion 3 the Commission
stated that, in the integration proceeding pending before it for decision, there were numerous questions present involving North American Light & Power Company and its subsidiaries, as well as other
subsidiaries of The North American Company, the proper disposition
of which might be- thwarted if the liquidation and dissolution of the
company took place before such questions were decided. It was
pointed out that in the case of a voluntary as well as an involuntary
liquidation of a company in a holding-company system, or where the
voluntary action was taken for the stated purpose of complying with
the integration provisions of Section 11, the Commission was charged
with specific administrative duties which were designed, among other
things, to protect the scattered public security holders of the company
against the concentrated power of a holding company possessing, as
in the instant case, absolute voting control.
It was therefore the Commission's position that, before the company could dissolve and liquidate its assets in the manner proposed,
Section 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 required not only that the Commission be permitted to consider the
effect of such action on the pending Section 11 (b) (1) proceeding, but
also that it be permitted to determine whether the proposed manner
of liquidation was fair and equitable to the security holders affected
thereby; including a consideration under the applicable precedents of
the treatment to be accorded The North American Company which,
as a dominant stockholder of North American Light & Power Company, had acquired senior securities of the latter company at prices
substantially below their face amount.
After the entry of the above order the companies would not assure
the Commission that its order would be obeyed. Consequently, the
Commission filed suit in the United States District Court of Delaware
to insure compliance with its order. This suit is described on page
206. infra. 4
The Commission's opinions during the past year have clarified most
of the interpretative problems arising under Section 11 (b). The deITn tho MaUer 0/ Th. North. Amorican Oompan/l and It. Subridiar/l Oompanlt8, Holding Company Act

terminations of the Commission, tentative and final, are discussed
separately in relation to Sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2).
Section 11 (b) (I)-Integration.

The opinion of the Commission in The United Gas Improvement
Company and its Subsidiary Companies 6 clarified several important
interpretative issues raised by the respondents. The Commission
interpreted the portion of Section 11 (b) (1) relating to "interests in
other businesses" and pointed out the specific statutory standards
which holding companies must meet to retain interests in other
businesses, including investment interests in utilities not subsidiaries
of the holding company. The Commission also reaffirmed its earlier
decision in Columbia Gas &: Electric Corporation 6 that gas and electric utility companies cannot be considered as together constituting a
."single integrated public-utility system" within the meaning of the
Act. Thus a holding company must satisfy the requirements prescribed by Congress for the retention of additional systems if it desires
to retain both an electric and gas utility system.
In a later decision in The United Gas Improvement Company proceeding 7 the Commission, having taken complete evidence as to
the status of many of the scattered subsidiary utility properties and
having given the companies concerned full opportunity to be heard,
ordered the divestiture of such properties from the system. Despite
the respondents' contention to the contrary, the Commission held
that the statute permitted it to order such evolutionary adjustments
prior to its final decision on the system or systems retainable; and that
such progressive orders of divestiture resulted in the most expeditious
solutions of problems arising under the Act and enabled a more
orderly trial of the remaining issues with consequent savings in time
and expense to the company and to the Government.
In a subsequent case, Engineers Public Service Company and its
Subsidiary Companies,s the Commission's opinion settled the most.
important interpretative issue arising under Section 11 (b) (1). The
company had contended that it was not precluded under clause (B)
of Section 11 (b) (1) from having one integrated system in Virginia and
States adjoining Virginia, and another in Texas and States adjoining
Texas. Interpreting clause (B) in the light of its legislative history,
and in the light of other provisions of the statute, the Commission
concluded that additional systems are retainahle under clause (B)
only if they are located in the State or States in which the principal
system operates or in States adjoining thereto .

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

The Commission further held in this case that it will require a complete disposition of all interests by a holding company in a controlled
subsidiary and will not permit the holding company to retain a so-called
"investment interest" through which the holding company might continue to exert influence.
Status of Major Integration Proceedings.

The following description of the status of the major integration
proceedings instituted by the Commission indicates the extent of the
progress made at the close of the fiscal year in complying with the
requirements of Section 11 (b) (1).
Electric Bond and Share Oompany.-Tne
Commission instituted
Section 11 (b) (1) proceedings directed against the Electric Bond and
Share system on February 28, 1940. The subsequent Section 11 (b) (2),
or corporate simplification proceedings, indicated that progress in
eliminating the innumerable corporate complexities of the system
would facilitate securing compliance with the integration requirements
of the Act. As a consequence, the integration proceeding has been
held somewhat in abeyance pending progress in the corporate simplification proceedings.
During the year, National Power & Light Company, a major subholding company of the Electric Bond and Share system, filed with
the Commission an application to exchange the common stock: of
Houston Lighting & Power Company for the outstanding preferred
stock of National. This plan is advanced as a step in the prospective
dissolution of National Power & Light Company, consonant with the
objectives of the pending 11 (b) (2) proceeding.
Oities Service Oompany and Odiee Service Power &: Light Oompany.In March 1940 the Commission instituted an integration proceeding
against Cities Service Power & Light Company and its subsidiary
companies. Extensive public hearings were held intermittently up
to June 23, 1941, at which time the record was closed. The company
has accepted the Commission's interpretation of Section 11(b) (1) (B)
and is making no claim that it can retain control of more than one of
its large group of properties.
On June 3, 1941 the Commission instituted a similar proceeding
directed against Cities Service Company. Shortly thereafter, Cities
Service Company and Cities Service Power & Light Company filed an
application under Section 11 (e) covering a plan for the divestment of
Cities Service interests ill its principal utility holding company subsidiary. The plan calls for the organization of three regional holding
companies, one owning the securities now owned by Cities Service
Power & Light Company in the Rocky Mountain area, another owning
the securities now owned by Cities Service Power & Light in Ohio,
and a third owning the securities now owned by Cities Service Power
& Light Company in midwestern and southwestern States. It is

PART IV-PUBi;:tc-~iJTILrry

HOLDING COMPANYACT OF 1935

79

proposed -that the common stock in the three new regional corporations will be offered in exchange to holders of the preferred stocks of
Cities Service Company. This plan is presently pending before the
Commission for approval.
The Oommonwealth &: Southern Oorporotion.-The
Commission
instituted 'integration proceedings against The Commonwealth &
Southern Corporation system on March 6, 1940. After the institution
of the proceedings, the company requested the Commission to indicate its tentative views on the system's status under Section l1(b) (1).
This request was granted and tentative views were released.
Because of the interrelationships of the geographical simplification
requirements (in Section 11(b) (1)) and the corporate simplification
requirements (in Section l1(b) (2)), the Commission, shortly after
issuing the statement of tentative conclusions, instituted proceedings
under Section 11(b) (2). In these proceedings the question was
raised as to whether the holding company should not reduce itself to
a single class of stock. Hearings proceeded in both cases. On June
20, 1941, the Commission, in an opinion holding that valuation testimony would-not be received prior to determining whether a one-stock
order should be entered, held that, under Clause (B) of Section 11(b)
(1), the northern and the southern properties of The Commonwealth
:& Southern Corporation could not be retained in the same holdingcompany system. It is anticipated that after the decision on the
one-stock order question, further hearings will be held and appropriate
orders entered in the Section l1(b) (1) proceedings.
Engineers Public Service Oompany.-The
Commission instituted
integration proceedings against the Engineers Public Service system in
February 1940. In response to a request by respondents for a tentative statement of the Commission's views as to the system's status
under Section 11(b)(I), tentative conclusions were released by the
'Commission. Hearings were held and the Commission, shortly after
the end of the fiscal year, issued its findings and opinion clarifying the
status of the system under Section 11(b) (1).9 The Commission determined that two subsidiaries of Engineers- Virgmie Electric and
Power Company and Gulf States Utilities Company-each constitute
a single integrated public-utility system and that either of them may
be retained by Engineers as its principal system under Section 11(b)
(1). In deciding that Engineers could not retain both of these systems, the Commission made the important interpretative decision
as to the scope of Clause (B) of Section l1(b) (1) which has been
referred to above.
At the close of "the fiscal year, the case was pending for the introduction of further evidence and resolution of the remaining issues •

ANNUAL

REPORT

The Middle West Oorporation.-The Commission instituted Section
11 (b) (1) proceedings on March 1, 1940 against The Middle West
Corporation and its 49 utility subsidiaries, which operate electric
facilities in 16 States and gas facilities in 12 States and 40 non-utility
subsidiaries.
The integration hearings are now virtually completed. The answerfiled by The Middle West Corporation in the proceedings proposed a.
"plan" for the retention of the system's southwestern and northern
"groups" of properties and the disposition of approximately $100,.
000,000 of miscellaneous scattered companies. The company's
claim for retention of the widely scattered southwestern and northern
properties is based upon the "two-area" construction of Section
11 (b) (1) (B) which has been rejected by the Commission as an
improper construction of the Act.
During the past year or more, in compliance with Section 11 (b),
Middle West has taken the following' steps: .It- has-disposed of its
interests in Missouri Public Service Corporation; Central Power
Corporation, its subsidiary, sold substantially all of its assets to a
public power district; Northwestern Public Service Company, an
indirect subsidiary, sold a portion of its assets to a public power
district. Middle West also has a pending application to sell its interests in Albion Gas Light Company and Michigan Gas and Electric
Company.
The North American Oompany.-The Commission instituted integration proceedings against The North American Company and its
subsidiaries on March 8, 1940. Extensive hearings were held, and
a full record was developed as to the operating characteristics and
relationships within the holding-company system. The North American Company early eonceded that it was necessary for it to dispose
of its interests in the District of Columbia group of properties, controlled through its subholding company, Washington Railway and
Electric Company. Consequently, North American has reduced its
interest in these properties by paying out in common stock dividends
participating units in its holdings in Washington Railway and Electric
Company. North American has also liquidated some of its holdings
in its subsidiary, Detroit Edison Company, by paying common stock
dividends in Detroit Edison stock. The cash conserved as a result
of paying dividends in kind has been used to retire holding company
debentures and to make further investments in other operating properties.
The integration hearings were closed on April 15, 1941, briefs were
filed, and arguments were held before the Commission on the remaining issues' in the proceeding. The case is now pending before th:e
Commission for decision.

Standard Power and Lighi Oorpora:lionand Standard Gas and Electric
Oompany.-The
Commission instituted Section 11 (b) (1) proceedings
in regard to Standard Power and Light Corporation, Standard Gas
and Electric Company, and their subsidiaries on March 6, 1940.
"The answer filed by Standard Gas and Electric Company indicated
that Standard Gas proposed to take certain major steps in order to
'COmplywith the integration requirements of the Act. Thereafter,
conferences-wereelreld-between
representatives- of the-company and
the staff -of the Commission in which the proposals of Standard Gas
were thoroughly discussed. After these discussions, the Commission
was advised by Standard Gas that it proposed to dispose of all of its
interests except the common stock of Philadelphia Company, which
operates in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Shortly thereafter, hearings were held on the issues of the case as
framed by the Commission's Notice of and Order for Rearing and the
Respondents' answer. In accordance with the position taken by
the company, the Commisson, shortly after the close of the fiscal
year, ordered Standard Gas and Electric Company to dispose of all
of its utility properties, with the exception of Philadelphia Company
and its subsidiaries. The Commission concluded that the properties
of Duquesne Light Company, a subsidiary of Philadelphia Company,
constituted an integrated public-utility system within the meaning
of Section 2- (a~ (29f (A), but the Commission mad~ no finding as to
the gas properties of Philadelphia Company and its subsidiaries and
as to the Philadelphia- Company's non-utility interests."
These
matters are reserved for future hearings and decision.
The United Gas Improvement Oompany.-The
United Gas Improvement Company controls approximately 38 utility subsidiaries which
operate electric facilities in 10 States, gas facilities in 5 States, and
approximately 41 non-utility subsidiaries.
The Commission instituted integration proceedings against The
United Gas Improvement Company and its subsidiaries on March 4,
194:0: _SubljeqnentJy,' the, respondents requested tpe Commission to
furnish them its tentative conolusions as to the system's status under
Section 11 -'(b') (I). The Commission granted the request, and on
June 18, 1941 issued its statement of tentative conclusions.
Following a tentative conclusion by the Commission that The
United Gas Improvement Company could not retain its interests in
the Connecticut Light and Power Company under the integration
standards of the Act, The United Gas Improvement Company sold its
stock holdings in the Connecticut Company in a successful offering

_ SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

On April 15, 1941, the Commission entered an order requiring that
U. G. I. divest itself of certain scattered utility interests which it was
found, on the basis of the record made, did not meet the standards
of Section 11 (b) (I)." Thereafter, in response to a petition for rehearing filed by the company, the Commission suspended the effectiveness
of the order requiring divestment.
Additional evidence was introduced, additional briefs were filed, and further argument was held.
The matter is presently pending before the Commission for decision. 12
There is presently pending before the Commission for decision the
question of whether The United Gas Improvement Company may
retain its interests in the electric utility assets of Luzerne County
Gas & Electric Corporation and the transportation assets of Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company. Further hearings will be held
to obtain evidence as to the status of other outlying properties and
investments.
The United Light and Power Oompany.-The
Commission instituted
integration proceedings directed against The United Light and Power
Company system on March 8,1940. Subsequent thereto, The United
Light and Power Company and its subsidiaries requested that they
be furnished with the Commission's tentative views with respect to
what action the Commission tentatively believed would be required
by Section 11 (b) (1).of the Act. On the basis of further examination
of the problems of this holding-company: system, the Commission concluded that achievement of the objectives of Section 11 would best be
promoted by the taking of concurrent action under Section 11 (b) (2)
requiring corporate simplification of holding companies.
Such
proceedings were therefore instituted, as a result of which an order
was entered on March 20,1941, directing the dissolution of The United
Light and Power Company, the top holding company of the system,
and the dissolution of United American Company, an intermediate
holding company.
Subsequently, during June 1941 the Commission issued its tentative conclusions under Section 11 (b) (1) and consolidated the proceedings under Sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2). After opportunity
for hearing, a final order was issued under Section 11 (b) (1), directing
the elimination from the holding-company system of a very substantaal
portion of its properties, including those operating in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, West VIrginia, and Texas.
This order was based
primarily on the applicability of Clause (B) of Section 11 (b) (1) to the
entire system. The far-flung operations of the system could not, of
course, be held to comply with the geographical limitations composed

by Congress under that clause and the order therefore required
extensive dispositions of outlying properties of the top holding and
subholding companies. The Commission also reaffirmed earlier
opinions to the effect that a holding company must "dispose of its
"investment interests" in non-controlled public-utility companies
where such" interests are not reasonably incidental or economically
necessary or appropriate to the operations of the system's integrated
public-utility systems. Jurisdiction was reserved to determine issues
remaining under Sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2), among which
questions are whether remaining properties can be kept under the
provisions of (A) and (C) of Section 11 (b) (1).
Section 11 (b) (2)-Corporate

Simplification.

The United Light and Power Oompany 13 involved a system containing 5 tiers of companies. It included 8 companies which were
holding companies as defined in the Act and, in addition, had 23
operating subsidiaries rendering electric and gas service in 14 different
States. One of the :first problems as to compliance with Section
11 (b) (2) which the Commission considered was that of bringing the
system into compliance with the "great-grandfather clause" which
'imposes a requirement limiting holding-company systems to not more
than three tiers of companies, i. e., a holding company may not be the
"parent" of a holding company which in turn is "parent" of another
holding company. The Commission's order in this case directed the
dissolution of two of the companies in The United Light and Power
Company holding-company system. The two companies ordered
dissolved were The United Light and Power Company, the top holding company, and United American Company, an intermediate holding company having no publicly-held securities. The selection of
these two companies as the ones to be eliminated was based in part
upon the fact that the degree of complexity as affecting particular
classes of securities was the greatest at the top of the pyramid of
holding companies' involved, and in part upon the fact that the
respondents themselves suggested a method, apparently in general
accord with the statutory standards, which would bring about compliance with the statutory requirement by means of dissolving the
top holding company. The Commission's order reserved jurisdiction
to consider the taking of such further steps as might be appropriate
to effect compliance with the corporate simplification requirementa of
the Act as applied to this holding-company system.
Subsequently, the proceedings were consolidated with others
already pending under Section 11 (b) (1), which deals with geographical limitation of systems, and the issue was raised, among "

others, as to whether the holding-company system should eliminate
all but a single holding company.a
An earlier proceeding, involving the corporate structure of The
United IUuminating Oompany, resulted in the elimination of certain
holding companies from the super-structure
of that system. The
United Illuminating Trust and the Illuminating Shares Company
held the controlling stock of The United Illuminating Company.
This voting trust had been created in 1930 for the purpose of retaining local control of the holding company. The Commission approved
a plan providing for the termination of the trust and the return of the
shares of The United Illuminating Company to' their beneficial
owners."
During the year, proceedings were instituted against General Gas &:
Electric Oorporation under Section 11 (b) (2).16 This corporation is
a holding company in the Associated Gas and Electric Corporation
system and, either directly or indirectly through certain subholding
companies, controls various utility properties scattered from Delaware to Florida. Shortly after the Commission's proceedings were
instituted, the company filed a plan providing for various exchanges
of stock and contemplating the subordination by Associated Gas and
Electric Corporation of certain securities.
While these proceedings were pending the Commission enter.ed an
order approving one phase of the plan, the elimination of Southeastern Electric and Gas Company, a subholding company, by merger
of that company into General Gas '& Electric Corporation. The
Commission's opinion 17 did not discuss the" great-grandfather clause"
nor did it consider any problems presented under Section 10. The
opinion held, however, that the Southeastern Electric and Gas
Company performed no useful functions, required expenses of
approximately $10,000 per year, and might therefore appropriately be
dissolved. Jurisdiction was reserved over various phases of the transaction, including accounting entries and the validity of open accounts
and
certain other obligations
payable to the parent
company, Asso. "

ciated Gas-and Electric Corporation.
The elimination of companies to comply with Section l1(b) (2) is

ing companies, some of which have subsidiaries which are holding
companies. In March 1941, The United Corporation filed a plan
under Section l1(e) which contemplated the gradual reduction of its
utility holdings and, pending such reduction, the sterilization of voting rights, the discontinuance of interlocking directorships, and the
termination of participation by the parent in transactions with its
subsidiary companies. In order that consideration of the company's
plan be accompanied by appropriate consideration of all relevant
standards of Section 11(b) (2), the Commission, in setting the plan
down for hearing, instituted proceedings under Section 11 (b) (2). 18
One of the principal matters raised for consideration under this section was as to the appropriate action to be taken to eliminate holdingcompany relationships so as to comply with the "great-grandfather
clause."
Proceedings under Section 11(b)(2) were instituted against International Hydro-Electric System shortly before the beginning of the
past fiscal year." This system is a Massachusetts trust whose ownership of securities is limited to equities in certain other holding companies, among which are the New England Power Association and the
Hudson River Power Corporation. Several of the subsidiaries of the
New England Power Association in turn are holding companies.
When the proceedings were instituted, International Hydro-Electric System had' outstanding large amounts of debentures, preferred
stock, Class A stock, Class B stock, and common stock. All of the
Class B and common stocks were owned by certain trustees, who held
as trustees for the benefit of International Paper and Power Company and International Paper Company. On January 17, 1941
the Commission issued findings and an order pursuant to Section
l1(b) (2).20 The Commission found that the common and Class B
stocks had no value and directed the trustees owning such stocks to
cancel them. In response to a request that such stocks be permitted
to be sold at public auction, the Commission held that such a sale
would not be in the public interest since such securities definitely
had no value. On June 16, 1941 the trustees turned in their Class B
and common stocks for cancellation, thereby complying with the Commission's order."

zation on a one-stock basis." The order permitted as an alternative
the liquidation of the company. This order was entered before the
completion of valuation evidence and the Commission made no finding that the junior securities were without value, but concluded that
a single class of stock was the only appropriate capitalization for
this holding company in view of the unstable earnings record, the
substantial debt and preferred stock of its utility subsidiaries, and the
speculative character of other assets.
In Federal Water Service Corporation," the company had outstanding debentures, four series of preferred stock, and Class A and
B stocks. In addition, there were substantial arrears of dividends on
the preferred stock as well as on the Class A stock, which had priority
as to assets and earnings over the Class B stock. The capital of the
company had been impaired to a substantial extent and under the
State law current earnings could not be used to pay dividends until
this impairment was eliminated. The plan presented by the management contemplated a statutory merger of the company with a parent
company and wholly-owned subsidiary in accordance with State law,
leaving the debentures undisturbed, but proposed to substitute a.
single class of par value common stock for the present shares, 95percent of which was to be allocated among holders of the various
series of preferred on the basis of their respective dividend preferences,
and the remaining 5 percent to be distributed to holders of the Class.
A stock. No provision was made for the B stock.
The Commission unanimously held that although the company was
not relying upon the machinery of Section 11 (e) for the effectuation
of the plan, it was, nevertheless, to be considered in the light of the
standards imposed by the Act for plans presented under Section
11 (e), namely, that it must be "fair and equitable to the persons
affected." 24 The Commission was also in agreement that the Class
B stock, which had no reasonable probability of receiving anything
from the company under its existing capitalization, should not be
permitted to participate in any manner in the plan. It therefore
disapproved of a provision in the plan for a staggered board of directors
designed to continue in control in management to some degree
identified in interest with the Class B stock. A difference of opinion

Be pointed out that the applicant was presenting a plan of the type descnbed in secnon 11 (e) of the Act; that is, for "act-on • • • for the purpose
of enablmr such company or any subsidiary company thereof to comply WIth the provis OIlS of subsection

Acc1rdingly, he concluded that it must be appraised in the light of the standards which Congress
had prescribed for such plans, I, e., the "fair and equitable" standard.

was expressed, however, with respect to the continuing interest of the
Class A stockholders under the plan by reason of the allocation to
them of new common stock.
Both the majority and dissenting opinions considered the application of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the Los Angeles
Lumber and Consolidated Rock cases," which had held that the
"fair and equitable" standard prescribed by Congress as applicable
. to plans of reorganization under Section 77B or Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy Act, had the same meaning as had been developed in
connection with that phrase in the equity receivership cases, and
that that standard requires full recognition of liquidation priorities.'
Section 11 (e) also expressly prescribes the "fair and equitable"
standard as applied to plans for compliance with Section 11 (b) of
the Act, but the majority of the Commission held that this standard
does not have the. same application in the setting of a plan to comply
with Section 11 where, as contrasted with the typical equity receivership or bankruptcy organization, liquidation of the company is not the
alternative to reorganization. The majority concluded that on the
basis of the pre-reorganization capitalization, the Class A stockholders
of Federal had a reasonable, though remote, expectation of participating in future earnings and that, on this basis, it was "fair and
equitable" to give them a continuing interest in the corporation in
the comparatively small amount provided in the plan. It recognized,
however, that the earnings prospects for Federal were not such as to
warrant the finding of a present value for its properties equal to the
full amount of the prior claims of the preferred stockholders on a
liquidation basis.
Commissioner Healy dissented on the ground that, since a reorganization was legally compulsory under Section 11 (b) (2), rights to
participate should be determined in the light of the respective contract
rights to priority in the event of liquidation. On the basis of this
reasoning and of his analysis of the facts, he concluded that any
allocation to the Class A stock would be unfair. The same analysis
led to a disapproval of the treatment of the various series of preferred
stockholders, since the allocation was based on the relative dividend
preferences and did not take into account their respective rights to
priority on liquidation.
Another aspect of the decision, on which there was no difference of
opinion, limited to cost the participation accorded to securities purchased by the management while the reorganization proceeding was
pending before the Commission. Since the close of the fiscal year an
appeal has been taken by those whose participation was so limited.

under Section 11 (b) (2) were instituted

against The

Oommonwealth &: Southern Oorporation,26 which company is a large
holding company owning the equities of various operating companies.
The order instituting the proceedings required the company to show
cause why it should not reduce itself to a single class of stock.
On the basis of a showing as to the underlying facts concerning
the holding-company
system, the Commission held that expert
evidence as to valuation of the company's assets was immaterial and
that such evidence would not be permitted on the issue ot whether a
one-stock structure was the appropriate structure for this company."
One of the factors considered by the Commission in its opinion was the
company's status under Section 11 (b) (1). The Commission indicated that a one-stock capital structure might be p'artic!lll}rly appropriate or even necessary where, as it appeared here, the company
must dispose of substantial amounts of assets in order to comply with
.that section. After this ruling the hearing proceeded on the issue
.of whether a one-stock order should be entered. At the close of the
fiscal year, the matter was pending.
A number of pending proceedings under Section 11 (b) (2) involve
the issue of possible subordination of the debt claims of. a parent
holding company against its subsidiary to the rights of the public
holders of the securities of the subsidiary.
These cases are discussed

SEVENTH

Standards

ANNUAL

REPORT

of the A!=t.

Before securities of registered public-utility holding companies or
their subsidiaries can be issued they must meet the standards of
Section 7 or be exempted pursuant to Section 6(b).29 The Commission, through formal orders with conditions attached or through
informal conferences, which the companies frequently request, has
continued to strengthen the terms of the issue to the point where
investors and consumers receive the protection intended by the Act.
In these meetings, sometimes extending over a considerable length
of time, the weak points of the issuer and its securities are carefully
canvassed and adequate safeguards agreed upon. Changes, such as
increased maintenance and depreciation charges, restrictions on dividends, greater voting rights, limitations as to the future issuance of
securities having a preference over the proposed issue, elimination of
conflicts of interests of indenture trustees, restatement of certain
accounting items, and similar matters, are frequently made. It
should be noted that the statute and the precedents set by the Commission in earlier cases have greatly changed the type and character
of the financing plans now being filed with the Commission.
From November 1, 1935, to June 30, 1941, the Commission has
granted 186 applications for exemption under Section 6 (b). It has
been the Commission's policy to review a Section 6 (b) application
with the same care as a declaration under Section 7. Bond indentures and preferred stock contracts of exempted securities must meet
the same standards, with respect to protective covenants, as securities
issued under Section 7. The significant difference between the power
which the Commission has exercised under the two sections is that in
Section 6 (b) cases the Commission has never imposed conditions
preventing the issuance of securities in the amount and type approved
by the State Commission.
When, however, it appears that a proposed debt issue in a Section
6 (b) case is excessive or that there is an insufficient equity "cushion"
under the senior securities, including preferred stock issues, it is the
Commission's policy to impose conditions which will improve the
company's financial structure. Among the conditions imposed which
related to matters other than fees and commissions there were the
following general types:
(a) No dividend shall be paid on common stock or in excess
of a specified amount without Commission approval.
(b) No dividend shall be paid on common stock if common
stock and surplus fall below a stated minimum.
(c) No dividend shall be paid on common stock except out
of earned surplus accumulated after a specified date.
II For a distinction between the Commission's powers under these two sections, see concurring opinion
of Commissioner Healy, Wnt Penn Power Companv, 7 SEC 69, 90. See also Darton Power aM Light Com-

1,)Onll, 6 SEC 787.

PART IV-PUBLIC

(d) No dividend shall be paid on common stock unless
earned surplus after such dividend declaration is equal to or
greater than a fixed sum plus a specified annual amount.
(e) No dividend shall be paid on common stock and no
common stock shall be repurchased unless a stipulated amount
has been set aside for depreciation and maintenance or any
deficiency therein has been frozen in the surplus account.
(f) Reduction or prohibition of the payment of interest or
principal on system advances; reduction of the amount of fees
and commissions to be paid in connection with the financing.
Utility Bond Issues under Section 7.

In passing upon applications and declarations to issue securities,
dose scrutiny is given to the ratio of bonds, or of bonds and preferred
stock, to total capitalization and to net tangible property, and to the
relation between "earning power" and fixed charges and preferred
dividend requirements. In no case has the Commission permitted
the issuance of fixed interest-bearing obligations when it has felt that
fixed charges are inadequately covered.
In cases where it appeared that a declaration for the issuance of
securities would result in an excessive amount of funded debt the
Commission, until recently," was inclined to make a distinction
between refunding and new money issues.
In the El Paso case, decided February 4, 1941, the Commission
took occasion to reverse its previously indicated policy with respect
to refunding issues as contrasted with new money issues in the following words:
"In order that future applicants presenting declarations for refunding of
-outstanding senior securities may be fully forewarned of the problem and be
prepared to meet it we take this occasion to announce our future general policy as
follows: A refunding of outstanding senior securities where the issuer has a high
ratio of debt to net property or where the security issue does not fully meet the
.standards of Section 7 (d) will not be permitted effectiveness merely because it is
.a refunding. Such effectiveness will be permitted only where it appears that
the circumstances are so unusual and extraordinary as to justify a departure from
the general policy announced.
Even in such cases the applicants should else be
prepared to have included in their refunding operations measures definitely providing for a reduction of the ratio of debt to net property and of debt to total
eapitalization to a reasonable level."

The Commission deemed the matter of such importance that it
attached to its opinion in the El Paso case an appendix giving comprehensive reasons for its changed policy. Referring to its former
policy, the Commission said:
"Several opinions of the Commission and of individual Commissioners have in
the past stated that our policy was to apply the standards of Section 7 (d) less
II See appendix to the EI Paso opinion, Holding Company Act Release No. 2535. See e.qpeclallyconcurring opinion of Chairman Frank in the Soutbwestern Gill and Ekctric Companu case, 6 SEC 822.

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

strictly to refunding issues than to issues for new money. While such statements
have been largely predicated on special circumstances appearing in the cases
wherein the statements were made, it is apparent that reliance has been placed
upon them as authority for the general proposition stated."

It was pointed out that, although Section 7 (c) (2) (A) of the Act
provides for flexibility as to the type of securities which may be issued
in refunding cases, no such differentiation or exemption is provided
with respect to the application of the standards of Section 7 (d).
The Commission originally made this distinction on the assumption
that
"any improvement of a bad financial structure is necessarily a step in the right
direction, and that the issuer should be permitted to take steps in the right
direction, even though his proposals stop short of the point where the resultant
financial structure is consistent with sound finance and the objectives of the Act.
Most of the refunding issues which have come before the Commission have
involved proposals to take advantage of declining interest rates and to substitute
low coupon bonds for those originally issued at a higher rate. Interest savings
have been substantial, and consequently there have been such improvements in
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges as to present a better picture with respect to
the new bonds being 'reasonably adapted to the earning power of the declarant.'
In addition, indentures have been modernized, possible conflicts of interest affecting indenture trustees have been eliminated, and similar improvements made in
miscellaneous terms and conditions of the securities.
Without attempting to
minimize the extent of the improvements in the financial condition of the issuer and
the protection for investors which may have resulted, it is, nevertheless, the
Commission's conclusion that it may have frequently fallen short of giving full
effect to the intention of Congress, to the extent that it has permitted refundings
without requiring them to fully measure up to the standards of Section 7 (d).
"Aside from the statutory provisions, the wisdom of identical treatment of new
money issues and refunding issues is indicated also from the practical point of view.
Where corporate debt is excessive and the refunding is accomplished through the
sale of new long term obligations, the issuer perpetuates the two attendant major
perils--the necessity of paying it off at some date in the future, and the necessity
of meeting fixed charges in the meantime."

It should be emphasized that the EI Paso decision stated a general
ideal or objective, that refunding issues which fail to meet the
standards of Section 7 (d) will not be approved merely because they.
are refundings.
A recent interesting case which illustrates the work of the Commission with respect to improving the financial structure of companies
issuing securities is that which involved the refinancing of The Oommonwealth &: Southern Oorporation and its subsidiary, Georgia Power
Oompany.3t Originally, the parent company, which held $34,000,000
of 5 percent bonds of its subsidiary, planned to resell them to insurance companies along with $17,000,000 2}' percent 10-year installment
notes to 5 New York banks to retire its outstanding funded debt
amounting to nearly $52,000,000. In discussions, it was pointed out
II Holding

Company Act Release No. 2586.

PART IV-PUBLIC

UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

93

to the management that the sale of these bonds would have the effect
of freezing the outstanding bonded debt of the subsidiary at approximately $125,000,000 which, in the staff's opinion, was greatly in excess
of the amount which could safely be supported by its assets. After
further discussion, the management decided to proceed immediately
with the refunding of the $125,000,000 of Georgia Power Company
bonds. This refunding was consummated by a private sale to 27
insurance companies of $101,000,000 of 3~ percent mortgage bonds,
together with $13,500,000 of 2}~percent 8-year installment notes sold
to banks.
Before declaring the application effective, the Commission discussed
with the Georgia Power Company the desirability of making a
thoroughgoing readjustment of its accounts. As a result, among
other things, the operating company eliminated write-ups in its property account aggregating over $32,000,000; restated its preferred
stock at its liquidating value of $100 per share (its stated value averaged $86); increased its depreciation reserve by $13,000,000; reduced
the stated value of its common stock from $35 to $22 per share;
charged unamortized debt discount and expense of $5,000,000, attributable to the refunded bonds, against earned surplus; and consented to a condition restricting dividends to earnings accumulated
subsequent to December 31, 1940.
On a pro forma basis, funded debt amounted to 53 percent, preferred stock 21 percent, and common stock equity 26 percent, respectively, of total capitalization. The total of the new bonds and
notes represented 53 percent of the utility's net property after the
write-downs referred to above, but without adjustment for estimated
remaining intangibles. The Commission noted that the pro forma
property account was still substantially in excess of original cost of
its utility plant, which was being reclassified in accordance with the _
uniform system of accounts of the Federal Power Commission. Depreciation accounting, however, had superseded retirement accounting
and the provisions for this expense had shown considerable improvement during the last 4 years. The Commission declared that the
sinking fund provisions of the bonds and the retirement of the installment notes would rapidly improve the capital structure of the company. It was noted that there had been a marked upward trend in
earnings and that the total fixed charges and preferred stock dividend
requirements were earned on a pro forma basis 1.60 times.
The parent company made a capital contribution to the subsidiary
totaling $18,500,000, which consisted of $14,337,319 of its portfolio
bonds and all of its holdings of preferred stock which cost $4,162,68l.
The Commonwealth & Southern Corporation then eliminated its own
funded debt amounting to $51,857,500. The funds for this purpose
were obtained as follows: from the corporation's cash account

($16,500,000), in payment of the remaining Georgia Power Co. bonds
in its portfolio ($18,493,122) and from the proceeds of an issue of
10-year installment notes ($17,000,000). It was found that the
pro forma debt of the parent company was reasonable in proportion
to its total assets and that the :fixedcharges were amply covered. It
was also found that the issuance of the short-term notes would not be
a hindrance to compliance with Section 11. The transactions covered
by these applications were beneficial and constructive to The Commonwealth & Southern Corporation, as well as to the Georgia Power
Company.
In June 1941, the Commission authorized the Philadelphia Oompany, a registered holding company and a subsidiary of Standard Gas
and Electric 00., to issue $48,000,000 collateral trust bonds, $12,000,000
collateral trust serial notes (due 1942-1952), and not to exceed 413,794
shares of common stock (to be sold to its parent at $7.25 per share),
for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds amounting to $60,000,000 at a call premium of $3,000,000. Philadelphia Company's
principal investment is in the common stock of Duquesne Light Oompany and the Pittsburgh Railways Oompany, which is in the process
of reorganization under Section 77B.
In 1939, anticipating the necessity of creating a reserve to absorb
the depreciation of its investment in the Railways Company, Philadelphia Company applied for approval of a reduction in the stated
value of its common stock and the creation of a revaluation reserve
amounting to $23,000,000. The Commission granted the application
although it expressed "doubts of the adequacy of the revaluation
reserve." 32
In its opinion 33 on the refunding program, the Commission noted
that the transactions "are not without their difficulties" for "in relation to the book values of the properties of the system, with adjustment for write-ups and deficiencies of depreciation reserves, as well as
unrealized depreciation in the Railways, the debt initially is higher
than we should like to see it." In approving the transactions U the
Commission noted, however, that the provisions for debt retirement
and for increasing the amortization reserve were quite drastic and
gave evidence of a "bona fide endeavor to rectify a top-heavy structure
as rapidly as circumstances permit."
On October 2, 1940, Northeastern Water and Electric Corporation, 35
a registered holding company and an indirect subsidiary of Associated
Gas and Electric Oorporation in bankruptcy proceedings, filed an
application to purchase Union Water Service Oompany. The company
declared that it regarded the acquisition of the Union properties as an

anticipatory investment of the proceeds of the sale of certain electric
properties in Ohio. The applicant further stated that it was engaged
in negotiations looking toward the complete severance of Northeastern
from the Associated system.
The consolidated pro forma balance sheet showed that funded debt
and minority interest represented 41 percent of the total capitalization, while preferred stocks represented another 46 percent, and the
common stock the balance. Furthermore, senior securities (debt and
preferred stock) represented 86 percent of the net book :fixedcapital.
When write-ups were eliminated these securities represented 113
percent of the net :fixed capital. When, however, preferred stock
investments in nonsubsidiaries were added to the adjusted property
account, the common stock equity appeared to be 7.50 percent.
In reviewing the declaration in the light of the standards of Section
7 (d), the Commission noted that Northeastern was one of a tier of
four holding companies and that control was exercised through a
disproportionately small investment in the common stock. Earlier
assurances that Northeastern would promptly liquidate its electric
properties had not been fulfilled. The Commission found that, on a
corporate basis, prospective earnings of the company would not be
adequate to pay interest charges, sinking fund requirements, and
preferred stock dividend requirements during the next 3 years. The
Commission also noted that the preferred stock of Northeastern
represented the investment made by bondholders in a predecessor
company which was reorganized less than 6 years before. In approving the dcelaration, however, the Commission pointed out that
there were off-setting factors: (1) the issuance of common stock at this
time was precluded by the complexity in the financial structure of the
corporation; (2) even if Northeastern is not able to obtain cash from
the sale of its Ohio properties during the next 3 years, nevertheless,
its anticipated earnings on the corporate basis would suffice to pay the
interest and liquidate the principal of the note and to make possible
the payment of full dividends on the preferred stock for 2 of the 3
years and a portion of the third-provided that no dividends are paid
on the common stock.
The Commission permitted the declaration to become effective
only upon condition that no common stock dividends be paid until the
retirement of the note and that the declarant file a stipulation that,
if the electric properties were not disposed of within 6 months, the
company will consent to the entry of an order by the Commission
pursuant to Section 11(b) (1) requiring their disposition.
In replying to argument of counsel that the condition restricting
the payment of dividends constituted "an unwarranted intrusion on
managerial discretion", the Commission stated that the Public Utility

96

SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

Holding Company Act of 1935 was intended to restrict transactions
proposed by management which did not meet the prescribed standards, and that the Commission was bound to carry out the mandate
of the statute.
The Commission's "statutory powers and duties
under Sections 7 and 10 * * * are in no way diminished by the fact
that Northeastern is controlled by the Associated trustees who, in
turn, are subject to the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court."
This
was admitted by counsel for the trustees of the insolvent parent. .As
a reply to the contention of counsel, the Commission set forth, at
length in an appendix, some of the reasons which prompted Congress
to enact the statute.
Debt Retirement Policies.

As a remedial measure designed to conform top-heavy corporate
structures to statutory standards where the ratio of debt to net
property is excessive, the Commission has frequently required -issuers
to follow some systematic debt reduction plan. Several methods of
providing for gradual debt reduction have been utilized. In some
instances, conditions have been attached requiring that the interest
savings from refunding or a certain amount of net earnings be reserved to redeem outstanding debt. In other instances, the Commission has required the inclusion of sinking fund provisions whereby
the issuer agrees to devote annually a stated amount to retirement
of bonds or to property additions.
In still other instances, the
objective of debt reduction has been achieved by means of serial
financing.
The Commission has referred to the need of debt amortization as
follows:
"Too many utilities regard their debt as perpetual and make- no adequate
provision for its ultimate Iiquidation."
There appears to be an abiding faith in
the permanency of existing generating and transmission facilities, although it is
well known that rapid scientific progress might change the methods of the power
industry overnight. A similar optimism once prevailed in the street railway
industry:
'As late as 1921 an investment banker wrote-"Sinking
funds are
found in some of the earlier street railway mortgages, but the present tendency
is to omit them, on the theory that a street railway is permanent property and
not of a wasting character where sinking funds are essential to reduce the debt
as the assets are diminished." , " 37

Equity Financing. ~

As a corrective measure, the Commission is becoming more insistent
that, wherever possible, more common stock financing be. done to
.. In this connection It Is noteworthy that as a result of numerous recent refundlngs, it Is estimated that
some $3.6Ii6,200,OOO
of debt (or well over one-halt of the total fixed debt of the utlhty Industry) f!lllsdue In
the decade from 1961 to 1970. Moreover. It Is estimated that $2.543.500.000of funded deht (or almost 40
percent of the total) falL. due In the five y~.arsfrom 1965to 1969. Experts have suggested that this may
constitute an undue concentration of maturities and a possible future source of trouble to the utility Indu"

improve the capital structure of those companies which have a high
ratio of bonds to (a) "capitalization" and (b) net property, adjusted
for write-ups, All too frequently holding companies and their subsidiaries have been so overburdened with senior securities that they
are unable to sell common stock to the public without a thoroughgoing recapitalization."
In a number of instances, however, the Commission, in passing
upon declarations before it, has required companies to take action to
increase the ratio of equity to senior securities."
One method of increasing common stock equity has been to require:
the conversion of open accounts, bonds, or preferred stock held by th6!
parent company into common stock of its subsidiary."
When theAppalachian Electric Power Oompany 41 refinanced its bonds and preferred stock, its parent, American Gas and Electric Oompany, made a
$30,670,000 capital contribution to its subsidiary. This was accomplished by converting an open-account advance and preferred stock
into capital surplus, with the further provision that $22,500,000 of
that amount would be placed in an appropriate reserve account to be
available for possible adjustments to fixed capital accounts and the
depreciation reserve account. The principles of the Deep Rock
ease 42 established by the Supreme Court of the United States have
given considerable impetus to the conversion of senior security holdings
into common stock. This case is discussed at p. 105 of this report.
A number of holding companies have increased their equity investments in their subsidiaries either by outright cash contributions or the
purchase of additional common stock. Although the aggregate
amount has not been large, there has been a substantial increase in
the number of such instances since June 30, 1940.43
Mortgage Indenture.

Since the mortgage indenture is one of the principal instruments of
utility finance, the Commission has long desired to secure a greater
degree of uniformity and simplicity in its covenants. To that end
the Commission is now making a study of the provisions of a large
number of existing utility mortgage indentures.
Wherever possible the Commission has sought to limit funded debt
to 50 percent of the net :fixedassets. In passing upon this relationship

consideration is given to the existence, if any, of write-ups which may
be included in the property account. In general, the issuance of
additional bonds is limited to 60 percent of the cost or fair value,
whichever is less, of net additions to fixed property. This higher
ratio for bonding additions is sanctioned to give greater flexibility
under the indenture to meet unforeseen future conditions.
The Commission has been careful to see that each mortgage indenture has adequate maintenance and replacement provisions to
insure, as certainly as possible, that the net value of the property
securing the mortgage will not decrease and thereby diminish the
security of the outstanding bonds. Furthermore, the sum specified
in the indenture for maintenance and replacement must annually be
accounted for to the trustee. Since the enactment of the Trust
Indenture .Act of 1939, the trust indenture provisions of all utility
bond issues must meet the standards of that .Act with respect to the
duties, responsibilities, and the rights of the trustee.
Preferred

Stock Protective

Provisions.

In order to protect preferred stockholders more adequately the
Commission has insisted upon an increasing number of safeguards.
These have to do primarily with voting privileges. The Commission
now insists that in order to meet the standards of the Act, preferred
stock, as a class, must have the right to elect a majority of the board of
directors upon accumulation of six quarterly dividend arrearages.f
Furthermore, the Commission has insisted that the assent of a
specified majority of the preferred stock voting as a class shall be
necessary before certain corporate actions may be taken which may
affect the rights, privileges, or priorities of the preferred stockholders,
such as issuing additional senior securities or effecting a merger or
consolidation.
COMPETITIVE

BIDDING

On April 7, 1941, the Commission adopted Rule U-50, under the
Public Utility Holding Company .Act of 1935, requiring competitive
bidding in the sale of securities by registered public-utility holding
companies and their electric and gas utility subaidiaries.v
The rule,
applicable both to new security issues and to the sale by holding companies of portfolio utility securities, prescribes public invitation of
sealed bids. Certain transactions are specifically exempted, including
securities sold for less than $1,000,000; securities issued pro rata to
existing security holders pursuant to any preemptive right or privilege
or in connection with any liquidation or reorganization; and loans of a
maturity of 10 years or less, where the lender is a moneyed institution
not purchasing for resale, and no finder's fee or other negotiation

charge is to be paid to any third person. In addition, there is a.
general provision for exemption from competitive bidding by order
of the Commission.
Prior to the adoption of Rule U-50, the customary method of
selling utility securities involved a sale by the issuing corporation to
an underwriting syndicate at a price determined by private negotiation with the principal or so-called originating underwriter. It was
an established policy of investment bankers not to compete among
themselves for the securities business of any issuer which had a continuing investment banking relationship with a. particular firm.
Similarly, with very few exceptions, the issuing corporation made no
attempt to seek competitive bids or to "shop around" for better
terms than those offered by its customary banker. In some cases,
moreover, there was a clearly traceable affiliate relationship, sometimes extending over a considerable period of time, between the
originating underwriter and the issuer. In fact some of the underwriters had been promoters of some of the major holding company
systems. As a result of these conditions there was a definite absence
of free market competition in the underwriting of utility security
issues. Fortunately, the provisions of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 provided ample authority for meeting the
problem.
Section 1 of the Act enumerates various abuses and evils which
gave rise to the need for control of public-utility holding companies
and their subsidiaries, including those which occur when public utility
companies enter into transactions in the "absence of arm's-length
bargaining" or where there is "restraint of free and independent
competition."
In addition to the provisions which are aimed at the
maintenance of competitive conditions, the Commission was given
very special authority over dealings with "affiliates." In fact, the
Commission's first approach to the problem of maintaining arm'slength bargaining in the issuance and sale of public-utility securities
was evidenced by an attempt to control relations of holding company
systems with investment banking affiliates.
Early in the administration of the Act, the Commission was confronted with security transactions in which there was serious question
whether the negotiations were conducted at arm's-length. The
Commission eventually concluded that it was necessary to establish a
procedure to cope with the problem of affiliation in security issues.
Accordingly, in December 1938, it adopted Rule U-12F-2 which prohibited, with exceptions, the payment of any underwriter's fee by
registered holding companies or subsidiaries thereof to any affiliate
unless the affiliate had been awarded the securities as the most
favorable bidder in open competition. One of the exceptions was
that an affiliate might act as an underwriter without competitive

100

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

bidding if its participation did not exceed 5 percent of the total
offering and its fee was computed at the same rate as that of other
underwriters having a similar participation.
The theory of this
exception. was that with their participation so limited investment
bankers would no longer find it worth while, and therefore would cease,
to dominate the securities transactions of the companies with which
they were affiliated.
The Commission's experience with Rule U-12F-2, however, was
that, despite the fact that their participation was so limited, affiliated
investment bankers continued to negotiate, as managing underwriters,
the securities transactions of the companies with which they were
affiliated. Significantly, during the 2 years that Rule U-12F-Z
was in effect no use was made of the competitive bidding procedure
it provided. Thus, the attempt to assure competitive conditions and
arm's-length bargaining in the issuance and sale of securities by companies subject to the Act was defeated because affiliated investment
bankers, whatever their incentive may have been, continued to use
their position of superior advantage to dominate such transactions.
It was claimed, moreover, that Rule U-12F-2 was burdensome and
costly to issuers and underwriters alike because prolonged investigations and hearings were found necessary in many cases to determine
whether, under the Act, an underwriter and an issuer were affiliated
within the meaning of Section 2 (a) (11) (D) and the corresponding
standard imposed in the rule. The Commission recognized that these
hearings were not only costly and time consuming for the parties, but
presented for decision complex questions of fact. Thus it examined and
re-examined the record in the Dayton Pouer &: Light Company case,"
decided in March 1941, to avoid any possible unfairness in drawing inferences from the details of a large mass of evidence adverse to the
investment bankers there involved; and the delay and suspense,
necessarily incident to that careful scrutiny, had occasioned further
criticism of Rule U-12F-2.
The Commission's realization of the shortcomings of Rule U-12F-2
led, in February 1940, to the solicitation of suggestions as to the
method by which it might "best insure the reasonableness of fees and
commissions and the fairness of the terms and conditions of any proposed issue and sale of utility securities." It also instructed its Public Utilities Division to make a full study of the problem and, more
than a year ago (February 29, 1940), a letter was written to each
holding-company system subject to the Act, as well as to State commissions, investment bankers, and securities dealers throughout the
country. It was stated in this letter that competitive bidding and
"shopping around" had been suggested as possible ways of meeting

the problem. Many replies were received, but after careful consideration and discussions with representatives of the Investment Bankers Association, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
and others, it appeared that none of the suggestions received in response to that inquiry, other than competitive bidding, gave promise
of effectively achieving the desired results. Then, in a report to the
Commission dated December 18, 1940/7 the Public Utilities Division
formally recommended the adoption of a competitive bidding rule.
Copies of that report were distributed to registered holding companies,
State and Federal regulatory bodies, and to a broad list of investment
bankers and dealers, both directly and through the Investment Bankers Association and the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. In distributing the report, written comments were invited, following which numerous responses were received. The Commission
then called a public conference to consider the recommended rule and
public discussion continued for 4% days. The conference was attended by approximately 200 persons from every part of the country,
including two members of Congress, investment bankers, securities
dealers, and representatives of other governmental agencies. Fourmembers of the Commission were present at all times. All shades
of opinion, pro and con, were expressed on the question, both in the
written responses and at the conferences.
After weighing the evidence and considering all aspects of the problem, the Commission concluded that there was no way short of competitive bidding that would afford it satisfactory means of determining
the reasonableness of spreads or the fairness of prices, assure disinterested advice in financial matters to the companies concerned, and
effectively control their dealings with affiliates."
In connection with hearings on the rule, there was considerable
emphasis upon the difficulties of investment bankers, particularly the
small local dealers, in making enough money to keep them in business
under present day conditions of the financial markets. It was, urg~
that competitive bidding might result in a further shrinkage of income
for the small firms. The Commission indicated its concern with the
problems of the local dealers. However, it appeared that these
difficulties had developed to an acute degree during a period when competitive bidding was the exception rather than the rule. The small
dealers had no assurance of obtaining an adequate share of negotiated
issues or a fair division of the gross underwriting spread. Moreover,
there had been a growing practice of direct sales by issuers to insurance

companies, which gave no opportunity to the investment banking
industry at large to earn commissions, although there might be payment of so-called" finders' fees" to a few investment banking :firms who
act as intermediaries in conducting the negotiations with the insurance
companies. Among the factors which appear to have led to the growth
of private placements and consequent elimination of the investment
banking function in the distribution of securities, is the fact that
insurance companies can give a "firm commitment" while proceedings
for approval of the regulatory authorities are pending whereas investment bankers are unable to make a firm commitment until immediately
before public offering. Another factor has been the fact that direct
sales to insurance companies do not require registration under the
Securities Act, since they do not involve a "public offering." These
competitive advantages of the insurance company over the investment banker are eliminated under, competitive bidding, since there is
a preliminary approval by the regulatory authorities prior to the invitation for competitive bids and since registration under the Securities
Act is necessarily involved.
One further competitive advantage of
the insurance companies is that they are buying for their own investment and not for resale. This advantage remains unaffected whether
or not competitive bidding is resorted to.
Since Rule U-50 became effective there has been active competition
between investment bankers, both in the formation of groups to bid
on new issues (frequently without relation to past affiliations) and in
the tendering of bids. The insistence upon competition in the sale of
this particular kind of merchandise follows the traditional American
pattern of the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade
Commission Act, all of which aim to preserve competition and to keep
that competition fair. These laws, backed by both major political
parties, are among the foundation stones of our democratic system of
capitalism.
Rule U-50 is not merely a matter of business procedure.
Ours is a system of free enterprise and when practices are allowed to
develop which eliminate or suppress competition, the very fundamentals of that system are endangered.
The liberating influence of
this competitive bidding rule will foster free enterprise and competition in a :field which has long been characterized by concentration of
the management and underwriting of new securities in the hands of
a few firms,
PROTECTION OF THE FINANCIAL INTEGRITY OF UTILITY
COMPANIES

Since impairment of the financial integrity of utility companies
inevitably leads to poor public service and to falling security values,
measures designed to protect the financial strength of utility companies are of the utmost importance to consumers as well as to in-

PART IV-PUBLIC

UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

103

vestors. Therefore, Section 12 (c) of the Act prohibits the payment
of any dividend in contravention of a regulation or order of the Commission deemed necessary or appropriate to protect the financial
integrity of companies subject to the Act; to safeguard their working
capital; to prevent the payment of dividends out of capital or unearned surplus; or to prevent circumvention of such rules or orders.
To implement the statute, rules have been promulgated which prohibit the declaration of dividends out of capital or unearned surplus
without approval of the Commission.
On account of the large fixed investment in the utility industry
in relation to its operating revenues, depreciation accruals constitute
an important part of total operating costs. If the amount of depreciation is underestimated and an inadequate allowance therefor
is charged as expense, there results an overstatement of net income
available for fixed charges and for the payment of dividends. Not
alone does it result in a distorted income statement, which may be
misleading to investors, but if the overstated earnings are paid out
as dividends and that policy is continued, it may cause an impairment of the capital of the company and jeopardize its financial integrity. The failure to charge adequate depreciation expense also
results in a deficient depreciation reserve and, as a consequence, the
net book value of the company's assets is correspondingly overstated.
This, likewise, is misleading and may cause investors to believe that
the company's capital structure as related to net property values is
sounder than it actually is.
To date, the Commission's supervision over the dividend and depreciation policies of utility companies to prevent impairment of
working capital and maintain financial integrity has been limited
chiefly to the individual cases which come before it in connection with
security issues. In passing on proposed security issues, the Commission has not infrequently imposed conditions restricting the payment
of common stock dividends where such action was necessary to protect
the interest of investors or the financial integrity of the company.
It has been the Commission's practice in difficult cases involving
the adequacy of depreciation to supplement its analysis of financial
statements by engineering field investigations.
The results of these
investigations indicated the desirability of undertaking a general
survey of the dividend and depreciation policies of the utility. companies subject to the Act. Such a survey was made on the basis of
figures supplied by the companies and the results were published in
August .1940, in a report entitled "Fmancial Statistics for Electric
and Gas Subsidiaries' of Registered Public Utility Holding Companies,
1930-1939."

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

These reports showed that there was a marked discrepancy between
the depreciation charges which companies were allowed to deduct for
the purpose of computing their Federal income tax returns and the
depreciation expense which thdy actually recorded on their books.
Thus, for the lO-year period 1930-1939, 168 operating companies,
with aggregate assets of nearly $8,000,000,000, were allowed depreciation deductions for Federal income tax purposes in the amount of
$1,772,904,000, although the depreciation expense charged against
income on their books aggregated only $1,153,960,000. After theirincome accounts were adjusted by the amount of the excess of depreciation allowed for income tax pu-poses, it was found that 113 of
these 168 companies had paid out as dividends $348,777,000 more
than they actually earned during the lO-.vear period.
In the last few years there has been considerable improvement in
the depreciation policies of the utility companies, particularly since
1937 when the Federal Power Commission and most of the State
utility comrmssions prescribed depreciation accounting for electric
utilities in place of retirement accounting, which had been in general
use prior to that time. But the Commission's studies indicate that
the depreciation charges of a large number of companies continue to
be inadequate.
Early m July 1941, the Philadelphia Electric Company, a subsidiary
of The United Gas Improvement Company and The United Corporation, agreed to make substantial revisions in Its depreciation practices." The company has tentatively agreed, pending completion of
its property studies, not to use $10,000,000 of its earned surplus existing December 31, 1940, for dividend distributions: to increase its
annual accruals from current earnings for depreciation purposes to
not less than $7,000,000 beginning January 1, 1941 (accruals for 1940
amounted to $5,870,000); and to diligently pursue its present studies
on the cost and probable useful lives of _its utility assets. Representatives of the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission contributed
materially to the resulting cooperative adjy~t1nent of the company's
depreciation and dividend practices. Close cooperation with State
commissions on such matters is an established policy of this Commission.
Closely related to the problem of dividend payments is that of
)ayments on what purport to be debt claims of parent holding companies. In prior years it had been the practice of many holding
eompanies to force their subsidiaries to declare dividends on the basis
of the entire book earnings (which mayor may not have represented
actual earnings), regardless of the availability of cash to pay such
:lividends. The dividends so declared were not in fact paid-except
as 8. matter of bookkeeping entries or. formal payments; The sums

involved were loaned back to the subsidiaries, frequently at high
:rates of interest. Open accounts between the parent holding com;pany and its subsidiaries involved a great number of STIch"advances"
:in respect to dividends, as well as numerous other questionable incer'Company transactions not conducted at arm's-length. Sometimes the
balance remained an open account, sometimes part of it was the consideration for the issuance of additional common stock to the parent
holding company, and sometimes for the issuance of senior securities.
In some instances there was a time lag but an essentially similar
relationship between the "milking" of the subsidiary and the creation
of a debt claim in favor of the parent holding company. Having
launched the subsidiary with an unbalanced security structure or
-drained it of cash, it became necessary for the parent company to
'Cometo its rescue with financial aid in the form of a loan or the pur'Chase of senior securities.
An intercompany claim. of this character came before the Supreme
Court in 1939. Taylor v. Standard Gas &; Electric Oompany,S1 involved
a reorganization plan under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act for
Deep Rock Oil Company, one of the non-utility subsidiaries of Standard Gas & Electric Company. The parent holding company had
:filed a claim arising out of an open account against Deep Rock, in the
amount of $9,000,000, which was subsequently allowed in the compromised amount of $5,000,000. It was assumed that the $5,000,000
:figure represented a valid consideration received by Deep Rock from
Standard.
Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held that the equities
of the situation required complete subordination of this debt claim
to the claims of the publicly-held preferred stock of Deep Rock, and
for that reason disapprov..ed "lower court decisions approving as 'fair
and equitable' a reorganization plan" which did not provide for such
subordination.
Among the factors stressed was the domination of the
management of Deep Rock by Standard; the responsibility of Standard for a capitalization, top-heavy with debt; cash advances to permit
dividends not warranted by earnings; misrepresentations in connection with the sale of securities; charging 7 percent interest, compounded
monthly, on the open account; management fees; and miscellaneous
other abuses, as to which the Court stated:
"It is impossible within the scope of this opinion, to tell the numerous other
transaetions evidenced by the books of the two companies, many of which were
'to the benefit of Standard and to the detriment of Deep Rock. All of them were.
accomplished through the complete control and domination of Standard and
without the participation of the preferred stockholders who had no voice or vote
in the management of Deep Rock's affairs.
* * * It is impossible to recast
Deep Rock's history and experience so as even to approximate what would be its
financial condition at this day had it been adequately capitalized and independently managed .and had its fiscal affairs been conducted with an eye single
io its own interests."
11306 u. B. 308.

106

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

The decision in the Deep Rock case is merely an illustration of
the traditional equitable principle that directors and controlling stockholders are held to a strict fiduciary standard in dealing with their
corporation. This was pointed out by the Court in the subsequent
case of Pepper v. Litton,02 in which the Court stated that, in scrutinizing such dealings, "the essence of the test is whether or not under all
the circumstances the transaction carries the earmarks of an arm'slength bargain. If it does not, equity will set it aside." This arm'slength bargaining test closely parallels the standards applicable under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 to intercompany
transactions and to other transactions between affiliates." Accordingly, the effect of these recent decisions of the Supreme Court has
been to emphasize the importance of Commission scrutiny under the
Act of the many debt claims of the registered holding companies
against their subsidiaries.
The problem may arise in connection with the Commission's approval of a reorganization plan under Section 11 (e) or Section 11 (f)
of the Act. Mountain States Power Company;" referred to in the
Commission's annual report for the year ended June 30, 1939,55 was a
case .involving a plan of reorganization for a company which was the
subject of reorganization proceedings under Section 77B of the
Bankruptcy Act. The plan was approved by the Commission under
Section 11 (f). The equities in favor of subordination did not appear
to be as strong as those involved in the Deep Rock case and the
Commission approved a compromise settlement which gave the
preferred stockholders partial priority over the parent company's
debt claim.
Shortly after the close of the past fiscal year, 56 the Commission
approved, under Section 11 (e) of the Act, a plan of corporate simplification for Derby Gas & Electric Oorporation, a subsidiary holding company in the Ogden Corporation holding company system." Derby
had outstanding a $5,000,000 open account claim held by Ogden,
preferred stock, of which 14.7 percent was held by Ogden and the
balance by the public, and common stock all held by Ogden. The
preferred stock held by Ogden had been purchased at a substantial
discount by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent holding company
at a time when reorganization proceedings were pending before

the Commission. The subsidiary company had called for retirement
in advance of maturity its outstanding funded debt. This was done
in contemplation of a refunding operation but without making definitive arrangements, including securing Commission authorization, for
the new issue. Later, the refunding was abandoned, and the funded
debt paid off out of the proceeds of a demand advance from the
parent which carried interest at the same rate as that on the retired
funded debt. The plan provided for a cash payment to the parent
out of the proceeds of a new issue of debentures in the amount of
$2,750,000 on account of its $5,000,000 claim. The plan also provided for a single class of stock which was divided between the parent
holding company and the public holders of Derby's preferred stock.
The basis of division recognized that the open account claim might
be, to a certain extent, vulnerable under the strict standards applicable
to intercorporate dealings. The Commission approved this aspect of
the plan as fair and equitable on the ground that the circumstances
did not appear to require subordination of the parent company's
claim within the so-called Deep Rock doctrine and that, in any event,
the plan might be justified as a fair compromise of the issues involved."
Problems as to the status of debt claims of parent holding 'companies against their subsidiaries are also involved in a number of
pending Section 11 proceedings. Thus, plans of reorganization filed
under Section 11 (e) of the Act by Interstate Power Company and
North Shore Gas Company proposed settlements of such issues.
The Commission itself has raised the issue as to the status of parent
holding company debt claims in a number of proceedings instituted
pursuant to Section 1i (b) (2) of the Act, notably those involving United
Gas Corporation, Florida Power & Light Company, and Pennsylvania
Power & Light Company in the Electric Bond and Share system.
Occasionally such questions come before the Commission as an
incident to passing on proposals to issue new securities to refund outstanding debt of a subsidiary company where part of the issue is held
by the parent. An example is the refunding program of Georgia
Power Oompany, a subsidiary of The Commonwealth & Southern
Corporation, which was carried out early in 1941.59 During the years
from 1930 to 1938, Georgia Power Company paid very substantial
dividends to its parent company. Much of this money was needed,
however, for construction purposes, and the parent company, therefore, made open account advances to its subsidiary company. These
advances carried interest rates of 5 and 6 percent. From time to

time the parent company caused Georgia Power Company to issue
additional :first mortgage bonds which would then be transferred by
'Georgia Power Company to its parent company in payment of the
-open account. By the end of 1938 The Commonwealth & Southern
-Corporation had accumulated in this manner approximately $34,000,'000 of :first mortgage bonds of Georgia Power Company. The
remainder of such bonds, aggregating an amount of approximately
$90,000,000, were outstanding in the hands of the public.
In connection with the refunding program of Georgia Power Company, which has been discussed in a previous section of this report,"
'The Commonwealth & Southern Corporation was induc-ed to convert
into common stock a substantial portion of its investment in Georgia
Power Company represented by these bonds. Similar conversion
was made with respect to certain preferred stock of the operating
-eompany owned by the parent holding company. The parent company was permitted, however, to withdraw in cash a portion of its
investment by use of money obtained from the sale of the new refunding bonds.
Passing on any particular intercompany claim, whether in con-nection with a refunding issue or as incident to the approval of a plan
-of reorganization or recapitalization, frequently requires not merely
the scrutiny of a single transaction, but the review of a course of
-dealings over a period of years which involves a multitude of separate
transaotions. This is necessarily a time consuming process and may
give rise to substantial difference of opinion as to a great many issues
-of law and fact. It is not feasible to deal with more than a limited
number of such cases at anyone time and the problem is, therefore,
to select the most pressing cases for immediate.attention.
On April 16, 1941, there was submitted to the industry for comment a proposed rule which would suspend payments to the parent
holding company on all debt claims owed by subsidiaries who are in
arrears as to their publicly-held preferred stock until the Commission
-should have an opportunity to consider the status of the debt and to
enter an appropriate order under the applicable provisions of the Act.
Later, a public conference was held with respect to the proposed rule.
In support of the proposed rule, it was urged by Commission
'Counselthat the rule was designed to bring before the Commission for
-determination issues of considerable importance to the various classes
-of security holders affected; that the Commission would have jurisdiction to pass upon the propriety of making payments on any such claims
under Sections 12 (c) and 12 (f) of the Act; and that debt claims of the
parent holding company are most likely to require careful scrutiny in
those instances where the subsidiary against whom the claim is pressed
is in arrears as to its preferred dividends. Counsel for.preferred stockII Page

holders of one of the subsidiary companies which would be affected
by the rule also urged its adoption.
On the other hand, vigorous opposition was expressed on behalf of
counsel for one or two holding-company systems. Those opposed
argued that the Commission had no jurisdiction to pass on such
intercompany claims, and also urged that the rule was not adapted to
singling out the type of cases in which the Commission would be
justified in requiring the suspension of payments pending scrutiny of
particular claims. The adoption of a rule dealing with this subject
was still under consideration at the close of the fiscal year. However,
the discussions with respect to the rule had served to focus attention
upon many of the most critical situations involving such intercompany claims and, in the meantime, the Commission has instituted
proceedings by order to inquire into a number of these intercompany
claims.60a
Tables 46 and 47 of Appendix II, page 309, indicate the number of
applications under Section 12 (c) and Rules U-12C-2 and U-12C-3,
relating to the payment of dividends out of capital or unearned surplus, and applications under Section 12 (c) and Rule U-12C-1, relating
to the acquisition of securities by the issuer, received and disposed of
during the past fiscal year.
PROGRESS

IN SERVICE

COMPANY

REGULATION

Distinct progress in the administration of service, sales, and construction contracts pursuant to Section 13 of the Act was recorded
during .the past fiscal year. Section 13 was enacted primarily to
prevent holding companies or their dominated service companies or
allied interests from mulcting their controlled utility companies
through the guise of service fees or other unearned charges. Consequently, registered holding companies are prohibited by Section 13
(a) from servicing for a charge their associate public-utility or service
companies except under special or unusual circumstances. Equally
important are the provisions of Section 13 that such contracts as may
be performed by system companies for their associates shall be performed efficiently and economically and for the benefit of the serviced
It. On January 21, 1942,the Commission announced that in the light of its experience in dealing with
such problems by order, it is presently of the opinion that It is undesirable to have a general rule covering
payments of hoth principal and Interest and of the broad scope proposed, although further study may lead
to the conclusion thet there is some room for the exercise of the rule-making tuncnon withm this field. The
method of proceeding by order permits a greater fienbl1lty in selecting the most pressing problems for
immediate attentlon,and in manyinstanees permits the problems of the intercompany claims ttf be dealt
with, as an incident to proceedings under Section 11 (b) (2) of the Act, more economically than in the type
of proeeedmgs which might be precipitated by such a rule. The failure of the Comrrnssion to adopt theproposed rule should not be construed as accepting any of the legal arguments urged in opposition to the
rule. In fact, the determination of the Commission to proceed by order necessariIy assumes that the Commission regards the matter of taking action with reference to such intercompany claims as within its statutory powers under the Act, the choice between proceeding by rule or by order being dictated largely by
considerations of an administrative character. See Holding Company Act Release No. 3221.

company and the cost fairly and equitably allocated. The Commission has enforced these provisions by rules and regulations and by
proceedings pursuant to the .Act.
Intrasystem service, sales, and construction contracts are performed primarily by either actual or subsidiary service companies,
but so-called cross-servicing between operating companies in the same
system is permitted to a certain limited extent. While there are certain
technical differences in regard to the qualification of these two types of
service companies, the basic requirements as to the standards and
methods of operations by such companies are, for all practical purposes,
similar. Regulation of intrasystem service arrangements involves,
first, the qualification of the mutual and subsidiary service companies,
and second, the more important function of continuing supervision of
the actual operation of the servicing relationships. The first phase of
this regulation, which has been discussed in prior annual reports of
the Commission, is now largely completed, except for a small number
of new filings during the fiscal period and certain other cases which had
presented unusual difficulties. There has accordingly been a shift in
emphasis to the matter of supervising the actual operations of the
arrangements previously passed on by the Commission.
One of the statutory requirements is that the servicing activities
must be for the benefit of the companies receiving the services. This
excludes service activities which are primarily in the interests of the
holding company, that is, activities designed to protect its investment
and which enable it to control the operations of its subsidiaries .
Apparently, there has been a tendency to shift holding company
expenses to the operating companies through the vehicle of common
officers and employees. Thus, part of the salary cost and related
expenses of running the holding company and exercising control over
its subsidiaries, appears either as an operating expense of the service
company, which is in turn charged to the operating subsidiaries in the
system, or is directly charged to the operating companies, depending
upon whether these common executives are on the pay roll of the
service company or on the pay roll of the operating companies. In
either event the ultimate charge may be borne in part by the consumer
and in part by the public holders of securities of the operating companies, while the holding company escapes its fair share of the burden.
Some indication of the sums involved in certain of these situations
is presented in the tabulation below. While total service company
fees are used, salaries on the average comprise 60 percent to 70
percent of these fees. .A considerable portion of such salaries is paid
to high salaried executives and supervising personnel. The holding
companies referred to had limited staffs, if any, of their own. In
practically all instances where such staffs did exist, a portion of their
salaries was paid by the service company and charged to the operating

companies. In contrast, most operating companies in the systems
illustrated have well-paid, full time operating personnel resident on
the properties.
As will be observed, the bulk of the service company fees are
charged to the operating companies, while the holding companies
themselves pay an insignificant amount for the cost of determining
policies and administering and protecting investments, in many
instances aggregating hundreds of millions of dollars and producing
tens of millions of dollars in gross revenues.

The personnel, involved in the situations described above, holding
interlocking positions, supervise, if indeed they do not direct, the day
to day operations of the system operating companies. Obviously,
the question is where do their duties and responsibilities to the holding
company end, and where do their duties and responsibilities to the
operating companies begin. Needless to say, these problems require
careful consideration and case studies in each instance, since operating
conditions and service requirements vary in each system.
In a series of proceedings initiated in the past fiscal year, as well as
in connection with the consideration of a case which had been pending
for some time, the Commission dealt with this apparent shifting of
holding company expenses to the operating companies. In essence
the condition confronting the Commission in these cases, in greater
or lesser degree and in one form or another, was the use by the holding
company of common officers and employees between it and the
service company to supervise in its own interest daily operations of the
operating companies and the passing on to those companies of the
major portion of the cost of such supervision. The questions at issue
were whether or not it was possible to allocate such expenses between
the holding company and operating companies "fairly and equitably"
pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 (b), and whether, in effect,
the holding company was not in reality rendering services for a charge
to its operating subsidiaries in contravention of Section 13 (a).

112

SEVENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT~

'f4.~.41
In its opinions with respect to these -cases, the Commission laid'
down the broad principle that compensation and collateral expenses of
all holding company officers, directors, and employees must be bornedirectly by such holding companies and could not be shared with
their controlled service companies and thus passed on to the operatingcompanies. In other words, the Commission has taken the position
that operating companies should not be asked to pay the cost of thecontrol activities of the holding company.
Since these three cases constituted a landmark in the administration
of Section 13, it may be desirable to refer to them briefly.
In the case of Ebasco Services, Incorporated," the system servicecompany of Electric Bond and Share Company, it appeared that six
of Bond and Share's directors and principal executive officers held
identical positions in the service company and received portions of
their compensation from both of these companies. In this case theCommission decided tnat the functions of the principal executivesas officers of Ebasco were commingled with their functions as officers.
of Bond and Share and that it was an "almost impossible and wasteful
task" to ascertain what segments of the services of each of the common
officers were for Ebasco and hence properly included in the cost to
the service company, and what part was for Bond and Share and
therefore chargeable only to it.
Because of the importance of this case and the general principles.
it laid down, it seems appropriate to quote from the Commission's
decision in part:
"Each of the officers in question occupies .at least ..two positions: He is an
officer of Bond and Share and an officer of Ebasco.
Where his duties as an officer
of Ebasco, in a particular transaction, begin, and his duties as an officer of Bond
and Share end, cannot be determined.
That difficulty is inherent in the situation. Bond and Share, as the parent of each of the companies serviced by Ebasco,
has an abiding interest in matters pertaining to those companies.
In every
transaction by Ebasco, in which Bond and Share is somehow interested, theofficers will be acting in dual capacities-as
officers of Bond and Share and as
officers of Ebasco.
It is unreal to assume that the value of their services to each
company can be determined with any degree of accuracy.
The same is equally
true of the services of any employees whose work entails a commingling of holding
company and service company functions."

After the Ebasco decision, numerous service companies voluntarily
adjusted their practices to conform to the opinion of the Commission.
An illustration of the changes resulting is offered by The United Light
and Power Service Company, the service company in the United
Light and Power Company System." This service company had on
its pay roll practically all the officers of the system's holding companies.
These salaries, paid in the first instance by the service company,

were then recharged to the various operating and holding companies
on the basis of time allocation. In form, this was slightly different
from the Ebasco case where the holding company officials were paid
partially by the holding company and partially by the operating
'Company through the service company. The Commission, however,
found that the substance was the same in both cases. Officers and
employees of the holding company who owed their primary loyalty
to that company were rendering service for a charge to the operating
companies. In this case, the Commission reemphasized the principle
laid down in the Ebasco opinion and indicated clearly that the statu'tory prohibition of Section 13(a) against the performance of services
'for a charge by a holding company, to make sense, must also include
prohibition of the pmjor:r:qttnce of services for a charge by holding
-company officials and their staffs.
In the Middle West Service Company case,63 the principles laid
.down in Ebasco and United Light and Power cases were reaffirmed.
One of the important cases pending at the end of the year was
In the Matters of Columbia. Engineering Corporation, Columbia Gas
.& Electric Corporation." In the Ebasco opinion the Commission had
.stated that. interlocking personnel could not be permitted and that
those involved must resign either from the holding company or the
.service company. In the-Columbig ca!'e the issue has been raised that
the junctions, rather than the position held or situs on any particular
payroll, is the determinant as to whether or not a particular indi-
vidual is in reality an official or employee of the holding company.
Two cases pending at the close of the fiscal year which deserve
-eomment, involve determining, under Section 13, the proper scope of
-services for an: £ne system, as well as the services that. appropriately
-ean be rendered to various Classesof companies within a given system.
One of these cases is that of the Atlantic Utility Service Corporation 6Ii (formerly the Utility Management Corporation), the mutual
:service company in the Associated Gas and Electric Company System .
Because of the complexities involved in this case, of the changes incident to the replacement of the Hopson management by court trustees,
and of contemplated additional changes, this company has not yet
been qualified. It continues to operate under temporary exemption
provided for in the rules .and regulations of the Commission. 'Substantial- progress has already been made in conforming the company
to the statutory standards. For instance, when this company first
filed for approval it reported service fees of $4,863,191. Subsequent
revisions of its operations have reduced these fees to $1,940,805, and
even this amount remained in issue at the close of the fiscal year.

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

The major issue before the Commission in this case is whether services
to be performed by this company should not be litnited to engineering
and purchasing in order to satisfy the standards of Section 13". .
The second proceeding involving the proper scope of services
permissible to a service company was also noteworthy for various
other reasons.
During the course of the past fiscal year, the Commission was
called upon by the Vermont Public Service Commission to investigate
the servicing arrangements between the New England Power Service
Company, a subsidiary service company in the system of the New
England Power Association, and its associate operating companies,
Bellows Falls Hydro-Electric Corporation and Green Mountain Power
Corporation.
This was done pursuant to Section 13 (d) of the Act,
which provides that the Commission "at the request of * * *
a State commission, may, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
by order require a reallocation or reapportionment of costs among
member companies of a mutual service company if it finds the existing
allocation inequitable
* * *." This. was the first occasion that
a State commission had availed itself of the facilities of the Commission to investigate dealings between companies operating within
the State commission's jurisdiction and a service company outside its
jurisdiction because organized beyond the boundary of the State.
A hearing was held at Montpelier, Vt., at which representatives of
the Vermont Commission were present and participated, as well as
Commissioner Healy of this Commission. As a result of the Mont-.
pelier proceedings, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
an order requiring the service company to show cause why the prior
order, conditionally approving its organization and conduct of business, should not be revoked if certain changes in its organization and
conduct of business were not effected. Among the issues involved
were the problems of interlocking officers discussed above, the proper
scope of activities of the service company, and the economy and
efficiency of its operations. While a final order in this case had not
been issued at the close of the fiscal year, changes already agreed to
by the company have brought about substantial savings to the two
Vermont companies and the proceeding promises to be productive of
substantial results in further reducing servicing costs, not only to the
Vermont companies but to other operating companies of the New
England Power Association System.
In addition to its responsibilities as to servicing activities of companies in the registered holding company systems, Sections 13 (e)
and 13 (f) authorize the Commission to regulate to some extent
servicing activities of the so-called independent service companies
of the utility field. These sections relate to the servicing activities
rendered to any public-utility company engaged in interstate com-

merce or any registered holding company or subsidiary thereof, and
to any person whose principal business is the performance of such
contracts. Thus far the Commission has exercised this jurisdiction
to the extent of requiring by rule the:filing of reports by such persons
disclosing certain significant corporate and financial data, including a
list of utility companies serviced by such persons and the corporate
affiliations of such utility companies.
During the course of the past fiscal year the Commission had
occasion to investigate the activities of the Edison Electric Institute,
an organization which acts in the nature of a trade association for
the electric utility industry. As a result of this investigation counsel
for the Edison Electric Institute concluded that the activities of the
Institute were within the scope of Section 13, as a consequence of
which, and after discussion with the staff of the Commission, this
organization :filed a report pursuant to Rule U-13E-1. In this
connection, the question was raised as to Whether membership in the
Institute might be the basis for the exercise of regulatory jurisdiction
over its members who were not otherwise subject to the provisions
of the Act. The Institute was advised by the Director of the Public
Utilities Division that membership in the Institute would not, in and
of itself, result in subjecting member companies to the jurisdiction
of the Commission.
The Act, in its definition of service, sales, and construction contracts and other pertinent provisions, places broad statutory obligations upon the Commission. In its discharge of these obligations,
the Commission is making continuous studies, not only of intrasystem
servicing arrangements, but of all types of servicing affecting the
registered holding companies and their public-utility subsidiaries
under its jurisdiction. The investigation of the Edison Electric
Institute, referred to above, was one of such studies. The Commission, of course, must be alert to determine not only that arrangements in common practice prior to the passage of the Act are not used
to contravene the provisions of Section 13, but that new arrangements
and devices are not evolved to circumvent the intent and declarations
of Congress as defined in the Act.
Table 48 of Appendix II, page 310, indicates the number of
applications and declarations under Section 13 relating to mutual
and subsidiary service companies, received and disposed of during
the past fiscal year.
.
RULES AND REGULATIONS

During the past fiscal year the Commission reexamined the relationship of its rules and regulations to the administration of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, simplified its procedure for
passing upon applications and declarations, and completely revised

116

SEVENTH ~AL

REPORT

the text of the rules. In considering the changes in the rules, it may
be helpful to review the scope and function of rule making under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which differs sub-stantially in that respect from other Acts administered by the Commission.
Section 20 (a) empowers the Commission to "make. issue. amend,
and rescind such rules and regulations and ore ers as it may deem
necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of" the Act.
More specific authority to make rules, as well as to act by order, is
conferred by the various sections of the statute which deal with the
regulation or exemption of persons and transactions. Most of these
provisions leave to the discretion of the Commission the alternative
of dealing with 'problems in a. generalized way by rule, or of acting
specifically by order in the light of the particular facts. Because of
the extreme complexity of the holding company industry, each company and transaction within the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission presents its own problems. For that reason, regulation by
order rather than by rule has proved. generally speaking, the more
:satisfactory method of administration.
The various types of rules which have been adopted by the Commission fall within the following general classifications: (1) procedural
'rules prescribing the form and contents of applications and reports;
(2) rules granting a broad exemption to particular classes of persons
from provisions of the Act (such as intrastate holding companies.
holding companies which are primarily operating companies, and
banks which are temporarily holding companies because of the
acquisition of securities for liquidation in connection with a debt); 66
(3) rules exempting companies otherwise subject to regulation, as to
:a limited class of transactions; (4) rules requiring advance notice to
the Commission of the intention to consummate certain types of trans.actions, in order to enable the Commission to issue such orders with
reference to the proposed transactions as may be appropriate under
applicable standards of the Act; and (5) substantive rules, i. e.• rules
prescribing the standards by which particular transactions should be
governed, such as rules prescribing the uniform system of accounts
for holding companies and for mutual service companies.

has beerr primarily by order after opportunity for hearing and in the
light of the facts of a particular case. To that extent, the Act is
essentially what has been described as a "licensing" statute, i. e., one
which requires advance authorization or advance scrutiny by the
regulatory agency before it is lawful to consummate certain types of
traneactiona/"
Rules of the third and fourth categories enumerated above have
constituted an important field of rule making under the Act. These
are closely related functionally and involve the problem of prescribing, without reference to specific proposals by companies subject to
regulation, the extent to which the potential statutory jurisdiction of
the Commission will be exercised. Certain provisions of the Act (such
as Sections 7 and 10, applicable, respectively, to security issues and
acquisitions) require advance authorization from the Commission as
to certain classes of transactions, except as exemption may be granted
by rule or by order. Other provisions, notably those in Section 12
relating to intercompany transactions, require implementation by
rule or order before they become operative. The principal effect of
the Commission's rules pursuant to these provisions has been to
require the filing with the Commission of declarations of proposed
transactions, thereby enabling it to deal with them by order.
To the extent that the Commission's rules leave unregulated transactions which are within its statutory jurisdiction, there is always the
danger that there will be loopholes for abuses of the character which
the Act was intended to prevent. On the other hand, it has been
necessary: to take-into account the desirability of concentrating the
regulatory efforts of the Commission upon what have appeared to be
the most serious and pressing problems and, also, the desirability of
minimizing the expense to the industry incident to proceedings before
the Commission. The attempt to preserve a balance between these
conflicting considerations had led to frequent changes in the rules, as
experience indicated that a rule drafted with the intention of fitting
certain types of transactions, to which the attention of the Commission had been called, had the unintended result of excepting from
regulation certain types of transactions which call for close scrutiny or
failed to exempt others which did not appear to require such attention.
Frequent changes of this character proved inconvenient, and also
resulted in great textual complexity in the rules. The elimination of
this difficulty through a general revision of the rules has been closely
related to the adoption by the Commission of a new procedure for
disposing of applications and declarations without hearing, except in
cases where substantial difficulties are presented.

Sixth Annual Report of the Commission." As pointed out in that
Report, Commissioner Healy dissented from the adoption of the new
procedure, stating his belief that the procedure was invalid wherever
the Act requires a finding by the Commission as a condition precedent
to granting an order permitting contemplated action. He suggested.
an alternative procedure which he believed could be equally effective
in saving time." Despite this difference of opinion among the Commissioners, there was agreement that unimportant cases could be
disposed of by order without substantial expense or trouble to the
company concerned, and that the exercise of appropriate discretion in
dealing with particular applications afforded a more flexible method
of sifting out important and unimportant transactions than could be
accomplished in the exercise of the rule-making powers of the Commission. By reason of the availability of this procedure, and by
relating more closely the content of the application and the scope of
the review given to it to the importance and difficulties of the problems
presented by a particular transaction, it has been possible to dispense
with many automatic exemptions by rule as to classes of transactions.
Generally speaking, the effect of the revision of the rules is to require
advance notice to the Commission with respect to a larger proportion
of the transactions which are w ithin its potential statutory [urisdiction. The elimination of numerous exemptions of infrequent use and
of elaborate exceptions and qualifications to such exemptions, has
made possible a considers ble simplification in the text of the rules.
A number of more important substantive changes in the rules were
adopted in connection with the general revision of the rules or otherwise in the course of the year. One important change was a substantial narrowing of the automatic exemption previously granted to
non-utility subsidiaries of registered holding companies. Generally
speaking, the administrative difficulties of the regulating non-utility
subsidiaries are greater than those involved in the regulation of
utility subsidiaries. For that reason the Commission had concluded,
in the early days of its administration of the Act, to limit its activities
for the time being primarily to the regulation of the registered holding
companies and their utility subsidiaries. However, the Commission
was required by Section 11 to consider the problem of the retainability
of non-utility interest, dependent upon whether or not they are
"reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to

the operations of" integrated public-utility systems. In the course
of its studies in that connection, the Commission reached the conclusion that it was both necessary and feasible to substantially narrow
the scope of the exemption heretofore granted to non-utility subsidiarres.
The revised rules also included two new accounting rules under
Section 15 of the Act. Rule U-27 requires operating gas and electric
utility companies, which are not otherwise required by either the
Federal Power Commission or a State Commission to conform to a
classification of accounts, to follow the Federal Power Commission
classification in the case of electric utility companies and to follow
the classification prescribed by the National Association of Railroad
and Utilities Commissioners (which is substantially similar) in the
case of gas utility companies." Rule U-28 prohibits registered holding companies or their subsidiaries from distributing to security
holders, or publishing, financial statements which are inconsistent
with the book accounts of the company or with the financial statements filed with this Commission by or on behalf of such companies.
Rule U-50, requiring competitive bidding and which became effective
on May 7, 1941, is discussed elsewhere in this report."
The revised rules were distributed in draft form to the industry
and comments were invited. A number of constructive comments
were received and incorporated in the rules. The Commission has
continued its policy of consulting the industry before enacting or
revising rules. For instance, the difficult problem of requiring competitive bidding for the purchase of public-utility and holding-company securities was presented to the industry early in March 1940,
and a copy of 'a staff report on this question was distributed in
December 1940. After conferences and public hearing had been held
and briefs were filed, the rule was adopted on April 7, 1941, and made
effective May 7, 1941.73
In Considering the feasibility of advance discussion of rules with the
industry or of delaying the period between promulgation and the
effective date of a rule, it is necessary to take into account the char11 The Commission had previously prescribed Uniform System of Accounts for holding companies and
service companies, the accounting problems of which are peculiarly subject to its [urisdrcnon, As to operating companies, however, SectIon 20 (b) prescribes that the accounting requirements of this Commisson
shall not be inconsistent with requirements imposed by other Federal regulatory authorities or by State
commissions. While this limitation is not strictly applicable to the companies which are not subject to
such accounting regulation, the Commission, nevertheless, concluded that it was desirable, in the interest
of uniformity , to follow the uniform systems which had been adopted after considcrable study by the Federal
Power Commission and the National Assocllllion of Railroad and Utilities CommIssIoners.

ference on a proposed Rule U.51, relating to payments on indebtedness held by parent holding companies
by subsidiary companies which are in arrears as to dividends on their publiely-held preferred stock. A
draft of this proposed rule was distributed to the industry on April 16, 1941,and a pu blic conference WllS

acter of the rule-making function involved. It is recognized that
advance notice and opportunity for comment are both feasible and
desirable in the case of a rule which requires-substantial changes in the
practices of the industry, such, for example, as the competitive bidding
rule. On the other hand, where the rule-making function involves
selection of the types of cases which are to be scrutinized by the
Commission, the public interest demands that the Commission be
free to act promptly as situations requiring investigation are brought
to its attention and that it be able to preserve the status quo pending
investigation. Otherwise, it can only lock doors after horses are
stolen. Moreover, rules of this character contemplate that the essential
regulatory decisions, relating to the merits of the transactions involved, will be determined by order after opportunity for hearing.
It would seem that such an opportunity for hearing is adequate
protection to the industry, although it will occur after the promulgation of the rule.
An illustration of the occasional necessity to adopt a rule, effective
forthwith and without advance discussion, is Rule U-65 prohibiting
the expenditure of corporate funds in connection with solicitation of
proxies unless (subject to certain exceptions) a declaration is filed
notifying the Commission of the proposed transaction, and such a
declaration has become effective--thereby giving the Commission an
opportunity to take appropriate action by order. In connection with
the promulgation of the rule, the Commission stated that "the immediate effectiveness of the rule does not change its general policy of
submitting utility.rules to the industry for comment prior to adoption," and that "immediate effectiveness was necessary to prevent
substantial expenditures of corporate funds by the management of a
registered holding company to employ solicitors to aid them in obtaining proxies in a contested election before the Commission had an
opportunity to pass upon the propriety of such expenditures under
the provisions of Section 12 (e) of the Act". 7.
One possible reason for allowing a lapse of time between the publication and the effective date of a rule is to give those affected an
opportunity to become familiar with the rule. The importance of
this consideration is dependent upon the content of the particular rule
involved. As to rules adopted under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, its importance is minimized because of the highly
centralized organization of the industry and the comparatively small
number of individuals who, as counselor as officers of the companies
concerned, direct the activities within the scope of the Act and subject to such rules; also, because it is part of the business of these individuals to closely follow all developments in the administration of the
Act. Moreover, it is sometimes feasible te give specific notice of the

121

promulgation of a new rule to those whom the Commission has reason
to believe are contemplating transactions within its scope, as was the
.case in connection with Rule U-65 referred to above. Another factor
which may be relevant in determining the appropriate time lag between the promulgation and the effective date of a rule is the extent
of the notice which may have been given prior to its promulgation
that the Commission had under consideration the adoption of such a
rule.
EXEMPTION OF COMPANIES FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935

Sections 2 and 3 of the Act contain definitions and exemption provisions which determine the status of companies as subject to or excluded from the regulatory provisions of the Act. The definitions
are not entirely self-operative, but their applicability depends in part
upon the exercise of the rule-making power by the Commission 1IDd
in part upon its making certain specified findings after opportunity
for hearing. Thus "electric utility company" and "gas utility company" mean, respectively, companies owning or operating facilities
for the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy or
for the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas. The Commission is authorized to exclude from these categories companies primarily engaged in non-utility business and having only a small amount
of utility business."
A "holding company" under the Act is a company which has one
or more utility subsidiaries. The holding-company subsidiary relationship depends prima facie upon ownership of 10 percent or more of
the voting securities, but the Commission on application may declare
'that the relationsbip does not exist where it is found that neither control nor "controlling influence" is exercised, and may upon its own
motion declare the relationship to exist irrespective of stock ownership where it finds that controlling influence is exercised. Section
3 (a) specifies certain categories of holding companies which are entitled to exemption unless and except insofar as the Commission may
find the exemption detrimental to the public interest, etc.
These definition and exemption provisions have been of considerable importance as applied to the determination of the status of
companies and relationships in existence at the time the Act became
effective. Problems will continue to arise from time to time as to
their application to new situations. The initial volume of exemption
applications was very large. While many of these applications presented relatively simple questions, many others presented very
difficult issues and, because of the great variety of problems presented,
it seemed desirable for the Commission to proceed cautiously in the
75RuIe U-7; SoId1l Penn Oil ComfHlnv, d. al., Holding Company .Act Release No. 2625.

122

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

application of the statutory standards.
It was important to avoid
creating interpretative precedents which might prove embarrassing
as applied to superficially similar, but essentially different, facts.
Some of the cases also involved very difficult issues of fact as to the
exercise of control or controlling influence. Where an issue of this
kind arises, all of the company officers involved who are most familiar
with the facts are, of course, interested in establishing absence of
control. Accordingly, it is necessary for the Conunission to undertake extensive field investigations in order to develop the relevant
evidence, which is largely circumstantial in character. These cases
involve long hearings, voluminous records, and careful study before
the Conunission is in a position to decide them.
Most of the exemption provisions grant a temporary exemption
pending action by the Commission where an application has been
filed in good faith. This made it possible for the Commission, without hardship to the applicants, to postpone action upon some of the
more difficult applications, in order to give them the most careful
consideration and also, in some instances, to give the right-of-way
to what seemed more pressing business. This, of course, has involved
the disadvantage of delaying the application of the regulatory provisions of the Act to certain important companies which have ultimately been denied exemption.
During the past year the Commission has decided a number of
important cases arising under Section 2 (a) (8) of the Act, involving
applications by prima facie subsidiary companies (10 percent or more
of the voting securities of which were owned by other companies) to
be declared not to be subsidiary companies.
The Detroit Edison Company filed an application under Section
2 (a) (8) to be declared not to be a subsidiary of The North American
Company, the owner of 19.28 percent of its voting securities, of American Light & Traction Company, the owner of 20.27 percent. of its
voting securities, or of The United Light and Power Company and
The United Light and Railways Company, parents of American
Light & Traction Company."
The record in that case established
that The North American Company had caused the incorporation of
the applicant; that thereafter that company had "maintained a
position of importance and influence in Edison's affairs based on stock
ownership or historical association or both" ; and that the relationship
between the two companies was such as to preclude the findings
requisite to the granting of the requested order with respect to .The
North American Company. The application was granted with
respect to American Light & Traction Company.
On an appeal taken by The Detroit Edison Company, the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the order of the ComII Holding

mission denying such application."
With respect to the issue as to
the existence of a "controlling influence" by North American over
Detroit Edison, the court said, in part:
"The present Act undertakes to bring within its ambit all subsidiaries subject
to 'controlling influences' of a parent.
This phrase should be construed ill the
light of the purpose of the Act of which it is a part, and when understood in this
setting and in the light of its ordinary signification, it means the act or process,
or power of producing an effect which may be without apparent force or direct
authority and is effective in checking or directing action, or exercising restraint'
or preventing free action. The phrase as here used, does not necessarily mean
that those exercising controlling influence must be able to carry their point. A
controlling influence may be effective without accomplishing its purpose fully.

*

*

*

*

*

*

*

"The fact that the North American Company had abandoned some of the
characteristics of 'controlling influence' over the petitioner at the time of the
hearing, did not require the Commission to disregard prior interrelated activities.
There is no showing that its latent power to resume such control has been extinguished.
The relationship is such that they may enter into similar activities
in the immediate future.
United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association,
166 U. S. 290, 308; Labor Board v. Newport News Company, 241 U. S. 251."

The court also held that, in considering whether the "controlling
influence" was' such "as to make it necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that
* * *" Detroit Edison be subject to the obligations imposed by
the Act upon subsidiaries of holding companies, 'it was not necessary
for the Commission to show a history of abuses of the type specified
in Section 1 of the Act. As to this, the court said:
"The phrase 'public interest' as used means that the public has some pecuniary
interest or an interest by which legal rights or liabilities of its individual members
are affected by the operation of the utility.
The phrase is not to be construed as
requiring the Commission to find that the conduct of the applicant's business has
or will affect the public adversely. The statute contemplates action prospectively.
It is a preventive measure intended to regulate action before the interests of those
concerned are adversely affected. The prime factors in determining statutory
exemption are the size and extent of the company involved, the inter-company
relationship, the distribution of its securities and the opportunity presented
because of the relationship between the parent and subsidiary for excessive charges
for services, construction work, equipment and materials, and the transactions
entered into in which evil may result, because of the absence of arms-length
bargaining or restraint of free and independent competition.
Giving due weight
to the past transactions of petitioner with the North American and the continuing
opportunity for the resumption of such activities and the extent of the petitioner's
business and 'the widely scattered ownership of its stock, the Commission committed no error in denying petitioner exemption from the present Act."

The American Gas and Electric Company, a registered holding
company, filed an application pursuant to Section 2 (a) (8) for an order
declaring it not to be a subsidiary of Electric, Bond and Share Company, likewise a registered holding company and the owner of 17.51

percent of its voting securities.
The findings and opinion of the Commission, based upon the record made at the hearing on that application, reviewed at some length the organization of the applicant, the
contacts between its management and the executives of Electric Bond
and Share Company, and the participation of the latter in applicant's
affairs both from a financing and an operating standpoint, and concluded by stating:
"Upon consideration of all the circumstances of this case, we cannot find, as
requested by applicant, that its 'management orpolicies * *
are not subject to
a controlling influence, directly or indirectly
* * * so as to make it necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers
that the applicant be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed'
by the. Act upon subsidiary companies of holding companies."

*

The requested order was therefore denied."
Similar conclusions were reached in the applications of The Hartford
Gas Company with respect to The United Gas Improvement Company and Connecticut Gas and Coke Company; 79 Panhandle Eastern
Pipe Line Company with respect to Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation and Columbia Oil & Gasoline Corporation." and Columbia Oil &
Gasoline Corporation with respect to Columbia Gas & Electric
Corporation; 81 and Paul Smith's Electric Light and Power and Railroad Company with respect to Associated Gas and Electric Company
and its subsidiary holding companies,"
Not all the applications under this section, however, have resulted
in denials, for during the past year the Commission granted applications pursuant to Section 2 (a) (8) with respect to the relationship
of Reading Gas Company to Consumers Gas Company and The
United Gas Improvement Companyj " and with respect to the relationship of Wisconsin Valley Improvement Company to WJSCOO'llrin
Public Service Company and the Wisconsin Power and Light Company.
Section 3 (a) of the Act provides in substance that the Commission
shall exempt any holding company "and every subsidiary company
thereof as such" from the provisions of the Act if such holdmg company fits the description set forth in anyone of the five subsections of
that section unless and except insofar as it finds the exemption detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.

In September 1940', the Commission denied the application of
. Public Service Company of Oklahoma, filed pursuant to Sections
3(a) (1) and 3(a) (2), for an exemption as a holding company with
respeet- to Southwestern Light & Power Company. In discussing
the standards of subsection (2) of Section 3(a), the Commission stated
that "the most important consideration in determining whether a
holding company is 'predominantly a public-utility company' is the
relative size of the sudsidiaries and their business as compared with
that of a parent company" and then held that since it appeared
that the fixed gl'OSSutility assets, the gross operating revenues, and
the net operating revenues of the subsidiary each exceeded 38 percent
of those of the applicant, the conditions precedent to the granting of
an application under said subsection had not been complied with."
It was concluded that the applicant received a material part of its
income from its subsidiary "the loss of which would .be something
more than de minimis to the company."
The Commission granted the Section 3 (a) (1) application of
Pennsylvania-Ges & Electrio company for an exemption as a holdrng
company with respect-to its three wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely,
Interborough Gas Company, Conewago Gas Company, and Peoples
Light Company of Pittston, upon a showing that such applicant and
each of its subsidiaries were Pennsylvania corporations carrying on
their business as gas utility companies solely within that State.86
Subsection (3) of Section 3 (a) applies to a holding company which
is "only incidentally a holding company, being primarily engaged
or interested in one or more businesses" other than that of a publicutility company and either (A) does not derive any material part of
its income from its public-utility subsidiaries, or (B) does derive a
material part of its income from such subsidiaries but the latter are
substantially wholly-owned.
From many standpoints the most important decision rendered by
the Commission under Section 3 (a) (3) was the one involving the
application of Cities Service Company. That applicant had 110 gas
and electric utility and non-utility subsidiaries which were doing
business in many States and foreign countries. lis utility subsidiaries included Cities Service Power & Light Company, a registered
holding company with 50 subsidiaries, most of which were electric
utility companies serving over 500,000 customers in 16 States .. Investments in these utility subsidiaries represented, as of December
31, 1938, approximately 16 percent of the applicant's total investments, the aggregate fixed assets of its consolidated utility subsidiaries represented 47.3 percent of the fixed assets of all consolidated

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

subsidiaries, and 38.0 percent of the fixed assets of all subsidiaries.
For the year ending on said date, the aggregate gross revenues of the
applicant's consolidated utility subsidiaries, exclusive of the 3 gas
utility companies serving Kansas City and various towns in Kansas,
Nebraska, and Oklahoma, amounted to $70,257,800, or 32.6 percent
of the aggregate gross revenues of the applicant and all of its consolidated subsidiaries, including said gas utility companies.
The Commission stated that it was of the opinion that the question
whether a holding company was only incidentally a holding company
"must be determined in each case upon consideration of a variety of circumstances;
such as the relationship between the gas and electric operations of the company's
utility subsidiaries and the other business or businesses in 'which it is engaged or
interested-i.
e., whether the business of the utility subsidiaries is incidental or
accessory to the non-utility business or is wholly unrelated to it-the size of the
company's utility subsidiaries and the scope of their operations, and, where the
utility business is small, the company's stake in the utility business as compared
with its interest in other lines of business."

The application for exemption pursuant to subsection (3) of Section
3 (a) was denied because the Commission was unable to find that the
applicant was "only incidentally a holding company, being primarily
engaged or interested in one or more businesses other than the business
of a public-utility company." 86
Pending the determination of the above described application of
Cities Service Company, that company pledged all of the voting
securities of Cities Service Power & Light Company, which it owned,
with the Harris Trust and Savings Bank as additional security for its
own debentures and gave that bank the voting rights with respect
thereto. A similar arrangement was made pertaining to all of the
applicant's holdings ill certain other utility subsidiaries. The contention was then made that the phrase "power to vote" contained-in
Section 2 (a) (8) (A) modified the word "owned" and that since the
applicant had no power to vote the pledged securities it was not a
"holding company" within the definition of the Act. On the basis
of the previous decision in H. M. Byllesby & Company;" to the effect
that such phrase qualifies only the word "held" and not the words
"owned" or "controlled," the Commission refused to adopt such an
interpretation.
It also denied the applicant's contention that
"owned" must be construed to exclude ownership which is not accompanied by voting power and held that a pledgor of voting securities
is the owner thereof within the meaning of Section 2 (a) (8) (A)
although the voting rights thereon had been transferred to the
pledgee. The Cities Service Company did not appeal from this decision but subsequently registered.

Subsection (4) of Section 3 (a) provides an exemption for a company
which is temporarily a holding company solely by reason of the acquisition of securities for purposes of liquidation of a bona fide debt or in
connection with a bona fide arrangement to underwrite securities.
Pursuant to this subsection the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
Company 88 was granted an exemption for six months, while the exemption of the Manufacturers Trust Company was extended for 9
months 89 with respect to securities of utility companies which they
owned. In this connection, the Commission pointed out that a
holding company receiving an exemption under subsection (4) of
Section 3 (a) must within a reasonable time dispose of its utility
holdings because the word "temporarily" used therein negatived any
intention that such company should receive a continuous exemption.
Subsection (5) of Section 3 (a) relates to the exemption of a holding
company which is not itself a public-utility company and which
derives no material part of its income from utility subsidiaries operating in the United States. The application of Cities Service Company also requested an exemption under subsection (5) of Section 3
(a), that applicant contending that such subsection was applicable to
domestic as well as to foreign systems. After reviewing the legislative
history of this subsection, the Commission concluded that the exemption provided thereby "is available only to essentially foreign holding
company systems, and that the applicant cannot qualify under this
section since the great bulk of its utility subsidiaries are within the.
United States."
In its findings and opinion 'in the Cities Service Company case, the
Commission also interpreted the "unless and except" clause in the
first sentence of Section 3 (a) as being designed "to prevent the exemption of any holding company which, although it might meet the formal
conditions under Section 3 (a), is essentially the type of company
'at which the purposes of the legislation are directed'," and found it
would be detrimental to the public interest and to the interest of
investors and consumers in the United States to grant the application
of that company.
The request for an extension of the exemption of Dominion Gas and
Electric Company, both as a holding company owning securities of
companies operating in Canada and as a subsidiary of International
Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company, was denied,
except with respect to Section 13. The Commission found that,
although the applicant satisfied the factual requirements of both
Section 3 (a) (5) and Section 3 (b), the granting of the exemptions
would be detrimental to the public interest and to the interests of
United States investors, who owned a substantial percentage of the

securities, since the record revealed maI;LYinstances where its officers
and directors had acted in "wanton disregard of the fiduciary duties
owed to stockholders." 90
Section 3 (b) provides that the Commission may exempt. any subsidiary from any provision of the Act if it finds that such subsidiary
derives no material part of its income from sources within the United
States and neither it nor any of its subsidiary companies is a publicutility company operating in the United States and that the application of such provisions to such subsidiary is not necessary in the
public interest or for the protection of investors.
With respect to the foreign subsidiaries the Commission has generally found, with specified exceptions, that it was not necessary in
the public interest. or for the protection of investors that they be
subject to the duties and obligations imposed upon them as subsidiaries of registered holding companies by Sections 6, 9, 11 (g),
12 (b), 12 (c), 12 (f) and (g), 12 (h) (2), 13, 15, and 17 (c). Such
qualified exemption was, however, granted only until June 30, 1943.91
It has been the policy of the Commission in granting exemptions
under Section 3 (b) to retain jurisdiction with respect to further
investment of funds in these companies by investors in the United
States and over other matters which may affect United States citizens.
During the year the Commission extended the Section 3 (b) exemptions of the following companies: Southern Utilities Company,
Limited," Great Northern Gas Company, Limited," New Brunswick
Power Company," and Consolidated Electric and Gas Company."

Detroit Edison Company's petition and upheld the Commission's
determination.
Lewis H. Morris, a stockholder of International Paper & Power
Company, filed a petition to review an order of the Commission dismissing an application of International Paper & Power Company with
respect to a proposed change in its capitalization.
The Commission
had previously passed upon this proposal 96 and at the suit of a stockholder the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had held
that the Commission was without jurisdiction in the premises because
International Paper- & Power Company, having an application for
exemptioir'pending, was not it registered holding company."
Thereafter, the Commission granted the application for exemption of International Paper & Power Company and dismissed the proceeding
relating to that company's proposed change in capitalization.
Morris
thereupon appealed and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit upheld this action by the Commission and dismissed Morris'
petition.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to eliminate
l'lJ8flipulation..-Jlndother abuses in the trading of securities both on
the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter
markets
which together constitute the Nation's facilities for trading in
securities; to make available to the public information regarding
the condition of corporations whose securities are traded on any
national securities exchange; and to control the flow of the Nation's
credit resources into its securities markets.
CONFERENCES ON PROPOSALS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

In May of 1940 certain bills were pending before both houses of
Congress to amend the Securities Act of 1933 in certain respects.'
The Commission was then aware that representatives of certain stock
exchanges, as well as representatives of over-the-counter brokers
and dealers, also. were advancing additional proposals for various
amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The pending
bills were referred by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce of the House of Representatives to this Commission for
its consideration and comment. Because of the close relationship
between the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, the Commission suggested the advisability of its consultation
with the investment banking. and dealer associations and with representatives of exchanges on all aspects of proposed amendments to
each of the Acts prior to the submission by the Commission of its
views on. this.Iegislation. With the approval of the Chairman of the
House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce and the
Chsirman of the Committee on Banking and Currency of the Senate,
the Commission undertook a study, with representatives of the
securities industry and others, of the advisability of various suggested
amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the
Securities Act of 1933. The conferences on the general program, at
which all of the proposals for amendment of both Acts were exhaustively discussed, commenced in the fall of 1940 and continued at
intervals during the past fiscal year. Throughout the year the ComI

mission has endeavored, on the basis of these conferences, to work out
as many areas of agreement as possible,"
PROCEEDINGS
UNDER SECTION
19 (b) WITH RESPECT
TO THE
MULTIPLE TRADING 3 RULE OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE

On January 2, 1941, the Commission instituted its first proceeding
under Section 19 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act"ot.1'934~"-\Vh1ch
section empowers the Commission under certain conditions to alter
or supplement the rules of an exchange in respect of certain matters,
if the exchange itself refuses to make such changes. On that date,
the Commission served notice upon the N ew York Stock Exchange
of a hearing on the so-called 1/ multiple trading rule" of that exchange.
The notice of hearing was the culmination of an extended series of
staff investigations on the consequences of the rule, which were
followed by informal requests by the Commission that the New York
Stock Exchange rescind the rule. Upon the repeated refusal of that
exchange to comply with these requests, and upon its refusal to
comply with a subsequent formal request made pursuant to .the
statute, this proceeding was instituted.
The recent history of the N ew York Stock Exchange's multiple
trading rule dates from September 28, 1939, when a "Special Committee on Multiple Exchange Trading" was appointed by that
exchange to study dealings on other exchanges in securities listed on
that exchange. On February 28, 1940, pursuant to the recommendation of this committee, the Board of Governors of the New York
Stock Exchange directed its Committee on Member Firms to proceed
to enforce Section 8 of Article XVI of its Constitution.
This section
provides:
"Whenever the Board of Governors, by the affirmative vote of seventeen Governors, shall determine that a member or allied member is connected, either through
a partner or otherwise, with another exchange or similar organization in the City
of New York which permits dealings in any securities dealt in on the Exchange,
or deals directly or indirectly upon such other exchange or organization, or deals
publicly outside the Exchange in securities dealt in on the Exchange such member
or allied member may be suspended or expelled as the Board may determine."

Accordingly, tble Committee on Member Firms, on July 12, 1940,
adopted
the multiple trading rule, holding 'that:
,
,

, On August 7, 1941,the Commission rendered Its report to the two houses of Congress upon the various
proposals for amendment which had been canvassed during these conferences.
, For a description of multiple trading and Its history, refer to "Report to the Commission by the Trading
and Exchange Division on the Problem of Multiple TradlnJ( on Securities Exchanges" published by the Com.
mission in November 1940. The interest of the New York Stock Exchange in multlp~ trading lies In the
trading on other exchanges in Issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange and also listed or admitted to
unlisted trading privileges on other exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange maintains that It has not
as yet taken any position with respect to multiple trading in its general aspects, but that the rule referred
to In the accompanying discussion relates only to the prevention of its own members from acting as odd.
lot dealers or specialists and from publicly dealing for their own account oTranother exchange in securities
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

PART V--THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE.ACT OF 1934

"* * * after September 1, 1940, any member, allied member or member
firm acting as an odd-lot dealer or specialist or otherwise publicly dealing for his
or its own account (directly or indirectly through a joint account or other arrangement) on another exchange in securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange
shall be subject to proceedings under Section 8 of Article XVI."
The Commission's staff, which was already engaged in a study of
the problems of the.regional exchanges, immediately accelerated its
efforts and concentrated its study on the effects of the multiple trading rule upon such exchanges. Basing its conclusions in part upon
the staff's field investigations in Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh, the Commission on August 22, 1940, through
Acting Chairman Sumner T. Pike, requested the New York Stock
Exchange to postpone the effective date of the ruling. In part, his
letter said:

"* * * having regard * * * to the fact that the Commission's preliminary study indicates that the public interest may be involved, the Commission
feels that an extension of the effective date of the ruling for at least sixty days
would be advisable."
The New 'York"Stock Exchange replied' on August 28 that its
"Committee on Member Firms was specifically authorized to grant
any extensions of time necessary to prevent undue hardship to any
member firm affected. This Committee has already granted a
number of extensions of from 30 to 60 days and will be glad to receive
applications from any others that have a legitimate reason for postponing action." However, the exchange refused to accede to a
blanket extension of the effective date.
On October 24, 1940, the Commission, having at hand a summary
of its staff's findings and having in mind the impending termination
of lhe '60~ay extensions granted by the New York Stock Exchange,
released a "Summary of Findings and Conclusions to be Contained
in Report to the Commission by the Trading and Exchange Division
on the Problem of Multiple Exchange Trading." Simultaneously,
Commissioner Pike, in a letter to the New York Stock Exchange,
requested rescission of the multiple trading rule. His letter said in
part:
»-r

"You have assured us that you have no desire to do any injury to the national
system of regional seiluritiefiimarkets.
Because .tKe-findings of its staff investigation show that enforcement of your ruling will, in fact, have this result with
consequent injury to the investing public in the regions affected, the Commission requests that your Board of Governors rescind its resolution pursuant to
which the Committee on Member Firms issued its ruling of July 12, 1940."

The New York Stock Exchange, replying on October 30, refused to
comply with the Commission's request but instead it acceded to an
alternative suggestion by the Commission and extended existing

REPORT

exemptions-to DeeernbervI, 1940, pending the full report' on multiple
trading which was then heing prepared for publication.
The full report was made public on November 22, 1940, under
the title "Report to the Commission by the- Trading and Exchange
Division on the Problem of Multiple Trading on Securities Exchanges."
The report dealt in detail with the historical developments of multiple
trading and the mechanics of such trading and described the magni- ,
tude of multiple trading and recent trends in its volume. The report
then discussed the effects of multiple trading upon the distribution of
business- among exchanges and among various 'groups of brokers end
dealers, terminating with an analysis of the effects of the multiple
trading rule upon brokers and dealers, upon exchanges, and upon the .
public. The report concludes:

"* * *

the consequences of the New York Stock Exchange's action will be
undesirable and may prove to be extremely serious for individual investors in
some localities and for the public at large. Local industry, as well as local investors, look to their local financial centers to afford, as they should, a capital market
as well as a market in which outstanding securities may be traded under the safeguards which normally attend the functioning of an organized exchange. The
regional exchanges have played, and should continue to play, an integral and an
essential role in developing and serving industry, the financial community and
the investing public within their regions. Therefore, the action of the New York
Stock Exchange, even though apparently directed solely to its own members,
materially affeets inter-exebsnge competition in a marinei- harmful to local industry, the general public, and to individual investors."

On December 11, 1940, after having extended existing exemptions
to January 1, 1941, the New York Stock Exchange expressed disagreement with the findings in the staff's report and stated in a letter
to the Commission that it" must respectfully decline to accede to the
request contained in your letter of October 24." On December 20,
1940, the Commission, acting pursuant to the provisions of Section
19. (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, formally requested the
New York S~ck Exchange to
"effect such changes in its rules, as that term Is deflned by Section 6 (a) (-3) of the
Act; as may be necessary to make it clear that the rules of the exchange, or their
enforcement, shall not prevent any member from acting as an odd-lot dealer or
specialist or otherwise dealing upon any other exchange outside the City of New
York of which he is a member."

By letter dated December 27, 1940, the president of the New York
Stock Exchange. advised -
the Commission that _the exchange refused
to comply with the above-mentioned request. Thereupon, on
January 2, 1941, the Commission instituted a proceeding to determine
whether the Commission should, pursuant to Section 19 (b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of ,1934, by rule or regulation or by order
alter or supplement the niJet of such exchange insofar as necessary or
appropriate to effect the changes requested by the Commission on

December 29, 1940. Pending a final determination of the question,
the New'York Stock Exchange extended exemption from the rule's
provisions to those of its members who would have been directly
affected by its provisions at the time of its promulgation.
Hearings pursuant to the January 2 order were held from January
21 to January 30, 1941, at which time witnesses called by the Commission offered testimony on the history, methods, and extent of
multiple trading and on the consequences of the multiple trading rule.
At the same time, the New York Stock Exchange availed itself of the
opportunity to. challenge the testimony of the Oommission's witnesses
and to present its own case in full. On March 17, 1941, the trial
examiner's report was filed and on May 8 oral argument was held
before the Commission. The decision of the Commission in the
matter was pending at the close of the fiscal year.'
PROTECTION

OF CUSTOMERS'

SECURITmS

On November 15, 1940, the Commission promulgated two substantially identical rules known as Rules X-8C-1 and X-I5C2-1 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to carry out the principles of
Section 8 (c) of the Act governing the pledging of customers' securities.
Generally speaking, the rules prohibit brokers and dealers from risking
their customers' securities as collateral to finance their own trading,
speculating, or -underwriting ventures: Accordingly, the rules, subject to certain exceptions, put into operation the three basic standards
of desirable brokerage practice which are embodied in Section 8 (c).
The first is that brokers or dealers must not commingle the securities
of different customers as collateral for loans without the consent of
each customer. Second, a broker or dealer must not commingle his
customers' securities with his own under the same pledge. Finally,
and of the greatest practical importance, a broker or dealer must not
pledge customers' securities for more than the total amount which
his customers owe him.
The rules were adopted-under both Section 15 (c) and Section 8 (c)
of the Act in order that :uniformity oJ regulation would be achieved
with respect to all branches of the brokerage industry, regardless of
whether those subject to the rules are members of exchanges, brokers,
or dealers doing business through the medium of .members, or overthe-counter brokers or dealers who do not handle any stock exchange
business. Because of the complexity of the credit mechanisms affected by these so-called "hypothecation rules" and because of the possibility that compliance with the rules would entail certain readjustments in the business methods of brokers and dealers, they were not

No. 3033). The Commission altered the exchange rnle. The exchange subsequently indicated Its acqui-

escence.

SEVENTH .ANNUAL REPORT

made effective until February 24, 1941. This deferred effective date
allowed a lapse of over 3 months during which the industry could
adapt itself to their requirements.
The processes of conference and discussion which preceded the Commission's adoption of the rules., as well as its efforts to assist the approximately six thousand members, brokers, and dealers who are
subject to the rules in complying with. their provisions, may be briefly
summarized.
After extended study of the problems involved in the
pledging and repledging of customers' securities by brokers and
dealers, and following the customary practice of the Commission, a
tentative draft of the rules was submitted, under date of November
24, 1939, to representatives of brokerage and banking interests for
their study and comment.
In addition to obtaining the written
comment of the national securities exchanges, the American Institute
of Accountants, and certain accounting firms specializing in brokerage
problems, intensive conferences were undertaken with representatives
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the New
York Stock Exchange, the N ew York Curb Exchange, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the clearing house banks
of the City of New York, which handle the major portion of the
Nation's brokerage loans. These conferences extended well into 1940.
As a result, the rules, in the form in which they were promulgated,
contained numerous provisions and exemptions based upon suggestions emanating from these sources.
EXCHANGES

AND

EXEMPTED

FROM

REGISTRATION

During the past fiscal year there has been one change in the number of exchanges registered with the Commission as national secnrities exchanges. No change has occurred in the number of exchanges exempted from such registration.
Pursuan t to the provisions of Section 6 (f) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the New York Real Estate Securities Exchange, Inc.,
made application to the Commission on May 26, 1941, for the withdrawal of its registration as a national securities exchange. This application was granted by the Commission in its orde» of June 4, 1941,
and the WIthdrawal became effective June 16,1941. In its application,
the exchange-stated:
"The undersigned hereby requests withdrawal of said registration for the reason
that the Board of, Governors, after all possible efforts to improve and increase its
activities, has found it impracticable to overcome certain difficulties and obstacles
which stand in the way of making it the useful instrument for public service which
its founders and members envisaged."

The 19 registered exchanges and th~ 6 exchanges. exempted from
registration as of June 30, 194f, are as follows:

Act of 1934, which applications were pending at the close of the fiscal year, and

Some changes have been made in the rules, practices, and organization of the registered and exempted exchanges as reflected in their
applications for registration or exemption. Consequently, during the
past fiscal year, the national securities exchanges filed 157 amendments
to their applications, and 26 amendments were received from exempted
exchanges. Each of these amendments was studied and analyzed,
not only that the Commission might determine compliance with
relevant legislation and regulations, but also to the end that appropriate comments and suggestions could be addressed to the exchanges
concerned in order to facilitate the performance of their public
obligations.
During the past fiscal year, national securities exchanges have been
reporting monthly to the Commission all cases of disciplinary action
taken against their members or member firms. These cases .have

been recorded and studied with a view toward strengthening or
improving those rules which indicate a possible weakness in the
disciplinary machinery of the exchanges.

During the year the Commission cooperated with the Treasury
Department in the regulation of such securities transactions in domestic markets originating in occupied countries as came under the
so-called "freezing order." 5 It conducted investigations to ascertain
the effectiveness of the controls over such transactions and prior to
the adoption of the amendment to the "freezing order" on June 14,
1941, extending this order to include all transactions originating in
continental Europe, investigated and reported on the feasibility of
such action. Upon request of the Treasury Department, it has
considered and made suggestions with respect to proposed amendments to the regulations and licenses issued under the "freezing
order," and has reviewed and given opinions on the desirability of
granting specific applications for licenses. The Commission rendered
assistance in developing a program for taking a census of the holdings
of securities of foreigners in domestic enterprises and has prepared
and submitted analyses and studies of the values of many of the
British owned securities and direct investments in the United States,
including a special study of British ownership of insurance companies.
It has also conferred with the Treasury Department with respect to
a program for the orderly liquidation of British investments in American enterprises.
In addition the Commission, from time to time, has cooperated
with other governmental agencies in connection with problems arising
out of domestic transactions in the securities of aggressor nations and .
transactions in domestic securities originating in foreign countries
or for foreign accounts.
SURVEILLANCE

OF COMMODITY

MARKETS

The Commission has recently undertaken surveillance of certain
aspects of the commodity markets, as a result of a request under date
of June 5, 1941, from Leon Henderson, Administrator of the Office of
Price Administration and Civilian Supply. Mr. Henderson's request
reads as follows:
"As you are aware, members of this Office 'in recent weeks have been giving
attention to the presently unregulated commodity exchanges.
We have been
disturbed by the volume of speculative activity in essential foodstuffs on certain
of these exchanges and, in cooperation with exchange officials, have taken steps
to increase margin requirements and tighten various trading practices.

feeling that in.this emergency period there is need for a close watch of the trading
in these markets to the end. that the public is not victimized by undue speculative
activity.
"The Securities and Exchange Commission has had da~iled experience in
protecting- the public from similar manipulation on the securities exchanges. I
should like to call upon your organization to undertake on a voluntary basis to
keep us informed as to developments on these commodity exchanges. Such
cooperative activity would make it unnecessary for us to build up a staff for this
purpose and in any case give us the advice of a much more experienced personnel
than we could expect to assemble ourselves. It is understood, of course, that the
extent of your undertaking would be only to keep this office informed of developments requiring our scrutiny.
"May I hear from you in the near future as to whether you can assist us in this
matter."

On June 17, 1941, Chairman Eicher replied as follows:
"We have your letter of June 5, 1941, requesting us to employ our facilities
for scrutiny of the unregulated commodities.
"In response to. Y011r. request, we-have reviewed our fa-cilities' for market observation and believe that they are substantially adaptable to the additional scrutiny
of the unregulated commodities markets.
We shall therefore be glad to undertake this work for you, sending you daily (and where necessary, hourly) reports
of activity and calling to your special attention any unusual developments which
appear to have a bearing upon the problems under your jurisdiction.
"You understand, of course, that we do not have statutory power to proceed
against persons who manipulate the prices of these commodities, or who speculate
excessively to the detriment of the public. We shall, however, use our facilities
to detect such occurrences and call them immediately to your attention."

The results of this surveillance and analyses thereof are being submitted in the form of a frequent letters and reports to the Price Division of the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply.
The securities exchanges have been requested to cooperate by requiring -raargins in commodities transactions equivalent to those
required by rules of the commodity exchanges, and have responded
favorably to this request.

RECORD OF PUBLIC ACTION TAKEN AS A RESULT OF TRADING
INVESTIGATIONS

On February 7, 1941, Joseph L. Merrill, a special partner of Merrill
Lynch, E. A. Pierce & Cassatt, was suspended for 6 months as a
member oLthe New .¥ork StoCk-Exclmng8,'" the New ..:¥"ork Cusb .
Exchange, and nine other national securities exchanges for violating
Section 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This action
resulted from an investigation of his transactions during August 1940,
in Diamond Shoe Corporation common stock listed on the New YorR:
Curb Exchange. No evidence was obtained which indicated that any
other partner of the above firm knew of, consented to, or concurred in
the violation.
On May 2, 1941, the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois indicted David A. Smart, Alfred Smart, Arthur
Green, A. D. Elden, Jeannette Kilmnick, and Alfred R. Pastel, all
of Chicago, Walter Lyon and Walter Stein of Walter Lyon & Co.,
David -Van Alstyn.e,-J. J. Hindon Hyde, and..walter~Win:fi.eld_ofYaD;
Alstyne & Co., and Leo G. Seisfeld, all of New York City. The
indictment charged these defendants with conspiracy to violate
Section 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This case
was referred to the Department of Justice on June 23, 1939, and resulted from an investigation of transactions by the above named 'Persons during 1938 in Esquire-Coronet, Inc., common stock listed on the
New York Curb Exchange.
MARGIN REGULATIONS

The Securities and Exchange Commission is charged with the duty
of enforcing Regulation T promulgated by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System. This regulation limits the extension
and maintenance of credit by brokers, dealers, and members of national securities exchanges and was promulgated pursuant to Sections

PART V-TEE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

141

7 and 8 (a) of .the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As in previous
years, the Commission has continued to conduct inspections of brokerage firms for the purpose of determining compliance with Regulation
T 6 ,as,~wel1 as all other rules and regulations applicable to such firms,
and has made the results thereof available to the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System whenever appropriate.
During the
past fiscal year the Commission continued to receive the cooperation
of the national securities exchanges with respect to the enforcement
of this regulation, the New York Stock Exchange having taken action
in nine instances, the Los Angeles Stock Exchange in one instance,
and the San Francisco Stock Exchange in one instance, for violation
of Regulation T by member firms.
PEGGING,

FIXING, AND STABILIZING

OF SECURITIES

PRICES

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1941, the Commission contiItued>the~admiBistrationof
(a) Rme'X-17A-2, .which requires the
filing of detailed reports of all transactions incident to offerings in
respect of which a registration statement has been filed under the
Securities Act of 1933 where any stabilizing operation is undertaken
to facilitate the offering; and (b) Regulation X-9A6-1, governing
stabilizing transactions in securities registered on national securities
exchanges effected to facilitate offerings of securities so registered in
which the offering prices are represented to be "at the market" or at
prices related to the market prices.
Out of a total of 335 registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933 during the past fiscal year, 199 contained a statement
of intention to stabilize to facilitate the offerings covered by such registration statements.
Because of the fact that a registration statement
in some cases covers more than one offering, there-were a total of 227
offerings of securities in respect of which the statement required by
Rule 827 of the RuJes and Regulations under the Securities Act of 1933
was made to the effect that a stabilizing operation was intended to be
undertaken.
Stabilizing operations were actually conducted to
facilitate 89 of these offerings. In the case of bonds, public offerings
of $799,509,000 principal amount were stabilized.
Offerings of stock
issues aggregating 12,886,782~ shares and having an aggregate
estimated public offering price of $317,402,354 were also stabilized.
Of the 89 stabilizing operations commenced during the past fiscal
year, 75 had been completed and notices of termination of stabiliza-tiQll....filed ..with ..the Commission andvthe .remaiaing -14 .were ..still in
progress as of the close of the fiscal year.
Also during the past fiscal year, 21 notices of intention to stabilize
were filed with the Commission on Form X-9A6-1 pursuant to the
• Refer to "Su~rvis1on

of Over-the-Counter Brokers and Dealers" for further mention of this subject,
.

142

ANNUAL

provisions of Rule X-9A6-3. The offerings described in these notices,
to facilitate which stabilizing operations were conducted, involved
stock issues aggregating 1,736,808 shares and having an aggregate
initial public offering price of $52,670,419.
With a view toward simplifying the procedure for the reporting of
transactions effected by persons engaged in stabilizing activities, a
proposed new Form X-17A-1, with instructions therefor, was drafted
during the past year. This proposed form was designed to be "selfproving" and to replace the three forms required to be filed by those
persons subject to the provisions of Rule X-17A-2 or Regulation
X-9A6-1. A draft of Rule X-17A-2, as it would be amended in the
event this proposed form were adopted, was also prepared. Following
its usual practice, the Commission submitted, 'on May 20, 1941, these
tentative drafts to 67 representative underwriting firms in various
parts of the country and to the National Association of Securities
Dealers, 'Inc., for consideration and comment. They were requested,
in particular, to state whether they would prefer to continue to use the

On information derived in the first instance from reports filed with
the Commission pursuant to Rule X-17A-2 or Rule X-9A6-6, the
Commission referred two cases of apparent infractions of the statutes
or rules thereunder to national securities exchanges and one case of
such apparent infractions to the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., for consideration and appropriate disciplinary action by
those bodies. In another case, on information so derived, a formal
investigation was directed, and on the basis of the information developed therefrom the Commission ordered the suspension of the respondent from membership in the National Association of Securities'
Dealers, Inc. These cases are summarized below:
On January 22, 1941, the Commission referred to the New York

Curb Exchange imposed a fine of $250 on this member firm and
reprimanded its member partner.

ent infractions of Regulation X-9A6-1 committed by a member firm
during the distribution, in the over-the-counter market, of a stock
registered on that exchange. In a letter to the Commission dated
April 25, 1941, the New York Stock Exchange stated that it had
censured this member firm.
On April 28, 1941, the Commission submitted certain information
to the Washington office of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., with respect to apparent violations of the association's
Rules of Fair Practice by a member of that association during the
nrm's stabilization and distribution of a stock registered on the New
York Curb Exchange and the Los Angeles Stock Exchange. In a
letter dated June 16, 1941, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. advised the Commission that the association's District
Business Conduct Committee for District No.2 had imposed a fine of
$200 on this member and had censured the firm.
On May 26, 1941, the Commission, having found that Masland,
Fernon & Anderson of Philadelphia, Pa., had violated Section
15 \c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule X-15Cl-2
promulgated thereunder, and having found that it was necessary and
appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors
and to carry out the purposes of Section 15 of the Act to suspend that
firm from membership in the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., a registered securities association, for a period of three
weeks, ordered, pursuant to Section 15A (1) (2), the suspension of that
firm from that association from May 27, 1941, to June 16, 1941, both

The Commission is empowered by Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after appropriate notice and opportunity
for hearing, to deny, to suspend the effective date of, to suspend for a
period not exceeding 12 months, or to withdraw, the registration of a
security on a national securities exchange, if it finds that the issuer of
such security has failed to comply with any provision of the Act or
the rules and regulations thereunder. In those cases where after
notice of hearing the Commission finds the applications for registration or the annual reports deficient or misleading, the practice to
date has invariably. been, to order the security delisted unless the
registrant corrected the defect. This procedure has been followed in
all cases to date-so that in practice the delisting power has become

an administrative device for procuring accurate and adequate disclosures, although it is possible that the Commission may encounter
a case of such flagrance as to necessitate delisting, despite subsequent
efforts to amend. Proceedings instituted by the Commission pursuant to this section have resulted in most cases from the failure
of the registrant to file the annual report required under Section 13,
although in some instances such proceedings were instituted on the
basis of misleading or inaccurate statements of material fact which,
upon examination, appeared to exist in applications or reports filed
under the Act. Out of a total of 7 cases disposed of during the
past fiscal year, 6 were based upon the failure to file the required
annual reports and the remaining 1 resulted from the inclusion in
an annual report of information which appeared to be misleading
or inaccurate. In 5 of these cases, the annual report was subsequently filed or an amendment was filed correcting indicated deficiencies .and ..the proceedings were thereupon dismissed. -Xhe Commission ordered withdrawn the registration of securities of the other
2 issuers-which were also involved in bankruptcy proceedings-in
view of their continued failure to file the required annual report.

New Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act.

During the past fiscal year' the Commission adopted certain new
rules relating to the registration of securities on exchanges, pursuant

PART V-THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGEACT OF 1934

145

to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. One of these, Rule X-12B-9,
is a companion to Rule 523 under the Securities Act of 1933 and
simplifies the problem of filing information required of a company
subject to both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Thus, pursuant to this rule, an application
for registration of securities on an exchange which is filed by a closedend investment company may consist essentially of copies of its
registration statement filed pursuant to the Investment Company
Act of 1940, accompanied by any additional information and documents required by the form which would otherwise be appropriate and
are not included in that registration statement, provided such application is filed within 60 days after the date of filing of the registration
statement under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Commission also adopted a technical amendment to RUles X-13A-7 and
X-15D-4 to permit investment companies which are required to file
annual reports on Form lO-K, 15-K, 17-K, I-MD, or 2-MD, pursuant
to Sections 13 or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as the
case may be, to file in lieu thereof (under certain conditions) copies of
their registration statement filed under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. Certain other changes, of a relatively minor nature,
were also made in the rules and regulations governing the registration
of securities on exchanges.
Statistics of Securities Registered or Temporarily Exempted from Registration
on Exchanges.

Up to and including June 30, 1941, 2,929 issuers had filed a total of
5,375 applications for registration of securities under Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a total of 24,143 annual and
current reports under Section 13 of that Act. As of June 30,1941, the
registration of securities of 2,350 of these issuers was in effect, and the
registration of the securities of the remaining 579 issuers had ceased
to be effective for a variety of reasons; e. g., withdrawal from registration, etc.
The number of applications, reports, and amendments filed with
the Commission during the past year relating to the listing. and
registration of securities on national securities exchanges and to the
listing of securities on exempted exchanges are as follows:

on

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1941, applications involving
58 issues were filed with the Commission for the withdrawal or striking
of such issues from listing and registration on national securities
exchanges. These applications were filed in accordance with the
provisions of Section 12 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. As of June
30, 1940, applications involving 21 issues were pending, and decision
upon 1 application had been suspended by the Commission. During
the past fiscal year, the Commission granted applications involving 63
issues; denied applications involving 3 issues; dismissed 1 application
pertaining to 1 issue; applications involving 4 issues were withdrawn
by the applicants; and applications involving 8 issues were pending
as of June 30, 1941. The Commission was not called upon, during
the fiscal year, to dispose of the application upon which decision had
been suspended during the preceding fiscal year.
A considerable portion of these applications resulted from continuation of the N ew York Stock Exchange's practice of seeking to remove
from listing and registration thereon issues deemed no longer to have
adequate public distribution, activity, or market value for trading on
that exchange. Applications from that source involving 22 issues
were filed during the past year. As of June 30, 1940, applications
involving 12 issues were pending. During the fiscal year, the Commission granted applications involving 33 issues and 1 application
involving 1 issue was pending on June 30, 1941During the past fiscal year, the Commission received from national
securities exchanges certifications of removal involving 252 issues
stricken from listing and registration hecause of payment, redemption;
or retirement. A number of the new applications for listing and
registration on national securities exchanges filed during the past
year were with respect to issues resulting from refundings and changes
in capital structure in connection with these 252 issues.
Applications for the Granting, Extension, and Termination
Privileges on Exchanges.

of Unlisted Trading

National Securities Exchanges.-Clause (1) of Section 12 (f) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides that any national securities
exchange, upon application to, and approval by, the Commission, may
continue unlisted trading privileges to which a security had been
admitted on such exchange prior to March 1,1934. On June 30,1941,
unlisted trading privileges under clause (1) continued in 1,373 stock
and 221 bond issues. This is a reduction of 1,312 stock and 1,067
bond issues from the original total continued by the Commission under

PART V--THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

147

clause (1) on October 1, 1934, and a reduction of 132 stock and ~OO
bond issues from the total as of June 30, 1940.10 Outstanding causes
of this reduction under clause (1) lie in refundings, recapitalizations,
mergers, and reorganizations involving substantial changes in characteristics of issues or substitutions or exchanges therefor. During the
past fiscal year, 17 applications were filed with the Commission by
exchanges seeking a determination that an altered or substituted
security was substantially equivalent to a security theretofore admitted to unlisted trading privileges. Of these applications, 11 were
granted, 5 were withdrawn and 1 was denied.
Clause (2) and clause (3) of Section 12 (f) provide that the Commission, upon application by a national securities exchange, may extend
unlisted trading privileges thereon to any security duly listed and
registered on another national securities exchange, or in respect of
which prescribed information is available, provided certain conditions
as to public distribution and public trading activity in the vicinity of
the exchange and other matters are satisfied. On June 30, 1941,
unlisted trading privileges under clauses (2) and (3) existed with
respect to 160 stock and 31 bond issues, trading in odd lots only being
authorized with respect to 14 of the stock issues. Except for 11 issues
subsequently removed, these issues represent the total extension by
the Commission of unlisted trading privileges under these two clauses
since May 27, 1936, when they became effective upon the amendment
of Section 12 (f).
Tables 36 and 37 of Appendix II, page 306, summarize the disposition of all applications under clauses (2) and (3) of Section 12 (f)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Since unlisted trading privileges in various issues have been applied
for and granted to more than one exchange, the figures mentioned
therein include substantial duplication of the net number of issues
involved. This is particularly true with respect to stock issues under
clause (1). The duplication involved can be measured by comparing
the aggregate 1,533 stock and 252 bond trading authorizations under
clauses (1), (2), and (3) as of June 30, 1941,with the unduplicated
totals of 1,077 stock and 252 bond issues admitted to unlisted trading
privileges on national securities exchanges as of that date. These
unduplicated totals include 525 stock and 222 bond issues which are
admitted to unlisted trading privileges only; the remaining issues are
fully listed and registered (or, in a few cases, temporarily exempted
from registration) on national securities exchanges other than those
having unlisted trading privileges therein.
Where an application has been filed for permission to extend
'unlisted trading privileges to a security, the Act permits any broker

or dealer who makes or creates a market in such security, and any
other person having a bona fide interest in such proceeding to be heard
upon application to the Commission. During the past fiscal year,
there was one instance in which an issuer opposed the granting of
such an application-the
application of the New York Curb Exchange
for the extension of unlisted trading privileges to the First Mortgage
Bonds, series A, 4 percent, due September 1, 1969 of Public Service
Company of Indiana.
In that proceeding, the president of the company addressed a letter to the applicant exchange in which he stated
that until the bond had become seasoned, it was his opinion that it
would not be in the interest of the holders of the bond or of the company to have it admitted to unlisted trading privileges. The Commission did not sustain the objection raised by the president of that
company ..
During the past fiscal year, the Commission instituted a proceeding
to determine whether unlisted trading privileges should be terminated
in the $1 Cumulative Participating Stock of Crown Cork International
Corporation on the New York Curb Exchange. This security was
formerly listed and.registered on the .Boston Stock Exchange. Subsequent to the Commission's granting of the issuer's application to
withdraw such stock from listing and registration on the Boston
Stock Exchange, this proceeding was instituted to determine whether
such delisting had been effected for the purpose of evading the purposes
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Being satisfied that such was
not the intention of the issuer, the Commission dismissed the proceeding before it.
The Act provides that the Commission may terminate unlisted
trading privileges in a security upon application by an issuer of such
security, or upon application by any broker or dealer who makes or
creates a market in such security or by any other person having a bona
fide interest in the question of such termination.
During the year,
Chicago Rivet and Machine Company filed with the Commission an
application for the termination of unlisted trading privileges in its
Common Stock,. $4 Par Value, on the New York Curb Exch&nge.
This application was filed on all three of the statutory grounds:
inadequate public distribution of such security in the vicinity of the
exchange, inadequate public trading activity, and character of trading.
in such security on the exchange. The application had not been disposed of by the Commission as of June 30, 1941.
The Chicago Stock Exchange filed applications during the year for
the extension of unlisted trading privileges to twenty securities. This
action reversed a policy of long standing and left the N ew York Stock
Exchange the only major market without unlisted-trading.
The
hearing in connection with these applications was held on June 13,

ExeDlltted Exdlang'es.

On June 30, 1946, the Seattle Stock Exchange had pending before
the Coormission applications for the extension of unlisted trading
privileges to seven stock and three bond issues. On March 5,1941,
the Commission denied 4 applications involving one stock and three
bond issues on the ground that such securities wete ineligible for
admitt811e6 to unlisted trading privileges pursuant to the terms of the
order issued by the Commission granting this exchange e:a:emption
f:rom registration as a national securities exchange. The remaining
applications involving six stock issues were denied, the Commission
, concluding that no -application of this exchange for unlisted trading
privileg~ should be approved unless and until its rules are amended
so as to require all trades effected by ita members in listed securities
and in securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges thereon,
whether on or off the-floor of the exchange, to be currently reported to
the exchange and to be considered exchange transactions subject, Be
far as physically possible, to all the rules and regulations of the
exchange pertaining to transactions actually effected on the floor of the
exchange. As another prerequisite, the Commission stated th6t the
exchange should require the current reporting to the secretary or other
appropriate officer of the exchange of all bids and offers made by its
members in securities traded on the exchange.

Cooperative regulation of the over-the-counter markets has developed in many different ways. during the past :fiscal year. The
National Association of Securities Dealers, Ine., remains the only
association registered under Section IS.!. of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Its membership (2,973) comprises those sele proprietors;
partnerships, and corporations which transact the bulk Qf the Nation's
business in over-the-counter securities, other than exempted .issues,
suclr as municipal bonds. The N. A. S. D., as it is popularly" known,
has been active, under the cooperative supervision of the Conrmission,
in seeking- to raise the standards of business practice in the over-thecounter field through. disciplinary proceedings handled by its many
local business conduct committees, through the promulgation of certam new rules and the compilation of a Uniform Practice Code, and
tnrciugu educational work carried on both independently by its various
committees- and jointly with the Commission.

cases, the association conducted supplementary inspections ill the

90 complaints against members for violation of the selling agreement

members were censured.
These penalties imposed by various local
committees were at the close of the fiscal year still under review by
the association's N~tionnl Business Conduct Committee. ' Its decisions are appealable to or reviewable by;'the" Commission on its own

the facts. In the future, the N. A. S. D. will presumably be in a

Some time subsequent thereto, all of the district secretaries were called
to Washington for a course of instruction in the investigation of complaints which was followed by practical field work in the form of an
ins~tio~
of all membm focated in St. Paul, Mmntmpolis, Duluth,
and other '8.rtjacent cities. A general inspection of this nature represents a distinct step forward compared to the association's original
policy of taking action only upon specific complaints.
The new
policy, if carried through with thoroughness, should prove of real
assistance to the Commission in meeting its problem of policing the
6,OOO-oddover-the-counter houses scattered throughout the land.
Additional N. A. S. D. Rules and Uniform Practice Code.

On March 14, 1941, the association filed with the Commission a
proposed amendment to its Rules of Fair Practice concerning the
activities of its members in connection with the distribution and
redemption of securities issued by open-end management investment
companies.
These rules were adopted by the association pursuant
to authority conferred by Sections 22 (a) and 22 (b) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 which authorize registered securities associations
to formulate rules designed to minimize dilution caused by defective
pricing methods and to eliminate excessive sales loads. Since the
Commission had been advised that certain interested members of
N. A. S. D. objected to several provisions of the proposed rules, a
public conference was held on March28, 1941, before the full Commission. After considering the various points of view advanced, the
Commission concluded that the proposed rules were within the scope
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and did not run counter to
the standards prescribed by Section 15A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Therefore, the Commission held that it need not exercise its statutory power of disapproving the rules and they automatically became effective 30 days after filing.
The Commission
in its opinion 16 emphasized that it was neither approving those portions of the rules dealing with dilution nor intimating that they were
adequate to solve the problem. It felt, however, that since the Investment Company Act of 1940 clearly contemplated that the association should be given reasonable latitude in attempting to work out
a practic~ solution 01 the dilution .problem, until the Commisaion's
power to promulgate rules with regard thereto becomes effective, it
would hardly be justified in rejecting the proposed rule because it did
not go far enough. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 the
Commission may promulgate rules covering dilution and excessive
sales loads 1 year after the effective date of the Act; meanwhile, the
association is given the first opportunity to tackle the problem.
If
the association is unwilling or unable to do so" the Commission has

Supervision of Over-the-Counter Brokers and Dealers,
,

.,

l

During the past fiscal year the Commission continued its :program
of inspection of over-the-counter
brokers. and dealers on .0. mofe
extensive scale than in any previous period. The primary purpose of
this program is, of course, protection of investors by, ascertaining
compliance with the statutes administered by the, Commission and
the rules and regulations thereunder,
But of substantial importance,
too, is the secondary purpose' of aiding.brokers and dealers themselves
to a better understanding of legal requirements imposed upon them.
Measured by either objective there is abundant' evidence-that 'these
Inspections have' had saluteey'effects.
- ,. ,,,. .
;
Tlie eeope of the problem of supervision of over-the-counter brokers
imd dealers is to some extent reflected in the fact that, as.of the close,
of the fiscal year, there.were 6~069'such brokers and dealers registered
with the Commission. Approximately 1,200 of these are also members

to a firm with a very limited volume of business they need not be

,
,...
. In about one-fourth of the 'total inspections made during the
year,. questions of compliance with provisions of the.statute required
consideration, ;In 66 inspections, for instance, the. question of-extonsion of credit in possible noncompliance with Regulation T presented
itself and in: all such. cases the-firms, promptly took steps to' bring
accounts into full compliance. In a large number of inspections in,
this 25 percent, segment; conditiens- and practices were discovered
which, to say't}le least, appeared in v~ing
degrees to be inimical to
the interests of.customers and-in numerous instances, as will be-noted
from the analysis which follows, actual violations of law were involved;
There were 24 inspections in which evidence of dangerous practices
relating to hypothecation and' eemmingling of customers' securities in
the possession of. the firm was discovered but where no evidence of
insolvency-or of violation of: minimum capital requirements under
Section 8. (b) of .the Seourities Exchange Act of 1~34 was found.
Eighteen of these cases antedated the Commission's rules under
Section 8 (c) of the 4.ct relating to commingling and .hypothecation,
which became effective February 24, 1941. These firms, however,
acknowledged that the practice of subjecting customers' securities to
risks of which customers were unaware was not in conformity with
good business practice and took prompt corrective measures. Since
the effective date of the hypothecation and commingling rules only
six inspections have reported practices in nonconformity with the rules
and appropriate action was taken in each.
.
A far more serious situation was found in connection with 69 other
firms, the financial condition of which was found to be either precarious
9r. definitely unsound,
Some of these firms were insolvent.
Others,
though solvent, had aggregate indebtedness, in excess of 2,000 percent
of their net capital, contrary to Section 8 (b) of the Seourities Exchange
Act of 1934. Some of the firms in question had borrowed .against
customers' securities more than customers owed the firm on such
securities. When such conditions and practices are discovered, the
firm is generally given a reasonable time within which to remedy the
situation; inability or failure to do so, however, results in' prompt
action by .the Commission.
Twenty-six of the 69 in this category
have discontinued business.
The action to be. taken is determined largely by considerations.of
public interest.
Besides- other courses, the Commission may move to
enjoin further violations or to revoke or suspend registration, or it
may seek to invoke both such ,remedies. It may also refer the facts
to the Department-of Justice for consideration of criminal prosecution,
or- to an agency of the State, if violation of State law appears to be

involved, for such action as such agency ma.y deem appropriate.
Obviously, the Commission's primary aim when it appears that the
interests of customers may be in jeopardy is to secure, with the
greatest speed. possible, action to correct the tiituatioo. or to freeze it
so that no further harm is done. On. numerous occasions, helpful ~

cooperation has been extended by various State agencies and the
following are but a few of the eases which eould be cited as evidence
of effective cooperation:
In the case of WilliRtn E. Atwood & Co., Inc. (Mama), inspection
disclosed liabilities in excess of $22,000 with assets of only $1,000.
Customers' fully paid securities had been pledged to secure bank
loans for the fum's own use, without the knowledge or consent of the
customers.
A bill in equity was filed 2 days after the inspection was
begun and a decree, to which the firm. consented, was obtained, which
effectively prevented the firm. from continuing its business while
insolvent. On the facts disclosed by the inspection, prosecution under
State law was instituted by the State of Maine and Atwood, president
of the company, was convicted.
In the case of Joseph W. Burden, New York, it appeared from the
inspection that the finn was insolvent by a sum in excess of $320,000.
Customers' funds and securities had, it appeared, been misappropriated. The facts were referred to the Attorney General of the State
of New York who moved promptly to enjoin and later brought criminal proceedings resulting in the conviction of Burden.
In July 1940, on a plea of nollo contendere, George McGhie, Jr., a
partner in the firm of George McGhie & Co., who had been a registered
broker and dealer, was found guilty by the Federal court in the
Western District of Wisconsin of mail fraud, conspiracy, and violation
of the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The criminal
proceedings in this instance grew out of an investigation made upon
information furnished by the Wisconsin Department of Securities.
Following an investigation conducted. in November 1940, in cooperation with the Pennsylvania' Securities Commission, Robert J.
Boltz of Philadelphia was indicted' in both State and Federal courts
on charges of fraud growing out of the operation of an "investment
counsel" scheme. Boltz pleaded guilty to both indictments.
No problem arises more frequently in reports on broker-dealer inspections than the problem involving the. sale of securities at prices
greatly in excess of the prevailing market prices." During the past
year studies were made of the schedules of transactions of 108 dealers
inspected, with a view to determining whether any roles can or should
be urged. The problem has been discussed with representatives of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the association and the Commission are engaged in further'8tudy of the pl'0b1e.m..
n This Is a situation of which the Commission took initial cognizance inan aggravated case in 1939(Duker
and Duker). See Sixth Annual Report of the Commission. p. 110.

hi its Sixth Annual Repert,18 the Commission commented on a type'of
fraudulent conduct by which a broker obtains secret profits through
the device of misrepresenting the price at which a customer's order)
is executed. For instance, a broker may confirm :a purehase of &'
security for a customer for $1,000 plus a commission for his services,
when in fact the order was executed for the total sum of $900. Sueh;
practices not only fall short of the standards of conduct recognized
by national securities exchanges and the National Association of
Secarities Dealers, Inc., but may also be in violation of the fraud
provisions of the securities Acts. Instances of such practices werefound in seventeen inspections during the year. An example in which
such practices were' found involved Hope & Co., St. Louis, Mo. The
Commission instituted proceedings to-revoke its regiStration, eharging.
that by misrepresenting to customers the price at which the firm, as
agent, had effected transactions for such customers and by violating its
fiduciary duty in certain ather transactions, the :firm had fraudulently
obtained secret profits aggregating more than S9,OOO. The fum ad'mitted the facts and consented to revoeasion of its registration.
The preceding ease-is ene of a series of cases involving revocation
of registration ordered by the Commission during the year in which
fraud, arising out of an abuse of a fiduciary duty, has been alleged.
Other cases were: In the Malter.oj Oommonwealth Securities, Inc.; In
ihe Matter of Secumies Distributors Oorporation; In the Matter of Eq'fJ/~table Securities Oompanyoj Illinois; and In the Matter of Geo, W. Byron
&: 00. In some of these cases, including Oommonwealth Securtties,,'
Inc . .and Securities Distributors Oorporation, the registered broker or
dealer had attempted to avoid fiduciary responsibility by use of words
on the confirmation intended to indicate that in the particular transaction it had not acted in a :fiduciarY capacity, but, in such cases,
the Commission held that the form of confirmation could not alter'
~e flduciary character of the relationship where this was clearly.
established from the other foots and cireumstances surrounding thetransaction.
The case of Oeo. W. Byron &: 00. involved transactions
ip. which the firm acted as agent {or both parties to the transaction
and accepted commissions from each without the other's knowledge
and consent, which constituted an abuse of the fiduciary responsibility to which an agent is subject.
In the Matter oj Securities Die-'
tributor» Oorporation involved failure of a securities :firm, while acting
as a fiduciary, to disclose information in its possession which the
customer would wish to have in deciding whether to enter into the
transaction.
In the Matter oj Equitable Securities Oompany oj fllinois
involved a fiduciary obligation arising from a relation of trust and
confidence between the customer .and the securities company.
In
the decision in In the Matter of Hope &: Oompany the Commission
held:

REPORT

- "A broker-dealer exercising supervision over a discretionary account iSJ-of
course, an agent and under the principles already discussed these transactions
eonstitute
a violation
of the statutory provisions cited."
,
,
,

and further held:
, "A broker is an agent and it is, of course, a general principle of law that an
~nt
may not, in the absence of consent of the person whom he purports to represent, deal with such person as a principal.
This is so irrespective of any injury
or loss to the principal.
It follows that when a broker-dealer represents to a
customer that he is effecting a transaction as broker, and. without the knowledge
or consent of the customer buys from or sells to the customer as a principal, he
is making a misrepresentation of a material fact and is engaging in a fraudulent
practice which violates Section 17(a) of the Securities Ac_t, Section 15(c) of the
Securities Exchange Act and Rule X-15CI-2 thereunder."

In this opinion the Commission quoted the following statement of
the law by the Supreme Judicial Court-of Massachusetts .in HaU v.
Ptiine:lO
,"A broker's obligation to his principal requires him to secure the highest price
obtainable, while his seH-interest prompts him to buy at the lowest possible price.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 19331

The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to compel full and fair
disclosure to investors of material facts regarding securities offered
or sold in interstate commerceand through the mails, and to prevent
fraud in such sales. Issuers of securities subject to the registration
requirements of the Act must file registration statements with the
Commission. These registration statements are required to CODtain speeifiedinformation about the issuer and the proposed offering
and are available for public inspection. Issuers are also required
to' ftrtnish to prospective investors a prospeetua showing the more
essential information contained in the registration statement.
STATUTORY AMENDMENT

Prior to August 22, 1940, Section 8 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933
provided that except in certain specified cases the effective date of the
registration statement should be the twentieth day after its flling'with
the Commission," However, Section 8 (a) was amended en that date
to give the Commission discretionary authority to accelerate the
effective date of the registration statement under certain eireumstances. Specifically, the amended section now provides that the
effective da.f\e.of the regis~tion
stt\t~ent
shall be the twentieth
day after the filing thereof or such earlier date as the Commission may
determine, but requires the Commission to give due regard to the
adequacy of information concerning the issuer which bas previously
been made available to the general public, the ease with which the
nature of the securities to be registered, their relationship to the
capital structure of the issuer, and the rights of the holders thereof
can be understood, and to the public interest and the protection of
investors. Ceincident with this significant amendment of the
statute, the Commission announced that, pursuant to such discretionary authority, it will-be its general policy to accelerate the
effeCtive date of registrit'tion stltten'1'lMts filed. under the Securities
Act of 1933 in accordance with the following procedure:
In determining the date on which a xC\,o$trs.tion statement;
shall become effective, the Commission will consider, having
due regard to the public interest ana the protection of investors,

material amendments filed after the initial :filing date; and
(c) The character and date of information previously or

In connection with the above-mentioned amendment, the Commission also announced that its examination of registration statements
and amendments whioh.have been prepared- with due regard to the
matters set forth in (a) above, will ordinarily be completed within a
few days after the filing date .. Accordingly, as soon as an appropriate
amendment correcting the .deficiencies, if any, and an amendment
setting forth the price (if the price and terms of offering were not
Qpginally included in the registration statement) are :filed, the Commission will, subject to its statement of general policy and the requirements of the Act, consent to the filing of the amendments 8.:Q.d
declare
the statement effective as soon as practicable. ,
, At the same time, the. Commission pointed ~ut that the requirements of the Trust Indenture Ac~ of 1939 have materially .increased
tho examination work of its Registration Division with respect to
registration statements for securities to be issued under indentures
which must he qualified under that Act. Accordingly it was suggested
that it will further the effectuation of the Commission's announced
general policy if drafts of such indentures a~~submitted in reasonably
fina] form for consideration and discussion with the .s~~ es far, as,
possible in advance of the actual filing of the registration statement.
The Commission stated further that it will be its policy to cooperate
wi,th registrants in order that the effectiveness of registration atatemerits filed under the Securities Act of 1933 may be expedited as much
as possible consistent with the public interest and the protection.of
investors.

Commission that much time can be saved and a good deal of difficulty
avoided in this way. It was found that smaller issuers in particular
availed themselves of this assistance.
Because of the success of the
experiment, the Commission extended this experimental registration
service. to its other regional offices and assigned experts trained in
registration technique to those offices. The extension of this service
became effective on February 1, 1941. .
The Commission also undertook another experiment whicb, if
proved successful, will constitute one of the most far reaching administrative changes ever undertaken by the Commission.
Since Februaryl, 1941, it has been conducting an experiment.in order to deter ..
mine the feasibility and .advisability of decentralization, to the extent
practicable under the statute, of the administration of the registrution
provisions of the Securities Act. of 1933. Registration units have
been established in the regional offices at San Francisco and Cleveland
and the rules and regulations have been amended to permit the filing
of certain registration statements in those offices.'
.
, These experiments 'will continue until Iater in the-year, when the
Commission will consider whether they' should be oontinued.iexpanded,
or abandoned,
'
Of the registration statements filed with the Commission during
the period from February 1 to J1IDe 30, 1941, .26.,r('.gist~ants were
eligible to file their statements in the San Francisco Regional Office,
13 by virtue of the location of their own principal .executive offices
and 13 because of that of a principal underwriter. .Df these 26, 13
took advantage of the rules to file in that office. Only'! of these was
eligible solely on the basis of the location of the underwriter's offices.
During the same period, 26- registrants were eligible to file in the
Cleveland Regional Office, 20 qualifying because of the location of
their own offices and 6 because of that of one of their principal underwriters. Ten of these elected to file in Cleveland, all, of them being
eligible because of the location of their own offices. Two of the 10
withdrew their registration statements before they became effective.

.transaction whereby the British Government, acting under its war
powers, acquired from Courtauldts, Ltd., a block of securities 'Of
American Viscose Corporation and disposed of them to a banking
group in the United States, the Commission was asked whether, in the
event the banking group should in turn dispose of the securities by
means of a public distribution in the United States, such .distribution
would make the British Government liable as an underwriter within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission concluded that under the circumstances the British Government will not
be subject to the liabilities of an underwriter under the Act and, in
order to give its conclusion. the status of a rule, the Commission
adopted Rule 143, eff~ctive as of April 18, 1941.6 The rule provides
that the terms "has purchased," "sells for," "participates,"

Holding Company Act of 1935 of Rule U-50, which requires, with
certain exceptions, competitive bidding in the issuance and sale of
securities of registered gas and electric public-utility holding companies and their subsidiaries, the Commission adopted Rule 881
under the Securities Act of 1933. This rule exempts from the prospectus requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules relating
thereto any public invitation for bids which is required by Rule
U-50, provided the invitation is an invitation for bids only and sets
forth that, prior to the acceptance of any bid, the bidder will be
fuinished with a copy of the official prospectus.
Additional rule simplifies compliance with similar requiremenie
a~nder.:6,i:i!~.,en,'f:zstatute8:~
The Commission is eonetaatlyendeavoring to simplify the problem facing a person who is subject to the
provisions of two or more of the Acts which are admiriistered by the
Commission and call for the filing of substantially identical information. In this connection, Rule 523 was adopted to provide a sim ..
plified procedure for registering under the Securities Act of 1933
securities of closed-end management investment companies whieh
have filed registration statements under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. By virtue of this new rule, closed-end management
investment companies may file copies of their registration statements
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a registration statement under the Securities Act of 193.3,provided that no registration
statement may be :filedpursuant to this rule more than 30 days after
the date on which the company filed its registration statement under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. For this purpose, such registration statement must be accompanied by any additional information
and documents required by the form which would otherwise be appropriate for registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and which are
not included in the registration statement filed under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.
Other changes of a minor nature were also made in the rules and
regulations under the Securities Act of 1938 during the year.
Progress made on proposed further simplification of forms.-Substantial progress was made during the year in the projected revision
of-forms for registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933.
Tentative drafts of two special forms (Forms 8-2 and 8-3) were submitted. to a number of lawyers, accountants, investment bankers, and
other interested persons for criticism and suggestions. Form 8-2 is
designed to provide a simple vehicle for registration of securities of
commercial and industrial companies which have not been in insolvency proceedings or had a succession during the past 3 :fiscalyears
and- ..Wtii:c}i"do not have any subsidiaries other than 'in.a.cttive or
insignificant subsidiaries.

r

Form 8-3 is likewise designed to simplify the registration of securities of promotional mining companies which have not had a succession during the past 3 fiscal years and which do not have any
subsidiaries. A novel feature of both forms would permit registrants
to file registration' statements consisting primarily of the prospectus
and the usual exhibits. This procedure would eliminate the necessity
of preparing two separate documents, namely, the registration statement and the prospectus, containing largely the same information.
These proposed forms were being re-examined at the end of the fiscal
year in the light of the-many suggestions received from representatatives of the industry and it is expected that as finally revised they
will be promulgated by the Commission, in the .near future."
Substantial progress was also made during the year.in the ,drafting
of a proposed' general form' for registration under the Securities Act
of 1933 of securities of issuers which have previously registered
securities under the Act, or which have securities listed and registered
on a national securities exchange pursuant to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, or which are public-utility holding companies registered
under the Public' Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. This form
also would permit registrants to file registration statements consisting
chiefly of a prospectus and exhibits.
DISCLOSURES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION

The cases which are briefly summarized below will illustrate some of
the results of the Commission's examination procedure in securing
fair and accurate disclosure 'of material' information required in
registration statements,"
, (1) Failure to provide for depreciation in; company's investments.A registrant filed a registration statement in connection with 'an
offering of first mortgage bonds and notes. Before filing its registration statement it submitted to the Commission for review the flnancial
-statements which it proposed to include therein. An examination
of these financial statements disclosed that the registrant's investments in .affiliated companies and' in certain listed and unlisted
securities were stated at $66,802,233 on' its' balance sheet. 'This
amount was approximately $45,000,000 in excess of -the market: or
appraised val~e' of the investments at the balance sheet date.: Most
of these investments 'were to be pledged as a part of the secUrity for
the first mortgage bonds which the registrant proposed to-offer. , At
the suggestion' of the Commission the registrant, prior to, filiilg its
registration statement, revised its balance sheet to include an additional column giving effect to an adjustment in 'respect of' the' sub, Form S,3 promulgated September 29, 1941, (Securities Exchange Act Release }fo. 2672)..
• Similar illustrations are shown in the previous annual reports of the Commission.

stantial depreciation of ~"/is Yi~tmep'~'-;
The amounts at which .the
asseta and liabilities were stated
the two .bases were shown in
comparative columnar form. The revised consolidated balance sheet
makes it clear that, after providing for the shrinkage of $45,000,000
in investments, the company's total assets were $67,211,805 instead
of $112,165,521, and that instead of an earned surplus of $7,953,408
it had an operating deficit of $34,211,056. The registrant in this
case is a listed company and its securities are widely held by the public.
(2) Inadequase disclosure oj the character of long term investment
contracts.-The parent company of the registrant in this case had
been engaged previously in a Nation-wide sale of face-amount investment contracts under which the investor made a specified number of
monthly payments over a period of years and upon completion of such
payments was entitled to receive from the company a certain sum,
payable in full at that time or in installments over a subsequent period.
Apparently finding itself tillable to comply with the requirements of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and in order to continue the sale of
its contracts, it organized a new.company.
A registration statement
was filed by.this newly organized company to continue the business
in which its parent heretofore had been engaged. The registration
statement and prospectus included. statements emphasizing that the
registrant would acquire its securities from independent underwriters,
brokers, and dealers and would make no payments to its parent company other than a commission of a specified amount for each contract
sold; that the contracts were a vital necessity, affording a medium for.
accumulating an estate, attaining finanoial stability, and providing
substantial income.
. Information was obtained shortly after the filing of the registration
statement .that the registrant intended to acquire securities through
its' parent, to pay its parent a premium for such securities and a fee
each year thereafter, based on a percentage of the securities held in
the registrant's portfolio; that the parent would also allocate some of
its operating expenses to the registrant; and that the continuation of
the' registrant's business' largely depended upon certificate holders
becoming delinquent or. permitting their contracts to lapse. The
registration statement and prospectus were revised to state clearly
the nature of all payments which would be made -by the registrant to
its parent company.
Furthermore, in order to disclose with clarity
the character of the security being offered, a table was included on the
:first page of the prospectus indicating, among other things, that a
certifieate holder .who made his monthly payments regularly over a
period of 15 years would receive a. yield of 1.64 percent per annum on a
compound interest beais, It was also disclosed that this yield would
be deereesed.in the event the certificate holder became delinquent at
any.time .dUl'iDg the I5-year period.

. (3) Fauure to disclose decline in company's production and misleading
description of lxmtract for sale of regi8tranf.s proo'UCt.-.A registrant
engaged in the business of processing moving picture :films and making
prints thereof :filed a registration statement in connection with an
offering of its common stock. This registration statement was the
second one filed, a previous offering having been made of its stock
under an earlier effective registration statement.
Certain correcting
amendments had been filed and the, registration statement had been
presented to the Commission for,disposition of the registrant's request
that the effective date be accelerated. because of the urgent need for
financing. Subsequent to oonsideratien by the Commission and 2
days.hefoxe the. registratioa "'8ta.tement would halVe become effective;
the registrant filed an amendment.
The prIDcipa1'mformafaon disclosed in the amendment was a statement to the effect that .the
registrant had entered into a contract with a certain motion picture
producing company for supplying a minimum amount of 10,000,000
feet of film per year for a term of "5 years. In this connection it was
noted that an increase of 10,000,000. feet of printing film would have
substantially
more than doubled the current production of the
registrant on an annual basis .
Immediately the Commission endeavored to obtain from various
sources in Washington, D. C., information concerning the moving
picture producing company with which the registrant had entered
into a contritet'o Neither Gov~ent
sOtlrc&'of infdfmation'nor
representatives of the moving picture industry in Waahington had
heard of tll.1amoving picture production company, although the Commission was advised that any company producing as much as 10,000,000 feet per year would probably be recognized in its Md.
Thereupon, the Commission requested one of its regional offices to
investigate the matter and furnish whatever info:rmation was avaiiable
concerning the production company.
As a result of this Inveetigation, .
it was discovered that the production company had only reee.JLt,ly.
been incorporated; no stock hsd-beerr issued nor had any application
for issuance of stock been filed 'With the,-approp:riate State regu!atoqt
authorities; it had produced no pictures nor did it have any commitments for the production-or distribution of any pictures; and its
promoters had previously filed voluntary petitions in bankruptcy.
It was further learned that the production co.mpany did not anti~pate, even if successful, that its printing requirements could possibly
reach 10,000,000 feet of film per year during its early existence •

.As .a result of the Commission's investigation, the prospectus was
amended to indicate the facts respecting the- promotional nature of
the production company; to disclose that the }~contract" with the
production' company contained
provision, for paJia}ti$ upon M'Ilcollation of the "contract" by either of the;pBl"ties thereto; and to

no .

remove the implication theretofore existing that the registrant's
business would be substantially more than doubled in the ensuing year.
Because of the registrant's delay 'in correcting- its registration
,statement,it beeezne necessery.to.fil« more recent financial statements,
which.disclosed
tha~Jbf:'.:tegistr~t.'.s average.monthly
production had
decreased some 70 percent and; in the -most recent 3 months, it had
sustained a relatively; sttbstmttial joss. These facts had not previously been disclosed even at the time the registrant amended its
statement to include a description of the "contract" referred to above.
, (4) Is8flIlme oj Glock fur promotiO'lUll purposes and its effect not
disclosed.-A company engaged in th.& manufacture and sale of azmaments filed a registration statement covering an offering of approxima.tely, lOO,~ sha.rcs:&f.ooIDmon stock, at $6.2& per share. About
half ihis stock 'Was to be sold for the account of the company and the
balanee f&r the aeeounte of eerteia mrge stoekhelders,
The company
was recently organized las the successor, through a series of reorganiz&,.Juon&;; iliflt.,~ertai.l1,.predecessoJ.:~companies
which had, since 1938, been
engaged in the development of the registrant's products.
In the course of the examination of this registration statement, it
was discovered that '260,000 shares' (approximately two-thirds of the
'company's outstanding common capital-stock) were in effect promotional shares which had been issued in exchange for junior stock of the
predecessor companies.
These latter shares had in turn been issued,
for a. purely nominal total cash consideration of approximately $162,
so certain persons interested in the original development of the enterprise, This situation was nowhere disclosed in the registration statement or prospectus as originally filed but was elicited as a result of
questions raised.by the 'Commission's stafl'in connection with certain
material in the original filing. The circumstances thus discovered
with respect to the issuance of these promotional shares were, of
course, required to be set fOl"th:,\fuUy by appropriate amendments- to
the registration statement and prospectus.
It is to be noted in this
connection that the public was asked to pay $6.25 per share for the
same class of stock. sold to promoters for approximately six onehundredths' of 1 cent per share.

the summary tigures used
the text above, it should be kept in mind
that these statistics are based solely on the registration statements
which become effectively registered under the Securities A.ct of 1933.
AJl data, therefore, refer to the r.egistrants' intentions and estimates
as reflected .in registration statements. on th~ effootive..date and 008SequeD.tly represent statistics of intentions to sell securities rather than
statistics of actual sales of securities."
Security Qfferi-.gs.-Securities registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 constitute only part of ell. new issues offered for cash. On. the
other hand, the statistics of new offerings include only actual offerings,
whereas the statistics of registrations reflect r~trants'
mtentioDS
to sell securities. Comprehensive statistics of new cash offerings of
securities are presented in tables.8 and 9 of Appendix II, pages 269-7 a.
T.able 8, parts 1 and 2, show the estimated gross proceeds of all issues
offered for sale, classified by type of offering, type of security, and type
of issuer; in addition, table 9 presents data on the proposed use of
proceeds of corporate issues.
In general, the data cover such issues over $100,000 in amount,
and (for debt issues) of a maturity of I year or over at date of issuance
as were reported as offered for cash in the financial press, in documents
filed. with the Commission, or in other available sources. The statistics include offerings irrespective of whether the issues were publicly
or privately placed and regardless of whether they were registered
under the Securities Act of 1933. The statistics of new offerings thus

of the total, while rail and other issues amounted to $505,00.0,000" OD
16.9 percent.
Corporate securities privately placed aggregated. $980,452,000,
equal to 32.8 percent of all corporate offerings. IS This compared with
$807,342,000, or 34.1 percent of all corporate issues in the 1940
fiscal year. Corporate private placements in the 194I- fiscal year
included $586,805,000 of utility issues, $281,451,0.00 of industrial
issues and $112,196,000 of rail and other issues.
The principal use of estimated, net proceeds of $2,931,000,000
raised from total corporate issues during the fiscal.year was for repayment of indebtedness and retirement of preferred stock, $2,132,000,0001
or 72.7 percent of total net proceeds, being intended for that purpose;
This included 65.3 percent for repayment of funded debt, 2.7 percent
for payment of other debt, and ~.,7percent for retirement of preferred
stock. New' money purposos ' accounted. for $768,000,000, or 26.2
percent of total net proceeds, consisting .of '$600,000,000 for plant
and equipment and $168,DOO,000for working capital.
The remainder
of $31,000,000, or 1.1 percent of net proceeds, was applied to miseellaneous other purposes.
Underwritingparticipations.-During the fiscal year ended June 30,
1941, the revised series of .statisties of underwriting participations
was continued on a quarterly and annual basis. The amount' of
participations in underwritten registered issues, classified by type of
security, was shown for each of the 50 largest New York City firms
and the 50 largest firms outside of New York City. The amount of
issues managed, also classified by type of security, was shown for each
of the 20 leading firms in and outside of New York City. These basic
data make possible an analysis of the distribution of underwriting
business, insofar as registered securities are concerned, among the
various investment banking firms.I'
Cost of flotation.~In March 1941 the Commission issued a report
entitled "Cost of Flotation .for Registered Securities 1938-1939,"
submitted to it by the Research and Statistics Section of tlie:Tra.<fuig

was published in May 1941 in. Statistical Series Release No. 568..
This report contained for the first time a detailed text analysis of
security characteristics.
.Partieular attention was called to provisions
for periodic retirement in the case of bonds and preferred stocks and
to voting rights in the case of preferred and common stocks. The
availability of data for the 4-year period also made possible a study
of changes in 'basic security provisions during a considerable part of
the period in which the Securities Apt was operative.
. Sales of unseasoned is8'Ue8.~In June 1941 the Commission issued a
report entitled "Sales Record of::Unseasoned Registered Securities
1933-1939," which was submitted to it by the Research and Statistics
Section of. the Trading and Exchange Division: Included in this
report were approximately 30 pages of text, tables, and charts. The
study covered only those issues registered under the Securities Act of
1933 which were deemed to be unseasoned in character.
It was based
on questionnaire returns from 757 companies covering 849 issues with
registered amount of $409,204,000. Major emphasis was placed upon
the ratio of. the amount actually sold to the amount, registered.
Detailed breek-downs of this sales ratio were made by type of concern
(new venture or going concern)" type .of security, major industrial
group, size of issue and size of issuer.. Information also was presented
on cost of flotation based on actual 'sales experience. The reporf
was intended primarily to serve as a further contribution toward an
understanding of the broad problem of small scale financing.

UNDER SECURITIES ACT

.

In a substantial revision of its procedures and rules in connection
with the exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933
of offerings nO,t in .excess of $100;000, the Commission repealed its
former Rules 200'to ~IOLinc~usive, and, effective December 9, 1940,
substituted a simplified Regulation A, consisting-of a single integrated
e~ep1ption"cont~ined
in Rules 220 to 224, which in many respects

the Commission has given a toUd
exemption ()D. issues up to $30,000. As to other .issues not in exeess nf
$100,000, &D. exemption has beetl1l.VtiIi:la.ble only upon v:arying telms
and conditions, such as the compliapee with. the laws.of the States in
which. the seeurities were sold, or the use ~f .. prospootus containing
certain specified information. The former Rules 202 to 216 were
rescinded. effective January 1, 1941. During the ~
 months from
July 1, 1940, to December 31, 194D, proposed stock offerings (other
than those of companies engaged in the oil and gas business} accounted
for the filing of 46 'prospectuses under the old Rule 202, representing
a total offering price of $3,765,000, and. 781etters ofnotmca.tinn under'
the old Rule 210, involving.a total.o1fering price of $4,81'8,000. At the
same time stock offerings of .oil and gas companies accounted for the
filing of 3 additional prospectuses under the old Rule 202, representing
an aggregate offering of $121,980, "8.D.d 10 .additional Ietters of notJifica,tion under :the old. Rule,2.10, x~~~g",fl"total,offering.;-of
'$587,000.
The new simplified procedure does not require tM use of a prospectus
in any case. To avail itself of the exemption, a domestie issuer will.
need only to send to the nearest regional office of the Commission
a letter notifying that office of its intention to sell, together with .any
selling literature it may plan to use. This letter. of notmcation need
contain only such. information as the name of the. company, the name
of the underwriters, the title of the issue to be sold, and a brief summary of the intended use of the proceeds. The issuer can give this
notice, at its option, either thr.ough 'an inf~r.mallettet" er through. the
use of a three-page form which has been adopted by the Commission
for the issuer's convenience and which will be supplied on request.
This optional form is designated as Form 8-31>--1. Where the issuer
nevertheless chooses to use a prospectus, the regulation :indicates
certain skeleton information to be included. therein.
A broadened exemption is 1l.vaila.ble.jn sevw.al.important~respects
under the new regulation.
For enmPIe, the Commission takes a new
position as to future sales of the securities of the same issuer. Heretofore, the Commission's rules have been such that, if the offering was
a part of a larger financial program, involving the future 131I1e
of additional securities of the same elass, the exemption was not available.
The new regulation specifically states that the exemption is available
even if "it is contemplated that after the termination of the offering
an offering of additional securities win be made."

Efforts to Protect Investors in Oil and Gas Leases;

','

'.

'The Commission has for some time been confronted with.problems
arising out of the sale of oil and gas leases ... Certain persons engaged
in this business have maintained that a .sale or. assignment of an oil
or gas lease on a specific property did not constitute under any eir..
cumstances the sale of a security. The Commission had an opportunity'
during the past year to state its position in this matter in connection
with It registration statement filed. in a specific case.. Briefly, the
Commission took the position.ar-thes-ease-that
assignments of 5-year
term oil and gas leases, in parcels of not less than 5 aeres.. constitute
investment contracts and therefore seeurities within.the meaning of
Section 2 (1) of the Securities Act of .1933, where it is contemplated
that purchasers will buy the assignments in the expectation that they
will increase in value as the result of drilling operations which have been
started and are intended to be resumed; where the assignor is to pay'
for. the drilling operations and is to be- reimbursed for any sums thus
expended from the proceeds of the sale of the assignments; and where
the assignor has a reversionary interest in the central drilling block.
As a result of an investigation conducted by the Commission during
the year in connection with an oil and gas lease promotion, several
persons were convicted on charges arising out of, violations of .the
fraud provisions of the Securities Act. of 1933. .In addition, confer'01 the principal oil producing
ences were held With officials of
States, and plans were made for closer cooperation between the Commission and such State authorities to facilitate consideration of.
problems arising in the sale of oil and gas Ieases. , It is anticipated
that this cooperation will offer a substantially greater degree of
protection to those members of the investing public.who may desire
to invest' in this type of security.
",'"

on~

O~ and,Gas Investigations.

, During the past year investigations were conducted-in a .total of.
284 cases involving oil and gas properties or proposed. offerings of oil
and gas securities. These.investigations,
which' arose largely out of
complaints received by the Commission, were primarily conducted
to ascertain whether transactions in the oil and gas securities were
effected in violation of Sections 5 or 17 of the Securities Act of 1933.
However, in some of the cases, facts and circumstances were developed
indicating violations of Section 15,o(the Securitiee Exchange,Act of
1934. Of the 284'investigations,
148 had been disposed of and 136
were pending at the close of the' fiscal ~ear. AB a result of these,
investigations, the persons concerned in 6 cases were enjoined from
violating the registration or fraud provisions -of"the Securities' Act of
1933, and in 9 cases, involving ....appiOxim,&tely 25 persons, the' faCts
were referred 'to the Department of Justice for_crimiIial prosecution,

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE TRUST INDENTURE

ACT OF 19391

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes,
debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, sold, or
delivered after sale through the mails or in interstate commerce
(except as specifically exempted by the Act) be issued under an
indenture which meets the requirements of the Act and has been
duly qualified with the Commission. The provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 are so
integrated that registration of indenture securities, pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, is not permitted to become effective unless
the indenture under which such securities are to be issued conforms
to the specific requirements contained in the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, and has been qualified under that statute.
NEW RULES, REGULATIONS,

AND FORMS

UNDER TRUST INDENTURE

ACT

At the same time that the Commission provided, as an experiment,
complete facilities in its San Francisco and Cleveland Regional Offices
for the registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as
discussed elsewhere in this report," corresponding arrangements were
made for the qualification of indentures under the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939 in those regional offices. In order to carry out this
further decentralization of registration facilities, various technical
amendments to the general rules under the Trust Indenture Act of
1939 were adopted." As a further step in this connection, the Commission also adopted a new rule (Rule T-7A-9) under which any
application under the latter Act which is to be filed with the Commission's central office in Washington, or any amendment to an
application so filed, may be delivered to the Commission's regional
officein the same section as that in which the applicant is located, for
forwarding to Washington. 4
Also during the year, the Commission adopted one new form
(Form T-4), as well as certain amendments to Forms T-1, T-2, and
T-3 under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Form T-4 is to be used
for applications for exemption filed pursuant to Section 304 (c) of the
Act. That section authorizes the Commission to exempt from one or
more provisions of the Act securities to be issued under an indenture
under which other securities are already outstanding, if the consent
of the existing security holders to compliance with such provisions

would be required or if such compliance would impose an undue
burden on the issuer. In this connection, the Commission also promulgated several new rules which are supplementary to the new form.
The Commission also promulgated during the past year two rules
designated as Rules T-lOB-2 and T-lOB-3 pursuant to Section 310 (b)
of the Act. Subparagraph (1) of that section provides that trusteeship under one or more indentures in addition to the indenture to be
qualified shall not disqualify the trustee if the Commission determines
that such additional trusteeship is not likely to involve a material
conflict of interest. Rule T-10B-2 establishes a new procedure
designed to expedite the disposition of certain applications filed under
that section. It provides that where an application under this section is based upon the claim that no material conflict will arise because,
prior to or concurrently with the delivery of the new indenture
securities, the other indenture or indentures will be discharged or
measures to assure the discharge will be provided, the application
shall be deemed to have been granted unless, within seven davs after
it is filed, the Commission orders a hearing thereon. Rule T-10B-3
is also a procedural rule designed particularly to facilitate qualification of indentures. Specifically, it enables persons desiring to act as
trustees to determine in advance of the filing of a registration statement or an application for qualifies tion of an indenture whether or
not the Commission would find them to be disqualified to act as such
because of a control relationship with any particular person who might
be named as underwriter for the obligor.
Certain other changes of a relatively minor nature were made in
the rules and regulations during the year.

OF THE COMMISSION

ACCOUNTING
AND AUDITING

UNDER

FIELD

OF

As has been emphasized in previous annual reports, much of the
material filed with the Commission takes the form of financial statements. The utility of such statements is clearly and directly dependent upon the soundness of the accounting principles followed in
their preparation, and in the quality and independence of the work
of the public accountant whose certificate accompanies them. Improvement and clarification of auditing and accounting standards
and insistence upon the independence of certifying accountants are,
therefore, objectives of major importance to the Commission.
Auditing.

The Sixth Annual Report of the Commission 1 contained a brief
resume of the principal facts disclosed by the investigation in In the
Matter oj McKesson &: Robbins, Inc., and of the conclusions set forth
in the Commission's report thereon.
It was indicated that, for the
time being at least, the Commission would not seek to prescribe in
detail the scope of and procedures to be followed in audits of the
various types of registrants but instead would await the outcome of
efforts of the accounting profession which had taken concrete form
in the publication of several bulletins and resolutions embodying
material extensions of auditing procedure.
However, it was also
indicated that the Commission's requirements as to the form and
content of accountants' certificates would be revised to overcome
certain shortcomings in such certificates as disclosed by its studies.
In furtherance of this program and after extended correspondence
and discussion with committees of the several professional associations
of accountants and a large group of other interested persons, the
Commission promulgated amendments to its rules as to certification
on February 5, 1941.2 Both positive representations as to the scope
and character of the work done and express indication of normal
procedures omitted must now be included in the certificate in order to
conform to the following requirements of paragraph (b) of Rule 2-02
of Regulation S-X, as amended:

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

"(b) Representationsas to the Audit.-The accountant's certificate (i) shall
contain a reasonably comprehensive statement as to the scope of the audit made
including, if with respect to significant items in the financial statements any
auditing procedures generally recognized as normal have been omitted, a specific
designation of such procedures and of the reasons for their omission; (ii) shall
state whether the audit was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards applicable in the circumstances; and {iii) shall state whether the audit
made omitted any procedure deemed necessary by the accountant under the
circumstances of the particular case.
"In determining the scope of the audit necessary, appropriate consideration
shall be given to the adequacy of the system of internal check and control.
Due
weight may be given to an internal system of audit regularly maintained by means
of auditors employed on the registrant's own staff. The accountant shall review
the accounting procedures followed by the person or persons whose statements
are certified and by appropriate measures shall satisfy himself that such accounting
procedures are in fact being followed.
.
"Nothing in this rule shall be construed to imply authority for the omission of
any procedure which independent accountants would ordinarily employ in the
course of an audit made for the purpose of expressing the opinions required by
paragraph (c) of this rule."

In announcing the adoption of the new rules, the Commission
explained its views as to the application of these new requirements:
"Section (b) contains the requirements for the accountant's representations as
to the nature of the audit which he has made. Under subdivision (i) the accountant must give a reasonably comprehensive description of the scope of the audit
which he has performed.
In accordance with the opinion of the Commission in
the McKesson report, the subdivision also requires that, if any generally recognized normal auditing procedures have been omitted with respect to significant
items in the financial statements, such omissions shall be stated with a clear explanation of the reasons for such omission. It is contemplated that designation
of procedures omitted would be confined to the primary auditing requirements
which have been recognized as normal auditing procedure, as for example, the
circularization of receivables, and would not extend to detailed or mechanical
steps. Since in particular circumstances such omissions may be proper, the
specification of such omissions and the reasons therefor in connection with the
description of the audit would not be considered as exceptions or qualifications
unless specifically so noted in connection with subsection (ii) which requires that
the accountant shall state whether the audit was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards applicable in the circumstances.
In referring
to generally recognized normal auditing procedures the Commission has in mind
those ordinarily employed by skilled accountants and those prescrihed by authoritative bodies dealing with this subject, as for example, the various accounting
societies and governmental bodies having jurisdiction.
In referring to generally
accepted auditing standards the Commission has in mind, in addition to the
employment of generally recognized normal auditing procedures, their application
with professional competence by properly trained persons. The Commission
further recognizes that the individual character of each auditing engagement
and the facts disclosed through a vigilant, inquisitive, and analytical approach
by the auditor may call for the extension of normal procedures or the employment
of additional procedures.
Therefore, subsection (iii) requires that the accountant also state whether he omitted any procedure deemed necessary by him under
the circumstances of the particular case.

PART VIII-oTHER

ACTIVITIES

"Paragraphs two and three of section (b) incorporate provisions of previous
rules and add the requirement that 'appropriate consideration shall be given to
the adequacy of the system of internal check and control,' thus emphasizing the
importance of this basic element."

The new requirements have not been in force for a period long
enough to warrant definitive conclusions as to their effect. It may
be expected, however, that limitations imposed by management or
normal procedures omitted through personal preferences will not
henceforth escape disclosure and consequent administrative review,
so far as reports filed with this Commission are concerned. While
the revised rule is applicable only to reports subject to the Commission's jurisdiction, yet the Committee on Auditing Procedure of the
American Institute of Accountants has taken the position that ".As
a practical matter, however, practicing accountants may in course
of time consider it advisable to apply the same standards of disclosure
. in reports for other purposes also, though the old form will doubtless
continue to be used for an intermediate period." 3 It may be noted
in this connection that Sections 30 and 32 of the Investment Company
Act of 1940 incorporate requirements as to accountants' certificates,
the scope of the underlying audit, and the selection of auditors that
are substantially similar to the recommendations contained in the
McKesson report and the revised Rule 2-02 of Regulation S-X.
Section 30, however, is applicable not only to certificates required to
be included in reports to this Commission but also to certificates
required to be included in reports to stockholders. The section further introduces the significant requirement that reports to stockholders
"shall not be misleading in any material respect in the light of the
reports" required to be filed with the Commission.
Questions as to the adequacy of the audit made or as to the accuracy of statements contained in the accountant's certificate were
raised in three stop order cases under the Securities Act of 1933,
namely, In the Matter of American Tung Grove Developments, Inc.,'
In the Matter of National Electric Signal Oompany,5 and In the Matter
of Resources Oorporation Iniernasional." None of these cases, however, arose under the provisions of the revised rules as to certificates.
In the American Tung Grove case, the Commission's opinion concluded:
"The materiality of the accountant's failure to express any opinion with
respect to the registrant's accounting procedure is emphasized by the laxity and
haphazardness of the procedure followed by the registrant.
Registrant's predecessors kept no complete set of books. Registrant's own books were set up by
H. E. Livermore, S. E. Stewart, their attorney, and a bookkeeper, and have been
kept by Stewart and an assistant.
None of these persons are accountants or are

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

qualified in accounting procedure.
It appears that principal reliance was placed
on Moore who came in at various times to make entries in the books on the basis
of vouchers made by Stewart and his assistant. The details of all accounts and
contracts were handled by H. E. Livermore.
The practice was for Livermore to
pocket all monies coming in and later to settle with the registrant on the basis of
the difference between the amounts received and the commissions due him.
"The record contains many illustrations of the superficiality of the accountant's
examination and audit and the doubtful value of his report.
For example, he
failed to make any inquiry as to the existence of contingent liabilities and apparently made no attempt to determine the collectibility of the accounts receivable,
other than to accept the statement of an officer that the accounts were all good.
Furthermore, he failed to make any disclosure of the unusual nature of the cash
receipts system of the registrant under which all monies went through Livermore.
The superficial nature of such an examination, the accountant's failure adequately
to disclose the registrant's questionable accounting practices, and the fact that he
admittedly ignored the Commission's regulations relating to financial statements
included in a registration statement constitute a severe indictment of the value
of his report."

In

the Resources case, the Commission concluded that while the
accountants' report was helpful in pointing out the matters upon
which the accountants were unable to express any opinion and in
flagging many of the material facts of particular interest to investors,
it could not be considered to be a "certificate" within the meaning of
the instructions calling for certified financial statements since the
report contained exceptions pertaining to the value assigned to the
corporation's principal assets and stated capital, and to the accounting principles followed in connection therewith and thus excluded
from its purview all but approximately $35,000 of assets out of total
stated assets of more than $9,000,000. As to the scope of the audit
it was held that:
"Moreover, the auditors failed in two respects in the performance of their
duties. In the first place, it appears that they were aware of certain additional
material facts concerning Hoover's relationship to RCI which were not disclosed.
Secondly, they failed to make as extensive an examination as, in our opinion, is
required under the circumstances of this case.
"When auditors, in the course of an examination, gain knowledge of facts
which are of material importance to investors, they are under a duty to report
such facts to investors.
If these facts are not set forth in the balance sheet, the
accountant's report is an appropriate medium for conveying the information to
investors.
"It is true that Arthur Andersen & Co. filed a report to the effect that they
cannot 'express an opinion with respect to the
balance sheet that
embraces the matter of value assigned therein to those assets and to the stated
capital or the accounting principles followed in connection therewith.'
However,
they cannot excuse their failure to disclose the facts surrounding the organization
of RCI and Hoover's true relationship to the Syndicate by pointing to this
qualification.
Nor does the qualification in their report run to the scope of their
investigation, but merely to the fact that they were not able to express an opinion
on certain matters of value. It must be assumed, therefore, that the auditors
have represented that they have made the type of examination required by our

rules. However, the record shows that Arthur Andersen & Co. failed to make
such an examination.

"It is, therefore, clear that, before the accountants prepared the data for the
registration statement, their representative on the job had entertained grave
doubts as to the bookkeeping methods employed by RCI and as to the nature of
Hoover's relationship to the company. The obligation of the accountants to
report material facts to investors made it their duty to express such doubts in
their report unless, after such doubts arose, they made a careful investigation of
available data and ascertained facts which reasonably justified them in setting
those doubts at rest. But they made no such investigation.
The evidence shows
that they knew of the Syndicate and had access to the Syndicate subscription
ledger, RCI's stock certificate books, and the minutes of the Syndicate and of the
directors' meetings. Any adequate investigation of that available material
would have revealed facts amply confirming the grave doubts expressed by
Kuiper.
"In view, then, of those grave doubts and of the information which came to the
attention and which was at the disposal of the accountants, they were, in our
opinion, under an affirmative duty to examine, most carefully, into the relationship between Hoover and the Syndicate subscribers and between Hoover and
RCI, and to disclose the true facts. An examination of the Syndicate agreement,
the Syndicate subscription ledger, and the minutes of the organization meetings
would have been sufficient to demonstrate to the accountants that Hoover had
expended none of his own money in the acquisition of these properties; that the
profits made by him weJzenot disclosed either to the Syndicate subscribers or to
RCI; and that the statements made in the registration statement with respect to
Hoover's cost and the acquisition of the properties, not only do not constitute
sufficient disclosure, but are in fact materially misleading."

To these formal decisions involving questions as to auditing procedures there should be added many more cases which have been
informally resolved through discussion and conference between registrants, their accountants, and members of the Commission's staff.
It appears from such conferences that the recommended extensions of
auditing procedures to include physical checking or observation of
inventory procedure, circularization of receivables, and more incisive
analysis of the system of internal check and control are in fact being
applied.
Professional Conduct.

No less important than the maintenance of sound auditing standards
is the mamtenance of high standards of independence and of professional conduct among certifying accountants.
The Securities .Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
the Investment Company .Act of 1940 all incorporate the concept of
independence as a prerequisite to certification by public accountants.
The Commission's rules have always required independence in fact,
and have refused to consider an accountant independent with respect
to any person in whom he has any substantial interest, direct or indirect, or with whom he is, or was during the period of report, connected as a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer, or

190

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

employee. Accounting Series Release No. 227 first summarized
previous stop order decisions on the point as follows:
" 'In the Matter of Cornucopia Gold Mines, 1 S. E. C. 364 (1936), the Commission
held that the certification of a balance sheet prepared by an employee of the certifying accountants, who was also serving as the unsalaried but principal financial
and accounting officer of the registrant, and who was a shareholder of the registrant, was not a certification by an independent accountant.
In the Matter of
Rickard Ramore Gold Mines, ua., 2 S. E. C. 377 (1937), an accountant was held
to be not independent by reason of the fact that he was an employee or partner of
another accountant who owned a large block of stock issued to him by the registrant for services in connection with its organization.
In the Matter of A11U>rican
Terminals and Transit Company, 1 S. E. C. 701 (1936), conscious falsification of
the facts by the certifying accountant was held to rebut the presumption of
independence arising from an absence of direct interest or employment.
In the
Matter of Metropolitan Personal Loan Company, 2 S. E. C. 803 (1937), it was held
that accountants who completely subordinate their judgment to the desires of
their client are not independent.
In the Matter of A. Hollander & Son, Inc.,
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Release No. 2777 (1941), the Commission held
that an accountant could not be considered independent when the combined
holdings of himself, one of his partners, and their wives in the stock of the registrant had a substantial aggregate market value and constituted over a period of
four years from lU% to 9% of the combined personal fortunes of these persons.
It was also held to be evidence of lack of independence, with respect to the registrant, that the accountant had made loans to, and received loans from, the
registrant's officers and directors.
In the same case, the evidence showed that
registrant's president, over a period of years, had used the accountant's name as a
false caption for an account on the books of an affiliate not audited by such
accountant and that upon learning of these facts the accountant protested and
procured a letter of indemnification in connection with such use. It was held
that this continued use of the accountant's name, after his protest, and the
overriding attitude apparently assumed by the registrant's president in this
matter, constituted additional evidence of lack of independence.' "

The release then went on to express the opinion that when an
accountant and his client, directly or through an affiliate, have entered
into an agreement of indemnity which seeks to assure to the accountant
immunity from liability for his own negligent acts, whether of omission
or commission, the accountant could not be recognized as independent.
In In the Matter of A. HoUander &: Son, Inc.,s the Commission outlined the considerations underlying the general concept of independence in these words:
"We cannot, however, accept the theory advanced by counsel for the interveners that lack of independence is established only by the actual coloring or
falsification of the financial statements or actual fraud or deceit. To adopt such
an interpretation would he to ignore the fact that one of the purposes of requiring
a certificate by an independent public accountant is to remove the possibility of
impalpable and unprovable biases which an accountant may unconsciously acquire
because of his intimate nonprofessional contacts with his client. The requirement for certification by an' independent public accountant is not so much a

guarantee against conscious falsification or intentional deception as it is a measure
to insure complete objectivity.
It is in part to protect the accounting profession
from the implication that slight carelessness or the choice of a debatable accounting
procedure is the result of bias or lack of independence that this Commission has
in its prior decisions adopted objective standards.
Viewing our requirements in
this light, any inferences of a personal nature that may be directed against specific
members of the accounting prcfession depend upon the facts of a particular case
and do not flow from the undifferentiated application of uniform objective
standards."

Cognate though not identical problems of ethics have arisen in a
number of cases. State laws governing the issuance and revocation
of licenses to practice as a certified public accountant or as a public
accountant have recognized the necessity of maintaining high standards of professional conduct. The accounting professsion through
its national and State organizations has voluntarily established codes
of ethics. Violation of these standards, established after appropriate
hearings, may be grounds for public admonition, for suspension or
expulsion from the societies, or, in the case of State regulatory bodies,
for revocation of the license to practice. Strengthening revisions of
the code were made by the American Institute of Accountants and
by several State societies during the past year. Because of its direct
bearing on the accounting work of the Commission, the revised Rule
5 of the American Institute of Accountants' "Rules of Professional
Conduct" may be quoted:
"(5) In expressing an opinion on representations in financial statements
which he has examined, a member or an associate shall be held guilty of an
act discreditable to the profession if:
(a) He fails to disclose a material fact known to him which is not
disclosed in the financial statements but disclosure of which is necessary to make the financial statements not misleading; or
(b) He fails to report any material misstatement known to him to
appear in the financial statements; or
(c) He is grossly negligent in the conduct of his examination or in
making his report thereon; or
(d) He fails to acquire sufficient information to warrant expression
of an opinion, or his exceptions are sufficiently material to negative
the expression of an opinion; or
(e) He fails to direct attention to any material departure from
generally accepted accounting principles or to disclose any material
omission of generally accepted auditing procedure applicable in the
circumstances. "

In view of the existence of disciplinary machinery of this character, it is the practice of the Commission to bring to the attention of
the appropriate societies and State agencies each case in which the
Commission has publicly criticized the work or professional conduct
of accountants practicing before it. During the past year, for example, the Council of the American Institute of Accountants sitting as a
trial board on five cases called to its attention by the Commission

192

SEVENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

found two members guilty as charged, one of whom was suspended and
the other publicly admonished. The remaining three were found not
guilty, although in each case a published statement reviewed the facts
(without names) and indicated disapproval of certain of the practices."
Voluntary disciplinary machinery of this kind can, if its sanctions
are vigorously and uniformly applied, be of great importance in the
maintenance of proper standards of professional conduct. It cannot,
however, supplant or remove the Commission's direct disciplinary
authority under its Rules of Practice. Rule II (g) of these rules
includes as practice before the Commission the preparation of any
statement, opinion, or other paper by an accountant, :filed with the
Commission with his consent. Rule II (e) provides that:
"The Commission may disqualify, and deny, temporarily or permanently, the
privilege of appearing or practicing before it in any way to, any person who is
found by the Commission after hearing in the matter
(1) Not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others; or
(2) To be lacking in character or integrity or to have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct."

Moreover, it should be noted that during the past year two certified
public accountants were indicted and two others convicted as a result
of criminal proceedings in which the Commission participated.
Accounting.

As in past years, the greater part of the Commission's accounting
work consists of the review of financial statements to determine compliance with the Commission's requirements and conformity to generally accepted accounting principles. Moreover, while formal
opinions, rules, regulations, and accounting series releases establish
standards of accounting to be observed by registrants, a much larger
part of the effort of the Commission to improve accounting practice .
under the securities Acts takes place in informal conferences between
registrants, their accountants and counsel, and the Commission's
staff. Such conferences deal principally with the application of rules
to particular situations and with the determination of accounting
principles applicable in the absence of specific rules. For the most
part such conferences settle the issues by agreement and in many cases
lead to the selection, out of several generally recognized modes of
treatment, of what may be termed the most preferable method.
In several of the Commission's published opinions the accounting
practices of particular registrants were severely criticized. In In the
Matter of Resources Oorporation Ituernational." it was held that it was
misleading to imply that properties were carried in the balance sheet
at valuations independently determined by the board' of directors
when in fact the directors had not independently valued the property
but had merely accepted as true certain representations as to the

amount paid for the property by a preexisting syndicate.
point the Commission said:

193
On this

"In the first place, the statements made in the balance sheet imply that the
directors made an independent valuation of the properties at $9,000,000. This is
entirely untrue. The directors and Syndicate subscribers merely assumed that
Hoover was telling them the truth in stating that the actual cost of the properties
was $9,000,000; they made no independent valuation, but, in the belief that
Syndicate subscribers had contributed $7,350,000 which had been paid on the
properties and that the balance due was $1,650,000, they issued the $7,350,000 in
stock, assumed a $1,650,000 'obligation' and placed the figure represented by
Hoover to be the original cost of the properties upon the books of ReI.
"In the second place, the statements made in the balance sheet, especially when
coupled with the statements as to cost of properties and the amount of subscriptions received, contained in the exhibits to the registration statement, which are,
of course, a part thereof, give an entirely misleading picture of the facts surrounding the acquisition of the properties and of Hoover's breach of his fiduciary
duties. Thus, the impression is conveyed that at the time of the transaction, the
profits were fully disclosed to the persons with whom Hoover was dealing; that
such profits were realized by Hoover, as cendor of property, rather than as agent
for the Syndicate subscribers; and that Hoover's profits were the result of arm'slength bargaining and were entirely lawful. As we have pointed out, the actual
facts are to the contrary.
DIsclosure of the frauds of a promoter and the methods
utilized by him becomes particularly important when, as here, such promoter,
years later, is still in a controlling relationship with the corporation, and has continued, from time to time during the intervening period, to exact unlawful profits."

In the same case it was argued that juxtaposition of a $9,000,000
carrying value and a $359,154 "cost to the promoter" effected the
maximum disclosure possible, namely, that the difference represented
the promoter's profit. The opinion held this argument to be fallacious, quite apart from the fact that the difference was not an accurate
indication of the promoter's profit, and that he had made no expenditure of his own money, all monies spent on acquisition of the property
having been advanced to him as agent by the subscribers to a preexisting syndicate.
In In the Matter oj American Tung Grove DevelopmentsY profits on
contracts for the sale, development, and maintenance of land were
treated as realized at the time of signing the contract, although payments were to be made over a 3-year period. The procedure used,
in the absence of evidence as to collectibility, collection experience,
and resale value of retaken property, was held to be misleading unless
accompanied by full explanation of its character and effect. In
In the Matter oj A. Hollander & Son, Inc.,12 where the registrant's
principal business was the curing, dressing, and dyeing of fur skins,
the inclusion without further segregation of amounts advanced by the
registrant in a joint merchandising venture among "Notes Receivable
(trade)" was held to be an improper classification resulting in the concealment of material information. Inclusion of similar advances in
11

SEVENTII~AL

REPORT

"Loans Receivable" without adequate qualifying statements was likewise held to conceal material information. Other cases dealt with
accounting principles as to which the Commission had previously
expressed its opinion, such as the disclosure of contingent liabilities
due to sale of securities not registered under the Securities Act of 1933
and the arbitrary valuation of patent and mineral rights.
As noted elsewhere in this report 13 the Commission, upon request
by a registrant, is empowered to hold confidential certain material
otherwise required to be filed publicly with it. Under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 many requests have related to portions of the
financial statements and, in particular, to the sales and cost of goods
sold as reflected in the profit and loss statement.
During the past
year the opinion of the Commission in In the Matter of American
Sumatra Tobacco Oorporation, dated February 1, 1939, was published,"
ruling that data relating to sales and costs of goods sold should be made
public. The text of the decision, publication of which was withheld

"In American Sumatra Tobacco Corporation v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 110 F. 2d 117,
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Oolumbia sustained the Commission. In its decision
the court said:
" • • • it is clear that the Act contemplates publicity of corporate flnaneial reports to insure the
maintenance of faIr dealing in the purchase and sale of securities not only for the benefit of the investing
public, but lIS well for the protection of banks in which loans are collateralled by such securities. The
It

provisions

of Section 24, on the other hand, were, as we think, enacted to provide a means of avoiding

the

inf1iction of hardships in particular cases where full disclosure would more likely result in harm to the
registrant than in benefit to the public Congress imposed on the Commission the duty of determining the
question, and lIS we said in a former hearing in this case, tlns requires the exercise of a [udiclal discretion.
The Commission is correct, therefore. in saying that its duty is to weigh the respective equities. And this
the Commission says IS what it did.

.

.

"What does appear is that the obvIOUSpurpose and mtent of the Act is a full and complete disclosure
of each registrant's financial condition, including a true statement of its profits and losses from time to
time. The general principle underlymg this requirement is as apparent to the layman as to the expert,
and grows out of scandals resulting from past frequent manipulation of securities by the 'insider,' to the
detriment of the investor. To correct these abuses, no one doubts, was in the public interest, and while
nothing unfair or improper IS. imputed to petitioner, the question whether its case presents such positive
equlties as entitles it to be excepted from the general rule is, after ail, the only question for decision.
"This was recognized by Mr. Blough, the Commission's offiCialexpert, who frankly stated in his testimony that if public knowledge of the items in controversy would so seriously affect registrant as to wreck
its business, disclosure should not be required. We are in accord WIth this view, and we think it correctly
reflects the spirit of the Act. For unquestionably Congress, m giving a registrant the right to flle objection
to pubheanon and m authorizing the Commission to grant or refuse the request In the exercise of a sound
jndlcial discretion, imposed on the Commission the duty of considering the claimed danger of loss and
damage and of weighing it in the scale of public interest. And this, at least, is what the Commission has
attempted to do and, if the conclusion reached is just as likely to he correct lIS incorrect, It Is our duty to
let It stand.
" In saying this, we can also say that we have no dIftlculty in understanding petitioner's reasons for
apprehension that the disclosure will be harmful, and lithe question were before us as an orlgmal proposition.
we could easily see our way to sustaining the objections to general publreatron. But the question Is primarily not for us but for the Commission, and Congress unquestionably intended that the Commission
should bring to bear upon the decision of this and like questions, what has been called in cases within the
jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the knowledge and experience of experts. This does
not by any means set up an inquisition destructive of the rights of the mdivldual. The delegated
power is not to be exercised arbitrarily or to be considered an unfettered discretion over the property of
the citizen. Its exercise is subject to review. But so long as the Commission's decision rests on substantial
evidence and on Inferences which are not arbitrary and capricious. It should be sustained..

as expressive of the Commission's views as to the significance and
utility to the investing public of this information:
"The first question to be answered is whether the registrant's figures on
sales and cost of goods sold are necessary, or useful,'to investors, present or prospective.
"As a part of the information designed to assure investors the protection and
benefits of adequate corporate publicity, Congress prescribed the filing of 'profit
and loss statements for not more than the three preceding fiscal years.'
And
the Commission, by virtue of the authority granted to it in Sections 12 and 13
of the Act, has by rule required to be included in such statements the registrant's
figures of sales and cost of goods sold. The importance of this disclosure can
readily be demonstrated by the functions of a profit and loss statement.
"The profit and loss statement is designed to disclose for the period selected
the amount of net profit or loss, the sources of revenue, and the nature of expenses.
It thereby provides a basis for analyzing the results of operation and the course
of the business; and in addition it may be utilized in forecasting the future
revenues, expenses, and operating results of the enterprise.
It is generally agreed
among accountants and analysts that in order to perform these functions the stare.
ment of profit and loss should show, as a minimum requirement, the dollar volume
of commodities or services, the cost of goods sold and operating expenses of the
business, income from other sources, income deductions or nonoperating charges,
and net profit for the period.
"To particularize, one of the essential purposes of the profit and loss statement
is to furnish the. investor or prospective investor with adequate historical data
definitive of past earning power, and of prime importance in forecasting future
earning power. In order either to judge the past or to forecast intelligently, an
investor must have not only a record of past earnings or losses, but also the significant details as to how the particular results were obtained.
The starting point
in forecasting earning power is, of course, sales and operating revenues.
Moreover, since earning power results from the sale of commodities or services for an
amount greater than the cost of producing or distributing such commodities or
seeviees, the next essentials are the cost of goods sold and operating expenses.
Similarly, selling and administrative expenses are of prime significance. If there
is made available the historical record of sales, cost of sales, and the resultant
profit margin, the investor is provided an important guide in calculating future
costs in relation to future sales.
"If, however, sales and cost of sales in dollars are not included in the profit and
loss statement, information essential for analysis is absent.
In the first place, there
is no possibility of gauging the effect of changes in selling prices, wage rates, material costs and similar items upon the undisclosed primary elementB--sales and
revenues, and cost of goods sold-upon which the profit figure is partially based.
Likewise the possibility of gauging the probable effect of such changes upon the
resultant profit figure itself becomes less likely. The relationship of the trends
of the primary elements from which the resultant profit figure is derived varies
under different business and economic conditions.
The effects of variations in this
relationship cannot be measured by study of the trend of the gross profit on sales
or of the net operating profit alone.
"In the second place, the investor is also directly concerned with the relative
.size of an enterprise's profit margin, since it may be vital in appraising the signifieanee to the particular enterprise of other known factors and trends.
A business
enterprise may manifest particular efficiency of production, purchasing or distribution; its location, cost of capital, personnel, patents, trade-marks may all be
highly favorable.
If the factors contributing to the wide profit margin cannot

196

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

be duplicated, strength may be indicated.
But, to the extent that the contributing factors may not be lasting, weakness may be indicated.
So a wide profit
margin constitutes a warning signal; the investor must determine to what extent
the margin is likely to continue. A narrow profit margin may likewise be indicative of strength or weakness. If the narrow profit margin represents the choice
of the management to do a large volume of business at prices but little above the
cost of production and if this method has resulted in a large scale, integrated,
efficient business, the very narrowness of the margin may be an effective barrier
to competition.
On the other hand, a narrow profit margin may be indicative
of a variety of causes, such as strong or even destructive competition, managerial
inefficiency, increasing prices of raw materials relative to selling price. It follows,
therefore, that, unless the size of the profit margin is known to the investor, a vital
element of the information necessary for informed judgment and for this minimum
protection is lacking. Moreover, in either ease the extent of fluctuations in sales
and cost of sales is itself an important factor in appraising the degree of fluctuations in the profit margin.
"In the third place, knowledge of sales is vital also if the quality of various
balance sheet items is to be tested. The comparison of sales to receivables,
inventories, fixed assets, and net worth is ordinarily one of the first steps taken in
attempting to appraise the results of operations, and to predict their future
course.
"Unless, in short, an adequate profit and loss statement, including gross sales
and cost of sales, is made available, a sound appraisal of the management is
likely to be impossible. Institutional investors and investment experts, it is true,
may on occasion be able to obtain the necessary information through their own
analyses or investigations, even though it is not contained in the published
records. It is possible in this case, for example, that a skilled analyst, possessing
expert and detailed knowledge respecting the tobacco industry, could on the basis
of the disclosures contained in the nonconfidential portion of the registrant's
financial statements calculate approximately its gross sales and cost of sales in
dollars. Similarly, controlling stockholders may have access to such information.
But the average investor will not have this information and will not be able to
obtain it. As a result, he may well be helpless in making an adequate estimate
of the efficiency with which the management of the company has conducted the
business during the period covered by the particular profit and loss statement, in
judging the future trends of the business, or, in sum, in making a sound decision
whether to 'hold, buy, or sell' a security.
"It should not be implied, of course, in our emphasis of the importance to the
investor of the need of an adequate profit and loss statement, that it will automatically give him a perfect and detailed picture of the operating results that the
management is achieving with the enterprise. If, however, the profit and loss
statement is adequate, the investor can form some judgment as to the future.
And as financial reporting becomes increasingly clear and adequate, the more
comprehensive will be the analysis which the investor can make of his investment, and the more intelligent will be his investment decisions." 16

Problems continued to arise during the year as to the use of what
has been termed a quasi or accounting reorganization. Despite
treatment of this problem in several opinions of the Commission and
accounting series releases, as related in the Sixth Annual Report,"
it became apparent that it would be desirable to integrate and amplify
II

173.

PART VIll-QTHER

ACTIVITIES

197

the several statements on this question. Accordingly, an opinion of
the Chief Accountant was issued as Accounting Series Release No. 25/8
indicating the conditions under which a quasi-reorganization may be
said to have been effected:
"'It has been the Commission's view for some time that a quasi-reorganization may not be considered to have been effected unless at least all of the following conditions exist:
"'(1) Earned surplus as of the date selected is exhausted;
"'(2) Upon consummation of the quasi-reorganization no deficit
exists in any surplus account;
" '(3) The entire procedure is made known to all persons entitled to
vote on matters of general corporate policy and the appropriate consents
to the particular transactions are obtained in advance in accordance with
the applicable law and charter provisions;
" '(4) The procedure accomplishes with respect to the accounts substantially what might be accomplished in a reorganization by legal proceedings-namely, the restatement of assets in terms of present conditions
as well as appropriate modifications of capital and capital surplus, in order
to obviate so far as possible the necessity of future reorganizations of like
nature.
" 'It is implicit in such a procedure that reductions in the carrying value of
assets at the effective date may not be made beyond a point which gives appropriate recognition to conditions which appear to have resulted in relatively permanent reductions in asset values; as for example, complete or partial obsolescence,
lessened utility value, reduction in investment value due to changed economic
conditions, or, in the case of current assets, declines in indicated realization value.
It is also implicit in a procedure of this kind that it is not to be employed recurrently but only under circumstances which would justify an actual reorganization
or formation of a new corporation, particularly if the sole or principal purpose of
the quasi-reorganization is the elimination of a deficit in earned surplus resulting
from operating losses.' "

During the past!year four amendments and two clarifying interpretations of Regulation S-X were published. One of these adapted the
requirements of this regulation for use by companies in filing registration statements and annual reports under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. It is intended that instructions as to the form and content of financial statements of such companies will be reconsidered
with a view to further changes that may be deemed necessary or
desirable as a result of experience gained from the original filings under
that Act.
Miscellaneous

Research.

Among other accounting research work performed during the year
was the beginning of an extensive survey and study of annual reports
to stockholders as compared with annual reports flied by industrial
and commercial companies with this Commission under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The objective of this study will be to deterU

SEVENTH ~AL

REPORT

mine, if possible, the extent to which the Commission's rules and
decisions on accounting matters have influenced reports to stockholders which, with the exception of companies registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, are not ordinarily subject to the
jurisdiction of the Commission, and whether the financial statements
accompanying such reports are in form, content, and disclosure
reasonably consistent with and ~omparable to statements filed with
this Commission. The study, however, has not progressed sufficiently
to warrant a substantive report of its results.
Cooperation

with ProCessional Organizations.

The development of uniform standards and practice in major
accounting questions continues to be a common objective of the Commission and the accounting profession. Outstanding among efforts
of professional associations toward this goal was the publication by
the executive committee of the American Accounting Association, in
June 1941, of a revised "Statement of Accounting Principles Underlying Corporate Financial Statements."
Originally published in 1936,
the statement gave rise to a very large volume of critical comment and
discussion. The present revision should further stimulate progress
toward its announced objective, the expression of a unified and coordinated body of accounting theory to the end that financial statements may be both intelligible and, as far as possible, comparable
with statements of other periods and other corporations. Efforts of
the authorized committees Of the American Institute of Accountants
toward improved accounting procedure resulted in the publication of
seven official bulletins setting forth recommended procedure with
respect to such auditing and accounting problems as the weight to be
given a client's representations as to inventories and liabilities; the
treatment of certain contingent liabilities; the accountant's certificate;
accounting terminology; and combined income and surplus statements.
In connection with the promulgation of accounting series opinions
and accounting rules, the practice of the Commission was continued
of securing the comments and suggestions of cooperating committees
of the various professional societies interested in accounting and of
other interested persons. Many of the suggestions received in this
manner are reflected in the substance of the rule or opinion as finally
issued.
Not less important than the official and semiofficial publications are
the papers presented at regular and annual meetings of the various
societies and at accounting clinics and conferences frequently sponsored by leading universities and accounting societies. In addition to
the educational value of such public discussions, the published papers
form a valuable addition to accounting literature on a wide variety of

PART VIII-oTHER

ACTIVITIES

199

important issues and may be taken as a continuing indication of professional efforts to improve and clarify accounting and auditing pro-cedures. Various members of the Commission and its staff have
participated, from time to time, in such meetings.
INTERPRETATIVE

AND ADVISORY SERVICE

From its inception, the Commission has realized that the technical
nature of the statutes administered requires the maintenance of an
interpretative and advisory service to provide attorneys and the general public with prompt advice concerning problems arising under
those statutes. The large volume of requests for interpretations
received annually by the Washington officeand regional officesof the
Commission was augmented this year by the many new problems
arising under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which are administered by the Commission. These requests embrace an extremely wide area extending from
complaints attending the failure of corporations to declare dividendsa situation over which the Commission has no jurisdiction-to
inquiries by foreign governments desirous of selling, for war purposes,
securities held locally by their nationals. Generally, however, inquiries relate to problems confronting modest business enterprises
interested in capital expansion. In every case, the Commission
attempts to aid the person making the inquiry to understand and
comply with the law.
The jurisdiction of the Commission does not extend to private
disputes of a civil nature arising under the Securities laws. Consequently, the Commission cannot advise litigants concerning the
prosecution or defense in such cases.
COMPLAINTS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

One of the important functions of the Commission is, of course, the
enforcement of the several statutes which it administers. The Commission annually receives and replies to thousands of complaints from
the public with respect to alleged violations. Information indicating
statutory violations also reaches the Commission from other sources,
such as the constant surveillance of market activities, the examination
of registration statements, and the facts furnished by cooperating
State and Federal agencies.
Every complaint lodged with the Commission receives careful consideration. Frequently, the complainant seeks the Commission's aid
to recover money invested in securities or to rectify strictly internal
conditions of a corporation, matters over which the Commission has
no jurisdiction. While the Commission cannot assist investors
directly in recovering money obtained from them in violation of law,
it can, and does, give them helpful information contained in its public

200

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

records, investment manuals, and other public sources to which the
investor may not have ready access.
Where the violation of a statute is indicated, preliminary inquiries
are made to substantiate statements made by the complainant. If,
after this preliminary inquiry, it appears to the Commission that one
of the statutes has been violated, an investigation is initiated in an
effort to determine the facts. Much of this investigative work is
conducted through the Commission's nine regional offices and theWashington Field Office. These offices are strategically located in
principal financial centers throughout the country. Such investigations may lead to civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings; on theother hand, they may prove negative. Sometimes a violation of
statutes administered by other branches of the Federal government,
or by State authorities, is indicated. It is the Commission's policy to
cooperate fully with such bodies and to furnish them with information,
in which they are interested.
At the beginning of the past fiscal year, the enforcement section had
pending 696 investigations and legal cases under the Securities Act of
1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, Investment Company Act of 1940 and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. During the year, 484 additional investigations
were initiated. Out of this total of 1,180 cases, 548 were disposed of
during the past year, leaving 632 cases pending as of June 30, 1941.The following table indicates the number of such cases pending and
disposed of during the past fiscal year:

of securities. Accordingly, in connection with the enforcement of the
fraud and registration provisions of the Acts, the Commission has
established through its Securities Violations Files a clearing house for
information concerning fraudulent securities transactions. The information thus assembled with the assistance of State securities commissions and other public agencies, the members of the National
-Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., and members of the
United States Chamber of Commerce, is made available only to those
officials and agencies who are directly concerned with the suppression
-of fraudulent and other illegal practices in the sale of securities.
LITIGATION
Civil Proceedings.

At the beginning of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1941, 13 civil
proceedings instituted by the Commission were pending; during the
year, the Commission instituted 34 additional proceedings, including
'28 injunctive actions brought against 82 persons to restrain them from
fraudulent and otherwise illegal practices in the sale of securities .
.Of this total of 47 proceedings, 36 were disposed of during the fiscal
year, including 32 cases which resulted in the entry of injunctions
against 79 persons. Eleven civil proceedings were pending at the end
-of the year.
Since its inception, the Commission has instituted a total of 404
-civil proceedings and disposed of 393. Permanent injunctions have
been obtained against 853 firms and individuals.

A brief description of all civil proceedings commenced or pending
during the year ended June 30, 1941, showing their status at the end
of that year, is set forth in Appendix IV, page 323, of this report.
Some of the more important or interesting of these cases are described
below in more detail.
Past annual reports have discussed many ingenious schemes to
secure public investment in business enterprises without complying
with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. As was stated in the
Commission's Sixth Annual Report: 19

" * * *

These schemes usually are camouflaged as the 'sale' of real or
personal property coupled with an arrangement under which the promoter-seller
retains possession of the property, representing that he will manage or resell it
for the benefit of the purchasers."

During the past fiscal year, the Com:rr..issionhas been successful in
several actions brought to enjoin violation of the Securities Act of
1933 where attempts were made to disguise the actual sale of a security
as a sale of personal property. Noteworthy among these cases were
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Louis Payne; 20 Securities and
It

Exchange Oommission v. Leo O. Pyne; 21 and Securities and Exchange
Oommission v. The Sentena1 Oorporation et al.22
In the Louis Payne case, the defendant, without complying with
the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, offered to sell
silver foxes under a bill of sale coupled with a ranching agreement.
This agreement provided that the defendant would care for and breed
the foxes and dispose of their offspring. In holding the entire transaction to constitute a sale of securities, Judge Edward A. Conger, of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
said:
"True the said documents on their face, and judged according to form, appear
to be contracts of sale; true the purchaser is given title and the right to possession

of the animal or animals mentioned in the contracts; true there are other indicia
of ownership, such as marking of the animals for each individual 'purchaser', therecording in the proper office of the 'bill of sale' in the name of the purchaser and
the payment of personal tax on each animal; nevertheless, viewing the various
transactions by and large and all the surrounding circumstances one can concludeonly that these transactions were investments and not actual and bona fide sales.

*****

"Many in this world of ours desire to make money without effort. Men and
women in all professions, busy men and women with good incomes, have an
innate desire to increase their income or their principal.
They do this by so-called
investments.
They venture into realms of which they know nothing.
All theliterature of the defendant appeals to this urge. Here was an appealing proposition to an investor.
Under skillful handling and care by experienced men, and by
the very law of nature, a pair of foxes would produce young each year (at least
three).
This increment was the profit. Properly handled by a skilled salesman,
who had access to the proper markets, this increment would return dollars. AU
without any effort on the part of the purchasers."

In the Leo O. Pyne case, the Commission prevented public investment in securities offered in violation of the registration and fraud
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 by obtaining an injunction
before any sales had been completed. The defendants were offeringundivided interests or "ship shares" in two boats, which they were
operating, and in additional boats which they represented would be
built. Proceeds from the sale of these interests were proposed to be
used in the construction of new fishing vessels. The shares or interests were offered at $1,000 each and represented a temporary
interest in the proceeds from the two existing vessels as well as an
interest in the vessels to be built.
The complaint alleged that, in attempting to make sales to prospects, the defendants, either directly or through their agent, made
many false and misleading statements.
The court held that the"ship shares" or the Undivided interests in vessels, which carried with
them the right to the receipt of profits by prospective purchasers.

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

moot of money with the expectation of profits through the efforts of
other persons", were securities within .the meaning of the Securities
Act of 1933. The court also held that the defendants had violated the
fraud provisions of the Act, as well as its registration provisions in
the sale of the securities.
Securities and Exclw-nge Oommission v. The Sentenal Oorporation
et al. involved the sale of popcorn-vending machines, coupled with a
lease-back and profit-sharing agreement. The defendants consented
to the entry of a permanent injunction against further sales in Violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
The injunction was used to prevent illegal sales of another type of
security in Securities and Ezchanqe Oommission v. Mario CasaMassa et al.23 The security involved was described by the defendants
as an "expectancy equity." The defendants were engaged in soliciting and selling equities in two trusts which allegedly held United
States patents on a new and improved type of differential for automobiles and trucks. The defendants represented, among other things,
that several large automobile manufacturers were interested in the
invention. The Commission's complaint charged this was untrue,
that no United States patents were held by the defendants, and that
the differential had failed to prove practical in several tests. The
complaint further alleged evidence that the defendants were appropriating a large part of the proceeds received from the sales to
their own use. After the .filing of the complaint, the defendants
-consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining further violations
of the registration and fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
Otl-er forms of securities frequently involved in the Commission's
civil litigation relate to oil and gas properties. These securities took
. the form either of outright sales of oil and gas leases or of fractional
undivided interests in oil and gas leases. Typical of the former type
-of case is Securities and Exdumqe Oommission v, Claude D. Adams
et al.24 In this case, the defendants were selling assignments of oil
and gas leases covering unproven and speculative tracts of land in
minimum parcels or units of 5 acres without complying with the
registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The prices of
such parcels were determined by the location of the leases with 'respect
to a test well the defendants had agreed and undertaken to drill and
-complete. The Commission's complaint charged violations of the
registration and fraud provisions of the Act. The defendants agreed
to discontinue the sale of the securities and consented to the entry of a
final judgment enjoining further sales in violation of the registration
provisions of that Act.

The second type of securities referred to in the preceding paragraph
was involved in Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Arthur Lew
Larson."
In this case, the Commission filed a complaint seeking to
enjoin the defendant from continuing to sell undivided fractional
interests in oil and gas leases in violation of the registration and fraud
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the registration and fraud
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relating to overthe-counter brokers and dealers. The Commission's motion for a
summary judgment was granted and a permanent injunction was
ordered by the court.
The cases in the field of civil litigation which have been discussed
so far involved violations of both the registration and fraud provisions
of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Timetrust Incorporated
et al.,26 the injunction was sought solely upon the grounds that the
defendants had violated the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of
1933. The court handed down a memorandum opinion finding that
the defendants, Timetrust, Inc., Bank of America National Trust &
Savings Association, Meredith Parker, Ralph W. Wood, H. E.
Blanchett, A. P. Giannini, L. Mario Giannini, and John M. Grant"
had violated the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the
sale of certificates of interest in shares of the common stock of Bank
of America National Trust & Savings Association. The complaint
was filed on April 5, 1939, and after several preliminary matters had
been heard and determined, as related in the Fifth and Sixth Annual
Reports," the case went to trial on May 10, 1940. The fraudulent
acts and practices complained of consisted, in general, of misleading
statements and representations concerning the nature and soundness
of Timetrust certificates. These statements and representations, set
forth in literature distributed by Timetrust, Inc., and made orally by
salesmen, portrayed the Timetrust certificates as being similar to a
savings account and represented that the investment would be bound
to have a large increase in principal due to "dollar averaging," compounding income, and unrealized appreciation. The plan was
represented as being a safe and sound investment, but the literature
and representations of the salesmen did not disclose that the purchase
of Timetrust certificates was merely a method of purchasing Bank of
America common stock on the instalment plan. On the facts, the
court concluded that, in addition to making false and misleading
statements and omissions, the defendants were engaging in a device,
scheme, and artifice to defraud purchasers and prospective purchasers
and rendered judgment enjoining each of the defendants from these

acts. All defendants have appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit.
The Commission has also found it necessary, for the protection of
investors, to seek to enjoin the sale of securities where no fraud appeared. Such was the case in Securities and Exchange Commissum v .
Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, Inc.,28 filed June 12,1940.
In that case, the Commission sought to enjoin the defendant, a
patriotic association, from selling unregistered bonds of the Chinese
Government in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. The defendant, through mass meetings and newspaper advertisements, had
solicited offers to buy the unregistered bonds. It had undertaken
these activities, without profit to itself, in the interest of the Chinese
Government and had no official or contractual relationship with that
Government.
The District Court of the Southern District of New
York, on motions for judgment on the pleadings, found for the defendant on the ground that it was not an underwriter and was, therefore, exempt from the provisions of the Act. The Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit, in an opinion rendered by Judge A. N.
Hand (Swan, C. J. dissenting), reversed the district court and directed
it to issue an injunction."
The court found that the defendant was
.selling for an issuer within the meaning of the statute and was
therefore an underwriter. It also found that, irrespective of whether
the defendant was an underwriter, it was engaged in a transaction in
which an issuer was distributing securities. The court pointed out
that the action instituted by the Commission was undertaken "only
to prevent the sale of Chinese securities through the mails without
registry. If it cannot be prevented, there is nothing to stop Germany,
Itely, Japan, or any other nation, as well as China, from flooding
our markets with securities without affording purchasers the information which the Securities Act intends to render available for investors
in foreign bond issues."
A different type of injunction is sought by the Commission in
Securities and Exchange Oommisiwn v. The North American Oompany
et at. which is now pending in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware. Here the Commission, in its efforts to effectuate
the policies embodied in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, instituted an action against the North American Light & Power
Company and The North American Company. The complaint seeks
an injunction to prevent North American Light & Power Company
from holding a stockholders' meeting for the purpose of voting on a
resolution to dissolve the company and also to enjoin such dissolution
.and liquidation and to enjoin The North American Company from
voting at the meeting .

At the time this action was begun, there was a proceeding under
Section 11 (b) (1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
pending before the Commission with respect to The North American
Company and its subsidiaries. The contention of the Commission is
that under the circumstances North American Light & Power Company, as a registered holding company, may not exercise the privilege
of dissolving and liquidating pursuant to State statutes unless it has
first subnutted its proposed plan of liquidation to the Commission in
the pending proceeding and unless the Commission has found, under
Section 11 (e) of the Act and that such plan is "fair and equitable to
the persons affected" thereby.
The Commission's duty to protect the investing public has necessitated the institution of a number of actions against over-tbe-counter
brokers and dealers who have violated the provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Two examples of such cases are Securities and
Exchange Oommission v. John F. Oole, doing business as Fulton, Cole
& Roe,30 and Securities and Exdumqe Oommission v. William E.
Atwood &; Oompany, Inc. 31
In the Oole case, the defendant represented himself as being a member of the "International Securities Dealers Association," a name
confusingly similar to National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(a well-known association registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934) when, in fact, he was not a member of either association .
Also, the defendant represented falsely that he was a member of the
Investment Bankers Association and' of a nonexistent "N ew York
Curb Stock and Bond Market."
The Commission sought an injunction to enjoin the continuance of these frauds in violation of Section
15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 17 (a) of the
Securities Act of 1933. The court granted a preliminary injunction
and, upon failure by the defendant to enter an appearance, made the
injunction permanent.
In the Atwood case, the defendant represented that he was an overthe-counter broker and dealer, ready and able to execute his customers'
orders for the purchase and sale of securities, without disclosing to his
customers that he was insolvent. ' Although the defendant represented that money received from customers would be used to purchase
securities for their account and that the securities would be held in
safekeeping, the Commission alleged that Atwood did not intend to
do either, but intended to and did convert the money to his own use
and benefit. The defendant consented to an entry of both a temporary
restraining order and a final judgment enjoining it from further
violating Section 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange A.ct of 1934
and Section 17 (a) (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

It has been said that the interpretation of an act by the agency
charged with its administration should control, unless plainly erroneous, in order to accomplish the objects of the act without constant
and disconcerting friction." The Commission, therefore, takes part
in many actions between private parties which involve provisions or
the statutes which it administers. It may intervene or appear as
amicus curiae. In either case its purpose is to give the court the
benefit of its experience in the special field and to inform the court or
its interpretation and the reasons therefor.
Herman Geismar v. Bond &: Goodwin et al., is the first case, within
the knowledge of the Commission, in which the plaintiff claims that
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gives a right to rescind or to
recover damages for fraud in an over-the-counter sale of securities.
The defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, contending
that the statute did not create such claims for relief. The Commission
appeared amicus curiae and argued that the right to rescind sucli a
transaction was clear, at least since the 1938 amendment to Section
29 (b), which provided a statute of limitations for such actions."
In A. O. Frost &: 00. v. Ooeur D'Alene Mines Corporation." thecorporation gave an option to purchase all or any part of its treasury
stock to plaintiff's assignor. The stock was unregistered and the
corporation refused to deliver the stock on the ground that the option
was in violation of the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore void.
A. C. Frost & Co. filed suit in the State court of Idaho charging
that {he corporation had repudiated the option and asked judgment
for its breach and for money due under the terms of the option. On
appeal, the Supreme Court of Idaho held the option void and denied
recovery. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and
the Commission filed an amicus curiae brief sponsored by the Solicitor
General. The United States Supreme Court, through Mr. Justice
McReynolds, referred to the Commission's brief and held that, even
though the option contract contemplated a public offering, the
Securities Act of 1933 gave the public adequate remedies against the
seller and that such remedies are" inconsistent with the idea that
every contract having relation to sales of unregistered shares is
absolutely void," and reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Idaho.
In "Boudinot Atterbury et al. v. Consolidated Coppermines Corporation,36 the Commission's proxy rules were involved and the Commission obtained permission to file a brief as amicus curiae. The officers
of the corporation, with the exception of the two plaintiffs, had

solicited the proxies of the shareholders, stating that the proxies were
solicited by the management and further stating that the only business to be presented by the management or by anyone else within the
knowledge of the management, was the election of directors. The
plaintiffs thereupon solicited the revocation of any proxies given the
management. The record also contained evidence that the management was informed that plaintiffs intended to present other business
at the meeting. The meeting was held and the management elected
directors and plaintiffs filed suit to set aside the corporate action.
The Commission in its brief contended (1) that the solicitation of
the revocation of a proxy is itself a solicitation of a" proxy, consent, or
authorization;" (2) that a solicitation "by the management" is not
false and misleading, even though a minority of the management does
not join in the solicitation; (3) that there is a duty to inform those
whose proxies are solicited of questions to be presented and the use
the proxies are to be put to; (4) that there is a duty on those soliciting
the proxies to inform those whose proxies have been solicited of
changed conditions which make statements made in the soliciting
material no longer true; and (5) that the question of invalidity of
action taken pursuant to proxies improperly solicited is for the court
to decide. The court found in favor of defendants without specifically determining all the points raised by the Commission.
In Leland Stanford, Jr., University v. The National Supply Company,36 the university filed an action to recover the par value of preferred stock held by it, together with the accumulated dividends.
The complaint alleged that the university owned 1,300 shares of preferred stock of the First National Company and that this corporation
consolidated with another to form The National Supply Company.
Under the plan of consolidation, the preferred stock was exchangeable
for stock in the new corporation and the accumulated dividends were
eliminated.
The university contended that the exchange was a sale, that the
new securities were unregistered, and that the prospectus was misleading, in that it failed to inform the stockholders of their rights and
the manner in which to assert such rights. The Commission in its
brief contended that (a) the distribution of the securities, being the
result of a consolidation approved by a vote of the stockholder~ was
not a sale and therefore was not a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933; (b) that even if a sale were involved, there would be
no liability under Section 12 (1) of the Act if the defendant had relied
upon the Commission's interpretative regulations; 37 and (c) if a sale
were involved, the reliance upon the Commission's interpretative

regulations could not protect defendant from liability under Section 12'
of the Act for false and misleading statements. No decision has yet
been rendered.
In Samuel N. Levy et al. v. Irving Feinberg et al.,38a group of stockholders sued to recover damages for the corporation, American Beverage Corporation. alleging that one of the defendants, formerly a
majority stockholder, director, and president of the company, had
given an option on his stock to Feinberg with the knowledge that Feinberg would defraud American Beverage Corporation and apply a large
portion of its assets to extinguish the indebtedness of another corporation, Prendergast-Davies, owned by Feinberg. This was accomplished
by the subsequent sale of the assets of Prendergast-Davies to American
Beverage Corporation and the assumption of Prendergast-Davies.

Proxy material sent to the stockholders of American Beverage Corporation, just prior to the time the option was exercised, contained
statements that the solicitation was being made by the management.
for the reelection of existing directors or such other persons as would
maintain the existing management for the ensuing year. The material also stated that prospects for the coming year were very encouraging. No mention was made of the option, although it had been
granted under circumstances indicating that it would be exercised and
control of the corporation assumed by Feinberg to the detriment or
the corporation. The option was exercised prior to the meeting and a
new board of directors was elected by the vote of Feinberg's newlyacquired stock. Thereafter, the new board approved the purchase of
Prendergast-Davies and the assumption of its liabilities.
The Commission filed an amicus curiae brief in which it took the
position that the proxy material distributed by the management in
the solicitation of proxies to vote in the election of directors did net.
meet the disclosure requirements of the Commission's proxy rules.P"
In a decision for the plaintiff, the court held that the Commission's
proxy rules required the disclosure of the option. The court also held
that the statements contained in the proxy statement concerning the
purposes of the solicitation and the corporation's prospects were false
and misleading.
Criminal Proceedings.

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission to the Department of Justice of evidence of violations of the
criminal provisions of those statutes. Criminal proceedings are instituted in the discretion of the Attorney General. It is the policy of
the Commission to make a thorough investigation of alleged violations
of law before referring a case to the Department of Justice and to

furnish to the Department the results of such investigation. Thereafter, if criminal proceedings are instituted, the members of the Commission's staff who participated in the investigation assist the United
States Attorneys in the preparation of the cases for presentation to
the grand jury and for trial.
Up to July 1,1941, the Commission had referred to the Department
of Justice 329 cases, including 52 cases which were referred during the
past fiscal year. Since the organization of the Commission, a total
of 1,852 defendants 40 have been indicted in 260 cases, including 27
cases which had been referred to the Post OfficeDepartment.
During
the past year indictments were returned against 194 defendants.
Since the inception of the Commission, convictions have been obtained against 739 defendants in 200 cases, representing 93 percent of
the 213 cases which have been disposed of as to principal defendants;
124 defendants, named in 44 cases, were convicted during the past
year.
The foregoing figures include perjury proceedings arising out of
Commission investigations. A total of 20 defendants have been so
indicted, and 8 convicted, including 2 defendants who were convicted
during the past fiscal year. At the end of the year, indictments for
perjury were pending as to 11 defendants.

been obtained by the Commission. Nineteen of these defendants
were found guilty. None were found guilty during the past fiscal
year.
A brief description of the criminal cases filed or pending during the
year ended June 30, 1941, showing their status at the end of that year,
is set forth in the tables comprising Appendix IV, page 327 of this
report. A more detailed description of some of the more important
cases follows.
United States v. Union Electric Company of Missouri.-Qn
January
17, 1941, an indictment was returned by a Federal grand jury in
St. Louis, Mo., charging Union Electric Company of Missouri, a
subsidiary of The North American Company, and Louis H. Egan,
former president of the Union Electric Company, with violations of,
and with conspiracy to violate, Section 12 (h) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935. This action resulted from an investigation by the Commission which extended over a period of nearly 2
years.
Under the provisions of Section 12 (h) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, it is unlawful for any registered holding company to make, in any manner, any contribution, directly or indirectly,
to political groups or in connection with the political campaign of any
individual. In this case the indictment alleged that, to further the
political campaigns and to assure the election to public officeof certain
individuals, the Union Electric Company made contributions out of a
"slush fund" which was accumulated through various artifices, such
as kickbacks on legal fees, payments to contractors, and the padding
of expense accounts.
To further the prosecution of this case, members of the Commission's staff were appointed as special assistants to the Attorney General and in such capacity aided the United States attorney in St.
Louis, Mo., in the presentation of the case to _thegrand jury. The
proceeding has been marked thus far by various motions and demurrers asserting, among other defenses, that this particular section of the
These motions and demurrers on the part of
Act is unconstitutional.
the defendant have been consistently overruled and the case will
probably be tried in the fall of 1941.
During the course of the Commission's investigation, three employees of the company were indicted for perjury committed before
officers of the Commission. The charges alleged that the defendants
had testified falsely with respect to certain phases of the aforementioned practices. Albert C. Laun, vice president of the Union Electric
Company, entered a plea of nolo contendere. He was sentenced to a
year and a day in prison and was fined $4,500. He was paroled after
serving about one-third of his sentence. Frederick J. Martin, formerly a sales manager employed by the Union Electric Company,

PART vnI-QTHER

213

pleaded guilty to the charge of perjury and was sentenced to 6 months
in prison and fined $501. .After serving about 10 days, and after
giving the Commission a full statement of the facts in regard to which
he committed perjury, he was placed on probation. The third
defendant indicted was Frank J. Boehm, former executive vice president of the company, who elected to stand trial, and was found guilty.
He was sentenced to 5 years in prison on each of two counts, to run
concurrently and was fined $2,000. His case is now pending on,
appeal before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. The appeal is set for argument on September 10,
1941.41
United States v. E. M. Hill et al.-Early in 1939, evidence acquired
by the Commission in proceedings leading to the revocation of the
broker-dealer registrations of certain firms was forwarded to the
Attorney General and the Chief Inspector of the Post Office Department. This evidence disclosed that, for approximately 6 years, hundreds of small businesses or prospective businesses had been victimized
by the operations of the so-called "front money racket." 42 The
victims had been induced to pay advance fees, estimated as aggregating $1,000,000, for various services in connection with incorporation and registration; and the preparation of sales literature. This
was accomplished by false and misleading representations as to the
ability of persons engaged in such racket to secure financing and
capital upon the payment of the advance fee. While almost every
conceivable type of small business was represented in the list of
victims, the investigation failed to reveal a single instance in which a
share of stock had been sold or a dollar of capital secured for the
victims.
As a result of this reference, a joint investigation was undertaken
by the Post OfficeDepartment and the Commission which culminated
on May 21, 1940, in an indictment at Cleveland, Ohio, charging 12
defendants, operating 'in their own names and in the names of some
23 different companies located throughout the United States and
abroad, 'with carrying on a scheme to defraud persons who were
desirous of securing financing or additional capital.
Members of the Commission's staff were appointed special assistants to the United States attorney and participated in the presentation of the case to the grand jury and in the trial which took place in
February 1941. On the eighth day of the trial, pleas of guilty were
entered by nine defendants and sentences were imposed as follows:

(who pleaded nolo contendere) 1 hour in the custody of the marshal.
The case is still pending as to Samuel Lewis, who was granted a.
separate trial because of illness, and C. Wayne Gould, who has not
as yet been apprehended.
United Statee v. Arnold Joerns et al.-This case is the most recent
step in the Commission's efforts to uncover the facts underlying the
promotion of Resources Corporation International, a very large securities promotion predicated on two million acres of timber and ranch land
in Mexico. On December 13, 1940, an indictment was returned in
Chicago, Ill., against nine -of the promoters and their accomplices
The indictment charged that subscribers to International Syndicate,
the original vehicle for the promotion, were told that two million acres
of valuable timber properties had been acquired in Mexico at a cost
of $9,000,000; that $7,350,000 had been subscribed to the syndicate;
and that $1,650,000 was still due and unpaid on the lands; when, in
fact, only $152,919.82 had been expended by the promoters in acquiring the properties, and substantially all the purported cost and remaining liability were fictitious.
On October 15, 1931, a meeting of International Syndicate subscribers was held to dissolve the syndicate and to form Resources
Corporation International.
According to the indictment, the late
Harper S. Hoover and his associates were able to acquire the bulk of
the stock of the latter company .
.According to the indictment, Hoover and his associates proceeded
to engage in an extensive stock-selling campaign, particularly in the
year 1937, which they stimulated by various fraudulent devices, including sham timber-cutting contracts, payments upon which were
used to give an appearance of earning power and income to the corporation. In this way, Hoover disposed of 528,709 shares of his
personally owned stock in Resources Corporation International
between 1931 and 1937 at a gross profit of $4,759,140.95.
During the period from 1938 to 1940, there had been extensive
litigation between the Commission and Resources Corporation International, Harper S. Hoover, and his associates. In March 1938, the
Commission instituted a stop order proceeding pursuant to Section
8 of the Securities Act of 1933. The proceeding was interrupted
several times because of litigation instituted by Resources Corporation International after its motion to withdraw its registration statement and terminate the stop order proceeding had been denied by
the Commission. Resources Corporation sought a direct appeal to
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which appeal

PART VIII-QTHER

ACTmTIES

:2J.5

was dismissed on the ground that the Commission's order refusing .00
permit withdrawal of the registration statement was interlocutory
and therefore not reviewable at that stage of the proceeding. The
corporation then filed suit in the District of Columbia to enjoin the
Commission from continuing the proceeding. The injunction was
refused. The Commission issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement on July 10, 1940.
The criminal proceedings against Arnold Joerns and the other
associates of Hoover are at present pending in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and should come
to trial in the fall of 1941.
United States v. Central Securities Corporation et al.-In this case,
three individuals and the Central Securities Corporation, a brokerdealer registered under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, were indicted on charges of fraudulently effecting the redemption
of municipal public improvement bonds issued by the cities of Gary,
Hammond; and East Chicago, Ind. On November 8, 1940, an indictment was returned in South Bend, Ind., charging the defendants with
conspiracy to violate Section 15 (c) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. This section prohibits fraud by brokers and dealers in security
transactions effected in the over-the-counter markets as distinguished
from the established national securities exchanges.
The three individuals named in the indictment were Edwin H.
Dickmeyer, president of Central Securities Corporation; Louis F.
Conter, former treasurer of Lake County, Ind.; and Edward L. Reil,
former employee of the treasurer's office of Lake County .. The indictment charged that the defendants entered into an agreement whereby
Conter, as treasurer of Lake County, would give preference to Central
Securities Corporation over all other persons in the redemption of the
public improve-neat bonds and coupons issued by the three Indiana
cities in return for the payment to him of bribes totalling 20 percent
of the aggregate amount of principal and interest received by the
corporation in the redemption of such bonds and coupons. It was also
alleged that the agreement provided that Reil would be appointed by
Conter as an employee of the county treasurer's office to maintain close
scrutiny and supervision over the treasurer's accounts kept in the
three cities.
The indictment alleged that, as a part of a conspiracy to defraud"
the corporation would falsely advise customers, who had such bonds
op. deposit with it for collection or for sale, that it had an opportunity
to sell their bonds at from 25 percent to 70 percent of their face values
and would recommend acceptance of these offers for the purpose of
reinvesting in other securities. The indictment charged that after
authorization had been obtained from customers to sell their bonds and
coupons the corporation, contrary to the authorization, would mail

216

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

the bonds and coupons to Reil who would present them to the
treasurer's office in the particular cities where the bonds had been
issued and collect 100 cents on the dollar, to the full extent of funds
available.
The indictment further alleged that Reil would transmit the
payments to Central Securities Corporation, which would remit to
him 20 percent of the proceeds to be paid to Center and 5 percent to
be retained for his services in the transaction.
According to the
indictment, the corporation would then send a statement to the
customer, indicating that it had purchased his bonds for its own
account, together with a check for the amount of the pretended offer,
and would retain for itself the remainder.
.
'I'he defendants by demurrer challenged the indictment primarily
on the ground that Section 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act
'Of 1934 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, and
that Rule X-15CI-2 was void because adopted pursuant to such
statute.
The defendants also contended that wilful violation of
Section 15 (c) (1) does not constitute a crime, that the improvement
bonds involved in the case were not securities within the meaning of
theAct,and that the section was not effective until the adoption of the
rule. On April 22, 1941, the court overruled the demurrer without
opinion.
The case is at present awaiting trial in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Indiana.
United States v. W. J. Herring et al.-W. J. Herring, a securities
broker, Little Rock, Ark., was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment on
his plea of guilty to charges of violating the fraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 215 of the Oriminal Code, in connection with the sale of the common stock of Investors Participating
Corporation, of which he was the promoter.
The indictment, which was returned by the Federal grand jury
at Little Rock, Ark., charged that Herring had falsely represented
that the stock of the Investors Participating Oorporation was aD.
absolutely safe investment; that the funds received from the sale of
the stock were being used to promote and advance the interests of the
corporation; that a 100 percent dividend would shortly be declared
because of the corporation's remarkable progress; and that the investors' money was backed by the assets of W. J. Herring & Company.
Actually, the latter company was hopelessly insolvent; the corporation
had operated at a deficit during its entire existence; and the funds from
the sale of stock were being converted to the personal use of the
defendant.

of the Securities Act of 1933, the broker-dealer registration provisions
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 215 of the Criminal
Code.
A member of the Philadelphia bar and of the city's most exclusive
clubs and institutions and a direct descendant of Philadelphia's first
families, he used his name and position to attract some 200 persons to
entrust to him more than $2,500,000 in funds and securities. Prior
to the effective date of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Boltz
was told by representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission that he must register with the Commission as an investment
adviser, and that his books and records were subject to inspection by
the Commission. Boltz challenged the Commission's jurisdiction and,
when steps were taken to enforce inspection, he disappeared. The
case of the missing investment counselor attracted Nation-wide
attention as city, State, and Federal enforcement authorities cooperated in an exhaustive Nation-wide search. Four months after his
disappearance, he was apprehended in Rochester, N. Y., and returned
to Philadelphia for trial in the State courts, where he was sentenced
to a term of from 20 to 40 years in prison.
The Federal indictment charged that Boltz had defrauded numerous
investors residing in and around Philadelphia who had entrusted him
with the investment of their funds in securities. It was alleged that
he had charge of 167 active accounts and, contrary to limitations
in the agreements with his customers, ran a margin trading account,
executed short sales, and used customers' funds to speculate in
securities and commodities for his own account with very large losses
to the customers. Boltz allegedly guaranteed a minimum annual
return of 6 percent and represented that he would preserve intact the
principal of all funds entrusted to him. It was further charged that,
in order to effectuate the fraud, Boltz delivered checks and quarterly
statements falsely showing or representing substantial profits earned
when, in fact, monies received by customers were returns of principal
or payments from funds and securities received by him from other
customers .
.According to the indictment, Boltz represented that he was a
principal stockholder of North America Investment Fund, Inc., an
incorporated investment trust with portfolio assets in excess of
$5,000,000, and that he actually pledged stock certificates of this
fund with various national banks in Philadelphia as collateral for
substantial loans. It was charged, however, that North America
)i1vestment Fund, Inc. was wholly fictitious, was never incorporated,
and had no assets.
Boltz pleaded guilty on all counts and, on February 28,1941, was
sentenced, in the United States District Court for Eastern Pennsyl-

vania, to 20 years imprisonment. This is the longest sentence imposed in a criminal case under the Securities Act of 1933.
United States v. Eugene S. Gates.-A fictitious cement manufacturing enterprise was the subject of a large-scale stock promotion in this
case. Having leased a cement plant at Chula Vista, Calif., Eugene
S. Gates and his associates proceeded to engage in the promotion of
the stock of the newly formed International White Cement Company
in the States of Colorado, California, and Illinois.
As a result of the Commission's investigation into the affairs of this
company, a Federal grand jury at Denver, Colo., indicted Gates and
seven of his associates for violations of the fraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933, and for mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud,
in connection with the sale of stock of International White Cement
Company. The defendants were charged with representing to prospective investors that the company was operating and manufacturing
cement, when it was not operating and had never operated, and, in
fact, did not have the machinery and equipment necessary for the
production of cement. It was alleged that they also employed the
not uncommon device of impressing investors with the payment of
fictitious dividends to further the alleged fraudulent scheme and to
induce additional purchases of the company's stock, when, in fact,
the company had no income other than that from the sale of stock.
Eugene S. Gates, who was promoter and president of the company,
was given a sentence of 8 years imprisonment and was fined $2,300
after having been found guilty on 14 counts of the indictment.
On
December 2,1940, he filed notice of appeal and his case is now pending
in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.
Three other defendants were given lesser prison sentences; 3 others
were placed on probation; and the indictment was dismissed as to the
remaining defendant.
United States v. Bankers Industrial Service, Inc., et al.--Qn December
27, 1940, a certified public accountant and three officers and directors
of Bankers Industrial Service, Inc., of Wilmington, Del., were given
prison sentences ranging from 1 year and 1 day to 3~ years for violation of the fraud section of the Securities Act of 1933, in connection
with the sale of the Class A common. stock of Bankers Industrial
Service, Inc.
This fraudulent scheme, which cost investors approximately
$1,000,000, was effectuated by means of misrepresentations with respect
to the net profits of the company and other aspects of its 'financial
condition. The defendants also falsely represented to investors that
the DuPont family of Wilmington, Del., was financially interested in
the company. Thev further represented that no compensation would
be or had been paid to the directors of the company when, in fact, they
intended to convert the entire proceeds of the sales to their own use.

United States v. Baskette et al.-The indictment in this case was
retw:ned by. the Federal-grand j.ary at Los Angeles, Calif., on October
23, 1940, charging Walter C>Baskette of Los Angeles and :five accomplices with violations of the fraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 and with mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud in connection with an oil and gas lease promotion under the name of Caloma
Oil Company. It also charged that the defendants obtained oil
and gas leases on 2,600 acres of "wildcat" land situated in Pontotoc
County, Okla., and caused to be written a geological report on the
property falsely indicating that there were favorable prospects of
:finding oil. It was further charged that the defendants were fully
aware that the prospects of :finding oil were unfavorable.
The defendants, according t-othe indictment, induced the purchase
of the assignments of leases and interests in the drill site by numerous
false statements and fraudulent representations including, among
other things, statements that the property lay in oil-producing
territory wherein every indication pointed to the probability that
'Oilwould be found in large quantities; that the surface outcroppings
'On the Galoraa JH'Opertywere identical with the outcroppings found
in the Fitts, Jesse, and other surrounding sites which were generally
known to be lucrative; that the leases had been withdrawn from the
market and were only available to a certain few investors; and that
individual salesmen had invested their personal funds in Caloma
leases.
Baskette and four other defendants, Andreas Atherton of San
.Jose, Frank Dent of Los Angeles, Raymond J. Standish of Los Angeles,
and Guy C. McBride of Oklahoma City, were found guilty as charged.
Thomas J. Finnerty of Los -
Angeles, formerly a deputy real estate
commissioner of -the State of California, was found guilty only on the
charge of conspiracy. On May 16, 1941, Baskette was sentenced to
4 years imprisonment and placed on probation for 3 years after the
expiration of the term. Atherton, Dent, and Standish were each
sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and placed on probation for 3
years after the expiration of their terms. McBride, who had pleaded
nolo contendere, was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment to

followed by 3 years probation. Finnerty was placed on probation
for 3 years.
United States v. Francis M. Oox.-on April 9, 1941, a jury in the
United States District Court at Chattanooga, Tenn., found Francis
M. Cox and Edward L. Kenyon guilty of violating the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 215 of the Criminal
Code in connection with the sale of the capital stock of the Franklin
Savings and Loan Company. F. Marion Johnson, the third defendant.
pleaded nolo contendere. The defendants, Cox, Kenyon, and Johnson,
were president, stock salesman, and secretary, respectively, of the
company, a Chattanooga industrial bank and small loan company.
The charges in the indictment were based upon the operation of a
fraudulent scheme by the defendants to effect sales of the company's
stock. This involved the payment of fictitious dividends when the
company consistently incurred large operating losses, the manipulation of the company's books and the diversion of funds for the use and
benefit of the defendants, and false representations as to the company's
financial condition.
Among the false representations made by the defendants were
statements to the effect that the Franklin Savings and Loan Company
was the oldest banking organization in existence; that the company
had assets amounting to $1,000,000; that the company was earning
and pay.ing dividends; and that its stock was guaranteed by the United
States Government.
On April 12, 1941, the court imposed sentences on the three defendants. Francis M. Cox was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment
and fined $10,000. Edward L. Kenyon was given a prison sentence
of 5 years and fined $4,000. A sentence of 3 years imprisonment
and a fine of $2,000 was imposed on F. Marion Johnson, but he has
recently been granted an executive pardon.
United States v. Alexander Mengarelli.-This
case represents one of
the instances in which the Commission has cooperated with a State
agency in order to complete an investigation of a stock promotion
which led beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the agency instituting
the investigation.
This particular case originated in the office of the
Attorney General of the State of N ew York.
Mengarelli, a securities broker and dealer of Syracuse, N. Y., was
convicted on June 15, 1941, of violating the fraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the mail fraud statute in the sale of the common stock of Ozonide Corporation, of Detroit, Mich., which had been
_organized for the purpose of exploiting and promoting an oil-cracking
process. It appeared that Mengarelli had distributed some 30,000
shares of the stock at prices ranging from $1.25 to $2.50 a share, which
he had taken down under an option at 75 cents a share. Mengarelli
had told investors that Ozonide Corporation was newJy formed, when

PART vm-oTHER

ACTIVITIES

221

he knew it had been in existence for more than eight years; that the
stock of the corporation was scarce, when he held an option on a very
large block of the stock; and that he was selling it at cost, whereas his
profits ranged from 50 cents to $1.75 a share. Mengarelli also falsely
represented that the Italian Government had deposited $250,000 in
escrow in aNew York bank for the right to use the process, whereas,
even if the representation had been true, the investors would not have
benefited because Ozonide Corporation did not own the foreign rights
to the process.
The United States District Court of the Northern District of New
York sentenced Mengarelli to 18 months imprisonment. The sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation for 3 years.
United States v. Buckhorn Mining Oompany and James R. Daoiee--«
This case resulted in the first convictions where the indictment was
predicated solely upon the use of the mails and the instrumentalities
of interstate commerce in the sale of securities without compliance
with the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
In April 1938, the Commission obtained an injunction against
James R. Davies and the Buckhorn Mining Company enjoining them
from further violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 in
connection with the sale of the common stock of Buckhorn Mining
Company. Despite the injunction, the sale of stock was wilfully continued. On May 15, 1940, an indictment was returned by a Federal
grand jury at Pocatello, Idaho, charging that the stock of the Buckhorn Mining Company, of which Davies was the president and promoter, was sold to investors in Idaho and neighboring States in
violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
Davies was sentenced, in the United States District Court for the
District of Idaho, to 15 months in prison and the company was
fined $1,000.
United States v. David A. Smart et al.-In this case, twelve individuals were charged with conspiracy to violate the anti-manipulation
section of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with
trading on the New York Curb Exchange in the common stock of
Esquire-Coronet, Inc., between May and September 1938. The
indictment, which was returned in the United States District Court at
Chicago on May 2, 1941, named as defendants David A. Smart, Alfred
Smart, Arthur Greene, A. D. Elden, Jeannette Kilmnick, and Alfred
R. Pastel, all of Chicago, Walter Lyon and Walter Stein, of Walter
Lyon and Co., David Van Alstyne, J. J. Hindon Hyde, and Walter
Winfield of Van Alstyne, Noel and Company, and Leo G. Seisfe1d, all
of New York City.
The indictment charged that the defendants conspired to create a.
rise in the price of the Esquire-Coronet stock on the N ew York Curb
Exchange by means of a series of transactions designed to induce the

222

SEVENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

purchase of that stock by others, in violation of Section 9 (a) (2) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It was alleged in the indictment
that the defendants David A. Smart and Alfred Smart granted an
option on 200,000 shares of Esquire-Coronet stock to the defendant
Greene, who, in turn, optioned the shares to Walter Lyon and Co.
According to the indictment Van Alstyne, Noel and Company joined
in the distribution of these shares.
Among the devices alleged in the indictment to have been employed"
by the defendants in stimulating activity in the stock and thereby
causing its rise, were agreements to guarantee persons against Ioss,
and the domination of the volume of trading and over-bidding in
order to raise the price of the stock on the exchange. Another deviceused by the defendants for the same purpose, the indictment alleged,
was to sell certain individuals shares of Esquire-Coronet stock at a
price substantially under the prevailing market price for the stock in
order to compensate such persons for purchasing the stock on theCurb Exchange at prices above the last sales price. Some of these
trades, the indictment charged, were strategically placed at theopening and closing of the trading session.
The defendants have filed demurrers to the indictment, which areset for argument in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois on September 8, 1941.
Appellate Decisions in Criminal Cases.

charging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the mail fraud
statute.

In Paul B. Roubay v. United States, and M. E. Waggoner v, United
States, both Roubay and Waggoner had been convicted of fraud in connection with the sale of trade acceptances by Comanche Mining and
Reduction Company against nonexistent gold and silver bullion. The
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the conviction
of Roubay on October 25, 1940, and affirmed the conviction of Waggoner on July 26, 1940. A petition for certiorari by Waggoner was
denied by the Supreme Court on November 12, 1940.
In Norman W. Minuse et al. v. United Statts, Norman W. Minuse
and Joseph E. H. Pelletier had been convicted of conspiracy to violate
the anti-manipulation
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 in transactions on the New York Curb Exchange involving the
stock of Tastyeast, Jnc.47 On August 7, 1940, the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the convictions and ordered a
new trial on the grounds that error had been committed in rulings of
the lower court on matters of trial procedure.

In Hiram R. Edwards v. United States, Edwards had been convicted
of violations of the fraud and registration provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 and of mail fraud and conspiracy in connection with the
sale of interests in :five trusts having assets consisting of oil and gas
leases. The conviction was affirmed by the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on June 29, 1940.
The Supreme Court granted certiorari and on March 3, 1941, reversed
the conviction and remanded the case to the district court for trial of
issues raised by a plea in abatement of the defendant in which he
claimed that immunity had been conferred upon him in the course of
hearings before the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The court
held that the district court erred in refusing the defendant an opportunity to be heard on that point.
The court sustained the Government's contention that an indictment, charging a violation of the registration provision of the Securities Act of 1933, need not negative the availability of an exemption.
The court also ruled that the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 did not impliedly repeal the mail fraud statute in the :field of
securities sales and that the two statutes could be useful side by side.

FORMAL OPINIONS

The Opinions and Research Section of the General Counsel's Office
prepares drafts of the Commission's formal opinions in contested cases
arising under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The work of this section is done
by a group of approximately 30 attorneys, who are also engaged from
time to time in rendering interpretative and advisory assistance to-the
public. While engaged in the preparation of opinions, these attorneys
work under the direction of the Supervising Attorney in Charge of the
Opinions and Research Section and are completely isolated, with
respect to this work, from persons actively participating in the proceedings. It is an invariable rule that the attorney assigned to prepare an opinion must not have had any connection with any previous
phase of the case with respect to which the opinion is to be prepared.
In addition, the attorney is subject to the following instructions:
"In no cases assigned for the preparation of opinions should the attorney confer
with the attorneys who have been responsible for the preparation or prosecution
of the proceeding. * * * It is just as improper to consult employees of the
Commission who have taken part in the proceedings as it would be to consult
attorneys for the respondent.
Even on formal or procedural matters not concerned with the merits of the case, attorneys should consult the supervising
attorney and allow him to make any inquiries from other divisions of the Commission which may be necessary.
The same inflexible rule must apply to
consultation with the trial examiner."

After hearings have been held, and after consultation with the
Commission, an attorney in this section analyzes the entire record and
prepares a draft of the formal opinion in accordance with the Commission's instructions. In most cases he also prepares a narrative
abstract of the record. Commission experts are from time to time
consulted on technical problems arising in the course of the preparation
of the opinion, but these experts are never individuals who have
participated in the preparation of the case or testified at the hearing.
When the draft of the opinion and the abstract of the record have been
completed, they are submitted to the supervising attorney, who reviews the entire case and, in conjunction with the opinion attorney,

226

SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

revises the draft. The revised draft is submitted to the Assistant
General Counsel in charge of the section, in important or difficult
cases to the General Counsel, and then to the Commission. After
further discussion by the Commission with the attorneys responsible
for the preparation of the draft opinion and after full consideration by
the Commission, the opinion may be modified, amended, or completely rewritten in accordance with the Commission's directions.
The typical opinion has been described in the Report of the Attorney
General's Committee on Administrative Procedure as "an admirably
clear and orderly exposition of the problems involved, of the conflicting contentions and the important relevant evidence, and of the
rationale of the Commission's decision." 50
The Commission, during the past year, issued 264 formal opinions
under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. Some of the more interesting opinions which
merit discussion are as follows:
In the Matter oj Oities Service Oompany.51-The Commission in this
case denied an application of the Cities Service Company under
Sections 3 (a) (3) and 3 (a) (5) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 for an order exempting it and its subsidiaries as such from
the provisions of the Act. Cities Service Company is the top holding
company. in a system which combines very extensive public-utility
operations with a huge oil and natural gas enterprise.
It contended
that, inasmuch as the bulk of its utilities holdings was pledged with
banks as trustees and the right to vote all of the stock was assigned to
such trustees, Cities Service Company had divested itself of the power
to vote the pledged securities; that the companies whose securities
had been pledged were no longer its subsidiary companies within the
meaning of Section 2 (a) (8) (A) of the Act; that Cities Service was
primarily engaged or interested in businesses other than the business
of a public-utility company and was only incidentally a holding company within the meaning of Section 3 (a) (3) and did not derive a
material part of its income from its public-utility subsidiaries within
the meaning of that section; and that it did not derive a material part
of its income from its domestic public-utility subsidiaries within the
meaning of Section 3 (a) (5).
The Commission's opinion discussed at length the relationship
between the applicant and its subsidiaries and the factors to be considered in determining whether an applicant is "only incidentally a
holding company, being primarily engaged or interested in one or
more businesses other than the business of a public-utility company."

'The record showed that the combined assets of applicant's publicutility subsidiaries were valued at more than $400,000,000; that their
operations extended to 20 States and Canada with an estimated
population in the areas served of approximately 4,500,000; that the
operations of the bulk of applicant's utility subsidiaries had no
functional relationship to the business of its nonutility companies;
that the aggregate fixed assets of applicant's consolidated utility
subsidiaries, at book value, represented 38 percent of the fixed assets
of all subsidiaries of the applicant; that the aggregate gross revenues
of applicant's consolidated utility subsidiaries amounted to more
than $70,000,000 for the year 1938; and that applicant's holdings in
its utility subsidiaries, and their assets, constituted a factor of prime
importance' in the ability of the applicant to function as a credit
vehicle for financing the needs of its nonutility subsidiaries. The
Commission concluded that Cities Service Company was not entitled
to exemption- under Sections 3 (a) (3) or 3 (a) (5).
Consideration of the legislative history of these provisions and the
income statements of the applicant, furnished the Commission with
additional support for its conclusions. The Commission noted the
history of indulgence in practices explicitly condemned by Congress
and the frequent reference in Congressional debate and Federal
'Trade Commission reports to Cities Service Company as an example
of the type of company whose regulation was deemed necessary in
order-to effectuate the purposes of the Act. Finally, the position of
Cities Service Company and its subsidiaries as one of the most important public-utility holding-company systems in the United States,
its vast scope of operation, and the fact that its securities are widely
held by the public caused the Commission to find that it would be
detrimental to the public interest and the interest of investors and
consumers to grant the application.
In the Matter of The Dayton Power and Light Oompany, Morgan
Stanley & 00. Incorporated.62-The decision in this case was the first
to hold that an underwriting house (Morgan Stanley) was affiliated
with a public-utility company (Dayton) for the purposes of the Commission's "arm's-length bargaining" rule." The effect of the decision
under the rule was to prohibit Morgan Stanley from retaining any
share in the underwriting fees and commissions received in connection
with $25,000,000 principal amount of first mortgage bonds which
were issued and sold by Dayton to the public early in 1940 through
an underwriting group headed by Morgan Stanley.
The basis of the decision was that, at the time of the bond issue,
Morgan Stanley, through J. P. Morgan & Co., stood in an influential
Holding Company Act Releases Nm. 26M and 2693.
Rule U-12F-2 or the General Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Public Utility Holding

position with respect to the underwriting of securities of companies
(including Dayton) which were within the orbit of influence of The
United Corporation and Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation,
registered holding companies under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935." The arm's-length bargaining rule was designed to meet the problems and eliminate the evils arising out of
an absence of arm's-length bargaining in transactions between investment bankers and companies subject to the Act.
The Commission's opinion reviewed at length the histories of the
companies involved and their officers and directors in relation to J. P.
Morgan & Co., which had for years prior to 1934 engaged in both
commercial banking and investment banking. The opinion stated that
after the Banking Act of 1933 required the divorcement of investment
banking from commercial banking, the members of J. P. Morgan & Co.
organized Morgan Stanley to carry on the underwriting business which
their firm could no longer transact, and that leading partners of J. P.
Morgan & Co. had a substantial interest in the capital and profits
of Morgan Stanley through ownership of its preferred stock. In
1929, J. P. Morgan & Co. had been a principal promoter of The United
Corporation and had occupied a dominant position in its affairs for
some years after.
The Commission concluded, among other things, that those partners
of J. P. Morgan & Co. who had an interest in the preferred stock of
Morgan Stanley possessed a substantial motive for using whatever
influence they had to supply Morgan Stanley with underwriting business and that J. P. Morgan & Co. still held a position of influence,
though no longer an official one, with The United Corporation, Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation, and their subsidiaries.
Morgan Stanley has taken an appeal from this decision to the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
In the Matter oj The Detroit Edison Oompany.66-The Commission'sopinion in this case made clear the scope of the phrase "subject to
a controlling influence," as used in Section 2 (a) (8) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Under that section, if Company A owns 10 percent of the voting securities of Company B, Company B is a "subsidiary" of Company A unless Company B can show
that it is not controlled by Company A or subject to Company A's
"controlling influence." Thus, Detroit Edison was prima jacie a
subsidiary of The North American Company and of American Light
. & Traction Company, registered holding companies, since North
American owned 19.28 percent and American Light 20.27 percent of
Detroit Edison's outstanding voting securities.
Detroit Edison
.. Dayton was 100percent controlled by Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation, whlch was a subsldlm'y ,
of The United Corporation.

claimed, however, that it was not controlled by North American or
American Light, and that its management and policies were not subject to a controlling influence by either of those holding companies so
as to make regulation of Detroit Edison necessary within the standards
prescribed by the Act.
It appeared that for many years the management of Detroit Edison
had been headed by very able executives and that the holding companies were content and did not interfere with these executives. With
respect to this attitude, however, on the part of the holding companies,
the Commission held: 56
"But whether the holding company has exercised control or effectively exerted
influence is, upon application such as this, material only insofar as such circumstances may evidence the existence in the holding company of the ultimate directory power. Inaction on the part of a holding company does not necessarily
negate the existence of control or controlling influence. It may only evidence
satisfaction with the manner in which a subsidiary is being operated. A subsidiary
company, moreover, does not cease to be such merely because it has been given
the opportunity to build up an able and self-contained management."

After reviewing the history of the relationship between Detroit
Edison and specified holding companies, the Commission concluded
that Detroit Edison had sustained its burden of showing the absence
of controlling influence by American Light, but had failed to sustain
the same burden with respect to North American. The Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied Detroit Edison's petition for
review and affirmed the Commission's order.
In the Matter oj Ebasco Services Incorporated.57-This
decision was
the first important step in the Commission's efforts to require service
companies to comply with the provisions of Section 13 of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Section 13 (b) of the Act
requires that servicing by a subsidiary service company of associate
companies must be at cost. In this case, the problem arose with
respect to interlocking officers of Electric Bond and Share Company
and Ebasco, its subsidiary service company. The functions of the
interlocking officers were commingled with their functions as officers
of Bond and Share. The Commission indicated that it was unreal
to assume that the value of the services of these common officers to
each company could be determined with any degree of accuracy and
the ascertainment of cost of performing services for the operating
companies in the Bond and Share system was thus an "almost impossible and wasteful task" by virtue of the commingling of the
functions of the common officers of Bond and Share and Ebasco.
Section 13 (a) of the Act prohibits intra-system servicing for a
charge by registered holding companies. One of the principal reasons

for compelling the registered holding company to be divorced from
the service company business was to provide a more accurate means
of determining the cost of such services. Therefore, the Commission
held that effective regulation pursuant to Section 13 (b) of the Act
required that the officers and employees who held positions in both
Bond and Share and Ebasco should sever their relations with one
company or the other. As an alternative, Bond and Share might
undertake to pay the entire compensation of these common officers
and employees. Either course would be a step towards insuring
performance by Ebasco of service, sales, or construction contracts
for associate companies at cost, within the meaning of Section 13 (b).
In the Matter of Engineers Public Service Oompany, El Paso Electric
Company.fiB-The Commission, in this case, approved the issue and
sale of certain securities of EI Paso for the purpose of refunding its
outstanding bonds. Previously, in applying the standards of Section
-7 (d) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Commission had adopted a policy of being somewhat more liberal in
-refunding cases than in cases where securities were to be issued for the
raising of new capital. It had taken the view that, if a proposed
refunding promised to be beneficial to the issuing company and if
the proposed capital structure and earnings coverages were to be
-sornewhat better than before, the standards of Section 7 (d) should be
applied less strictly than if the proposed securities were to increase the
issuer's funded debt. The Commission felt bound to adhere to that
principle for the purposes of this decision inasmuch as EI Paso had
-planned its security issues in reliance upon the Commission's prior
.decisions.
However, in an appendix published with its opinion in this case,
the Commission prospectively overruled its previous policy. It expressed the view that there was as much danger in 'the perpetuation of
too much old debt as there was in the creation of too much debt. For
-illustration, the Commission drew extensively upon the experience of
-the Interstate Commerce Commission and others in connection with
railway financing. The Commission stated its future policy, as
follows:
"A refunding of outstanding senior securities where the issuer has a high ratio
.of debt to net property or where 'the security issue does not fully meet the stand-ards of Section 7 (d) will not be permitted effectiveness merely because it is a
refunding. Such effectiveness will be permitted only where it appears that the
.eircumstanees are so unusual andllxtraordinary
as to justify a departure from
the general policy announced. Even in such cases' the applicants should also
be prepared to have included in their refunding operations measures definitely
-providing for a reduction of the ratio of debt to net property and of debt to
-;total capitalization to a reasonable level."

In the Matter oj Oolumbia Gas &1 Electric Oorporation.69-In this
proceeding, which arose under Section 11 (e) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, the Commission held that the provisions of the Act do not permit the combination of gas and electric
utility properties in a "single integrated system." The Commission
pointed out, however, that its holding in this respect does not mean
that electric properties and gas properties can never be retained
together by a registered holding company, for a combination of such
properties may be retained where the electric properties are found to
constitute an integrated electric utility system and the gas properties
an integrated gas utility system, and where retention of both systems
satisfies the standards applicable to retention by a holding company
-of more than one integrated utility system. This position was
reconsidered and affirmed in the later case of The United Gas Improvement Oompany and Its Subsidiary Oompanies.60
In 'the Matter of A. Hollander &1 Son, Inc.61-The opinion in this
-oase, a proceeding under Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 to determine whether the registration of a corporation
should be revoked or suspended because of failure to disclose material
information, dealt with three important aspects of the Commission's
p.olicy with respect to registration statements and annual reports.
In the first place, it was indicated clearly that a corporate management
.cannot avail itself of the existence of a separate corporate entity as a.
pretext for concealing transaetions in which themanagement is involved,
Thus, in setting forth the amount of securities owned beneficially by
officers and directors of a registrant, it was held that a registrant must
include securities in the portfolio of a corporation completely owned
and controlled by such officers and directors. Secondly, it was held
that where an interchange of information, advice, services, property,
.and other assistance takes place between a registrant and a corporation completely owned and controlled by the registrant's officers and
-directors, such an arrangement must be disclosed both as a material
contract between registrant and its officers and directors and as a
material advisory or service contract with an affiliate. The third
.aspect of the opinion dealt with the determination of who may certify
financial statements as "independent" public accountants.
In this
connection, it was concluded that (1) the holding by accountants "and
their immediate families of securities of a registrant amounting to from
1~ percent to !l percent of their combined approximate net worth,
(2) the making of loans by accountants to and from a registrant's
officers and directors, (3) the continuous and unexplained use of all
accountant's name in a false and misleading connection on the hooks

of a company affiliated with the registrant, and (4) the concealment
in registrant's financial statements of its participation in a venture
not associated with its indicated line of business, each constituted
evidence of a disqualifying lack of independence on the part of the
accountants.
The order handed down by the Commission provided that registration would be revoked unless registrant filed appropriate amendments and mailed a copy of the Commission's decision to each of its
stockholders of record. The registrant was also required to file with
this Commission and with the New York Stock Exchange, for public
inspection, quarterly reports summarizing the material transactions
taking place between the registrant and its officers and directors
(including transactions with wholly-owned companies of such officers
and directors) and, in its annual reports to stockholders, to summarize
all such transactions taking place during the preceding year.
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS

During the past fiscal year, the Commission extended .its rules and
regulations governing the solicitation of,proxies, consents, and authorizations to cover securities of investment companies registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. This change became effective
on November 1, 1940, through the adoption of Rule N-20A-I under
Section 20 (a) of that Act. The rules and regulations pursuant to
Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were already
applicable to securities listed and registered on national securities
exchanges and, pursuant to Section 12 (e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, to securities of registered public-utility holding
companies and their subsidiaries.
The work of the Commission in the enforcement of these rules,
which are commonly referred to as the proxy rules, is unspectacular in
nature. However, it constitutes one of the leading fronts in the
current campaign for corporate democracy. Under the rules, stockholders must be given a fair chance to vote for or against each specific
proposal that is submitted to them. Furthermore, a company's
management, when it submits its own proxy material and if it has
been given adequate notice, must include information concerning 'the
proposals of minority stockholders and must cooperate in mailing
whatever proxy material is submitted by such stockholders. Most,
important of all is the requirement of the rules that the security holders.
must be fully informed as to the nature of the proposals on which
they will be asked to vote or give consents or authorizations.
The.
assurance that security holders are adequately informed of the important developments taking place within their corporations- is one
of the best available guarantees for the existence of a responsive

PART vm-QTHER

233

corporate management, sensitive to its fiduciary responsibilities and
public obligations.
Cases handled by the Commission this past year indicate that corporate managements, when releasing proxy material to their stockholders,
may still sometimes fail to inform the solicited stockholders of the
nature of their voting power. This is illustrated by a case in which
the Commission brought about the adjournment of the annual stockholders' meeting and the resolicitation of proxies for the election of
directors, because the corporate management had failed to state in its
proxy material that, under the company's charter, the holders of
preferred stock upon 'which dividends were in default were entitled to
elect a majority of the company's directors.
A more complicated situation arose in another case involving a plan
of recapitalization. The purpose of this plan was to eliminate dividend arrearages on the preferred stock of a company by a merger
with an affiliated company. The amount of the accumulated dividend arrearages on the preferred stock far exceeded the net worth of
the company. Nevertheless, the management of the company,
which held a substantial amount of its common stock, claimed that
some part of the new securities could with propriety be allotted to the
holders of-the-oommon stock. Its justification was that the corporate
charter contained a provision that, in the event of the company's
liquidation, the assets would be divided among the preferred and common stockholders without taking into account arrearages of dividends
on the preferred. The management, however, failed to disclose in its
proxy material that, even if all of the common stock were voted in
favor of the liquidation, the liquidation could not take place without
the affirmative vote of approximately 60 percent of the outstanding
preferred stock. Furthermore, the management failed to state that,
on a going-concern basis, the interests of the common stockholders
were subordinate to the rights of the preferred stockholders to the
large amount of accumulated unpaid dividends on the preferred stock.
The management, upon being advised that its proxy material was
deficient, agreed not to vote any proxies which it might have received
from its solicitation until after the stockholders had been given appropriate corrective information and had expressly confirmed their
proxies.
.The most usual item of corporate business to which proxy machinery
is directed is, of course, the election of directors; other frequently recurring items are mergers, consolidations, transfers of all or a part of
corporate assets, acquisitions of control of other businesses, issuances
and modifications of securities, charter and by-law amendments,
restatements of accounts, compensation plans for executives or other
employees, etc. The past year has seen an increasing amount of
proxy material filed with this Commission in connection with retire-

moot plans for officers and employees, and amendments to corporate
by-laws providing for the indemnification of directors and officers
against expenses and other costs of lawsuits that may be brought
against them.
During the past fiscal year, the Commission examined both thepreliminary and final proxy material with respect to 1,620 solicitations
and in each case commented thereon to the persons making the solicitation. In many cases, it examined revised drafts of preliminary
material. In addition, 450 pieces of supplemental or "follow-up"
soliciting material were received and examined.

Among the Acts administered by the Commission, the Securities
Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, the Investment Company Act of 1940,
and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 provide for the confidential
treatment, upon application by registrants, of information contained
in reports, applications, or documents which they are required to file.
The Securities Act of 1933 empowers the Commission to hold confidential only material contracts, or portions thereof, if it is determined by
the Commission that disclosure will impair the value of the contracts
and is not necessary for the protection of investors. The other four statutes referred to are, in general, without specific restriction in this respect and-empower the Commission to hold confidential under certain
conditions any information contained in any reports required to be
filed under those statutes. Disclosure of information confidentially
filed under the latter statutes is made only when the Commission
determines that disclosure is in the public interest.
Although registrants may seek judicial review of decisions by the
Commission adverse to them, no petitions for such judicial review
were filed in any of these cases during the past fiscal year.

and acted upon during the past year, together with the number

New Rules, Regulations, and Forms to Implement
Company Act of 1940.

Section 30 (f) of the Investmens

During the past year the Commission published two forms, N-30F - I
and N-30F-2, to be used by officers, directors, and other persons
occupying specified relationships to registered closed-end investment
companies in making reports prescribed by Section 30 (f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940. Form N-30F-1 is used for filing
initial reports of holdings following registration of a closed-end investment company or assumption of one of the specified relationships to
such a company, and Form N-30F-2 is used to report subsequent
monthly purchases and sales and other changes in such holdings.
The Commission adopted the companion Rules N-30F-l and N-30F-2
governing the use of these new forms. In conjunction with the
adoption of these rules and forms, and in order to avoid any unnecessary duplication in connection with the reporting requirements, the
Commission also adopted Rule X-16A-7 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to permit persons who are under the duty to fileownership reports under both the Investment Company Act of 1940
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to use the new forms for
OJ For information regarding the general purpose and scope of reporting requirements, the Commission's
examination procedure, and the pubheauon of security ownersfnp reports, see Sixth Annual Report of th.Commission, pp. 180, 182,as well as previous annual reports.
In addition to the reports required of certain persons closely Identified with the management or control
of eompames required under other Acts administered by the Commission, the Investment Company Act
of 1940provides, under Section 30 (f) thereof, which became effective November 1, 1940,that every person
who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10percent of any class of outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) ot which a registered closed-end investment company is the ISSueror

reports required under both Acts. Thus, an officer of a closed-end
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, which also has equity securities listed and registered on a
national securities exchange, may comply with the reporting requirements of both Acts by filing reports on Form N-30F-1 or N-30F-2
with the Commission and the exchange on which the securities are
listed.
In addition, the Commission adopted Rule N-30F-3 exempting for
the purposes of Section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act of
1940 securities held in a decedent's estate during a period of 2 years
following the appointment and qualification of the executor or
administrator; securities held by a guardian or committee for an
incompetent; securities held by a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or
other similar person duly authorized by law to administer the estate
of another person; and securities reacquired and held by or for the
account of the issuer. A similar rule has been in effect for some time
under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Forms 4, 5, and 6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Forms U-17-1 and U-17-2 under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 were continued unchanged during the year."

Of the 3,764 officers, directors, and principal security holders who
filed initial reports on Forms 5, 6, and N-30F-l during the past year
2,714 did so without the necessity for any action by the Commission.
However, the remaining 1,050 persons did not file their initial reports until after the Commission had called the reporting requirements to their attention.
The Commission examines a wide variety of sources to obtain
information as to the identity of persons who fail to :filereports in
compliance with the requirements of the statutes. Among these
sources are applications for registration of securities, annual reports,
current reports, and proxy statements filed by issuers pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934; registration statements filed by
issuers under the Securities Act of 1933; notifications of registration,
registration statements, and annual supplements filed by registered
holding companies under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935; notifications of registration under the Investment Company
Act of 1940; letters received from issuers; and the current publications
of certain daily, weekly, and quarterly financial news services.
During the period that the security ownership reporting requirements have been in effect-more than 6 years under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, more than 5 years under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, and less than a year under the Investment Company Act of 194D-an aggregate of approximately
170,000 original and amended reports has been filed by 31,115 persons.
There has been practically no necessity for any formal action by the
Commission in order to secure the filing of these reports, notwithstanding the large number of reports and persons involved.

Releases.

The Commission conceives it to be its duty to see to it 'that the
public is kept informed of the activities of the Commission through
informational releases made available currently to the press and
mailed free upon request to any person. The releases are classified
into various categories so that a person may receive copies of all
announcements relating to one particular phase of the Commission's
work (for example-releases relating to the Securities Act of 1933)
without obtaining other material in which such person would have no
interest.
The releases promulgated by. the Commission. include its findings,
opinions, and orders, as well as announcements of rules, filings of
registration statements, utility company applications and corporate
annual reports, public hearing notices, security transactions and
holdings, statistical data, etc. Among those on the mailing lists, in
addition to members of the general public, are banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms, security dealers, investment and financial
services, statistical organizations, stock exchanges, corporations,
universities, libraries, and law, accounting, and engineering :firms.
Included among the announcements issued during the past fiscal
year were 312 releases relating to the Commission's activities under
the Securities Act of 1933; 374 releases dealing with activities under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and 717 releases with reference
to activities under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
There were 153 releases concerning the Investment Company Act of
1940 and 18 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (both Acts
became effective November 1, 1940). In addition, there were 39
releases concerning the duties of the Commission under Chap.$erX of
the Bankruptcy Act, while 11 releases were issued under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939.
The Commission continued the daily publication of the Registration
Record, which presents a brief description of data filed under the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. This
data includes a thumbnail sketch of registration statements and appli<lations for qualifications of indentures, amendments, effective dates,
withdrawals of registration statements or applications, and certain

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

PUBLIC INSPECTION OF REGISTERED INFORMATION

Under the provisions of the several Acts administered by the
Commission, certain information filed with the Commission is made
available to the public under such regulations and reasonable limitations and at such reasonable charge as the Commission may prescribe.
Accordingly, there are available for inspection in the Public Reference
Room of the Commission at Washington, D. C., copies of all publicinformation contained in registration statements, applications, reports,
declarations, and other public documents on file with the Commission.
In addition to the thousands of letters and telephone calls received
during the past fiscal year from members of the public requesting
registered information, more than 8,380 members of the public visited
this Public Reference Room during this period seeking such information. Also, through the facilities provided by the Commission for the
sale of public registered information, more than 3,100 orders for
photocopies of material, involving 155,679 pages, were filled during the
fiscal year, Photocopies of registered public information may be
procured from the offices of the Commission in Washington, D. C.,
only.
In order to make public information further available for inspection,
the Commission has, insofar as practicable, made registered information filed with it available to the public in its regional offices. Thus, in
the Public Reference Room which is maintained in the Commission's
N ew York Regional Office, facilities are provided for the inspection of
copies of (1) such applications for permanent registration of securities
on all national securities exchanges, except the New York Stock
Exchange and the New York Curb Exchange, as.have received final
examination in the Commission, together with copies of supplemental
reports and amendments thereto, and (2) annual reports filed pursuant
to the provisions of Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, by issuers that have securities registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The fact that during the past
fiscal year more than 14,700 members of the public visited the Public
Reference Room of the N ew York Regional Office seeking registered
public information, forms, releases, and other material indicates a
continued demand for such information in this zone.
Likewise, in the Public Reference Room of the Chicago Regional
Office there are available for public inspection copies of applications
for permanent registration of securities on the N ew York Stock Exchange and the New York Curb Exchange, which have received final
examination in the Commission, together with copies of all supplemental reports and amendments thereto.
During the. :fiscal -year

PART VIII-QTHER

241

ACTIVITIES

ended June 30, 1941, more than 4,580 members of the public utilized
the facilities provided in this office by requesting registered information, forms, releases, and other material. •

In each of the Commission's regional offices there are available for
inspection copies of prospectuses used in public offerings of securities
effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Duplicate copies of applications for registration of brokers or dealers
transacting business on over-the-counter
markets, together with
supplemental statements thereto, filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, are also available for public inspection in each regional
office having jurisdiction over the zone in which the principal office of
the broker or dealer is located. Also, inasmuch as letters of notification under Regulation A exempting small issues of securities from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
may be filed with the regional office of the Commission for the region
in which the issuer's principal place of business is located, copies of
such material are available for inspection at the particular regional
office where it is filed.
In addition, as a result of the Commission's regionalization during
the past fiscal year of the registration of securities under the Securities
Act of 1933 and the qualification of indentures under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, there are available for inspection in the Commission's San Francisco and Cleveland Regional Offices, in which are
provided complete facilities for such registration and qualification,
copies of registration statements and applications for qualification of
indentures filed at those regional offices.
Copies of all applications for permanent registration of securities on
national securities exchanges are available for public inspection at the
respective exchange upon which the securities are registered.

the real estate and merchandising groups were 57 and 47, respectively.
The mining and other extractive classification with 27 and service
