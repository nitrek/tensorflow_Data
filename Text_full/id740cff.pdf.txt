INITIAL DECISION MAKING FINDINGS
AND IMPOSING SANCTION BY DEFAULT
January 27, 2015

Robert M. Moye and Jedediah B. Forkner for the
Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission
Respondent Roy Dixon, Jr., pro se

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision bars Roy Dixon, Jr. (Dixon), from the securities industry.
I. BACKGROUND
The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) instituted this proceeding with
an Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on February 11, 2014, pursuant to Sections 15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 (Advisers Act). The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on SEC v. Onyx Capital
Advisors, LLC, No. 2:10-cv-11633 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 31, 2014), in which Dixon was enjoined
against violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. To date, Dixon has
failed to file an Answer to the OIP, due on December 29, 2014. See Roy Dixon, Jr., Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 2154, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4870 (Dec. 19, 2014); 17 C.F.R. §
201.220(b). Accordingly, he has failed to answer or otherwise to defend the proceeding within
the meaning of 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2). Therefore, Dixon is in default, and the undersigned
finds that the allegations in the OIP are true.1 See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).

Dixon was warned that if he failed to file an Answer within the time provided, he would be
deemed to be in default, and the undersigned would enter an order barring him from the
securities industry. Roy Dixon, Jr., 2014 SEC LEXIS 4870. Additionally, the Division of
Enforcement has filed a motion for default.

II. FINDINGS OF FACT
Dixon is permanently enjoined against violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of
1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1),
206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. SEC v. Onyx Capital
Advisors, LLC, ECF No. 147.2 He was also ordered, jointly and severally with Onyx Capital
Advisors, LLC (Onyx Capital), a Detroit, Michigan, private equity firm that he owned and
controlled, to pay disgorgement of $3,112,343 plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of
$3,112,343. Id.
Dixon, age fifty, resides in Atlanta, Georgia. From at least 2007 to 2010, Dixon acted as
an unregistered investment advisor to three public pension funds that invested in the Onyx
Capital Advisory Fund I, LP (Onyx Fund). From at least 2007 to 2010, Dixon was also
employed as a registered representative at Professional Asset Management, Inc., a Bloomfield
Hills, Michigan, broker-dealer.
He held the following FINRA licenses: Investment
Company/Variable Contracts Products Limited Representative (Series 6) and General Securities
Representative (Series 7).
In the conduct underlying SEC v. Onyx Capital Advisors, Dixon and Onyx Capital
misappropriated more than $3.11 million from the Onyx Fund – $2.06 million under the guise of
management fees and an additional $1.05 million that was ostensibly invested in Dixon’s
friend’s used car businesses. Further, Dixon and Onyx Capital made numerous false and
misleading statements to the pension funds. For example, Dixon and Onyx Capital sent a forged
letter to one of the pension funds misrepresenting the principals of Onyx Capital. Dixon and
Onyx Capital also issued false and misleading capital calls to the public pension funds and
misrepresented the amount of management fees they had taken. Dixon himself made material
misrepresentations to the public pension funds that invested in the Onyx Fund, and Dixon
himself misappropriated money from the Onyx Fund.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Dixon has been permanently enjoined “from engaging in or continuing any conduct or
practice in connection with any such activity” as a broker, dealer, or investment adviser within
the meaning of Sections 15(b)(4)(C) and 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and 203(e)(4) and 203(f)
of the Advisers Act.
IV. SANCTION
Dixon will be barred from the securities industry, as the Division of Enforcement
requests. This sanction will serve the public interest and the protection of investors, pursuant to
Sections 15(b) of the Exchange Act and 203(f) of the Advisers Act, and accords with
2

Official notice, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323, is taken of the docket report and the court’s
orders in SEC v. Onyx Capital Advisors, LLC.

Commission precedent and the sanction considerations set forth in Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d
1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981). As described in the
Findings of Fact, Dixon’s unlawful conduct was recurring over a period of years, egregious, and
involved a high degree of scienter. His dishonesty even included forgery. His misconduct
resulted in unlawful gains of millions of dollars that he misappropriated from public pension
funds while concealing his misappropriations with misrepresentations. Because of the
Commission’s obligation to ensure honest securities markets, an industry-wide bar is
appropriate.
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Sections 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, ROY DIXON, JR., IS BARRED from
associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal
advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization and from
participating in an offering of penny stock.3
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to
that Rule, a party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days
after service of the Initial Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of
fact within ten days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party,
then that party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the
undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The Initial
Decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality. The
Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion to
correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the Initial Decision shall not become
final as to that party.4
