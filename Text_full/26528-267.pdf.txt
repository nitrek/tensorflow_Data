Meeting of the Securities and Exchange Commission Investor Advisory Committee
Discussion on the State of Sustainability Reporting
SEC Headquarters, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549
July 14th (10:30-12:00)
File No. 265-28

Remarks by Christianna Wood, Chair of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

1. Introduction
Thank you Members of the Security and Exchange ommission’s Investor !dvisory ommittee for the
opportunity to address you on the important issue of the state of sustainability reporting.
My name is Christianna Wood and I Chair the Board of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). While I have
come here to speak to the Commission on behalf of GRI, I have numerous other perspectives to share. I
am an institutional investor for over 30 years, most recently at the California Public Employee Retirement
System (CalPERS) where I was in charge of their $150 billion global equity portfolio. Additionally, I am a
director of a US issuer H&R Block (HRB) listed on the New York Stock Exchange and recently served as a
director of the International Securities Exchange.
The disclosure of meaningful sustainability information is a critical process that provides investors and
other stakeholders with a holistic view of an organization’s performance, impacts and activities, to inform
effective decision-making. This process supports stable and sustainable global capital markets and the
transition towards a sustainable global economy.
I hope that this morning’s discussions will support you in your valuable work advising the Commission in
its mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and facilitate capital
formation. And in particular, the ommission’s work around its oncept Release on usiness and Financial
Disclosure Required by Regulation S-K, as part of the ommission’s disclosure effectiveness initiative.
I would like to compliment the Commission and this Committee on its leadership in bringing this
conversation forward. Building on previous Commission leadership on the crucial sustainability issue of
climate change, this is the first time the broad area of sustainability disclosures has been tabled as a
Concept Release by the Commission. This demonstrates that the Commission is listening to investors as
well as other stakeholders about the critical information they need from issuers to make more informed
investment and other decisions.
2. GRI and the growth of sustainability reporting

1


GRI was established 20 years ago here in the United States by Ceres, a national coalition of investors,
environmental organizations and other public interest groups, to create the world’s first global
sustainability reporting framework. At that time, the practice of voluntary, let alone mandatory,
sustainability disclosures was virtually non-existent.
Since then, the disclosure of sustainability information by organizations around the world has increased
dramatically and GRI’s reporting framework has become the world’s most trusted and widely used
sustainability reporting framework. Indeed SEC Chair Mary Jo White in her address to the International
Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) Annual Conference in San Francisco last month remarked that
“The GRI Sustainability Framework ... is now being widely used by companies to prepare their
sustainability reports”.
Today, according to KPMG’s 2015 Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting, almost three quarters of
the largest 100 companies by revenue in each of 45 countries surveyed by KPMG now report on
sustainability issues. The current rate of sustainability reporting among the world’s largest 250 companies
based on the Fortune Global 500 Ranking, is over 90 per cent. According to KPMG, GRI provides the most
popular voluntary sustainability reporting standards, used by 74% of the Fortune G250; and by 72% of
companies reporting on sustainability issues worldwide in standalone sustainability reports. GRI’s
Standards are used by thousands of organizations across all sectors in over 90 countries.
The GRI Standards are already used by hundreds of companies, both public and private, here in the United
States. We are currently aware of more than 350 companies headquartered in the United States that have
publically declared that they are following the GRI Standards. 250 of these are SEC registrants.
Furthermore, there are more than 90 multinational companies that are foreign issuers and have declared
that they are following the GRI Standards. A list of these companies appended to a copy of this speech
was electronically submitted to this Committee (Annexes 1-2).
The GRI Standards provide a comprehensive view of the sustainability impacts of an organization through
the lenses of a wide variety of stakeholders including investors, business, accountants, labor, civil society,
and academia. This reporting includes disclosures on critical issues such as child labor, anti-corruption,
procurement practices, energy, emissions, occupational health and safety, product responsibility, and
water. When applied appropriately, the GRI Standards allow for meaningful comparison on the
sustainability performance of different companies.
Currently, 41 countries reference GRI in their legislation and policy on sustainability disclosures- that’s by
governments such as Norway and India, as well as at a regional level in the groundbreaking EU Directive
on disclosure of non-financial and diversity Information1.
GRI is also recommended in the World Federation of Exchanges sustainability guidance and
recommendations of October 20152, which sets out material ESG metrics to include in disclosure guidance
11

DIRECTIVE 2014/95/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 22 October 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information
by certain large undertakings and groups
2
WFE Sustainability Working Group Exchange Guidance & Recommendation – October 2015

2


for its 66 stock exchange members. Furthermore, GRI is specifically referenced by 21 stock exchanges
including the Deutsche Börse Group, the Singapore Stock exchange and BM&F Bovespa in Brazil. GRI has
also been referenced by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in its 2010 Guidance Regarding
Disclosure Related to Climate Change.
GRI stands out in the sustainability reporting field, given its vast scale, inclusive approach and unmatched
widespread adoption.

3.	 GRI’s formal submission in response to the SEC’s Concept Release
I would like to outline the three key points GRI will be including in its formal response to the ommission’s
Concept Release on Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation S-K next week.
	 First, the responsibility to determine material sustainability issues lies with the registrant
The registrant’s business, financial condition and risks has to become evident through its filing. The
filing should not be misleading and should provide the complete set of information that is material to
any investment or voting decision. In this context, GRI has advocated for many years that
organizations should identify their specific material issues based on an established definition and
principle-based guidance, and focus their reporting on such issues.
Requiring line item disclosures across industries would result in an undue reporting burden and is
likely to produce a large quantity of information that is immaterial to investors and other
stakeholders. Requiring line item disclosures would also go against what has been emerging as
recognized best practice globally. The business models of modern companies are highly diversified
and, while industry specific commonalities exist, significant differences, even within industries, are
not uncommon.
GRI advises that the registrant should itself define which sustainability and public policy issues are
material based on an established definition and principle-based guidance and this principle is already
embedded in our standards.
	 Second, GRI supports disclosure of all material issues whether they relate to financial or nonfinancial information
Many SEC registrants are already making disclosures on public policy and sustainability issues. In most
cases this reporting activity is happening outside of the SEC mandated filings. There are a variety of
different approaches to disclosure in this space, such as through standalone sustainability reports or
via issue specific communications.
To fulfill its mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate
capital formation, the Commission should strongly encourage registrants to broaden their disclosure
practice within SEC mandated filings. The expectation that sustainability and public policy issues are
3


covered by the current materiality definition needs to be communicated much more clearly to the
market place. A clear position on this matter from the SEC would be instrumental to further develop
and lead to a change in reporting practice, to support more sustainable and stable capital markets.
GRI strongly supports full disclosure of all financially material information by companies for the use
of investors. GRI contends that additional information, where it addresses significant emerging
sustainability issues that haven’t yet risen to the point of being financially material, but might in the
future for example such as consequences of increased palm oil production, or concerning the rights
of indigenous peoples in the context of the extractives industry, can have real value for investors and
other stakeholders.
In order to ensure companies continue to disclose this pre-financially material information, GRI
advises that the SEC embrace already existing reporting practice by recommending that such
information be disclosed as an Exhibit or in another defined area of additional disclosure to relevant
SEC filings.
	 Third, the use of GRI as an existing robust reporting standard increases the utility and
comparability of information
Many SEC registrants operate in multiple jurisdictions around the world, and are faced with a variety
of sustainability and public policy disclosure recommendations and requirements. GRI strongly
recommends that the SEC consider global best practice, which is the GRI Standards, should it choose
to recommend or require sustainability and public policy disclosure.
The GRI Standards, which originated in the US, are particularly relevant to the US market, which
represents GRI’s largest reporting market (Annex 3) containing some of GRI’s longest standing
reporters; with GE, sitting in this room today being a great example. The multi-stakeholder process
used by GRI to develop its Standards, which incorporates input from all main stakeholders across all
regions includes a robust and continuous US perspective.
In addition to being well suited to serve the US market, GRI Standards also represent global best
practice for sustainability reporting and its widespread use contributes to lowering the reporting
burden for US companies operating internationally and significantly increases the comparability of
available information.
4.	 In closing
In closing, as an institutional investor, I can confidently say that investors have always been using nonfinancial information in assessing the suitability, risk and valuation of companies. And increasingly
investors want more of this kind of information in assessing the risks of issuers. Therefore, this is an
area where GRI recommends the SEC should take action to ensure a consistent and effective approach
to sustainability disclosures by US issuers.

4


Should the SEC decide to regulate disclosure of sustainability information, GRI advises that the
ommission recommend SE registrants report on sustainability issues using GRI’s Standards, taking
advantage of international developments in sustainability reporting over the last 20 years.
GRI has a strong international footprint in both compliance and voluntary reporting- it doesn’t
advocate for either, but is essential to both. Based on GRI’s observations, different types of disclosure
regimes work in different jurisdictions around the world.
Given the robust uptake of sustainability reporting and GRI Standards, it is remarkable how far
companies have come voluntarily at the behest of a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including
investors. If the Commission decides to recommend voluntary or mandatory sustainability reporting,
GRI’s advises that it recommend using the GRI Standards, already used by the majority of the world’s
largest companies and referenced by numerous governments, market regulators and stock
exchanges.
I would be remiss not to mention that there are challenges that persist around sustainability reporting
such as consistency of information, quality, comparability, regional/sectoral differences in levels of
reporting, different approaches to innovations in reporting such as integrated reporting, scope, and
assurance. Clearly, sustainability reporting is an evolving practice and while many of these challenges
rest with the reporters themselves, GRI is committed to helping the evolution of sustainability
reporting; and these challenges are taken into account in the due process that continues to enhance
GRI’s Standards.
As a possible approach using existing SEC rules, GRI advises the SEC to encourage or require
companies that are preparing comprehensive GRI based sustainability reports to put such reports in
their SEC filings as an Exhibit. In doing so the SEC would embrace the existing practice of 74 per cent
of the largest global companies and enhance the information available for all stakeholders to ensure
a broad perspective on a company’s performance, risks and impacts.
Thank you for your attention and the opportunity to address you on this important issue. I look
forward to a deeper discussion on these issues and to any questions that you may have.
