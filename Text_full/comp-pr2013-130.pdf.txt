UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
MIAMI DIVISION
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
v.
CITY OF MIAMI, FLORIDA AND
MICHAEL BOUDREAUX,
Defendants.
________________________________________________/
COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows:
I.

INTRODUCTION
1.

The Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendants the City of Miami,

Florida and its former Budget Director, Michael Boudreaux from violating the anti-fraud
provisions of the federal securities laws.
2.

In March 2003, the Commission instituted a cease-and-desist order against the

City for violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with
bonds the City issued in 1995. The City has gone on to violate these same provisions again –
this time in connection with three bonds the City issued in 2009.
3.

The City raised approximately $153.5 million from the investing public through

bond offerings in May, July, and December 2009. In connection with these offerings, the City
made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to investors in the bond offering
documents and the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (“CAFRs”) concerning
certain inter-fund transfers from its Capital Projects Funds to its General Fund, including
transfers of restricted fees.
1

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 2 of 40

4.

Beginning no later than 2007 until 2009, the City engaged in a series of transfers

from its Capital Projects Funds to its General Fund to mask the General Fund’s deficits,
transferred restricted funds into the General Fund, and falsely inflated the General Fund balance
to achieve the City’s goal of maintaining $100 million in reserves in its General Fund, and
ultimately obtained more favorable ratings on its bond offerings.

To obtain the City

Commission’s approval of these inter-fund transfers, Boudreaux made misrepresentations to the
City Commission about the transfers, which falsely represented that the project funds were
unallocated, and concealed the transfers in the City’s internal records.
5.

The City made numerous material misrepresentations and omissions to the

investing public in its bond offering documents and 2007 and 2008 CAFRs about the inter-fund
transfers. For example, the City did not disclose the full amount or effect of the transfers to the
General Fund’s budget and its fund balance. Further, the City represented the project funds
transferred in 2007 and 2008 were “unexpended” or “unused,” when in reality the funds were
allocated to specific capital projects that still needed the money or had already spent it. The City
also failed to disclose it had not adjusted its Capital Projects Funds budget to reflect the transfers
to the General Fund.
6.

Additionally, to ensure rating agencies gave the City’s 2009 bond offerings

favorable ratings, in April 2009 the City, through Boudreaux, made material misrepresentations
and omissions to the agencies concerning the fiscal year 2007 and 2008 transfers and the City’s
projected operating deficit for its fiscal year 2009 General Fund.
7.

During the same time the Defendants were making material misrepresentations

and omissions, the City obtained favorable ratings from the rating agencies on the more than
$150 million the City raised from the investing public. Notably, these favorable ratings allowed

2

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 3 of 40

the City to obtain the more than $150 million on more favorable terms than if they had less
favorable ratings.

Ultimately, the true nature of the transfers was disclosed, many of the

transfers were reversed, and the City’s ratings were downgraded.
8.

In addition to the above misrepresentations and omissions, the City, through

Boudreaux, engaged in other fraudulent and deceptive conduct in violation of the federal
securities laws, including, but not limited to, misrepresenting the interfund transfers to the City
Commission that approved the transfers and by taking affirmative steps to obscure or conceal the
transfers in the City’s internal records.
9.

By engaging in the conduct described above, and more fully below, the City has

violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 77q; and
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and
Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. Boudreaux has violated Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77q; Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §78j(b) and Rule
10b-5(b) thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5; and aided and abetted the City’s violations of
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §78j(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §
240.10b-5. Moreover, the Court should issue an order pursuant to Section 20(c) of the Securities
Act and Section 21(e) of the Exchange Act commanding the City to comply with the prior
Commission Order.
II.

DEFENDANTS
A.

Defendants

10.

The City is the largest municipality in Miami-Dade County, Florida in terms of

population. At all relevant times, a Mayor and the five member City Commission governed the
City.

The highest ranking employee of the City is the City Manager, who reported to the

3

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 4 of 40

Mayor. The City regularly issues municipal bonds to the public. At the end of its most recent
fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, the City had outstanding municipal bonds (general
obligation, special obligation and revenue) totaling approximately $647 million.
11.

Boudreaux, 47, resides in New Orleans, Louisiana. Boudreaux was the City’s

Budget Director during the relevant time periods until his termination in March 2010. In this
capacity, Boudreaux oversaw the Budget Department, which is responsible for the preparation
and presentation of the City’s budgets for its general operating, capital projects, special revenue,
and debt service funds. Boudreaux provided information used to draft sections of the City’s
annual CAFRs, and he also provided budget information the City used in the CAFRs budget
schedules. Boudreaux was also responsible for the City’s Multi-Year Capital Plan – an official
statement of the City’s long-range physical improvement plans. In addition, he was responsible
for, among other things, preparing the overall capital budgets, updating the Multi-Year Capital
Plan, monitoring actual and non-operating capital project expenditures to ensure they did not
exceed budget appropriations, and reporting on the amount of those funds. Moreover, the
transfers masterminded by Boudreaux were incorporated into the City's General Fund financial
information included in the City’s Management Discussion and Analysis and financial
statements.
B.

Relevant Individuals

12.

During the relevant time period, the City employed a City Manager who had full

authority over the City’s financial operations and the preparation of its annual budget. He signed
a certificate stating the City’s Official Statements for the 2009 bond offerings were free of
misstatements and omissions of material fact. He also signed a transmittal letter assuming full

4

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 5 of 40

responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all information contained in the City’s 2007
and 2008 CAFRs (“Transmittal Letters”). The City Manager resigned in February 2010.
13.

During the relevant time period, the City also employed a Chief Financial Officer

(“CFO”) who was responsible for oversight and management of all aspects of the City’s
finances, including its capital financing and bond issuance activities, budget development, and
compliance with its codified Financial Integrity Principles. In February 2000, the City enacted
the Financial Integrity Ordinance establishing thirteen financial integrity principles. The
Financial Integrity Ordinance was enacted as a preventive measure setting forth financial
practices that would prevent the recurrence of a financial emergency. He was also responsible for
the City’s Finance Department.

The CFO also signed the Transmittal Letters.

The CFO

resigned from the City in June 2011.
14.

During the relevant time period, the City also employed a Finance Director who

oversaw the Finance Department, which prepared the City’s annual CAFRs. Together with the
City Manager and CFO, the Finance Director also signed the Transmittal Letters. The Finance
Director resigned from the City in September 2011.
III.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
15.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(c),

20(d)(1) and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(c), 77t(d)(1), and 77v(a); and
Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1),
78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e), and 78aa.
16.

This Court has personal jurisdiction over the City and Boudreaux, and venue is

proper in the Southern District of Florida because many of the acts, transactions, practices, and

5

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 6 of 40

courses of conduct constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred in the Southern
District of Florida and the City is located within the Southern District of Florida.
17.

In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the City and Boudreaux,

directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation and
communication in interstate commerce, and the mails.
IV.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
A.

The Deteriorating Financial Condition of the City’s General Fund

18.

The General Fund is used to account for all financial resources except those

required to be reported in another fund. In other words, resources in a fund other than the
General Fund are either (1) required to be used for the purpose of that fund or (2) intended by the
government to be used for that purpose. “Fund balance” simply means the difference between
the fund’s assets and its liabilities.
19.

The City’s General Fund is the largest component (representing more than $500

million or approximately 70% during the relevant period) of the City’s adopted consolidated
operating budget. The General Fund pays for most of the City’s core services and its largest
departments, including the police and fire departments. Rating agencies and bond insurers give
primary attention to the condition of the General Fund in assessing a municipality’s financial
condition.
20.

During fiscal years 2007 through 2010, the City reported decreasing General Fund

balances, because of overspending, revenue underperformance and declines in property taxes due
to the housing market correction.

Escalating pension and health care costs were also a

6

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 7 of 40

significant drain on the City’s finances. All of these factors materially impacted the health of the
City’s General Fund during the relevant time period.
B.

The Bond Offerings and the CAFRs
1.

21.

The 2007 and 2008 CAFRs

On July 22, 2008, the City distributed its 2007 CAFR to broad segments of the

investing public, including investors in previously-issued City debt pursuant to continuing
disclosure agreements. The CAFR is a government entity’s official annual report. The City’s
2007 CAFR contained a Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) section and the
City’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007. The CAFR
also contained a transmittal letter stating that the CAFR “is complete and reliable in all material
aspects.”
22.

On March 26, 2009, the City distributed its 2008 CAFR to broad segments of the

investing public, including investors in previously-issued City debt. The 2008 CAFR also
contained an MD&A section and the City’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2008. The 2008 CAFR also contained a transmittal letter making the same
statements as in the prior year about the completeness and reliability of the information presented
in the CAFR.
23.

Also, as in the prior year, the Finance Department relied on Boudreaux’s budget

reports to prepare the 2008 CAFR. The City completed the CAFRs budget tables by “dropping
in the numbers” from Boudreaux’s reports. Boudreaux provided information the City relied on
in other sections addressing the General Fund financial and budgetary highlights, economic
factors, and budget forecasts.

Boudreaux also helped draft certain sections of the CAFR,

including a portion of the transmittal letter describing the City’s economic condition and outlook.

The May 2009 -- $51 Million Bond Offering

On May 29, 2009, the City issued approximately $51 million in Limited Ad

Valorem Tax Bonds to pay for the costs of certain homeland defense/neighborhood capital
improvement projects. These bonds are not insured. The bonds are secured by certain pledged
City ad valorem tax revenues. The Preliminary Official Statement and Official Statement for
this bond offering contained, among other things, excerpts of the City’s 2008 CAFR, including
the MD&A section and fiscal year end 2008 audited financial statements.

The Official

Statement also contained an “Authorization of Official Statement” stating the execution and
delivery of the Official Statement was authorized by the City. In addition, the bond closing
documents contained a certificate stating the Official Statement was free of misstatements and
omissions of material fact (the “Anti-Fraud Certification”).
25.

The rating agency Standard and Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“Standard and

Poor’s) gave this bond offering an “A” rating; the rating agency Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
(“Moody’s”) gave it an “A3” rating; and the rating agency Fitch Ratings Ltd. (“Fitch”) rated it an
“A-“. These were favorable ratings for the City. For example, obligations rated “A3” or “Aaa”
by Moody’s are judged to be of the highest quality by the rating agency and subject to the lowest
level of credit risk.
26.

Rating agencies issue ratings on a scale from the best quality credit to the lowest.

Credit ratings are important because they affect the cost of borrowing, i.e., the interest rate the
issuer will pay the investor for buying the bonds. An issuer such as the City can save or incur
significant additional costs in interest over the life of a bond because of its credit rating. Issuers
with good credit ratings are able borrow at low cost as they pay low interest rates.

27.

The July 2009 -- $37 Million Bond Offering

On July 16, 2009, the City issued approximately $37 million in Non Ad Valorem

Revenue Refunding Taxable Pension Bonds to raise funds to refund outstanding City bonds
issued in 2006. These bonds are not insured. The bonds are secured by certain pledged funds.
The Preliminary Official Statement and Official Statement for this bond offering also contained,
among other things, excerpts of the City’s 2008 CAFR, including the MD&A section and fiscal
year ended September 30, 2008 audited financial statements. This offering also included an
Authorization of Official Statement and an Anti-Fraud Certification. The rating agencies gave
this offering favorable ratings. For instance, Standard and Poor’s gave this bond offering an “A”
rating and Moody’s gave it an “A3” rating.
4.
28.

The December 2009 -- $65 Million Bond Offering

On December 2, 2009, the City issued $65 million in Special Obligation Bonds to

pay for the cost of acquiring, constructing, and improving certain roadways and streetscapes.
Although these bonds are not insured, pledges of certain local gas and transportation taxes and
parking surcharges secure them. The preliminary Official Statement and Official Statement for
this bond offering also contained, among other things, excerpts of the City’s 2008 CAFR,
including the MD&A section and fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 audited financial
statements. This offering also included an Authorization of Official Statement and an AntiFraud Certification. The rating agencies gave this offering favorable ratings. For example,
Standard and Poor’s rated this bond offering an “A-“; Moody’s rated it “A3”; and Fitch rated it
an “A-“.

C.

The City’s Operating Budget and Approval Process for Inter-fund Transfers

29.

Pursuant to both Florida and local laws, the City must incur expenditures based

only on funding appropriations the City Commission approves.

Florida law also requires

municipalities to adopt a balanced budget each fiscal year. The City’s annual operating budget
(the “Operating Budget”) serves as the foundation for the City’s fiscal planning, control, and
accountability. The City Manager submits the Operating Budget to the City Commission and, if
it approves, the City Commission enacts it. The Operating Budget includes the City’s budget for
all governmental funds (except for the Capital Projects Funds which are budgeted for separately)
and budget appropriations, including transfers between the City’s funds.
30.

The City Commission may amend the City’s Operating Budget if, during the

course of the year, it becomes evident that a particular department is unable to provide the
required level of services to the community due to unexpected higher costs of providing that
service.

In such instances, the City’s Budget Director submits a resolution for the City

Commission’s approval.

Generally, the resolution includes a proposal for financing the

additional expenditures, usually through either the appropriation of funds from the City’s
General Fund, or the submission of evidence of an expected surplus in current year revenue
collections. The City Manager must approve the resolution before submitting it to the City
Commission.
31.

The City’s Budget for its Capital Projects Funds is detailed by project and funding

source and is prepared as a part of a Multi-Year Capital Plan the City Commission authorizes
and enacts.
32.

The City Commission must also approve inter-fund transfers.

Governmental

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) (in effect at the time) Statement 34 defines

11

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 12 of 40

inter-fund transfers as the flow of assets such as cash or goods from the fund making the transfer
without equivalent flows of assets in return and without a requirement for repayment from the
fund receiving the transfer.
33.

One of the City’s financial goals was to maintain a total fund balance or total

“reserve” of at least $100 million in the General Fund for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. This $100
million reserve target for the General Fund was discussed at City Commission meetings on May
8, 2008, during which City officials, including Boudreaux, committed to keep the General
Fund’s balance at $100 million. In addition, the $100 million reserve target for the General Fund
was discussed at City Commission meetings on September 11, 2007 and September 11, 2008.
The City recognized the importance of maintaining a healthy General Fund balance and
considered the $100 million reserve target crucial for credit rating purposes.
D.

The Defendants Make Inter-fund Transfers in FY 2007 and 2008
to Mask Increasing Deficits in the General Fund

34.

In fiscal years 2007 and 2008, the City recorded certain inter-fund transfers

totaling approximately $37.5 million from its Capital Projects Funds and a Special Revenue
Fund to its General Fund. Governmental GAAP stipulates that Capital Projects Funds should be
used to account for financial resources to be used for the acquisition or construction of major
capital facilities (National Council on Governmental Accounting (“NCGA”) Statement 1).
Special Revenue Funds should be used to account for specific revenue sources that are legally
restricted to expenditures for specified purposes (NCGA Statement 1).
35.

In the 1990s, following the City’s financial crisis, the City enacted a law that the

City’s General Fund reserves could not fall below 20% of its average general revenues for the
prior three fiscal years.

The misleading transfers in fiscal year 2008 prevented this from

occurring.
12

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 13 of 40

36.

At the close of fiscal year 2007, Boudreaux was concerned about the declining

fund balance in the City’s General Fund. Boudreaux, therefore, proposed fund transfers to the
General Fund as a way to reduce the declines in the City’s General Fund balance and help the
City meet its financial goal of maintaining a General Fund balance (or total reserve) of at least
$100 million. In fact, the transfers in fiscal year 2008 prevented the City’s General Fund fund
balance from falling below the 20% reserve requirement.
1.
37.

The $13.1 Million Transfer to the General Fund in FY 2007

On or about January 22, 2008, after the end of fiscal year 2007, Boudreaux

notified the CFO that the General Fund ending balance for fiscal year 2007 was approximately
$92.4 million and, more importantly, the projected total decline in the General Fund balance was
$33.8 million. The projected General Fund ending balance was problematic because it fell below
the City’s General Fund balance (or total reserve) target of $100 million for 2007.
38.

Hence, to close this gap as of the close of fiscal year 2007, a few months later

Boudreaux recommended that the City transfer to its General Fund any “unused General Fund
contributions sitting in” the Capital Projects Funds. Purportedly in connection with finding
unused General Funds, on or about April 28, 2008, Boudreaux gave the Finance Director a
written request for a journal entry to transfer $13.1 million to the City’s General Fund from one
of its Capital Projects Funds.
39.

In his request to the Finance Director for the journal entry, Boudreaux claimed the

Budget Department’s ongoing review of the Capital Projects Funds indicated there were “unused
General Fund contributions” in the Capital Projects Funds as of September 30, 2007. Boudreaux
also stated the City Manager had agreed they could return to the General Fund any unused
General Fund contributions leftover in the Capital Projects Funds at the end of fiscal year 2007.

13

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 14 of 40

40.

When Boudreaux made these representations, he knew that part of the $13.1

million, although unspent, was still needed by certain capital projects. Further, he had no
reasonable basis to conclude the remaining portion of that amount was unused and no longer
needed. For example, the $13.1 million transfer came from money from two funding awards the
General Fund had previously made to certain capital projects. In early 2008, prior to the transfer,
Boudreaux had asked the City’s former Assistant Director of Capital Improvement Projects
(“Assistant CIP Director”) to research the projects to which the General Fund dollars were
allocated and the projects’ unspent balances. In March 2008, the City’s Assistant CIP Director
provided Boudreaux her analysis showing only about $900,000 out of approximately $5.1
million was in fact unused and no longer needed for future expenditures for ongoing projects.
41.

Boudreaux disregarded her analysis and did not request further information or

analysis about the other relevant capital projects funded from the second award from the General
Fund. Instead, he left the approximate $900,000 not needed in the Capital Projects Funds and
requested the transfer of $13.1 million (comprised of the additional $4.2 million from the award
the Assistant CIP Director had analyzed plus $8.9 million from the second award) to the General
Fund. This money was still needed for capital projects.
42.

The City ultimately recorded the $13.1 million transfer in a post-closing journal

entry (manually recorded subsequent to the closing of the City’s books for the month of
September 30, 2007). This transfer resulted in a 34% reduction of the deficit (or decrease in the
General Fund’s balance) in fiscal year 2007, thereby resulting in a 15% increase in the General
Fund ending balance. As a result, the City was able to meet its General Fund balance target of
$100 million, reporting a fund balance of approximately $100.5 million in its 2007 CAFR.

14

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 15 of 40

43.

Although $13.1 million was transferred from the Capital Projects Fund, the

budgets for the affected capital projects were not adjusted as they should have been to remove
the funding from the projects. In fact, the Budget Department did not request that the City
Commission remove the funding from the City’s budget for the affected capital projects. Nor did
the City replace the transferred funds with funds from other eligible capital funding sources.
Consequently, the affected capital projects began to incur unfunded expenditures.
44.

On May 8, 2008, as part of the process to close-out the City’s 2007 Operating

Budget, Boudreaux presented the 2007 year end budget resolution that included the $13.1
million transfer to the City Commission for approval. During this public City Commission
meeting, Boudreaux falsely described the $13.1 million as “unallocated” General Fund money
that was being moved back to the General Fund from the Capital Projects Funds. During prior
briefings with individual Commissioners, Boudreaux also falsely described the funds as
“unused.” At the time, Boudreaux knew this money consisted of funds that had been previously
allocated to specific ongoing capital projects that still needed this money.
45.

At the public City Commission meeting, Boudreaux highlighted the fact that the

City’s General Fund would close 2007 with a balance of slightly more than the $100 million
target number. The City Commission then approved Boudreaux’s budget amendment, including
the $13.1 million transfer, and closed out the City’s fiscal year 2007 Operating Budget.
46.

When the City Commission closed out the City’s 2007 Budget, it adopted a

resolution that only authorized the transfer of “any excess unrestricted moneys from other funds
to the General Fund provided that those are appropriated moneys which are no longer needed to
implement the original purpose of the appropriation and whose expenditure is not limited to use
for any other specified purpose.” The $13.1 million transfer was contrary to this resolution

15

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 16 of 40

because it involved the transfer of money still needed to implement the original purpose of the
appropriation, whose expenditure was not limited to use for any other specified purpose, and did
not involve “excess” funds.
47.

As discussed more fully below, the City’s 2007 CAFR contained material

misrepresentations and omissions concerning the $13.1 million transfer, including omitting to
disclose the full amount and effect of this transfer on the General Fund’s balance and that the
transfer was comprised of funds that were allocated to specific capital projects that still needed
the money as of the fiscal year end.
2.
48.

$24.4 Million in Transfers to the General Fund in FY 2008

During fiscal year 2008, the City recorded a series of transfers totaling

approximately $24.4 million from the Capital Projects Funds and a Special Revenue Fund to its
General Fund. As with the $13.1 million transfer in 2007, the purpose of these transfers was to
reduce the decline in the General Fund balance and maintain a General Fund balance target of
$100 million. Indeed, had the City not made the transfers in 2008, its General Fund balance
would have fallen below the 20% reserve requirement and, thus, the City would have been in
violation of City law. Notably, the transfers in 2008 resulted in a 78% reduction of the deficit (or
decrease in the General Fund’s balance) in fiscal year 2008 and a 35% increase in its ending
balance.
a. The $3.1 Million Transfer of Restricted Downtown Development Fees
49.

In October 2008, Boudreaux orchestrated a $3.1 million transfer to the City’s

General Fund from a Special Revenue Fund the City used to account for the proceeds of revenue
sources legally restricted to expenditures relating to specific City economic development and
planning purposes. The $3.1 million transferred to the General Fund consisted entirely of

16

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 17 of 40

restricted downtown development supplemental fees (fees charged to new developments within
downtown Miami pursuant to City Code).
50.

On October 21, 2008, Boudreaux caused this transfer to take place by sending an

email to the Finance Department requesting adjustments to the City’s fiscal year 2008 operating
transfers. An attachment to his email falsely described the $3.1 million transfer as providing for
“indirect costs” incurred in the General Fund relating to downtown development. Further,
Boudreaux did not provide the Finance Department with any supporting documentation for this
transfer. Nonetheless, the Finance Department recorded the $3.1 million transfer to the General
Fund in a journal entry dated as of September 30, 2008, and the City Commission ultimately
approved this transfer as part of the total budget adjustments Boudreaux proposed for fiscal year
2008.
51.

Boudreaux’s justification for this $3.1 million transfer was false. The City had

not incurred any indirect costs in the General Fund relating to downtown development. This
money consisted of restricted downtown development supplemental fees which the City Code
required to be held in a separate account. In addition, Boudreaux failed to provide any legitimate
documentation to support this transfer.
52.

In 2010, after the start of the Commission’s investigation of this matter, the City

performed a reconciliation of all of its Special Revenue Funds and could not find justification or
supporting documentation for this $3.1 million transfer. As with all the transfers Boudreaux
orchestrated, the only purpose for transferring these restricted funds to the General Fund was to
help stem the decrease in the General Fund balance. Significantly, in 2010, the City determined
this transfer was improper and sent $3.1 million back to the Special Revenue Fund from the
General Fund.

b. The $8 Million Transfer of Capital Projects Funds
53.

In November 2008, Boudreaux orchestrated a transfer of $8 million of Capital

Projects Funds to the General Fund. In connection with this transfer, Boudreaux instructed the
City’s Budget Coordinator to send an email to the Finance Department requesting an $8 million
transfer from the Capital Projects Funds to the General Fund. An attachment to the email, which
the Budget Coordinator prepared at Boudreaux’s instruction, falsely described the $8 million
transfer as the return of an “advanced allocation” the General Fund had previously made to the
Capital Projects Funds. Again, Boudreaux did not provide any supporting documentation for
this transfer. Yet, the City posted the $8 million transfer to the General Fund in a journal entry
dated as of September 30, 2008.
54.

As with the transfer discussed above, Boudreaux’s justification for the $8 million

was false.

In late December 2009, the Assistant CIP Director analyzed this and other

questionable transfers from the Capital Projects Funds to the General Fund during 2008. Her
analysis showed there was never any “advanced allocation” of the $8 million from the General
Fund. Her analysis also showed the $8 million consisted of almost all of the money in two
revenue accounts within the Capital Projects Funds as of the end of fiscal year 2008. It further
revealed that a number of capital projects had already incurred expenditures totaling
approximately $8 million against these accounts during fiscal years 2007 and 2008. In fact, the
funds in the two revenue accounts should have been applied to the corresponding capital projects
where the expenditures took place instead of being transferred to the General Fund.
55.

In early 2009, Boudreaux consulted with his staff and the CIP Department about

the propriety of this very same transfer. On March 26, 2009 (the same day the City issued its
2008 CAFR), the Finance Director raised concerns about the 2007 and 2008 transfers and

18

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 19 of 40

Boudreaux requested that the City’s CIP Budget Administrator and the Assistant CIP Director
analyze the accounts from where the $8 million was transferred. The next day, the Assistant CIP
Director gave Boudreaux a detailed chart showing the projects these accounts supported had
already incurred expenditures totaling approximately $8 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2008.
56.

On or about April 14, 2009, Boudreaux emailed the Assistant CIP Director and

the City’s CIP Budget Administrator that the City would have to transfer funds back to the
Capital Projects Funds in fiscal year 2009 to cover shortfalls in these capital projects.
c. The $13.3 Million Transfers of Restricted Impact
and Storm Water Utility Fees
57.

Despite the two transfers discussed above, in December 2008, Boudreaux sent the

Finance Director an email stating the total projected General Fund ending balance for fiscal year
2008 was approximately $91.2 million and that the projected decrease to the General Fund
balance was about $9.2 million. These projections showed the City was again expecting to fall
below its General Fund balance target of $100 million.
58.

Approximately two months later, in February 2009, Boudreaux contacted the

Finance Director about a proposal to make five transfers totaling approximately $20.1 million
from three different Capital Projects Funds to the General Fund. Like the 2007 $13.1 million
transfer, Boudreaux proposed including all five transfers in a post-closing journal entry in fiscal
year 2008.
59.

The first proposed transfer for approximately $6.8 million involved moving

purported “unused” General Fund contributions from the Capital Projects Funds back to the
General Fund.
60.

The second proposed transfer for approximately $8.2 million involved moving

purported “unused” General Fund contributions that had been made to capital projects back to
19

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 20 of 40

the General Fund and “replacing” the funds with restricted impact fees from the City’s Impact
Fee Fund.
61.

Similarly, the three remaining transfers totaling about $5.1 million also involved

“replacing” purported “unused” contributions the General Fund had allegedly provided to three
specific storm sewer projects with the remaining balance in a revenue account held in the City’s
Storm Sewer Fund.
62.

City Code designates the impact fees and storm water utility fees as restricted, and

requires they not be commingled with other funds or revenues of the City. Pursuant to City
Code, developers pay impact fees at the time of building permit issuance to fund capital
improvements needed to address demand for public facilities attributable to new developments.
Storm water utility fees are required to be used exclusively by the City’s Public Works
Department to pay for capital improvements to, and maintenance or operation of, the City’s
storm drainage and sewer system.
63.

After Boudreaux advised the Finance Director of his proposal, the Finance

Director told him she was concerned about the proposed transfers from a budgetary standpoint
because they were only a temporary solution to offset the decrease in the General Fund balance
and would delay action to resolve the problems causing the City to have to use its General Fund
reserves in the first place. She also told Boudreaux she planned to discuss the proposal with the
CFO.
64.

Shortly thereafter, on February 26, 2009, the City Manager met with the CFO,

Finance Director, Boudreaux, and the City’s Treasurer to discuss Boudreaux’s proposed
transfers. The Finance Director again voiced her concerns about the transfers. She also told the
group that although $13.1 million had been transferred to the General Fund in fiscal year 2007,

20

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 21 of 40

the capital projects for which these funds had been set aside had continued to incur expenditures
because the budgets were never adjusted.

Furthermore, she questioned whether the funds

Boudreaux proposed to transfer to the General Fund in fiscal year 2008 would still be needed to
pay for ongoing capital project expenditures in the future.
65.

Above all, the Finance Director remarked that transferring these funds to the

General Fund would be a “shell game” if they were later returned to the Capital Projects Funds
to cover expenses incurred by the affected projects. Even the Treasurer, who had worked at the
City during its financial crisis in the 1990s, described Boudreaux’s proposed transfers as
reminiscent of the questionable fiscal policy that had led to the City’s financial meltdown in the
1990s.
66.

Boudreaux’s five proposed transfers totaling $20.1 million would have almost

completely eliminated the decrease in the General Fund balance for fiscal year 2008 and would
have resulted in an almost zero net change to the General Fund balance for that year. The
Finance Director and the Treasurer both believed that it was unreasonable and unrealistic to
show this General Fund balance given the severity of the economic downturn at the time.
Besides that, the Finance Director, and the Treasurer also strongly objected to Boudreaux’s
proposed transfer of the $6.8 million because, unlike the other four proposed transfers, it did not
involve “replacing” unused General Fund contributions made to capital projects with other
funds.
67.

Boudreaux later decided to exclude the $6.8 million transfer from the final

proposal, leaving the four remaining transfers totaling approximately $13.3 million.
68.

Significantly, had Boudreaux included the first proposed transfer of $6.8 million,

the City would have again just met its $100 million General Fund balance target for 2008.

21

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 22 of 40

69.

On March 12, 2009, the City Commission approved the $13.3 million transfer

following a brief presentation by Boudreaux at a Commission meeting to close out the City’s
fiscal year 2008 Operating Budget. As in the previous year, during briefings with individual City
Commissioners, Boudreaux falsely described the $13.3 million as “unused” General Fund dollars
that were being returned to the General Fund. At the City Commission meeting, the Commission
Chair actually commented on the relative health of the City’s General Fund balance.
70.

As in the prior year, in closing out the City’s 2008 budget, the City Commission

adopted a resolution that only authorized the transfer of “any excess unrestricted moneys from
other funds to the General Fund provided that those are appropriated moneys which are no
longer needed to implement the original purpose of the appropriation and whose expenditure is
not limited to use for any other specified purpose.” The 2008 transfers were contrary to this
City’s resolution because they involved the transfer of money still needed to implement the
original purpose of the appropriation and whose expenditure was not limited to use for any other
specified purpose. The transfers also did not involve “excess” funds, and some of the transfers
included restricted funds.
71.

The next day, Boudreaux gave the Finance Director a written request, with

including supporting documentation, for a journal entry to make the four transfers totaling $13.3
million from the Capital Projects Funds to the General Fund. Boudreaux’s request stated these
were “unused” General Fund contributions being sent back to the General Fund.
72.

The City Manager approved the $13.3 million transfers based on Boudreaux’s

misrepresentation that the funds being transferred back to the General Fund were unused General
Fund contributions.

22

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 23 of 40

73.

However, as further discussed above, $8.2 million of the money transferred to the

General Fund consisted of restricted impact fees rather than unused General Fund contributions.
Furthermore, these restricted impact fees had already been allocated to specific eligible capital
projects and were not available at the time of the transfer to the General Fund. In fact, specific
capital projects had already spent $2.7 million of these funds.
74.

Furthermore, the $8.2 million in restricted impact fees was actually recorded and

transferred to the General Fund directly from the Impact Fee Fund, a fund specifically created to
segregate and maintain these restricted fees. This transfer was recorded based on the journal
entry that Boudreaux provided to Finance Director.
75.

The remaining $5.1 million transferred to the General Fund from the three storm

sewer projects also did not consist of unused contributions from the General Fund. In fact, the
three storm sewer projects in question never received General Fund contributions in the first
place. Instead, the storm sewer projects received restricted storm water utility fees.
76.

Furthermore, the storm water utility fees collected by the City had been accounted

for in the General Fund, contrary to City Code that required the City to collect and account for
these restricted fees in a Special Revenue Fund. Strangely enough, the City had a Storm Water
Utility Special Revenue Fund, a fund specifically created to account for these restricted fees, but
had not used this Special Revenue Fund since 2002, which was a violation of City law.
77.

In short, the $5.1 million transferred to the General Fund in 2008 from these three

storm sewer projects consisted of restricted storm water utility fees. Furthermore, contrary to
Boudreaux’s representations, the revenue account did not have the available funds to “replace”
the $5.1 million that was sent to the General Fund because the money held in that account was
already earmarked for other ongoing capital projects.

The Transfers had a Material Impact on the City’s General Fund

The transfers in 2007 and 2008 materially impacted the General Fund. The

following chart sets forth the General Fund’s ending balances as reported in fiscal years 2007
and 2008 and the impact that the 2007 and 2008 transfers had on the General Fund’s balances for
those years:

$89,250,880

The $13.1 million transfer in fiscal year 2007 resulted in a 34% reduction of the

deficit (or decrease in the General Fund’s balance) from $38.9 million to $25.8 million in fiscal
year 2007, thereby resulting in a 15% increase of the General Fund ending balance from $87.4
million to $100.5 million. Thus, the City met its General Fund balance target of $100 million,
reporting a balance of approximately $100.5 million in its 2007 CAFR.
80.

Similarly, the $24.4 million in transfers in fiscal year 2008 resulted in a 78%

reduction of the deficit (or decrease in the General Fund’s balance) from $31.2 million to $6.8
24

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 25 of 40

million in fiscal year 2008, and a 35% increase of its ending balance from $69.2 million to $93.6
million.
81.

If the City had not transferred the $24.4 million in 2008, its General Fund balance

would have fallen below the 20% reserve required by law, and the City Commission would have
been required by law to adopt a plan to replenish the reserves back to the required threshold
within two fiscal years.
82.

The impact of the transfers on the General Fund and their obfuscation of the

City’s failing finances were not lost on the Finance Director and others in senior management at
the City. In a March 2009 email to Boudreaux, the City Manager, the CFO, the Treasurer, and
the Assistant City Manager, the Finance Director documented her concerns that the transfers
would “mask the complete loss” sustained by the General Fund during fiscal year 2008. To
underscore the seriousness of her concerns, the Finance Director wrote:
As originally stated at the [February 26, 2009] meeting, I do not believe it is
fiscally prudent or financially responsible to mask the loss in the General Fund
for FY 2008 with these journals. I believe that the position of the City in
today’s economic times should be one of conservatism. Returning the funds to
the General Fund is a ‘one-time’ solution that does not address the issues that
caused the deficit to begin with; it is also reminiscent of the practices of the
1990’s which led to financial crisis. Without showing the full loss (i.e., losses
prior to the entry), I believe the urgency of the elected officials to make changes
and address the causes of said deficits will be diffused.
83.

Although, the Finance Director also questioned whether the $13.1 million transfer

in 2007 actually consisted of unused General Fund contributions as Boudreaux previously
claimed, the City Manager ultimately authorized the $13.3 million transfer in 2008. The City
Manager did so, because Boudreaux had repeatedly falsely assured him and others that the funds
were unused General Fund contributions that could properly be returned to the General Fund.

F.

Misrepresentations and Omissions in the City’s Public Disclosure Documents
Concerning its General Fund and the Transfers
1. The 2007 CAFR

84.

The City made material misrepresentations and omissions in its 2007 CAFR

concerning the $13.1 million transfer. Specifically, the MD&A section of the City’s 2007 CAFR
contain two vague references to the 2007 transfer and its impact on the General Fund. In
drafting the misleading disclosures, the City used and relied on information Boudreaux provided.
The numbers for the charts regarding the transfers included in the 2007 CAFR were provided by
Boudreaux. Boudreaux also proposed the 2007 transfer and made the journal request.
85.

First, the “General Fund Budgetary Highlights” section of the MD&A stated that

“[n]on-Departmental experienced a positive variance against the budget of $7,282,947 as a result
of contributions from the Capital Improvement Fund not expended in fiscal year 2007, returned
to the General Fund.”
86.

Second, the “Financial Analysis of the City’s Funds” section of the MD&A

contained the following statement:
The General Fund’s fund balance decreased by $25,806,369 during the
current fiscal year. Key factors in this decrease are: … net effect of various
inflows and outflows during the fiscal year.
87.

These statements were misleading and omitted material facts because they did not

disclose the full amount or effect of the $13.1 million transfer to the General Fund’s budget and
its fund balance. Nor did they disclose the fact that the fiscal year 2007 transfer included funds
that although not expended, were allocated to specific capital projects that still needed those
funds. The disclosures also omitted the fact that the budget for Capital Projects Funds had not
been adjusted to show that $13.1 million had been transferred out of the Capital Projects Funds.

26

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 27 of 40

88.

Furthermore, the disclosures did not comport with Governmental GAAP

(Government Accounting Standards Board “GASB" (Statement 34, par. 11(d)), which states that
the MD&A should provide an analysis of “significant changes in fund balances” and “whether
restrictions, commitments, or other limitations significantly affect the availability of fund
resources for future use.” Indeed, the MD&A section of the City’s 2007 CAFR omitted any
analysis of the change to the General Fund balance resulting from the $13.1 million transfer or
disclosure of the fact that this money was already allocated to capital projects that still needed
the funds.
89.

The City’s disclosures in its 2007 financial statements were also deficient. For

instance, the City included in its 2007 CAFR a boilerplate footnote to its financial statements
entitled “Inter-fund Receivables, Payables, and Transfers” that also omitted material facts.
Although the $13.1 million transfer was listed in a chart included in this footnote, the footnote
was void of any description or details about the transfer or its impact on the General Fund.
90.

Above all, the footnote omitted certain information required by Governmental

GAAP (GASB Statement 38, par. 15), which provides that governments should disclose in the
notes to the financial statements, among other details, the intended purpose and the amount of
significant transfers that meet either or both of the following criteria: (i) do not occur on a
routine basis and/or (ii) are inconsistent with the activities of the fund making the transfer – for
example, a transfer from a capital projects fund to the General Fund. The footnote omitted
disclosure of the intended purpose of the $13.1 million transfer, namely, to offset the decline in
the General Fund balance and to maintain a General Fund balance target of $100 million.

27

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 28 of 40

2. The 2008 CAFR and 2009 Official Statements
91.

The City’s 2008 CAFR also contained material misrepresentations and omissions

concerning the $24.4 million transfer to the General Fund in fiscal year 2008. In drafting the
misleading disclosures, the City used and relied on information Boudreaux provided.
92.

In the “Financial Analysis of the City’s Funds” section of the MD&A, the City

made the following false and misleading statement about $21.3 million of the $24.4 million
transferred to the General Fund in fiscal year 2008 (the difference being the $3.1 million transfer
of downtown Miami development fees):
The General Fund’s fund balance had a net decrease of $6,872,696 during
the current fiscal year. The decrease in the General Fund’s fund balance was
off-set by approximately $21.3 million of transfers from the capital projects
funds which were unused appropriations that were initially funded from the
general fund in prior years.
93.

The “General Fund Budgetary Highlights” section of MD&A contained a similar

description of the transfers. These statements were false and misleading. As discussed more
fully above, $8.2 million transferred from the Capital Projects Funds were restricted impact fees
rather than “unused appropriations that were initially funded” from the General Fund. Another
$5.1 million transferred from the Capital Projects Funds were never funded with General Fund
contributions, but rather with restricted storm water utility fees. Moreover, another $8 million
transferred from the Capital Projects Funds did not originate from the General Fund but instead
from two revenue accounts within the Capital Projects Funds. This $8 million amount was also
in fact not “unused” because the money was already spent by capital projects at the time of the
transfer to the General Fund.
94.

These disclosures also omitted the fact that the General Fund’s balance was

further increased by the improper $3.1 million transfer of restricted downtown development

28

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 29 of 40

supplemental fees, as discussed more fully above. Finally, the City omitted to disclose that
capital projects impacted by the fiscal year 2007 transfer continued after the funding was
removed to incur unfunded expenditures and deficits.
95.

For the same reasons discussed above, the boilerplate footnote to the City’s 2008

financial statements did not comply with GASB Statement 38, and was otherwise misleading and
omitted material facts about the inter-fund transfers in fiscal year 2008.
96.

The Official Statements for the May, July, and December 2009 bond offerings

contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions because they included the
MD&A section of the City’s 2008 CAFR.
97.

Additionally, the Official Statement for the July 2009 bond offering omitted to

disclose in a “Management Discussion and Budget Finances” section that certain capital projects
impacted by prior year transfers continued to incur unfunded expenditures and deficits, and that
the City expected that the General Fund would have to transfer funds to the Capital Projects
Funds to offset these project deficits.
98.

In addition, the City’s fiscal year 2008 financial statements and the 2008 CAFR,

which were contained in the Official Statements, were also materially misstated because of the
transfer of the restricted money to the General Fund. In particular, the City’s General Fund
financial statements were misstated because of the transfers of the $3.1 million restricted
downtown development fees, $8.2 million restricted impact fees, and $5.1 million restricted
storm water utility fees, to the General Fund. These transfers of restricted fees to the General
Fund totaling $16.4 million resulted in an overstatement of transfers in to the General Fund of
27% (from $60.4 million to $76.8 million), a reduction of the deficit in the General Fund of 70%
(from $23.2 million to $6.8 million), and an overstatement of the General Fund ending fund

29

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 30 of 40

balance of 21% (from $77.2 million to $93.6 million) in the City’s fiscal year 2008 General Fund
financial statements.
99.

Furthermore, pursuant to Governmental GAAP, these legally restricted funds

should have been properly accounted for separately from the General Fund in the other
respective funds established by the City for those designated purposes.
100.

Specifically, Governmental GAAP (NCGA Statement 1) states the diverse nature

of governmental operations and the necessity of assuring legal compliance preclude recording
and summarizing all governmental financial transactions and balances in a single accounting
entity. It furthermore states that unlike a private business, a governmental unit is accounted for
through several separate fund entities each having a separate set of accounts and functioning
independently.
101.

Finally, Governmental GAAP (GASB Statement 34) also provides that

governments should report governmental funds in their fund financial statements to the extent
they have activities that meet the criteria for using those funds. Therefore, under GAAP, the $3.1
million restricted downtown development fees should have been accounted for in the City’s
Special Revenue Fund. Similarly, the $8.2 million restricted impact fees should have been
accounted for in the City’s Impact Fee Capital Projects Fund. And, the $5.1 million restricted
storm water utility fees should have been accounted for in the City’s Storm Sewer Capital
Projects Fund.
G.

Misrepresentations to the Rating Agencies by the Defendants

102.

Boudreaux and the City made material misrepresentations and omissions to

Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch, the rating agencies that rated the City’s 2009 bonds.
In a slide presentation to the rating agencies during the last week of April 2009, Boudreaux

30

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 31 of 40

represented the City was projecting an operating deficit of only $15.6 million in the General
Fund for fiscal year 2009. This statement was false and misleading because it omitted to
disclose that the City would have to transfer money from the General Fund back to the Capital
Projects Funds in 2009 to cover shortfalls in capital projects resulting from transfers that were
made in fiscal years 2007 and 2008.
103.

Boudreaux made additional materially false and misleading statements to

Moody’s when he sent an email to Moody’s stating that “[t]he reason for the increase in transfers
in FY 2008 was due to the return of prior year General Fund contributions from the Capital
Fund.” This email, which Boudreaux sent in response to a question from Moody’s, was false
and misleading because these funds never originated from the General Fund. Furthermore,
Boudreaux omitted to disclose in this email that the funds transferred in fiscal year 2008
included dollars restricted by City Code for designated purposes, and consisted of money taken
from specific capital projects that had already incurred expenditures against those funds or still
needed them.
H.

Details of the Transfers are Revealed and Funds are Sent Back From the
General Fund to Capital Projects and Special Revenue Funds

104.

In November 2009, after conducting its annual review of the City’s compliance

with its Financial Integrity Principles adopted as law following its last fiscal crisis in the 1990s,
the City’s Office of Independent Auditor General (“OIAG”) issued a report in which it made
several findings concerning (a) the $13.1 million transferred from the Capital Projects Funds in
fiscal year 2007; and (b) the $13.3 million transfers relating to the impact fees and storm sewer
projects transferred from the Capital Projects Funds in fiscal year 2008.
105.

For example, the OIAG found that management’s representation to the City

Commission that the funds taken from the Capital Projects Funds were “unused” General Fund
31

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 32 of 40

contributions was inaccurate and misleading because there were already large shortages in
capital project funding. The OIAG also determined that the $8.2 million transferred from the
Impact Fee Fund to the General Fund in 2008 consisted of restricted impact fees and not General
Fund contributions. The OIAG concluded that these transfers were used to increase the General
Fund balance reserves and noted they resulted in a 15% and 16.5% increase in the General Fund
balance reserves for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, respectively
106.

In March 2010, during the preparation of the City’s 2009 CAFR, the City

transferred approximately $17.2 million from the General Fund back to its Capital Projects
Funds to fund the shortfall in the Capital Projects Funds. This amount included the shortfall
resulting from the $13.1 million transferred in fiscal year 2007 and the $8 million transferred in
fiscal year 2008.
107.

Additionally, the City reversed the $8.2 million transfer of the impact fees and

returned the fees from the General Fund back to the Capital Projects Funds. These transfers
totaling $25.4 million decreased the General Fund balance by 27% in fiscal year 2009. They
were reflected in the City’s 2009 CAFR, issued in April 2010 and described in that CAFR as
money transferred from the General Fund to the Capital Projects Funds “to cover capital project
expenditures which continued to spend after funding had been removed.” Finally, in November
2010, the City determined the $3.1 million transfer of restricted downtown development fees was
also improper. During the preparation of its 2010 CAFR, the City transferred this money back
from the General Fund to the Special Revenue Fund.
108.

In June and July 2010, about three months after the City issued its 2009 CAFR

disclosing the transfers back to the Capital Projects Funds, Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, and
Fitch all lowered their ratings on the City’s general obligation bonds and issued a negative

ratings outlook. In addition, S&P downgraded the City’s May 2009 and July 2009 bonds and
Fitch downgraded the May 2009 bonds.

All three ratings agencies cited the deteriorating

condition of the City’s General Fund as a major reason for the ratings downgrade.
109.

More importantly, the rating agencies each reported that the reversals from the

General Fund back to the Capital Projects Funds contributed to the deteriorating condition of the
City’s General Fund. For example, Standard and Poor’s reported the following in its June 2010
ratings downgrade:
The city, which is currently subject to an SEC inquiry over the use of capital
funds and impact fees, had transferred $28.3 million in capital funds over
two years that it did not expect to use for capital projects to balance its 2007
and 2008 budgets. Although the funds were transferred to the general fund
to close the budget gap, the city still incurred capital expenditures associated
with the projects for which these funds were originally budgeted, leaving the
capital funds with a $20 million dollar funding shortfall. In fiscal 2009,
management decided to reverse the $28.3 million transfer, re-establishing
the funds to the capital fund and increasing the general fund’s operating
deficit by that amount. The city’s total general fund balance declined from
$93.57 million to $39.97 million.
110.

In June 2011, Standard and Poor’s once again lowered its ratings on the City’s

bonds, stating the downgrade was based on its view of the “continued pressure on the city’s
finances as evidenced by continuing operating deficits, structurally unbalanced budgets, and low
reserves.” According to Standard and Poor’s, the outlook on the City’s bonds remains negative.
111.

Through the misconduct discussed in this Complaint, the City, acting through

Boudreaux and others, obtained property and money. For example, the City obtained investors’
money and deprived investors of a property interest by having them pay money in exchange for
the City’s bonds.

I.

Boudreaux’s Integral Role in the Fraud

112.

Boudreaux was the architect of the scheme to defraud. First, he devised all the

transfers discussed above, including the transfers of restricted funds to the General Fund.
Second, between 2008 and 2009, he misrepresented the true nature of the $13.1 million and
$13.3 million transfers to City Commission during public meetings, in briefings with individual
City Commissions and their staff, to the City’s external auditors, and to others in senior
management at the City. Third, he falsified the justification of the $8 million and $3.1 million
transfers in the city’s internal records. Fourth, he made false representations to third parties,
such as the rating agencies. Finally, during the audit of the City’s 2008 financial statements,
Boudreaux continued to misrepresent the true nature of the $13.1 million transfer in 2007, even
after he was challenged by others at the City about the transfer. At the time Boudreaux engaged
in this scheme to defraud he knew his misconduct would lead to false and misleading disclosures
about the General Fund and adversely affect the City’s financial statements relied on by
purchasers of the City’s previously-issued debt and new debt.
113.

Moreover, Boudreaux furnished information that was materially false and

misleading that was incorporated into the City’s filings. For example, he supplied budget
information, including the closeout budget, which he knew would be relied on in preparing the
CAFRs.
114.

By no later than January 31, 2008, Boudreaux took on the additional

responsibilities of assisting the Capital Improvement Department in preparing overall capital
budget and updates to the Multi-Year Capital Plan, including a comprehensive review of
allocation needs and status of capital projects, providing fiscal monitoring of capital budgets to

34

Case 1:13-cv-22600-CMA Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/19/2013 Page 35 of 40

include determination of funds availability, and monitoring actual expenditures to ensure they
did not exceed budget appropriations.
115.

Boudreaux devised the transfer proposals knowing the relationship of the General

Fund balance to favorable ratings for the City. In a revenue manual, he wrote, “Fiscal year 2006
is the last audited year and fiscal years 2007 and [2008] are anticipated to maintain the City’s
general fund balance above 100 million. As a result of this responsible fiscal management it has
an opportunity to see positive bond ratings on City issued debt with favorable interest rates.”
Boudreaux devised the transfers discussed above for the purpose of helping the City obtain
positive bond ratings in furtherance of a scheme to defraud investors in the City’s bonds.
