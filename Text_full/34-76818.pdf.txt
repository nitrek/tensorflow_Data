ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Vivian S. Shields (“Shields” or “Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents
to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and Desist Order
(“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
Summary
1.
These proceedings arise out of insider trading by Shields. From May 29, 2012 to
June 6, 2012, Shields purchased 12,600 shares of J. Alexander’s Corporation (“J. Alexander’s”)
stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information relating to what was ultimately a
tender offer for J. Alexander’s by Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (the “Tender Offer”). Shields
indirectly acquired the information from a J. Alexander’s employee. On July 18, 2012, Shields
sold 1,000 shares of her J. Alexander’s stock and tendered the remainder of her holdings in midSeptember 2012. In all, she realized a profit of $71,401.12.

Nashville, Tennessee. J. Alexander’s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant
to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol
“JAX.” J. Alexander’s is a restaurant chain.

Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (“Fidelity”) is a Delaware Corporation that is
headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. Fidelity is a Fortune 500 company that provides title

across other industries, including the restaurant industry.
Background
5.
On April 17, 2012, Fidelity proposed to J. Alexander’s a tender offer for 50.1% of
J. Alexander’s common stock at $12.00 per share, as well as a special dividend of $3.00 on each
remaining share. Based on this offer, the Board of J. Alexander’s entered into a 30-day
exclusivity agreement with Fidelity beginning on April 18, 2012.
6.
On April 26, 2012, J. Alexander’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board met with Fidelity’s Executive Chairman and Executive Vice President of Corporate
Finance to discuss a tender offer.

7.
From April 27, 2012 to May 2, 2012, senior managers from J. Alexander’s, J.
Alexander’s counsel and investment bankers met and had multiple conversations with Fidelity
and its counsel and investment bankers regarding the structure of the offer.
8.
While on a vacation with Shields, on May 18, 2012, a J. Alexander’s employee
(“JAX Employee”) learned of the Tender Offer. During that vacation, Shields indirectly
acquired material, nonpublic information relating to what was ultimately a tender offer for J.
Alexander’s from the JAX Employee.
9.
On May 29, 2012, June 1, 2012, and June 6, 2012, while in possession of
material, nonpublic information about the Tender Offer, Shields purchased an aggregate of
12,600 shares of J. Alexander’s stock.
10.
On June 25, 2012, J. Alexander’s issued a press release announcing Fidelity’s
acquisition of J. Alexander’s.
11.
On July 18, 2012, Shields sold 1,000 shares of her J. Alexander’s stock and
tendered the remainder of her holdings in September 2012. In total, Shields realized a profit of
$71,401.12.
12.
Shields’ conduct described above violated Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14e-3 thereunder, prohibiting her trading while in possession of what she knew or had
reason to know was material nonpublic information that was acquired directly or indirectly from
someone working on behalf of the offeror or target of a tender offer.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Shields’ Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Shields cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder.
B.
Respondents shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement of
$71,401.12, prejudgment interest of $5,724.46, and a civil penalty in the amount of $71,401.12 to
the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States
Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional
interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and/or 31 U.S.C. § 3717. Payment must
be made in one of the following ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;
3

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3)

Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying

the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to William P. Hicks, Division of
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 950 East Paces Ferry Road, NE, Suite 500,
Atlanta, Georgia 30326-1382.
C.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, she shall not argue that she is entitled to, nor shall she benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that she shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.

V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

By the Commission.
