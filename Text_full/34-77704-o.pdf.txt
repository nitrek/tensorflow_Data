Valentine Beauty Inc.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of Valentine Beauty Inc. (“VLBI”) because of
concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace and suspicious
market activity relating to VLBI common stock. VLBI is a Nevada corporation with its principal
place of business located in Sunrise, Florida. Its stock is quoted on OTC Link, operated by OTC
Markets Group Inc., under the ticker: VLBI.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on April 26, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 9, 2016.
By the Commission.
