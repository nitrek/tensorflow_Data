ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

In the Matter of
KEY ENERGY
SERVICES, INC.,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Key Energy Services, Inc. (“Key
Energy” or “Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Key Energy has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for
the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of
these proceedings, which are admitted, Key Energy consents to the entry of this Order
Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth
below.
1

III.
On the basis of this Order and Key Energy’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
1.
These proceedings arise from violations of the books and records and internal
control provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”) [15 U.S.C. §
78m(b)(2)] by Respondent Key Energy. From August 2010 through at least April 2013, Key
Energy’s Mexican subsidiary (“Key Mexico”) made improper payments to a contract
employee at Petróleos Mexicanos (“Pemex”), the Mexican state-owned oil company, to
induce him to provide Pemex inside information as well as advice and assistance on
contracts with Pemex and amplifications or amendments to those contracts. These funds
were transferred to the Pemex employee via an entity that provided purported consulting
services to Key Mexico (the “Consulting Firm”) despite the absence of appropriate
authorization of the relationship with the Consulting Firm and lack of supporting
documentation regarding the purported consulting work performed.
2.
Key Mexico improperly recorded the transfers to the Consulting Firm as
legitimate business expenses in Key Mexico’s books and records. Key Mexico’s books and
records were consolidated into Key Energy’s books and records. During the relevant
period, Key Energy failed to implement and maintain sufficient internal controls including
within Key Mexico relating to interactions with Pemex officials and failed to respond to
indicia of risk relating to Key Mexico’s improper use of consultants.
Respondent and Related Entities
3.
Key Energy is a Maryland corporation with its headquarters in Houston, TX.
The company’s common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed on
the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: KEG). Key Energy and its various subsidiaries provide
rig-based well-services. On September 4, 2015, Key Energy announced that for 30 consecutive
trading days the price for Key's common shares was below the minimum $1.00 per share
requirement for continued listing on the NYSE. Key Energy’s common shares have continued to
trade below $1.00 since that time. Between December 2014 and October 2015, Moody’s
downgraded Key Energy’s bonds three times and changed its outlook to “negative.”
4.
Key Mexico consists of two legal entities: an operating company, Key Energy
Services de Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V., and a service payroll company, Recursos Omega S. de
R.L. de C.V., which is the legal employer of Key Energy’s employees in Mexico. Both are
Mexican entities and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Key Energy. Key Mexico was
formed to service wells owned by Pemex. It currently has one remaining contract with Pemex,
which expires in October 2016. Throughout the relevant time period, Key Mexico’s financial
results were included in the consolidated financial statements that Key Energy filed with the
Commission. Key Mexico provides rig-based services such as maintenance, workover, and

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other person
or entity in this or any other proceeding.

recompletion of existing wells, completion of newly-drilled wells, and plugging and
abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives.
Facts
Key Energy’s Business in Mexico
5.
In 2004, Key Energy began taking steps to enter the Mexican market. In 2007,
Pemex awarded Key Mexico its first contract in Mexico, and subsequently awarded the
company additional contracts and contract extensions. Both Key Energy and Key Mexico
officers and employees were involved in Key Mexico’s obtaining of Pemex business. From
2010 through 2013, Mexico accounted for 3.5%-10% of Key Energy’s annual consolidated
revenue. In April 2015, Key Energy announced that it was winding down its international
business outside of North America, and intends to exit Mexico once its current contractual
obligations to Pemex are complete.
Contact between Key Mexico and the Consulting Firm
6.
In 2008, Pemex announced a call for bids on a public tender for Contract
Number 424048861 (“Contract No. 8861”), through which Pemex sought field production
solutions and well workover services in its North Region. Key Mexico competed against three
other bidders as part of a public tender and was awarded Contract No. 8861. Contract No. 8861
was signed on September 26, 2008. The initial contract was for a 24-month term and provided
for Key Mexico to be paid $65 million. The contract term and amount were subsequently
increased through a series of amendments or “amplifications.”
7.
In or around August 2010, Key Mexico hired the Consulting Firm to “provide
expert advice on contracts with . . . Pemex,” including Contract No. 8861. The hiring of the
Consulting Firm was arranged and approved by the Key Mexico country manager. Although
the country manager knew that the Consulting Firm had ties to the Pemex employee and that
payments to the Consulting Firm were used to funnel Key Mexico funds to the Pemex employee
in exchange for his assistance with obtaining Pemex business, the country manager never
disclosed the nature of this relationship to Key Energy.
8.
The Pemex employee was employed in the department that negotiated and
approved Key Mexico’s contracts with Pemex. Over a period of three years, the Key Mexico
country manager approved payments to the Consulting Firm with ties to the Pemex employee in
exchange for the employee providing assistance to Key Mexico in bidding for and obtaining
amendments to contracts with Pemex, including providing Key Mexico with non-public
information about upcoming Pemex tenders and lobbying internally at Pemex for lucrative
amendments to Key Mexico contracts with Pemex. Some of the communications were sent
from the Pemex employee’s official Pemex email account and some from a personal email
account. From 2010 through at least 2013, Key Mexico paid the Consulting Firm tied to the
Pemex employee at least $229,000 for purported consulting services.

3

9.
While Key Energy personnel eventually became aware at least as early as 2011
that Key Mexico was doing business with the Consulting Firm, Key Energy allowed Key
Mexico to continue using the vendor even though Key Mexico did not enter into a written
agreement or contract with the Consulting Firm until 2013. Moreover, Key Energy and Key
Mexico failed to conduct due diligence on the Consulting Firm, despite Key Energy policies
requiring that such due diligence be performed. As a result, Key Energy did not uncover the
Consulting Firm’s relationship to the Pemex employee until 2014, when Key Energy began an
investigation into other allegations concerning the country manager.
The Amendment to Contract No. 8861
10.
In 2011, Key Mexico continued performing under Contract No. 8861. On
February 15, 2011, the Pemex employee, from his official Pemex email account, forwarded the
Key Mexico country manager an internal chain of emails among Pemex officials writing “I am
sending you this for your information and so we are ready.” The attachments to the email string
included Pemex internal memoranda concerning certain new contracts that Pemex intended to
put out for tender.
11.
At that time, Pemex’s plan to put out the tenders on the new contracts had not
yet been publicly announced. However, it is clear that Key Energy and Key Mexico had already
learned of the forthcoming tenders. Upon receiving the email from the Pemex employee, Key
Mexico’s country manager forwarded it to Houston, to Key Energy employees including a
senior vice president, writing “The tenders are coming now.” It was clear from the e-mail that it
contained detail of internal Pemex deliberations, but the recipients at Key Energy apparently did
not question how or why the country manager was in possession of and sharing such
communications. Rather, after discussing the potential new contracts that had been flagged by
the Pemex employee, the senior vice president wrote, “Why don’t we convince them to add 90
million to the current package?” The “current package” was the existing contract, Contract No.
8861. The country manager suggested scheduling a conference call with the senior vice
president to discuss the matter further.
12.
One week later, on February 23, the Pemex employee, again from his Pemex
e-mail account, forwarded the Key Mexico country manager an unexecuted internal Pemex
memo, under which Pemex personnel recommended an increase of $60 million to the funds
available to pay Key Mexico under Contract No. 8861. The Pemex employee wrote in the cover
e-mail to the country manager: “I am sending this to you so you can see I am working.”
13.
On March 24, 2011, a little more than a month later, Key Mexico and Pemex
executed an amendment to Contract No. 8861 increasing the contract amount by approximately
an additional $60 million.
14.
The Pemex employee, through the Consulting Firm, continued to provide Key
Mexico with assistance and information in connection with Contract No. 8861 and with bids for
and execution of other contracts with Pemex through at least 2013.

The Payments to the Pemex Employee and the Consulting Firm
15.
Starting in August 2010, Key Mexico paid the Consulting Firm a monthly
consulting fee of approximately $4,500. This amount was increased to approximately $8,000 a
month in July 2011, after Key Mexico obtained an additional contract with Pemex. Between
August 16, 2010 and May 7, 2014, Key Mexico made 58 payments to the Consulting Firm
totaling approximately $561,000. Of that amount, at least $229,000 were payments made
through April 2013 in connection with consulting services that were described in Key Mexico’s
accounting system as “Expert advice on contracts with the new regulations of
Pemex/Preparation of technical and economic proposals/Contract Execution.” In addition, the
Pemex official received four wire transfers directly to his personal bank accounts from the
personal bank account of Key Mexico’s country manager totaling approximately $6,400.
16.
There is no record that the Pemex employee or the Consulting Firm provided
any legitimate consulting services for Key Mexico. Instead, the Consulting Firm was used as a
conduit through which the Pemex employee received payment from Key Mexico.
17.

The country manager resigned from Key Mexico in February 2014.

Key Energy’s FCPA Related Policies and Internal Accounting Controls - Lax
Internal Controls
18.
During the relevant period, Key Energy had various written compliance policies,
including a Code of Conduct, an FCPA Compliance Manual (which included an FCPA Policy
and an FCPA Procedure), and a Procurement Policy. But despite having a compliance program
on paper, Key Energy failed to implement accounting controls in its Mexico subsidiary
sufficient to prevent improper payments to a vendor with ties to a Pemex employee. At some
point during the course of the payments to the Consulting Firm Key Energy’s then legal
department became aware of the relationship with the Consulting Firm (but not the Consulting
Firm’s connection to the Pemex employee). Although the consulting arrangement with the
Consulting Firm violated Key Energy compliance policies because it had been entered without
pre-approval from Key Energy legal, because no due diligence had been conducted on the
Consulting Firm and because no written contract had been entered with the firm, Key Energy
allowed the relationship and payments to continue, and Key Mexico allowed payment of the
invoices from the Consulting Firm despite a lack of sufficient documentation supporting the
purported services and the ties between the Consulting Firm and the Pemex employee.
19.
In addition to failing to respond to various indicia of risk concerning the
relationship with the Consulting Firm tied to the Pemex employee, Key Energy also failed to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that transactions were executed in accordance with management’s general or specific
authorization and recorded as necessary to maintain accountability of assets by failing to
respond effectively to signs indicating that gifts provided by Key Mexico to Pemex officials
were being given as rewards for providing Key Mexico with increased business that year.
Specifically, in 2012, Key Energy approved Key Mexico’s contribution of gifts totaling
approximately $118,000 to Pemex’s annual Christmas season celebration with the
understanding that the gifts were to be intended for a raffle. However, employees of Key
5

Mexico did not disclose to Key Energy that Key Mexico planned to give at least $55,000 of
these gifts to approximately 130 specific Pemex officials working in the regions in which Key
Mexico operated. In approving the gifts Key Energy ignored that the amount spent on approved
gifts was more than nine times what had been spent on purported raffle gifts in 2010 and
approximately 26 times what had been spent in 2011. Key Energy also failed to consider the
implications of the explanation by Key Mexico’s country manager that the higher gift amount in
2012 was correlated to Key Mexico having done more business with Pemex that year. Had Key
Energy sought more information, it may have learned that Key Mexico was providing gifts to
Pemex officials during a period Key Mexico was engaged in ongoing negotiations with Pemex,
including negotiations to obtain additional funding for work required under its contracts with
Pemex.
20.
Key Energy also failed to adequately monitor and supervise the senior
executives at Key Mexico to ensure they complied with and enforced anti-corruption policies
and kept accurate records concerning payments to consultants and gifts to Mexican government
officials. Key Mexico had no independent compliance staff or internal audit function that had
authority to intervene into management decisions and, if appropriate, take remedial actions.
Key Energy also failed to enforce its pre-approval processes for consultants in Mexico, instead
allowing Key Mexico to engage consultants without the required due diligence, pre-approval, or
written contract—even once members of Key Energy’s then legal department became aware
that Key Mexico was using the Consulting Firm. As a result, in many instances, the senior
employees of Key Mexico had unsupervised control over the compliance process; these
employees in turn abused their privileges, approving suspect arrangements with and payments
to consultants and gifts to Mexican government officials at Pemex, and concealing these
arrangments and payments from Key Energy.
Internal Investigation and Remedial Efforts
21.
In or around January 2014, the staff of the Commission contacted Key Energy
with respect to potential FCPA violations by Key Energy. In April 2014, Key Mexico
employees reported to Key Energy information they had received suggesting the recently
resigned country manager had promised bribes to one or more Pemex employees during his
employment with Key Mexico. Upon learning of these allegations, Key Energy reported the
allegations to the staff of the Commission. Thereafter, Key Energy undertook a broad internal
investigation and risk assessment of Key Energy’s international operations. To the extent the
internal investigation identified additional issues of concern, Key Energy provided updates to
the Commission staff.
22.
In conjunction with its internal review and investigation, Key Energy promptly
and simultaneously undertook significant remedial measures including hiring a new Chief
Compliance Officer (“CCO”) who oversaw a renovation and enhancement of Key Energy’s
compliance program. These steps included: (1) the suspension of payments to all vendors and
third parties in Mexico shortly after the independent investigation/internal review began; (2)
the engagement of a manual review of over 600 vendors in Mexico for purposes of clearing
legitimate payments and assessing whether to move forward with those vendors in current and
future operations; (3) reviewing all vendors in use in Russia and Colombia and instituting an
enhanced due diligence procedure for all vendors globally; (4) establishing enhanced financial
6

controls around the procedure-to-pay process in Mexico, Colombia, and Russia including
interim employee certifications requirements, revised vendor onboarding requirements, and
heightened payment approval requirements; (5) implementing a new business opportunities
protocol to help Key Energy legal better understand business risks including the role played by
agents, consultants or other vendors/business partners, so as to enable better assessment of
corruption-related risks in future business opportunities; (6) installing new controllers in the
Colombia and Mexico businesses and more effectively enforcing a solid line reporting
relationship to the U.S. Controller and ultimately the CFO; (7) in-person visits to each
international location by the CCO and others to, among other things, conduct training of all
international employees; and (8) developing and/or reviewing several company policies and
procedures including the Code of Business Conduct, the FCPA and Anti-Corruption policy,
the Travel and Expense policy, and the New Hire Screening Form; and (9) a coordinated
wind-down and exit of all markets outside of North America, and a commitment to exit
Mexico by the end of 2016.
23.
Throughout the process, Key Energy provided cooperation with the staff. In
addition to reporting to the staff after discovering the FCPA allegations relating to Mexico,
Key Energy provided the staff with investigation updates and shared its translations of certain
important documents. These actions assisted the staff in its investigation.
Legal Standards and FCPA Violations
24.
Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a
cease-and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any
provision of the Exchange Act or any regulation thereunder, and upon any other person that is,
was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should
have known would contribute to such violation.
25.
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires every issuer with a class of
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to make and keep books,
records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the issuer. [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A)]
26.
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires such issuers to, among other
things, devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s
general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (II) to maintain
accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management’s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C § 78m(b)(2)(B)]

7

27.
As a result of the conduct described above, Key Energy violated Section
13(b)(2)(A) because its books and records did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the purpose of the payments. These improper payments were falsely recorded as
legitimate business expenses in the books and records of the subsidiary which were consolidated
into Key Energy’s books and records. Accordingly, Key Energy violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
the Exchange Act. As described above, Key Energy also violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act by failing to devise and maintain sufficient accounting controls to prevent and
detect these improper payments.
Commission Consideration of Key Energy’s Cooperation, Remedial Efforts and
Current Financial Condition
28.
In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered cooperation Key
Energy afforded to the Commission staff and the remedial acts undertaken by Key Energy. In
addition, in determining the disgorgement amount and not to impose a penalty, the Commission
has considered Key Energy’s current financial condition and its ability to maintain necessary
cash reserves to fund its operations and meet its liabilities.
