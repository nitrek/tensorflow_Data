Respondents.

ORDER UNDER SECTION 27A(b) OF
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND
SECTION 21E(b) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, GRANTING WAIVERS OF THE
DISQUALIFICATION PROVISIONS
OF SECTION 27A(b)(1)(a)(ii) OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND
SECTION 21E(b)(1)(A)(ii) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934

Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I, Inc., Morgan
Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC (collectively “Morgan Stanley”) have submitted a
letter on behalf of themselves and their affiliates, dated May 2, 2014, for a waiver of the
disqualification provisions of Section 27A(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the
“Securities Act”) and Section 21E(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”) arising from their settlement of cease-and-desist proceedings brought by
the Commission.
On July 24, 2014, the Commission instituted cease-and-desist proceedings against
Morgan Stanley. In the Order Instituting Proceedings (the “Order”), the Commission found
that Morgan Stanley made misleading disclosures regarding the number of current and/or
historical loan delinquencies in two subprime residential mortgage-backed securities
transactions that Morgan Stanley sponsored, issued, and underwrote in 2007. Based on
these allegations, the Commission concluded that Morgan Stanley violated Sections
17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the findings,
Morgan Stanley consented to the entry of the Order requiring them to, among other things,
cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of
Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act.

The safe harbor provisions of Section 27A(c) of the Securities Act and Section
21E(c) of the Exchange Act are not available for any forward looking statement that is
“made with respect to the business or operations of an issuer, if the issuer … during the 3year period preceding the date on which the statement was first made … has been made the
subject of a judicial or administrative decree or order arising out of a government action that
… (II) requires that the issuer cease and desist from violating the antifraud provisions of the
securities laws….” Section 27A(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Securities Act and Section
21E(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act. The disqualifications may be waived “to the extent
otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission.” Section
27A(b) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b) of the Exchange Act.
Based on the representations set forth in Morgan Stanley’s letter, the Commission
has determined that, under the circumstances, the request for a waiver of the
disqualifications resulting from the issuance of the Commission’s Order instituting
proceedings is appropriate and should be granted.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 27A(b) of the Securities Act
and Section 21E(b) of the Exchange Act, that a waiver from the disqualification provisions
of Section 27A(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the
Exchange Act as to Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I, Inc.,
Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC and their present and future affiliates
resulting from the entry of the Order is hereby granted.
By the Commission.
