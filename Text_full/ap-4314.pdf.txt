ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on March 30, 2015. The OIP alleges that Respondents violated the
antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 in their operation of three collateral
loan obligation funds (known as the Zohar Funds) by reporting misleading values for the assets
held by the funds and failing to disclose a conflict of interest arising from Lynn Tilton’s
undisclosed approach to categorization of assets. The proceeding was stayed by order of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit between September 17, 2015, and June 2016. See
Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 291 (2d Cir. 2016); Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103 (2d Cir.), ECF Nos.
76, 125. The hearing commenced on October 24, 2016, and is expected to last two to three
weeks.
Under further consideration is Respondents’ October 17, 2016, Motion to Compel the
Office of Litigation and Administrative Practice to Produce Documents Responsive to
Respondents’ Subpoenas. The Motion to Compel states that Respondents and the Commission’s
Office of Litigation and Administrative Practice (OLAP) held numerous meet and confers to
resolve any privilege assertions, but that OLAP continues to withhold inter-agency
communications that the undersigned had ordered to be released. Ex. 2 of the Declaration of
Mary Beth Maloney attached to the Motion to Compel is a privilege log sent to Respondents on
October 14, 2016. Next to each withheld document is a privilege claim of work product
doctrine, law enforcement privilege, and/or deliberative process privilege. But no particularized
showing as to the applicability of any privilege has been made. OLAP was therefore ordered to
submit the withheld items to the undersigned for in camera review. See Lynn Tilton, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 4274, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3917 (A.L.J. Oct. 18, 2016).
On October 21, 2016, OLAP submitted the withheld documents and a verified
explanation of privileges asserted in its privilege log for in camera review. As the review
progressed, it became clear that the privilege log sent to Respondents on October 14 does not
provide sufficient information to enable Respondents to assess and respond to any claimed
1

privilege. See United States v. Constr. Prods. Research, Inc., 73 F.3d 464, 473-74 (2d Cir. 1996)
(privilege log “contain[ing] a cursory description of each document, the date, author, recipient,
and ‘comments’” with “general allegations of privilege” found deficient). The privilege log’s
subject headings state only whether each document is an “immunity request” or an “investigative
information request.” In at least some instances, a privilege log with greater description of the
nature of documents, without revealing their purported privileged content, could have resolved
any privilege dispute or demonstrated that certain documents do not contain useful information.
For example, the “immunity request” that is the subject of several emails does not relate to any
witness expected to testify at the hearing.
Further, OLAP’s verified explanation revises its position on asserted privileges as to
certain documents. Also, although OLAP invokes the law enforcement and deliberative process
privileges as a basis for withholding several documents, it has not provided an appropriate
declaration supporting those privileges with an explanation delineating the declarant’s authority
to invoke them. See Landry v. FDIC, 204 F.3d 1125, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Northrop Corp. v.
McDonnell Douglas Corp., 751 F.2d 395, 405 n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1984).
By November 3, 2016, OLAP shall file and serve on Respondents a revised privilege log
and an appropriate declaration in accordance with this Order. By November 7, 2016,
Respondents may file a written response. No oral argument will be permitted.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
