No. 16 CV 3779
JURY DEMANDED

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission alleges:
1.

This civil law enforcement action concerns an elaborate scheme

hatched and orchestrated by Defendant Ryan Gilbertson to siphon millions of
dollars from a company he founded and its shareholders. That company was
originally named Dakota Plains Transport, Inc., was later renamed Dakota Plains,
Inc., and ultimately became Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. after a merger. (Except
where context requires, all three entities are referred to herein as “Dakota Plains” or
the “Company”.)
2.

Gilbertson and Michael Reger co-founded Dakota Plains in 2008.

They installed figureheads to be Dakota Plains’ executive officers, by appointing
their fathers – who as a practical matter had no involvement with Dakota Plains – to

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 2 of 29

serve as its first CEO and president. Behind the scenes, however, Gilbertson and
Reger wielded total control.
3.

Gilbertson asserted his power over Dakota Plains to enrich himself to

the Company’s detriment. He caused Dakota Plains to use money raised from
investors to pay himself and Reger dividends, interest at a favorable rate, and
$300,000 in “consulting” payments. He had Dakota Plains issue millions of shares
and warrants to himself and Reger – including promissory notes with lucrative
bonus payments tied to the Company’s stock price in its first 20 days of public
trading.
4.

During the 20-day period, Gilbertson actively influenced both the

buying and selling of Dakota Plains shares, artificially inflating the stock price and
increasing the size of the bonus payments.
5.

Gilbertson’s scheme worked as follows: First, Gilbertson caused the

Company to borrow money from himself, Reger, and a few others on terms
generous to Gilbertson and the other lenders.
6.

Second, Gilbertson caused Dakota Plains to use a significant portion

of the loan proceeds to fund the issuance of dividends to the Company’s
shareholders. As Dakota Plains’ largest shareholders, Gilbertson and Reger received
the largest portions of these dividend payments. The Company paid Gilbertson and
his ex-wife dividends totaling $445,500.

2

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 3 of 29

7.

Third, Gilbertson caused Dakota Plains to offer himself and the other

noteholders – as lenders – a sweetener in the form of bonus “additional payments.”
The size of the bonus payments depended upon the price of Dakota Plains’ stock
following Dakota Plains’ reverse merger, that is, merging into a company with
publicly traded shares (commonly referred to as a “reverse merger”).
8.

Fourth, following the reverse merger, Gilbertson tightly

choreographed the sales and purchases of Dakota Plains’ stock in its initial weeks of
public trading. He did so by enlisting the help of friends and associates, including
his co-defendants in this matter, to act as fronts for his stock activities. The goal was
to artificially inflate the price of the stock in the first 20 days of “public” trading –
the time period that determined the size of his additional payments.
9.

Gilbertson’s manipulative activities were wildly successful. Upon the

commencement of public trading in March 2012, his manipulation caused the price
of Dakota Plains stock to skyrocket from 30 cents to between $11 and $12, where it
stayed for almost exactly 20 days. Under the additional payment mechanism
conceived by Gilbertson, that inflated stock price obligated Dakota Plains to pay
Gilbertson and the other noteholders bonus payments exceeding $32 million.
10.

After sustaining Dakota Plains’ stock price for the first 20 days and

meeting his “additional payment” target, Gilbertson stopped his efforts to artificially
inflate Dakota Plains’ stock. Without Gilbertson’s manipulation, the stock price
began a sustained and substantial decline. It ended 2012 trading at between $3 and

3

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 4 of 29

$4. By the end of 2013 it was trading between $2 and $3. By mid-2015 it was
trading for less than a dollar. In July 2016 it was delisted from the stock market on
which it had been trading. Dakota Plains’ stock currently trades on the over-thecounter market at about 4 cents a share.
11.

The other defendants actively participated in the manipulation of the

price of Dakota Plains’ stock during the first 20 days of public trading.
12.

Apart from his manipulation, Gilbertson also traded Dakota Plains

shares extensively while hiding his actions from the public. Despite being one of
Dakota Plains’ largest shareholders at the time the Company went public, Gilbertson
used a web of nominee accounts to unlawfully conceal both his ownership and
trading in the Company’s stock. Since November 2012, he has traded Dakota Plains
stock hundreds of times, yielding himself more than $16 million in profits, all
without filing any of the required public disclosures of his holdings or transactions.
13.

The SEC brings this action to hold defendants accountable for their

malfeasance.

DEFENDANTS
18.

Defendant Ryan Gilbertson, age 40, is a resident of Delano,

Minnesota and Sarasota, Florida. Gilbertson previously held Series 3, 4, 7, 55, and
63 licenses with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., the securities
industry’s self-regulatory organization. Between 1998 and 2006, Gilbertson was a
registered representative of various firms in the securities industry. Currently he is
the CEO of Northern Capital Partners, a private equity firm in Wayzata, Minnesota.
Gilbertson co-founded Dakota Plains along with Michael Reger. At the time it went
public, Gilbertson controlled 11.0% of Dakota Plains’ stock and 38.9% of its
promissory notes.

5

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 6 of 29

19.

Defendant Douglas Hoskins, age 48, is a resident of Delano,

Minnesota and Nicholasville, Kentucky. Hoskins is a friend of Gilbertson’s. He
acquired a large block of MCT Holding Corporation (“MCT”) shares immediately
before it merged with Dakota Plains. He then sold those shares during the first 20
days of Dakota Plains’ public trading.
20.

Defendant Thomas Howells, age 44, is a resident of Sandy, Utah.

Howells is a consultant who was instrumental in arranging both the merger between
Dakota Plains and MCT, and the private sale of stock to Hoskins.
OTHER PARTIES
21.

Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. is a publicly-held corporation based in

Wayzata, Minnesota. Its business is shipping North Dakota crude oil by rail. Dakota
Plains Holdings, Inc. was created on March 22, 2012 when its predecessor, Dakota
Plains Inc., merged into a company, MCT, which had publicly traded shares. Its
shares of common stock were registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act
during the relevant period. On July 11, 2016, Dakota Plains stock was delisted from
the stock market on which it had traded. The shares of Dakota Plains and its
predecessor, MCT, constitute “securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of
the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1)] and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)].
22.

Michael L. Reger, age 40, is a resident of Wayzata, Minnesota.

Reger co-founded Dakota Plains along with Ryan Gilbertson. At the time it went

6

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 7 of 29

public, Reger controlled 21.4% of Dakota Plains’ stock and 33.3% of its promissory
notes.
FACTS
About Dakota Plains
23.

In 2008, Gilbertson and Reger founded Dakota Plains. To avoid

disclosing their involvement in the Company, Gilbertson and Reger named their
fathers as CEO and President. The fathers were mere figureheads, who signed
documents presented to them by their sons or the Company’s lawyer, or their
signatures were stamped or forged. Gilbertson and Reger later replaced their fathers
with other handpicked officers. The roles of Gilbertson and Reger were never
disclosed to the public.
24.

In 2011, Gilbertson and Reger hired one of their friends to replace

Reger’s father as Dakota Plains’ CEO. In addition to the compensation he received
from Dakota Plains, Gilbertson and Reger also provided the new CEO with
additional, secret benefits in the form of stock in another company Gilbertson and
Reger controlled and a loan from a different entity they controlled. Dakota Plains
never publicly disclosed the additional benefits Gilbertson and Reger provided to
the new CEO. The new CEO thereafter dutifully approved two lucrative consulting
agreements with Gilbertson and Reger, as well as the promissory notes containing
the generous “additional payment” provision for them.

7

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 8 of 29

Gilbertson and Reger’s Secret Control of Dakota Plains
25.

Between 2009 and 2011, Gilbertson caused Dakota Plains to raise

capital by making four private placements of its stock. Approximately 70 investors
purchased 8.675 million shares for $7.35 million.
26.

The offering materials for the private placements misleadingly stated

that Gilbertson’s and Reger’s fathers or the successor officers handpicked by
Gilbertson and Reger managed the Company. In fact, Gilbertson and Reger
controlled Dakota Plains.
27.

Each offering memorandum purported to identify all people who

beneficially owned 5% or more of the Company’s stock. But the offering
memoranda either entirely omitted Gilbertson and Reger from those lists, or
significantly understated their holdings.
28.

Reasonable investors would have considered these facts important.

Such facts would have exposed Gilbertson’s influence over Dakota Plains. The
offering materials, which were prepared at Gilbertson’s direction, thus contained
material misstatements and omissions.
29.

In January 2011, Gilbertson caused Dakota Plains to raise additional

funds by issuing $3.5 million in promissory notes. Gilbertson and Reger (or their
nominees) purchased $2.1 million of the notes. The notes provided for 12% interest,
as well as warrants to purchase additional shares. The Company needed cash to
build out its rail facility, but when the notes were issued, Gilbertson had Dakota

8

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 9 of 29

Plains use the infusion of cash to declare a dividend. This resulted in $1.9 million of
the note proceeds and 1.4 million shares being distributed to shareholders.
Gilbertson personally received $288,500 and his ex-wife received $157,000.
30.

In April 2011, at Gilbertson’s direction, Dakota Plains’ CEO caused

the Company to issue another $5.5 million of promissory notes paying 12% interest.
Gilbertson, Reger, and entities they controlled purchased $4.25 million of the $5.5
million in promissory notes.
31.

At around the same time – also at Gilbertson’s and Reger’s direction –

Dakota Plains’ CEO caused the Company to enter into an agreement to pay a
$200,000 “consulting fee” – later increased to $300,000 – to a company Gilbertson
and Reger controlled. Dakota Plains never publicly disclosed its consulting
agreements with Reger and Gilbertson’s company.
32.

The offering materials for the private placements disclosed that the

Company declared a dividend and issued promissory notes. But the materials did not
identify Gilbertson and Reger as noteholders. Nor did they disclose that Gilbertson
and Reger purchased the lion’s share of the notes. The offering materials also failed
to disclose the amount of interest and dividends they received, or their lucrative
consulting agreements.
33.

Between January 2011 and October 2013, payments to Gilbertson and

Reger constituted 15.9% of all disbursements from Dakota Plains’ bank account,
dwarfing the amounts Dakota Plains spent on professional services (11.7%), taxes

9

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 10 of 29

(6.0%), or payroll (5.3%). Gilbertson and Reger hid from the stockholders the
payments Dakota Plains paid them.
Dakota Plains Becomes a Public Company
34.

Gilbertson decided how and when Dakota Plains would become

publicly traded. He structured the transaction to maximize his personal benefit. In
January 2011, Gilbertson approached Defendant Thomas Howells about taking
Dakota Plains public through a reverse merger. Dakota Plains’ named officers were
not involved in the decision to do a reverse merger. None of them understood how a
reverse merger benefited Dakota Plains. Nonetheless, at Gilbertson’s insistence,
Dakota Plains’ board voted to approve the reverse merger.
35.

In a “reverse merger,” a privately held company – in this case, Dakota

Plains, Inc. – becomes publicly traded by merging into an existing company with
publicly traded shares. At Gilbertson’s request, Howells located a reverse merger
partner, MCT Holding Corporation, a public shell company that owned a single
defunct Utah tanning salon. Following the merger, MCT renamed itself Dakota
Plains Holdings, Inc. For approximately the first three days of trading, the
Company’s stock kept the MCT “ticker symbol” for trading purposes, after which
Dakota Plains was issued a new ticker symbol: DAKP.
36.

Howells told Gilbertson about two characteristics of MCT that made

it an ideal public shell to further Gilbertson’s scheme. First, MCT had an extremely
limited supply of shares that had no restrictions on the face of the stock certificates.

10

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 11 of 29

Second, most of those unrestricted shares were held by a handful of family members
and employees of MCT’s attorney, who was a longtime associate of Howells.
37.

Howells worked with Gilbertson to transfer a block of those

unrestricted shares from the MCT attorney’s family and employees to Defendant
Doug Hoskins, Gilbertson’s polo instructor. Hoskins would allow Gilbertson to
exercise control over the shares. This stock transfer gave Gilbertson control over a
substantial portion of the tradeable stock, thus enabling him to assert significant
influence and control over the initial trading in the stock.
38.

While the reverse merger was in the works, Gilbertson concurrently

directed Dakota Plains’ CEO to modify the promissory notes to add the lucrative
“additional payment” provision based on Dakota Plains’ stock price during its first
20 days of public trading. Gilbertson also directed the CEO to cause Dakota Plains
to pay Gilbertson $70,000 in fees for modifying the promissory notes.
39.

Gilbertson and Reger collectively held over 70% of the notes with the

lucrative bonus provisions. Thus, they stood to profit handsomely if: (a) Dakota
Plains went public; and (b) the Company’s stock hit lofty benchmarks in the first 20
days after becoming public.
40.

Having already controlled how Dakota Plains would go public,

Gilbertson then set about to cash in on the bonus payment provision he had created
for himself.

11

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 12 of 29

41.

Gilbertson avoided buying and selling Dakota Plains shares on his

own behalf during the initial 20-day period – thus concealing his role in the
manipulation, and dodging reporting requirements. Instead of trading in his own
account or on his own behalf, Gilbertson recruited a host of individuals whose
buying and selling he could control behind the scenes. One such person was
Defendant Hoskins. Hoskins had almost no previous investment experience and was
in financial distress. At the time, he had more than $130,000 in federal and state tax
liens against him. The IRS had deemed his debt uncollectible.
42.

Gilbertson negotiated a side deal with Howells to transfer a majority

of the unrestricted MCT shares to Hoskins. Gilbertson loaned Hoskins money so
Hoskins could purchase the stock. Notwithstanding a confidentiality agreement with
Dakota Plains, Gilbertson told Hoskins about the merger before it was publicly
disclosed. Gilbertson directed Howells to keep the transfer of MCT stock to Hoskins
strictly confidential. Howells obliged; neither he nor Gilbertson disclosed the
transaction to any of Dakota Plains’ officers.
43.

No publicly available document identified the holders of unrestricted

MCT shares. But Howells knew that most of unrestricted shares were in the hands
of the MCT attorney’s family and employees. Notwithstanding his own
confidentiality agreement with Dakota Plains, Howells facilitated the disclosure of
non-public information about the pending merger to these shareholders so they
could sell the stock to Hoskins when the time was right.

12

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 13 of 29

44.

Hoskins served as a strawman purchaser of MCT stock – which

became Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. stock after the merger. Gilbertson told
Howells that Hoskins would purchase 50,000 unrestricted shares of MCT—more
than half of all the unrestricted shares—for $0.50 per share. Although Hoskins
nominally purchased the shares from six different people, he never met or
communicated with any of the sellers. Gilbertson and Howells arranged the entire
transaction behind the scenes.
Defendants Clandestinely Control
the Trading Following the Merger
45.

At Gilbertson’s request, Howells arranged for Hoskins to open a

brokerage account with a broker who was a longtime associate of Howells, and to
have some of the shares he acquired transferred into that account.
46.

During the critical 20-day period following the merger, Gilbertson

directed Hoskins to sell his shares at elevated prices. Hoskins was the largest seller
during the first 20 days. Most of the handful of other people who sold shares during
the first 20 days sold their shares through the same broker Hoskins used.
47.

After the merger was complete, Gilbertson and Howells, with the

active assistance of Hoskins, covertly coordinated the buying and selling of Dakota
Plains shares to ensure that the price stayed high during the first 20 days. Howells
and Gilbertson remained in close contact throughout the first 20 days of trading,
communicating about the stock price and the trading activity. Gilbertson

13

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 14 of 29

concurrently was directing a broker to purchase Dakota Plains shares during that
same period.
48.

Throughout the first 20 days of trading, Gilbertson was the man

behind the curtain. He carefully choreographed all aspects of trading – including
timing, quantities, and price.
49.

Gilbertson’s control is reflected in a text message he sent Howells on

April 4, 2012: “Hoskins should be getting more than 25 pct of the volume – unless
you know of anyone else who is generating volume.” Howells assured Gilbertson
that he was “keeping small positions passive.”
50.

Gilbertson then sent Howells another text message admitting his

manipulation of the stock price: “they would be participating on sales at 7 bucks not
12 were it not for my involvement.” In a response, Howells “agreed 100%”. After
speaking with Hoskins’ broker, Howells reported back to Gilbertson in another text
message: “All good.” Following that exchange of text messages between Gilbertson
and Howells, Hoskins’ broker did not sell any Dakota Plains shares for any
customers other than Hoskins until April 10, 2012.
51.

During its investigation into this matter, the SEC questioned both

Gilbertson and Hoskins under oath about Hoskins’ acquisition of MCT shares and
subsequent sale of those shares during the 20-day period. Both Gilbertson and
Hoskins invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and

14

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 15 of 29

refused to answer any questions regarding Hoskins’ purchases or sales of stock.
Indeed, Gilbertson refused to answer any questions about Dakota Plains.
52.

Before the merger, Gilbertson directed a Minneapolis broker to buy

Dakota Plains stock right after it started publicly trading on the broker’s behalf and
on behalf of the broker’s customers,. The Minneapolis broker complied with
Gilbertson’s instructions, submitting an order on the first day of trading to purchase
10,000 shares for customer accounts at “market price,” that is, he bought shares at
any price Hoskins’ broker offered to sell the stock for. On the second day, the
Minneapolis broker added a $12 limit to the order. The Minneapolis broker
continued purchasing Dakota Plains shares throughout the 20-day period. During the
first 20 days he purchased more than half of the total volume of shares purchased.
After the first 20 days, he stopped buying the stock.
53.

The Minneapolis broker had good reason to follow Gilbertson’s

directions. Between 2009 and 2012, Gilbertson caused an unregistered entity the
Minneapolis broker owned to be paid over $400,000 as compensation in return for
the Minneapolis broker selling stock in Dakota Plains and two other companies that
Gilbertson and Reger controlled. The Minneapolis broker did not sell any of those
shares through his registered broker-dealer employer, as required by the securities
laws. Bypassing his registered employer allowed the Minneapolis broker to keep all
of the commissions for himself, without sharing them with his firm.

15

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 16 of 29

54.

Also in furtherance of the scheme, Gilbertson told Reger to have his

friends buy Dakota Plains’ stock during the first 20 days. To that end, several of
Reger’s family members, friends, and associates purchased Dakota Plains stock
during the first 20 days of trading.
Defendants Succeed in Manipulating
the Price of Dakota Plains Stock
55.

The market manipulation scheme worked. As a result of Gilbertson’s

manipulation, upon becoming publicly traded, the price of Dakota Plains stock
immediately soared from $0.30 to $12. It stayed between $11 and $12 for almost
exactly 20 days—the period that determined Gilbertson’s bonus additional payment.
Only 92,400 shares were listed as non-restricted, so trading during the 20-day period
was extremely light, with no trading on five days and the daily volume after the
opening day never exceeding 2,300 shares.
56.

On the first day of trading, Gilbertson exercised the warrants he

received with the promissory notes. Those warrants had an exercise price of 28.5
cents and contained a cashless exercise feature; the higher the stock price, the more
shares the holder received. By exercising his warrants when the stock was just over
$11, Gilbertson received 1,071,525 shares (of which 97,411 went to a foundation he
controlled).
57.

More than a month after the reverse merger, on May 15, 2012, Dakota

Plains filed a Form 10-Q disclosing that the additional payment due to holders of the

16

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 17 of 29

notes pursuant to the bonus provision in the promissory notes was $32,851,800. No
public filing by Dakota Plains disclosed the names of the noteholders or the amounts
they received. Because Dakota Plains did not have the cash to pay large bonuses,
Gilbertson structured the bonus mechanism to be payable either in stock or
additional debt. Gilbertson took his bonus payments in the form of new promissory
notes, thus saddling the Company with more debt. For his bonus payment,
Gilbertson received new promissory notes totaling $12,775,700.
58.

These notes constituted debilitating debt for the struggling Company.

Near the end of the 20-day period, Gilbertson directed Dakota Plains’ CEO to have
the Company raise an additional $50 million in a debt offering. Gilbertson wanted
the Company to use this fresh debt to pay him his bonus payment.
59.

As Gilbertson directed, Dakota Plains conducted the debt offering, but

it could only raise $6.1 million. Following the unsuccessful debt offering, Dakota
Plains’ shareholders began to complain about the bonus payments. Twice,
Gilbertson negotiated with the complaining shareholders and agreed to restructure
and reduce the amount of the additional payment. While most of the bonus
payments were ultimately converted to stock, Dakota Plains made $995,000 in
interest payments to Gilbertson on the notes he received as a bonus payment. The
Company made this payment to Gilbertson in cash. Gilbertson’s entitlement to this
money flowed from the artificial spike he had caused in the price of the stock postmerger.

17

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 18 of 29

60.

Gilbertson made millions in profits from his manipulation scheme.

Those profits came at the expense of the Company and its shareholders. In the same
May 15, 2012 Form 10-Q that announced the bonus payments, the Company
disclosed that there was “uncertainty relating to our ability to continue as a going
concern,” in large part because “[a]s a result of the payments due under our
outstanding promissory notes, we expect to have significant cash requirements in
the next twelve months.”
61.

Since then, the situation has only gotten worse. Dakota Plains’ most

recent Form 10-Q, filed in August 2016, warns that the Company can provide no
assurances about “the ability to continue as a going concern” or that “we will not be
forced to seek bankruptcy protection.” Dakota Plains’ stock is almost worthless
today. The Company currently operates under a forbearance agreement with its
lenders.
Gilbertson’s Undisclosed Stock Transactions
62.

Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act require beneficial

owners of more than 5% and 10%, respectively, of an issuer’s stock to file public
disclosures of their holdings and transactions, to inform other investors and the
public of major shareholders’ activities. At the time Dakota Plains went public,
Gilbertson beneficially owned approximately 11% of its stock, which gave rise to a
reporting obligation under the securities laws. Nevertheless, Gilbertson failed to
publicly report his holdings.

18

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 19 of 29

63.

Gilbertson purposefully structured his holdings so that no one account

held more than 5% of Dakota Plains’ stock. He held over 1.1 million of his shares in
his young child’s name, nominally under the control of two “custodians,”
Gilbertson’s father and sister. Neither controlled the shares. Gilbertson made all of
the investing and voting decisions for his child’s accounts. Gilbertson held other
shares in a foundation he controlled. Gilbertson also beneficially owned over 1.5
million shares in his ex-wife’s name. Under a “pledge” agreement, the ex-wife was
unable to sell any of those shares without Gilbertson’s consent. She was required to
give Gilbertson all proceeds of any sales of Dakota Plains stock.
64.

Since Dakota Plains began public trading, Gilbertson has used his web

of nominee accounts to make over 500 transactions – both buys and sells – in
Dakota Plains stock. Since November 2012, Gilbertson has made over $16 million
in profits trading Dakota Plains shares in accounts he controls. He reported none of
those purchases or sales, as required by Sections 13(d) or 16(a) of the Exchange
Act.
65.

Gilbertson was well aware of the securities laws’ reporting

obligations. He had previously been the president and CFO of a publicly-held
company. In that capacity he filed 40 disclosure statements for his stock holdings or
transactions. Before that Gilbertson had been a securities professional; from 1996
through 2006 he was a registered representative and held several securities licenses.
Despite his extensive experience with the securities laws and his knowledge of the

19

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 20 of 29

public disclosure requirements, Gilbertson intentionally avoided disclosing his
Dakota Plains holdings and transactions. In doing so, he made many millions of
dollars through his unreported sales of Dakota Plains stock.
COUNT I
Violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act

67.

By engaging in the conduct described above, Gilbertson, in the offer

and sale of securities, by the use of the means and instruments of transportation or

(a) employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud, or (b) obtained money or
property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (c) engaged in
transactions, practices, or courses of business which operate or would operate as a
fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.
68.

Gilbertson intentionally, recklessly, and/or negligently made the

untrue statements and omissions and engaged in the devices, schemes, artifices,

COUNT VI
Violations of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
(Against Defendant Gilbertson)
86.

Paragraphs 1 through 65 are realleged and incorporated by reference.

87.

Pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(d)]

and the rules promulgated thereunder, persons who are directly or indirectly the
beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a class of voting
equity securities registered under the Exchange Act are required to file a Schedule
13D within ten days of the date on which their ownership exceeds five percent, and
to notify the issuer and the Commission of any material increases or decreases in the
percentage of beneficial ownership by filing an amended Schedule 13D. The
Schedule 13D filing requirement applies both to individuals and to two or more
persons who act as a group for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of
securities of an issuer.
88.

During the relevant period, Gilbertson was the beneficial owner of

more than five percent of Dakota Plains shares. He was the beneficial owner of the
shares held in the names of his child, ex-wife, and foundation. Together, this group
was sufficiently interrelated that they constituted one individual for purposes of
Exchange Act Section 13(d) and the Schedule 13D filing requirements.
89.

Accordingly, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 13(d), Gilbertson was

under an obligation to file with the Commission true and accurate reports with
respect to his ownership of the Dakota Plains shares, including those held in the

25

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 26 of 29

name of his child, ex-wife, and foundation, as well as any material increases or
decreases in the percentage of such ownership.
90.

Moreover, Gilbertson failed to disclose the existence of the

promissory notes described above, or his entitlement to additional shares or
promissory notes based on the price of the stock in the first 20 days of trading.
Gilbertson also failed to disclose the existence of warrants he could immediately
exercise for underlying shares of Dakota Plains.
91.

By engaging in the conduct described above, Defendant Gilbertson

violated Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(d)].
COUNT VII
Violations of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
(Against Defendant Gilbertson)
92.

Paragraphs 1 through 65 are realleged and incorporated by reference.

93.

Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 16(a) [15 U.S.C. § 78p(a)] and the

rules promulgated thereunder, persons who are beneficial owners of more than 10%
of any class of any equity security registered under the Exchange Act, or who are
directors or officers of an issuer of such securities, are required timely and
accurately to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the Commission. These forms disclose
information about an officer’s, director’s, or 10% shareholder’s holdings and trading
in the corresponding issuer’s securities.
94.

As discussed above, Defendant Gilbertson violated Section 16(a) and

the rules promulgated thereunder because he owned and traded Dakota Plains shares

26

CASE 0:16-cv-03779 Document 1 Filed 10/31/16 Page 27 of 29
