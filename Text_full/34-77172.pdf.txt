SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission has requested comment in its

1

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 76743 (December 22, 2015), 80 FR 81948
(December 31, 2015).

Release generally seeks comment on a broad range of topics in the transfer agent space,
including the processing of book entry securities, recordkeeping for beneficial owners,
administration of issuer plans, and the role of transfer agents to mutual funds and crowdfunding.
The Release originally provided that comments must be received by February 29, 2016. The
Commission has received requests to extend the comment period.2 The Commission believes
that extending the comment period would be appropriate in order to provide the public additional
time to consider and comment on the issues addressed in the Release. Therefore, the
Commission is extending the public comment period for 45 days, until April 14, 2016.

By the Commission.
