__________________________________________:
The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested a third extension of time,
until March 31, 2014, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1101(a).
The Commission issued two orders dated December 17, 2012, finding that Aladdin
Capital Management LLC (“Aladdin Management”) violated Section 206(2) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and that Aladdin Capital LLC (“Aladdin Capital”)
(collectively “Aladdin”) violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities
Act”) when Aladdin misled investors regarding co-investments in two collateral debt
obligations (“CDOs”) that Aladdin managed and marketed, and that Joseph A. Schlim, who
was responsible for ensuring that Aladdin co-invested alongside its clients in the CDOs but

failed to ensure that Aladdin actually did so, violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act
and caused Aladdin Capital’s violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Aladdin
Management’s violations of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act. 1
On February 14, 2013, the Commission issued an order extending the Division’s time
until July 17, 2013 to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution.2 On July 26, 2013, the
Commission issued a second order extending the time until October 18, 2013 to submit a
proposed Plan of Distribution. 3 The Division now states that it will require additional time
because of the novel and complex nature of this analysis.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until March 31, 2014 to submit a proposed Plan of
Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
