ORDER FINDING RESPONDENT IN
DEFAULT AND DIRECTING MOTION
FOR SANCTIONS

On December 21, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent Blue Mountain Eco Tours, Inc. Respondent
was served on December 23, 2015, and when it failed to file a timely answer I ordered it to show
cause by January 15, 2016, why this proceeding should not be determined against it. See The
Registration Statement of Blue Mountain Eco Tours, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
3467, 2016 SEC LEXIS 23 (Jan. 5, 2016).
To date, Respondent has not answered the OIP or responded to the show cause order.
Accordingly, pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 155(a), I find Respondent in default.1
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
It is ORDERED that the Division of Enforcement shall file a motion for sanctions by
January 29, 2016. The motion shall provide legal authority and evidentiary support relating to
the OIP’s allegations and the Division’s requested sanctions.

Respondent is notified that it may move to set aside the default pursuant to Rule 155(b):
A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time, state the
reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the proposed
defense in the proceeding. In order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as
may be appropriate, the hearing officer, at any time prior to the filing of the initial
decision, or the Commission, at any time, may for good cause shown set aside a
default.

17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b).
