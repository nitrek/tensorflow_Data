In the Matter of
WILLIAM TIRRELL

ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On June 23, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings (OIP) against Respondent William Tirrell. The
OIP directs me to issue an initial decision within 300 days after service of the OIP. OIP at 14. A
hearing is currently scheduled for July 25, 2016.
In view of the foregoing, I ORDER the following:
1. The hearing scheduled to begin on July 25, 2016, is POSTPONED and a telephonic
prehearing conference will be held on July 21, 2016, at 11:00 a.m. EDT.
2. Prior to the prehearing conference, the parties must confer and discuss the date for the
hearing in this matter, the most convenient location for the hearing, the prehearing
schedule, and the matters listed in Rule of Practice 221(c). See 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c).
In doing so, the parties should bear the following in mind. First, 5 U.S.C. § 554(b) and
17 C.F.R. § 201.200(c) provide guidance regarding the location of the hearing. Second,
Mr. Tirrell has a right to a hearing between thirty and sixty days after service of the OIP.
15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(b); see OIP at 13. If he exercises that right, the hearing in this matter
will commence on a date to be determined within that time period. Otherwise, the parties
should review Rule of Practice 360(a)(2) in discussing possible dates to start the hearing
in this matter. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2).
3. By July 18, 2016, the parties should submit a joint letter, filed consistent with Rules of
Practice 151 and 152, 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.151, .152, addressing:
a)

the results of their discussion;

b)

whether Mr. Tirrell wishes to exercise his right to begin the hearing between
thirty and sixty days of service of the OIP; and

c)

the date they have agreed the hearing should begin.

4. The Division of Enforcement should promptly notify this office when Mr. Tirrell or his
counsel is served with the OIP. Service on an individual is complete upon delivery. 17
C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(i). The parties may stipulate to a service date in their joint letter.
The parties are asked to e-mail PDF text-searchable courtesy copies of any filings in this
proceeding to alj@sec.gov.
