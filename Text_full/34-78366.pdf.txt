DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS

5.
As discussed in more detail above, all of the Respondents are delinquent in their
periodic filings with the Commission, have repeatedly failed to meet their obligations to file
timely periodic reports, and failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of

their failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission
rules, did not receive such letters.

of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current

Exchange Act Rule 13a-13 requires issuers to file quarterly reports.

As a result of the foregoing, Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
