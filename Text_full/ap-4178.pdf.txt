ORDER POSTPONING HEARING

On August 31, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondents pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. A hearing is scheduled for September 23, 2016.
On September 9, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondents were served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(ii) by September 8, 2016. Because service was made by mail, Respondents’
answers to the OIP are due by September 21, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b),
.220(b). If Respondents fail to timely file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding, they will
be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against them, and the registrations of
their securities will be revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
The September 23, 2016, hearing is POSTPONED. A telephonic prehearing conference
will be held on a date to be determined in a later order, unless the proceeding is resolved before
such order issues.
