APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registrations of the registered securities of Respondents
Med-Zone Biotechnologies Acquisition, Inc., and Millenium Direct, Inc. (the Two Respondents)
due to their failures to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.1
INTRODUCTION
On March 1, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding with an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP
alleges that the Two Respondents have securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g) and have repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the
Commission, in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13
thereunder. The Two Respondents were served with the OIP by March 10, 2016, and their
answers were due by March 23. Map IV Acquisition, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
3732, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1110 (ALJ Mar. 24, 2016). When the Two Respondents failed to file
answers, I ordered them to show cause by April 5, 2016, why the registrations of their securities
should not be revoked by default due to their failures to file answers or otherwise defend the
1

This decision does not apply to the third respondent, Map IV Acquisition, Inc., which settled
with the Commission. Map IV Acquisition, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 77597, 2016 WL
1445947 (Apr. 13, 2016).

proceeding. Id. To date, neither of the Two Respondents has filed an answer, responded to the
show cause order, or otherwise defended this proceeding.
FINDINGS OF FACT
The Two Respondents are in default for failing to file answers or otherwise defend the
proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by
Rule of Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be
true.
Med-Zone Biotechnologies Acquisition, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1294604, is a
void Delaware corporation located in New York, New York, with a class of securities registered
with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its
periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form
10-QSB for the period ended August 31, 2005, which reported a net loss of $3,119.80 for the
prior three months.
Millennium Direct, Inc., CIK No. 1114835, is an inactive Delaware corporation located
in North Blenheim, New York, with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with
the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the
period ended March 31, 2001, which reported a net loss of $28,931 for the prior three months.
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, the Two Respondents
failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation
Finance requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations, or, through their failures to
maintain valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not
receive such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. “Compliance with those requirements is
mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is
not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250,
1268 (D.D.C. 1978). The Two Respondents failed to file timely periodic reports. As a result,
the Two Respondents violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
2

opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
The Two Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because the
failures constitute violations of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). The Two
Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file periodic reports.
See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at
*20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due over a two-year
period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26
(May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period
considered recurrent). The Two Respondents are also culpable because they failed to heed
delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance or, through their failures
to maintain valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did
not receive the letters, and were therefore on notice, even before the OIP issued, of their
obligations to file periodic reports. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800,
2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted
even without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally, the Two
Respondents have not answered the OIP, responded to the show cause order, or otherwise
participated in the proceeding to address whether they have made any efforts to remedy their past
violations. They have also made no assurances against further violations.
For these reasons, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke
the registrations of each class of the Two Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrations of each class of registered securities of Respondents Med-Zone Biotechnologies
Acquisition, Inc., and Millennium Direct, Inc., are REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party
may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,
pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is

3

filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
