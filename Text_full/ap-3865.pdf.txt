ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17241

In the Matter of
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
EQCO2, INC.,
HONDO MINERALS CORP., and
LIBERTY GOLD CORP.

On May 4, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A telephonic prehearing conference is scheduled for June 17, 2016.
I previously found that Respondents were served with the OIP by May 9, 2016, and that
their answers were due by May 23, 2016. EQCO2, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
3847, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1747 (ALJ May 16, 2016). To date, Respondents have not filed
answers.
Accordingly, I ORDER that Respondents SHOW CAUSE by June 3, 2016, why the
registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to file
answers or otherwise defend this proceeding. If Respondents fail to respond to this order, they
shall be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against them, and the registration
of their securities will be revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
The telephonic prehearing conference will take place on June 17, 2016, as scheduled, if
the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
