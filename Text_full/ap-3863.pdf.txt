ORDER FOLLOWING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

A telephonic prehearing conference was held today, attended by counsel for the Division of
Enforcement and Respondent Joseph P. Doxey. During the prehearing conference, with the parties’
agreement, I set the following prehearing schedule:

Parties exchange and file their witness lists.

August 5, 2016:

Parties file their exhibit lists 1 and exchange, but not file, pre-marked
exhibits.

Parties file motions in limine and objections to proposed exhibits.

August 23, 2016:

Hearing commences at a venue to be determined, near West Palm
Beach, Florida. The hearing will conclude by August 26, 2016.

The parties should each be prepared to present brief opening statements of no more than
twenty minutes at the start of hearing.
Doxey should be aware that a respondent bears the burden of raising and demonstrating an
inability to pay. Philip A. Lehman, Exchange Act Release No. 54660, 2006 SEC LEXIS 2498, at
*16 (Oct. 27, 2006). Doxey should therefore be prepared to present evidence at the hearing to meet
this burden, if he desires to raise it. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.630(b), 209.1 (Form D-A).
SO ORDERED.
