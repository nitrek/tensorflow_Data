In the Matter of

ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

JANICE D. REY
On March 1, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Thereafter, I postponed the hearing in this matter and scheduled a telephonic
prehearing conference for March 22.
During the March 22 prehearing conference, Respondent indicated that she would likely
not contest this proceeding, and the Division of Enforcement stated that it would send
Respondent settlement documents for her to sign. Because Respondent indicated that she may
not initially understand such documents on their face, I decided that a second telephonic
prehearing conference should be held. At this second conference, the Division will explain the
settlement documents to Respondent, and Respondent will be free to ask me or the Division any
questions she may have.
I therefore ORDER that by March 31, 2016, the Division shall provide my office with
proposed dates and times that the Division and Respondent are available for a prehearing
conference. The Division shall ensure that any proposed date for the conference will allow
Respondent sufficient time to receive and review any settlement documents ahead of time.
Further, although information submitted by the Division indicates that the OIP was
delivered to Respondent’s correctional institution on or around March 7 by U.S. Postal Service
certified mail, I determined during the March 22 conference that Respondent was not served with
the OIP until March 22, 2016. According to the OIP, Respondent’s answer would be due twenty
days after service. OIP at 3. However, given her pro se status and the possibility of settlement,
Respondent’s answer is due by April 22, 2016, if the proceeding is not stayed or resolved by
then.
