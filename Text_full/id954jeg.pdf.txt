In the Matter of
YAYI INTERNATIONAL, INC.

INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
February 9, 2016

APPEARANCES:

David S. Frye for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of Respondent’s registered securities due to its
failure to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On December 23, 2015, the Commission initiated this proceeding under Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with an order instituting proceedings (OIP). The OIP alleges that
Respondent has securities registered with the Commission under Exchange Act Section 12(g) and
has repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the Commission, in violation of Exchange
Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Respondent was served with the OIP on
December 28, 2015, and its answer was due by January 7, 2016. Yayi Int’l, Inc., Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3468, 2016 SEC LEXIS 24 (ALJ Jan. 5, 2016). On January 8, 2016, I noted
that Respondent had not filed an answer to the OIP, and I ordered it to show cause by January 19,
2016, why the registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file
an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding. Yayi Int’l, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
3479, 2016 SEC LEXIS 70. On February 3, 2016, I held a telephonic prehearing conference at
which counsel for the Division of Enforcement appeared, but Respondent did not. To date,
Respondent has not filed an answer, responded to the show cause order, or otherwise defended in
this proceeding.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondent is in default for failing to file an answer, attend the prehearing conference, or
otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).

Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I deem the OIP’s
allegations to be true.
Yayi International, Inc., Central Index Key No. 789860, is a void Delaware corporation
located in Zhongbei Town, Xiqing District, Tianjin, China, with a class of securities registered with
the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for
the period ended December 31, 2011, which reported a comprehensive loss attributable to common
shareholders of $4,093,796 for the prior nine months. As of December 15, 2015, the company’s
common stock was quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (formerly “Pink
Sheets”), had seven market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange
Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
In addition to its repeated failure to file timely periodic reports, Respondent failed to heed a
delinquency letter sent to it by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with its periodic filing obligations.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to file
annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. “Compliance with those requirements is
mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied,
Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required
to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. See SEC v.
McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C.
1978). Respondent failed to file timely periodic reports. As a result, Respondent failed to comply
with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTIONS
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend for a
period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that the
issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or rules
thereunder. In determining what sanctions will ensure that investors are adequately protected, the
Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s violations, the isolated
or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved, the extent of the issuer’s
efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and the credibility of its
assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondent’s failure to file required periodic reports is serious because the failure
constitutes a violation of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so
that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC LEXIS
1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned for the
protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the sale of
2

securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). Respondent’s violation
is also recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods.,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent
failed to file seven required periodic reports due over a two-year period); Impax Labs., Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008) (respondent’s
failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period considered recurrent). Respondent is
also culpable because it failed to heed a delinquency letter sent to it by the Division of Corporation
Finance. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37
& n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even without proof that a
respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally, Respondent has not answered the OIP,
responded to the show cause order, appeared at the prehearing conference, or otherwise participated
in the proceeding to address whether it has made any efforts to remedy its past violation. It has also
made no assurances against further violations.
For these reasons, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke the
registration of each class of Respondent’s registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, under Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registration of each class of registered securities of Yayi International, Inc., is REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a party may file a petition for review of
this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party may also
file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision, pursuant to
Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party,
then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the
undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion to
correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become final as
to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at any
time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as
may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a
reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the
proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
