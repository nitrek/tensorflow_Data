STAY ORDER AS TO
TWO RESPONDENTS

On August 9, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission, failed to
timely report the termination of the auditor-client relationship, and are delinquent in their
periodic filings.
On September 1, 2016, the Division of Enforcement and Respondents John D. Oil and
Gas Company and Legal Life Plans, Inc., filed a joint prehearing statement following a
prehearing conference held between the parties. According to the statement, John D. Oil and
Gas and Legal Life Plans have agreed to the settlement of the proceeding and the revocation
of their securities’ registrations.1 Statement at 2. I construe this statement as a motion to stay
the proceeding within the meaning of Rule of Practice 161(c)(2). See 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.161(c)(2). The motion is GRANTED and this proceeding is STAYED as to John D.

The statement also notes that although Respondent Powder River Coal Corp. did not
participate in the prehearing conference or endorse the statement, it is also considering
settling the proceeding. Statement at 1-2. The parties are reminded that I issued an order to
show cause against Powder River, warning it that the registration of its securities could be
revoked be default for failure to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding. See
Capitol City Bancshares, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4100, 2016 SEC LEXIS
3088 (ALJ Aug. 29, 2016). This show cause order is still in effect. If Powder River fails to
respond to the show cause order, then I will find Powder River in default and revoke the
registration of its securities.

Oil and Gas and Legal Life Plans, subject to compliance with that rule, requiring that this
office be notified promptly if any of the requirements of the rule are not met. Id.
