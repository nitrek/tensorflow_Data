INITIAL DECISION
MAKING FINDINGS
AND REVOKING
REGISTRATIONS
BY DEFAULT
May 6, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision revokes the registrations of the registered securities of Clubhouse
Videos, Inc., GLX.com, Inc. (f/k/a American Environmental, Inc., a/k/a GLX, Inc.), Mortgage
Shakers, Inc., Newbridge Mortgage Corp., and Newcourt Holdings, Inc. (collectively,
Respondents). The revocations are based on Respondents’ repeated failure to file required periodic
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I. BACKGROUND
The Commission initiated this proceeding on March 31, 2016, with an Order Instituting
Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).
The OIP alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and that each has repeatedly failed to
file with the Commission annual and quarterly reports in compliance with the Exchange Act. The OIP
provides that each Respondent’s Answer to the OIP is due within ten days of service of the OIP on it.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Each was served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. §
201.141(a)(2)(ii) by April 7, 2016.1 Clubhouse Videos, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
1

Each Respondent was served with the OIP by USPS Express Mail delivery or attempted delivery
at “the most recent address shown on [its] most recent filing with the Commission.” 17 C.F.R. §
201.141(a)(2)(ii).

3795, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1507 (A.L.J. Apr. 21, 2016). None filed an Answer, and each was ordered
to show cause why it should not be deemed to be in default and the registration of its securities
revoked. Id. To date, none has filed an Answer to the OIP or responded to the order to show cause.
Thus, Respondents have failed to answer or otherwise to defend the proceeding within the meaning of
17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2). Accordingly, Respondents are in default, and the undersigned finds that the
allegations in the OIP are true as to them. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f). Official
notice has been taken of the Commission’s public official records concerning Respondents, pursuant to
17 C.F.R. § 201.323.
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
Clubhouse Videos, Inc. (CIK No. 1248218),2 is a dissolved Florida corporation located in
Heathrow, Florida, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having
not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-KSB3 for the period ended December 31,
2003, which reported a net loss of $3,664,787 from the company’s September 26, 2001, inception to
December 31, 2003. The company had filed Form 10-SB registration statements on June 26 and
October 14, 2003, and requested withdrawal of those filings on August 26, 2003, and September 24,
2004, respectively. It filed another Form 10-SB on September 24, 2004.
GLX.com, Inc. (f/k/a American Environmental, Inc., a/k/a GLX, Inc.) (CIK No. 1290785),
is a Florida corporation located in Jupiter, Florida, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-K for the
period ended May 31, 2009, which reported a net loss of $20,827 for the prior twelve months.
Mortgage Shakers, Inc. (CIK No. 1425410), is a dissolved Florida corporation located in
Miami Shores, Florida, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-SB registration statement
on January 29, 2008.
Newbridge Mortgage Corp. (CIK No. 1441824) is a dissolved Florida corporation located in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10 registration statement on
August 5, 2008.

The CIK number is a unique identifier for each corporation in the Commission’s EDGAR
database. The user can retrieve filings of a corporation by using its CIK number.

Forms 10-KSB and 10-QSB could be filed, in lieu of Forms 10-K and 10-Q, by a “small business
issuer,” pursuant to 17 C.F.R. §§ 228.10 - .703 (Regulation S-B). These “SB” forms are no longer
in use. See Smaller Reporting Company Regulatory Relief and Simplification, 73 Fed. Reg. 934
(Jan. 4, 2008) (eliminating Regulation S-B and phasing out the forms associated with it, while
adopting a different reporting regime for “smaller reporting companies”).

Newcourt Holdings, Inc. (CIK No. 1107961), is a dissolved Florida corporation located in
Miami, Florida, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not
filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-KSB for the period ended December 31, 2003,
which reported a net loss of $204,886 for the prior twelve months.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
By failing to file required annual and quarterly reports, Respondents violated Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
IV. SANCTION
Revocation of the registrations of the registered securities of Respondents will serve the
public interest and the protection of investors, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act.
Revocation will help ensure that the corporate shell is not later put to an illicit use involving
publicly traded securities manipulated to the detriment of market participants. Further, revocation
accords with Commission sanction considerations set forth in Gateway International Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006) (citing
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1139-40 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91
(1981)), and with the sanctions imposed in similar cases in which corporations violated Exchange
Act Section 13(a) by failing to file required annual and quarterly reports. See Cobalis Corp.,
Exchange Act Release No. 64813, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2313 (July 6, 2011), recons. denied, Exchange
Act Release No. 65118, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2839 (Aug. 12, 2011); Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197 (May 23, 2008); America’s Sports Voice,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied,
Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1242 (June 6, 2007); Eagletech Commc’ns,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 54095, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1534 (July 5, 2006). Respondents’
violations were recurrent, egregious, and deprived the investing public of current and accurate
financial information on which to make informed decisions.
Failure to file periodic reports violates a crucial provision of the Exchange Act. The
purpose of the periodic reporting requirements is to publicly disclose current, accurate financial
information about an issuer so that investors may make informed decisions:
The reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is the primary
tool which Congress has fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent,
careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the sale of stock and securities.
Congress has extended the reporting requirements even to companies which are
“relatively unknown and insubstantial.”
SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977) (quoting legislative history); accord
e-Smart Techs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 50514, 2004 SEC LEXIS 2361, at *8-9 (Oct. 12,
2004). The Commission has warned that “many publicly traded companies that fail to file on a
timely basis are ‘shell companies’ and, as such, attractive vehicles for fraudulent stock manipulation
schemes.” e-Smart Techs., Inc., 2004 SEC LEXIS 2361, at *9 n.14.
