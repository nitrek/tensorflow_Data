SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
Civil Action No.: 4:16-cv-992
v.
SOUTHLAKE RESOURCES GROUP, LLC,
CODY M. WINTERS, and
NICHOLAS R. HAMILTON,
Defendants.

COMPLAINT
For its Complaint against Defendants Southlake Resources Group, LLC (“Southlake”),
Cody M. Winters, and Nicholas R. Hamilton, Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC” or the “Commission”) alleges as follows:
SUMMARY
1.

From approximately June 2010 through approximately September 2014, Winters,

directly and through Southlake, a company he owned and controlled, sold interests in 12 oil-andgas joint ventures, raising more than $5.2 million from more than 70 investors in 26 states. None
of the offerings were registered with the Commission, and none of the individuals that Winters
and Southlake employed to cold call potential investors, including Hamilton, were registered
with the SEC as a broker or associated with a registered broker.
2.

In written offering material provided to investors, Winters and Southlake made

untrue and misleading statements and omissions of material facts regarding, among other things,
the use of offering proceeds, the allocation of and title to working interests, projections for oil-

Case 4:16-cv-00992-O Document 1 Filed 10/24/16

Page 2 of 18 PageID 2

and-gas production and revenue, commingling and loaning investor funds, and volume discounts

on the purchase of interests. In each offering, Winters overstated the projected well costs by
almost 100% and omitted to disclose to investors Southlake's actual cost and profit information.

3.

At Winters' direction, Southlake also engaged in conduct that was contrary to

written representations to investors about the use of offering proceeds. For example, Southlake
took undisclosed profit and overhead payments from the offering proceeds and used offering
proceeds to acquire working interests for itself in undisclosed transactions. Southlake stated that
certain well revenue was being directed to well operators, when, in fact, Southlake retained the

revenue. Southlake commingled proceeds from multiple offerings. And it selectively sold
interests to certain investors at a 50% discount in undisclosed transactions.

4.

By committing the acts alleged in this Complaint, Defendants Winters and

Southlake directly and indirectly engaged in, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to

engage in, acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business that violate securities-registration
and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)

of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. § 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)] and
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and
Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. Defendants Winters and Hamilton also

directly and indirectly engaged in, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to engage in,
acts, transactions, practices, and courses of business that violate the broker-registration provision

of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §
78o(a)].

5.

The SEC brings this action seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus

prejudgment interest, and civil penalties as to each Defendant and all other equitable and

Complaint

ancillary relief to which the Court determines the SEC is entitled.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6.

The SEC brings this action under Securities Act Section 20(b) [15 U.S.C. §77t(b)]

and Exchange Act Section 21(d) [15 U.S.C. §78u(d)], seeking to restrain and enjoin the

Defendants permanently from engaging in such acts and practices as alleged herein.
7.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action under Section 20(d) and 22(a) of the

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(d) and 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].
8.

Each of the joint-venture interests offered and sold as described in this complaint

is a "security" as that term is defined under Securities Act Section 2(a)(1) [15 U.S. C. §
77b(a)(l)] and Exchange Act Section 3(a)(10) [5 U.S. C. § 78c(a)(10)].

9.

The Defendants, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails or of the means

and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the transactions, acts, practices,
and courses of business described in this complaint.

10.

Venue is proper because Defendants reside in, and a substantial part of the events,

acts, and omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in, the Northern District of Texas.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The Joint Ventures

15.

In or about 2010, Winters founded Southlake to raise capital to acquire working

interests in oil-and gas-wells drilled and operated by third parties. Between 2010 and 2014

Southlake formed 12 joint ventures. During that period, it offered and sold units of interest in
the joint ventures ("Units"), raising $5,235,650 from 70 investors in 26 states. Some investors
invested more than once. For each offering of Units, the table below sets out the joint venture's
name, the number of wells the venture planned to drill, the date the offering began, the amount

Southlake sought to raise, the number of sales, and the total amount actually raised.

Southlake controlled each joint venture. Winters in turn owned and controlled

Southlake. Through Southlake, Winters exercised ultimate control and authority over each

Complaint

Case 4:16-cv-00992-O Document 1 Filed 10/24/16

Page 5 of 18 PageID 5

venture, including its direction, the content of its public statements, the decision to disseminate
such statements, its disclosures to investors, and all decisions regarding its functions, operations,
and activities.

17.

For each joint venture, Winters drafted a Confidential Information Memorandum

("CIM") to provide investors information about the venture. Each CIM contained the number
and price of the Units on offer, the amount sought to be raised, and a table setting out the
anticipated use of investment proceeds. The CIMs were substantially similar for each joint
venture, except for the Unit cost and quantity and the respective descriptions of the well
prospects. After initial contact, Winters typically sent the prospective investor a CIM by FedEx
or email.
The Units Were Securities

18.

The CIMs portrayed the investors and Southlake as general partners of one

another, having all the rights of general partners under Texas law. In reality, however, the joint

ventures did not function as general partnerships. Each joint venture was governed by a nonnegotiable joint-venture agreement, which delegated to Southlake the exclusive right and
authority to control and obligate the venture. The joint-venture agreements thereby rendered
illusory the CIM's claims that investors were general partners.

19.

Investors had no input concerning which wells to drill or complete or regarding

when or whether to do so. They had no input on how the venture spent investment proceeds or

allocated assets. They had no input on the decision to hire drillers or operators. They had no
direct access to venture bank accounts or financial records. They received no information from

Southlake that would allow them to even identify, much less contact, the joint venture's other
investors—their so-called "partners." And although the joint-venture agreement provided that

Complaint

Page 5 of 18

Case 4:16-cv-00992-O Document 1 Filed 10/24/16

Page 6 of 18 PageID 6

investors could vote on certain limited actions, Southlake controlled the balloting process and
never sought such a vote on any action.

20.

Given the joint-venture agreement's assignment of control to Southlake, the

investors' role in each venture was passive, limited to making an investment of money.
Investors therefore reasonably expected the venture's success to come from the managerial

efforts of Winters and Southlake. Consequently, each joint-venture Unit offered and sold by
Winters and Southlake constituted an investment contract and was, therefore, a security.

21.

No registration statement was ever filed with the SEC related to Southlake's offer

and sale of securities.
Winters and Hamilton Acted as Brokers in the Securities Transactions

22.

Winters and Hamilton acted as brokers in Southlake's securities transactions.

Winters identified prospective investors throughout the United States from referrals and from

lead lists he purchased. He supervised a staff of commissioned telephone solicitors to cold-call
these investors to offer and sell the Units. He also closed sales initiated by the cold-callers. He

engaged in cold-calling himself. He negotiated securities transactions, advised prospective
investors regarding the investment, and provided them sales materials, including CIMs. And he

completely controlled the Unit-sale proceeds, from which he paid himself $1,150,473.87.
23.

From April 2012 through September 2014, Hamilton served as a Vice President

at Southlake. In this role, he cold-called prospective investors to offer Units, distributed sales
materials, including CIMs, advised investors about the investment, and negotiated and closed
sales. He earned a 15% commission on each sale and received commission compensation

totaling $357,570.
24.

Complaint

Despite acting as brokers, neither Hamilton nor Winters has ever been registered

Page 6 of 18

Case 4:16-cv-00992-O Document 1 Filed 10/24/16

Page 7 of 18 PageID 7

as a broker with the SEC, and Hamilton has never been associated with a registered broker.

Although Winters was associated with a registered broker from July 2007 through October 2010,
he continued to broker Southlake securities transactions for more than three years after this
association ended.

Winters and Southlake's Misrepresentations and Misconduct
25.

The CIMs contained untrue statements and statements that were rendered

misleading because they omitted information that Winters and Southlake had a duty to disclose.
In the joint-venture offerings, Winters and Southlake also engaged in misleading conduct.
Use ofProceeds

26.

Each CIM included a table entitled "Use of Proceeds," which purported to

disclose Southlake's "anticipated" use of investor money. In each CIM, the table provided that
Southlake anticipated using not more than 15% of the proceeds for fees relating to sales,
marketing, and due-diligence. The CIMs generally noted that a fraction of a percentage of the
proceeds would be used for organizational and offering expenses and that the balance—

approximately 85%—would be used for actual well costs such as lease acquisition, drilling,
testing, completion, and geological and geophysical costs. Although the percentages varied
slightly from CIM to CIM, the example below from the SRG Aldrich Venture CIM illustrates
how Southlake disclosed its anticipated use of proceeds:

27.

Page 8 of 18 PageID 8

In reality, in each joint venture, Southlake spent approximately 50% on well

costs, spent approximately 20% on sales commissions and overhead, and retained approximately
30% as profit. The tables were untrue because they misstated Southlake's actual anticipated use
of proceeds. And they were misleading because they omitted to disclose Southlake's profit and

overhead, disclosures necessary to give a complete and accurate accounting of Southlake's
anticipated use of proceeds. When Winters drafted and disseminated the CIMs, he knew or was
severely reckless in not knowing that the tables were untrue and misleading.
28.

These untrue and misleading statements were material. A reasonable investor

would consider such overstated anticipated expenses and undisclosed anticipated profit and
overhead important in making an investment decision about the joint venture.
29.

By taking undisclosed profit and overhead payments from the offering proceeds,

Winters and Southlake acted knowingly or severely recklessly..
Interest Allocations

30.

Each CIM contained a statement that the joint venture intended to acquire a

specified maximum percentage of the working interest in each well prospect if the joint venture
became fully capitalized. Among the 12 CIMs, this specified maximum ranged from 20% to
100% of the working interest. The table below sets out the maximum working interest to be

acquired by each joint venture if fully capitalized, as specified in the CIMs.

Each CIM contained a table entitled "Interest Allocations," showing who would

own or otherwise share in each prospect well's royalty interest ("RI"), working interest ("WI"),
and net revenue interest ("NRI"). The table below from the SRG Raymond Doxon Joint Venture

is an example showing generally how the CIMs disclosed well-prospect interest allocations:

The CIMs' interest-allocation statements were inaccurate. In reality, Southlake

intended to use, and did use, offering proceeds in undisclosed transactions to acquire for itself

approximately three percentage points of the working interest earmarked for each joint venture.
Therefore, even if the joint venture was fully capitalized, it could not have acquired the

maximum working interest percentage specified in the CIM. The interest allocation tables were

misleading because they did not include Southlake's working interest allocation or its
corresponding net revenue interest allocation.
33.

When Winters drafted and disseminated each CIM, he knew or was severely

reckless in not knowing that the statements regarding working-interest acquisition and interest

allocation were untrue and misleading. These untrue and misleading statements were material.
A reasonable investor would consider Southlake's undisclosed use of proceeds to acquire a share
of the working interest earmarked for the joint venture important in making an investment

decision about the joint venture. A reasonable investor would likewise consider interest

Case 4:16-cv-00992-O Document 1 Filed 10/24/16

Page 10 of 18 PageID 10

allocations in the wells important in making an investment decision about the venture.

34.

By using offering proceeds to acquire working interests for themselves in

undisclosed transactions, Winters and Southlake acted knowingly or severely recklessly.

35.

In addition, 10 of the CIMs contained a statement that a third party well operator

would receive approximately 20% of the net revenue interest in exchange for its services. This
statement was misleading because it omitted to disclose that the operator maintained only a
"back-in interest." The back-in interest—described in contracts that Winters negotiated between

Southlake and the operator—entitled the operator to 20% of the net revenues only after the well
reached "payout." Payout is the point at which the well generates revenues greater than the cost
charged by the operator to drill, test, complete, and operate the well. Unbeknownst to investors,
until payout, Southlake kept the 20% net revenue interest for itself.
36.

Winters knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that the statements

regarding the operator's 20% net revenue interest were misleading. These misleading statements

were material. A reasonable investor would consider Southlake's receipt of the operator's 20%
net revenue interest important in making an investment decision about the joint venture.
37.

By receiving the operator's 20% net revenue interest in undisclosed transactions,

Winters and Southlake acted knowingly or severely recklessly.

38.

The foregoing undisclosed interest allocations had a material impact on the

distribution of well revenues. Southlake received approximately $1.3 million in oil-and-gas
revenues, but it only distributed approximately $800,000 to investors.
Projections

39.

The CIMs contained unsubstantiated performance projections that were not

consistent with Southlake's prior experience. For example, by the time Southlake started the

Complaint

Page 10 of 18

Case 4:16-cv-00992-O Document 1 Filed 10/24/16

Page 11 of 18 PageID 11

SRG Aldrich Joint Venture in 2013, it had drilled more than 30 wells since 2010 in the same

geographical area as the SRG Aldrich well prospects. The SRG Aldrich CIM projected that

producing wells could return investors initial principal in 7 to 42 months, assuming total oil
production between 100,000 barrels and 400,000 barrels. In reality, no wells in any Southlake
joint venture had ever produced oil in sufficient quantities to return investor principal. None of
the wells in Southlake's previous joint ventures had ever even reached the minimum 100,000-

barrel assumption. Moreover, the SRG Aldrich projections assumed oil production ranging from
50 to 300 barrels of oil per day. But only two of Southlake's wells had ever produced more than
100 barrels per day, and even those wells failed to sustain that level of production for more than
a few months.

40.

Moreover, each CIM contained a misleading analysis of existing oil-and-gas

activity in proximity to the prospect wells. In particular, the CIMs included projected production
rates for Southlake's prospect wells based on the most successful wells in the surrounding area,

but ignored dry holes and lesser producing wells. As a result, the CIMs conveyed the misleading

impression that the well prospects were far more favorable than they actually were.
41.

Winters knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that the foregoing

projections were misleading because they had no reasonable basis. These misleading statements
were material. A reasonable investor would consider Southlake's accurate production and

revenue estimates important in making an investment decision about the joint venture.
Working-Interest Title
42.

Each CIM stated that title to the joint venture's property would be held in the

name of the joint venture. This statement was untrue. In reality, Southlake held the title to the
joint venture's working interests. Southlake never took steps to transfer joint-venture property

Complaint

Page 11 of 18

Case 4:16-cv-00992-O Document 1 Filed 10/24/16

Page 12 of 18 PageID 12

from Southlake's name to the joint venture's name.

43.

Winters knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that the CIM statements

regarding title to the joint venture's property were untrue. These untrue statements were

material. A reasonable investor would consider the title holder ofjoint-venture property to be
important in making an investment decision about the joint venture.
Commingled Funds and Loans

44.

The CIMs asserted that there would be no commingling of funds between the

venture and Southlake or any of its affiliates. For at least the first three ventures, however, all
investor money was deposited into a single Southlake bank account and no efforts were made to
ensure that the funds were not commingled. Subsequently, Winters set up separate bank

accounts for each joint venture, but he used Southlake's tax identification number to set up all
the accounts. Therefore, despite the name on the account, Southlake, not the joint venture, was
the account holder.

45.

The CIMs also include a "dealings among related parties" clause, which stated

that there will be no loans between the venture and any other entities controlled by Southlake or
its affiliates. However, Winters on occasion used funds from one joint venture to loan money for

expenses of another joint venture that was not fully funded yet. A reasonable investor would
consider it important to know that investor funds were used to pay for drilling expenses unrelated
to the joint venture.
46.

Winters knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that the CIM statements

regarding commingling and loans were untrue. These untrue statements were material. A

reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment decision about a joint

venture that the joint venture's funds were held in a non-joint-venture account, commingled with

Complaint

Page 12 of 18

Case 4:16-cv-00992-O Document 1 Filed 10/24/16

Page 13 of 18 PageID 13

other funds, or used for loans to other entities.

47.

By commingling and loaning investor funds among the joint ventures, contrary to

their written representations, Winters and Southlake acted knowingly or severely recklessly.
Discountsfor Certain Investors

48.

Each CIM provided that Units would be offered to investors at a fixed price and

that Southlake "may provide a Volume Discount of 5% to 10% for purchases of 3 or more
Units." This statement regarding a discount was untrue. In reality, Winters offered discounts to

certain investors, regardless of the volume of Units purchased. Several investors accepted the
offer and received a 50% discount, paying for half a Unit but receiving a full Unit. These
discounted sales were never disclosed to the other investors.

49.

Winters knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that the CIM statements

regarding discounts were untrue. These untrue statements were material. A reasonable investor
would consider such discounts for certain investors to be important in making an investment
decision about the joint venture.

50.

By selling Units at a 50% discount in undisclosed transactions, Winters and

Southlake acted knowingly or severely recklessly.
