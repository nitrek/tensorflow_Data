COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), files this
Complaint and alleges as follows:

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 1 of 22 PageID #: 1

OVERVIEW
1.

This matter involves an offering fraud that began in approximately

2008 and continues to the present, which was conducted by Defendants James Hugh
Brennan, III (“Brennan”) and Douglas Albert Dyer (“Dyer”), working through their
company, Broad Street Ventures, LLC (“Broad Street”) (collectively “the
Defendants.”)
2.

Although the offering documents stated that only $800,000 would be

raised in total for the Scenic City Companies, Brennan and Dyer offered and sold
over 45 million shares in eight related companies known as Scenic City F10 I-VIII
(collectively, “the Scenic City Companies”), and raised over $5 million dollars from
over 240 investors.
3.

Investors were told that the offerings were to be used to capitalize the

Scenic City Companies, which would register their common stock with the
Commission, such that they would be publicly traded, and then acquire small private
businesses. In fact, although the Defendants have been representing since 2008 that
they are preparing to file Form 10 registration statements with the Commission, the
Defendants have never filed such statements, which are the documents used to
register companies’ securities with the Commission, and there have been no
2

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 2 of 22 PageID #: 2

investments in other businesses. Virtually all of the funds were instead transferred
to Brennan and Dyer and/or used for other purposes.
4.

Although they touted their experience in the securities industry,

Brennan and Dyer also failed to disclose their disciplinary histories with FINRA (the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and the states of California and Tennessee
to investors. FINRA previously barred Brennan from association with a brokerdealer and suspended Dyer from the industry for 60 days.
5.

Relief Defendants Carole Johnson Brennan (“Ms. Brennan”) and Alison

F. Dyer (“Ms. Dyer”) have obtained funds or other assets to which they have no
legitimate claim, and have been unjustly enriched thereby. Specifically, from 2010
through January 2015, Ms. Brennan received $30,000 from Brennan’s account and
Ms. Dyer received $286,000 from Dyer’s account. The sources of these funds were
transfers from Broad Street’s bank account, which in turn received the vast amount
of its funding from investors in the Scenic City Companies.
VIOLATIONS
6.

The Defendants have engaged and, unless restrained and enjoined by

this Court, will continue to engage in acts and practices that constitute and will
constitute violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”)
3

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 3 of 22 PageID #: 3

[15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §
240.10b-5].
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
7.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 22 of

the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v], and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)], to enjoin the Defendants from
engaging in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this
Complaint, and transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business of similar purport
and object, for civil penalties and for other equitable relief.
8.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20 and

22 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t and 77v], and Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].
9.

The Defendants, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails, the

means and instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce
and the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint, and
made use of the mails and the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to
4

effect transactions, or to induce or to attempt to induce the offering fraud alleged in
this Complaint.
10.

THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME
A.

The Scenic City Offerings

17.

Starting in 2008 and continuing at present, Brennan and Dyer, acting

through Broad Street, have engaged in a continuous offering of stock in eight
separate, but similarly named companies, Scenic City F10 I, Inc. through Scenic City
F10 VIII, Inc. (collectively “the Scenic City Companies.”). Each investment was to
be apportioned equally among the Scenic City Companies.
18.

To date, Brennan and Dyer have raised over $5 million from over 240

investors nationwide.
19.

Brennan and Dyer prepared an Executive Summary, which serves as an

offering document and has been shown to prospective investors in the Scenic City
6

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 6 of 22 PageID #: 6

Companies.

The document has been in use, largely unchanged, since 2008.

According to the Executive Summary, the eight Scenic City Companies were
preparing to file Form 10 Registration Statements with the Commission, which
would enable each company’s shares to be publicly traded. An early version of the
Executive Summary stated that the Form 10 filings were expected to be completed in
early 2009; a more recent version altered that wording to state that the filings were
expected to be completed in the first half of 2016.
20.

The Executive Summary also stated that each respective Scenic City

Company was to be a public “blank check” or “shell” company that would merge
with a small private company that wanted to go public, “thereby enabling these . . .
target companies to begin reporting with the SEC and, ultimately, to trade the shares
publicly in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.” According to the Executive
Summary, it was anticipated that the Scenic City Companies would retain an average
of ten percent of the shares of the public entity. The total stated offering amount was
$800,000, with investments to be apportioned equally among the eight Scenic City
Companies.
21.

Brennan and Dyer further stated in the Executive Summary that:
After evaluating, negotiating and completing mergers between these
7

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 7 of 22 PageID #: 7

blank-check Companies and the operating companies, the Scenic City
management anticipates an average public market valuation for each of
the merged entities of approximately $20 million, resulting in initial
trading levels in the $1 per share range.
22.

Combined, these statements represented that each Scenic City Company

investor would receive a return of over 800%
B.

Misrepresentations and Omissions in the Scenic City Offerings.

23.

Brennan and Dyer, through Broad Street and the Scenic City

Companies, made numerous misrepresentations and omissions related to the Scenic
City offerings.

The Defendants have not conducted the Scenic City offering

according to the plan described in the Executive Summary.
24.

First, during the entire eight year offering period, not a single Form 10,

the SEC form use in connection with the initial registration of a class of securities
with the Commission, has ever been filed with the Commission concerning any of
the Scenic City Companies.

Indeed, no evidence has been uncovered that the

Defendants even attempted to file a Form 10 with the Commission. Consequently,
none of the Scenic City Companies’ shares have begun publicly trading and no
reverse mergers have been completed by the Defendants.
25.

The only transaction remotely involving any of the Scenic City
8

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 8 of 22 PageID #: 8

Companies took place just last year, when Dyer arranged for Broad Street to acquire
a very small number of shares in a Minnesota company that had completed a reverse
merger with an unrelated third party shell company, partly as a result of Dyer’s
efforts in making introductions among the various parties. Dyer falsely stated in two
emails to investors, prepared by him and Brennan, that Scenic City F10 VIII, Inc.
had merged with the Minnesota company.
26.

In fact, Broad Street was merely granted shares in the Minnesota

company as a result of its consulting work. These shares were later apportioned to
Scenic City F10 VIII, Inc., but that entity did not merge with the Minnesota
company.
27.

Second, the Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose

accurately the total number of shares sold and outstanding in each of the Scenic City
Companies. Each version of the Executive Summary stated that upon completion of
the offering, there would be 2.2 million shares outstanding in each of the eight
Scenic City Companies, or a total of 17.6 million shares combined. To date, the
evidence indicates that a total of over 45 million shares have been sold and are
outstanding in the Scenic City Companies, averaging approximately 5.6 million
shares per entity. Thus, each shareholder’s interest in the Scenic City Companies is
9

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 9 of 22 PageID #: 9

substantially more diluted than what was represented.
28.

Third, the Executive Summary touts the experience of Brennan and

Dyer, claiming that they had twenty years’ experience seeking equity financing for
growth-stage companies and that they estimated that their investments had achieved
average annual returns of thirty percent. One version of the Executive Summary
lists twenty-one transactions that Brennan and Dyer were supposedly involved in
during their employment in the investment business.

Yet no version of the

Executive Summary discloses their disciplinary histories with FINRA and the states
of California and Tennessee to investors.
29.

For Brennan, the disciplinary history includes

three separate

complaints that FINRA filed in 1998. The first complaint alleged that he failed to
supervise adequately retail trades by Dyer and another representative, and thus failed
to detect excessive mark-downs. The second complaint which was consolidated with
the FINRA action, alleged that Brennan engaged in unauthorized and unsuitable
trading in a customer’s account, claimed falsely that the trades were errors,
overstated the value of the account and guaranteed the customer against losses.
FINRA accepted Brennan’s offers of settlement in both matters, issuing orders in
1999 that censured Brennan, barred him from association with any member, and
10

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 10 of 22 PageID #: 10

fined him $10,000 (with collection efforts suspended unless Brennan were to seek
reentry into the securities industry.)
30.

For Dyer, the disciplinary history includes a complaint filed by

FINRA in 1998 against him, his member firm and others, alleging that Dyer
purchased stock from his retail customers at excessive mark-downs and engaged in
unauthorized trading. In 1999, FINRA accepted Dyer’s offer of settlement and
issued an order censuring him, suspending him from association with any member
for sixty days and fining him $10,000 with collection efforts suspended unless he
were to seek reentry into the securities industry.
31.

In addition, in 2005, the California Department of Corporations issued a

desist-and-refrain order against Brennan, Dyer and a company they operated for the
unauthorized sale of securities issued by the company in that state. In August 2011,
the Tennessee Securities Division concluded an investigation by sending warning
letters to Brennan and Dyer recounting allegations that they had sold unregistered
securities with multiple misrepresentations and omissions and putting them on notice
that, among other things, any future complaints received concerning them would be
viewed with heightened scrutiny.
32.

Finally, on February 22, 2016, the Tennessee Securities Division filed a
11

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 11 of 22 PageID #: 11

cease-and-desist order against Broad Street, Brennan and Dyer, in connection with
the conduct at issue in this matter, alleging that they had sold unregistered securities,
were not registered to sell securities in Tennessee and had engaged in fraud by
failing to disclose the existence of the California desist-and-refrain order.
B.

Misuse of Investor Funds

33.

The Defendants also misrepresented how they would use the funds

raised in the Scenic City offerings. Specifically, Brennan and Dyer diverted virtually
all of the funds raised from Scenic City investors to pay what appears to be their
personal living expenses, as well as to pay for Broad Street’s operating expenses.
34.

The investment funds were deposited into Broad Street’s bank account.

No individual bank accounts exist for any of the Scenic City Companies.
35.

From January 2010 through February 2016, more than 92% of the

money coming into Broad Street’s bank account came from Scenic City investors
($3.98 million vs. $4.32 million total). Approximately $2.1 million was withdrawn
from Broad Street’s bank account. Of this amount, $940,000, or 44%, went to
Dyer’s bank accounts, $348,000, or 16%, was transferred to a bank account in the
name of Ridgecrest Capital Corporation (“Ridgecrest”) and then used by Brennan
for personal expenses, and $455,000, or 21%, was withdrawn by wire transfers.
12

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 12 of 22 PageID #: 12

36.

According to the bank account statements for Ridgecrest from 2010

through 2015, Brennan used the funds deposited in the account for his personal
expenses. For example, he withdrew or transferred approximately (1) $151,000 in
cash; (2) $142,000 to the IRS; (3) $39,000 to various insurance companies; (4)
$30,000 to his wife, Carole J. Brennan; and (5) $6,600 to a cable television
company. These statements do not reflect any type of investments on behalf of the
persons who sent funds to Broad Street for investments in the Scenic City
Companies.
37.

Carole Brennan provided no goods or services in return for the funds

she received from the Ridgecrest account, and was thus unjustly enriched.
38.

Ridgecrest was administratively dissolved in 2006 and Brennan now

uses the Ridgecrest account it as his personal bank account.
39.

Dyer’s bank account statements for this same period show transfers of

(1) $286,000 to his wife, Alison Dyer; (2) $38,000 in cash; (3) $71,466 to various
credit card companies; and (4) $23,500 to a collections agency in 2014. As with
Brennan’s Ridgecrest account, none of the transfers from Dyer’s account suggest
any type of investment on behalf of the persons who sent funds to Broad Street for
investments in the Scenic City Companies.
13

Case 1:16-cv-00307 Document 1 Filed 07/20/16 Page 13 of 22 PageID #: 13

40.

Alison Dyer provided no goods or services in return for the funds she

received, and was thus unjustly enriched thereby.
41.

Virtually none of the funds have been used as represented in the

offering documents or in any way to fund the Scenic City Companies, i.e., to invest
in other companies or to register their securities with the Commission.
