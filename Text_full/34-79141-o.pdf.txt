In the Matter of
Dynamic Response Group, Inc.,
Eagle Telephonics, Inc., and
Far East Energy Corporation,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) that there is a
lack of current and accurate information concerning the securities of Dynamic Response Group,
Inc. (“DRGZ1”) (CIK No. 1098685), a dissolved Florida corporation located in Miami, Florida
with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Securities Exchange Act of
1934 ("Exchange Act") Section 12(g) because it is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2009. On February 19, 2016, the Commission’s Division of Corporation
Finance (“Corporation Finance”) sent a delinquency letter to DRGZ requesting compliance with
its periodic filing requirements but DRGZ did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure
to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule
301 of Regulation S-T, 17 C.F.R. Section 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual). As
of October 13, 2016, the common stock of DRGZ was quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC
Markets Group Inc. (formerly “Pink Sheets”) (“OTC Link”), had four market makers, and was
eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
