In the Matter of
NICHOLAS ROWE

ORDER REGARDING TESTIMONIAL
SUBPOENAS

The hearing in this matter is scheduled to commence on February 1, 2016. I previously
signed and issued testimonial subpoenas at the request of the Division of Enforcement and
Nicholas Rowe. These subpoenas were issued to several potential witnesses, including Edward
Duby, Jr., and Suzanne Duby, who appear on the witness lists of both parties. Rowe has been
unsuccessful in his attempts to serve them with his testimonial subpoenas. The Division has
represented to my office that it has not served the Dubys with its testimonial subpoenas.
According to counsel for the Dubys, the Dubys are currently residing in Florida, but they
have not authorized him to receive the subpoenas on their behalf and have not disclosed their
address. Counsel for the Dubys stated that he has informed them that I am prepared to allow
them to testify by telephone. In a subsequent email to my office, Rowe expressed that he is “at a
loss as to what to do at this time,” given his unsuccessful efforts to serve the Dubys. According
to a public records search by Rowe, the Dubys appear to own a home in Rotonda West, Florida.
Rowe requests guidance on whether he may serve the subpoenas on the Dubys at this address.
It is ORDERED that Rowe serve the testimonial subpoenas and this order on the Dubys
at the Florida address and email electronic versions of the subpoenas to counsel for the Dubys,
who is directed to forward the subpoenas and this order to the Dubys via email. I will deem
such service sufficient. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.103(a), .111(b), .150(b)-(d), .232(c).
From the above circumstances, it appears that the Dubys are aware of Rowe’s testimonial
subpoenas and are avoiding service. It is FURTHERED ORDERED that if the Dubys continue
to avoid service or fail to comply with the subpoenas, they may be referred for subpoena
enforcement proceedings in federal district court.
