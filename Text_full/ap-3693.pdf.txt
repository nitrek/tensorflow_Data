In the Matter of
MARK A. LOPEZ

ORDER POSTPONING HEARING AND
SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On February 24, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. A hearing is currently scheduled for March 21, 2016.
On March 7, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a motion to convert the March 21
hearing to a telephonic prehearing conference and for leave to move for summary disposition.
The motion states that Respondent is incarcerated at the Sheridan Federal Correction Institution
in Oregon and that the Division has spoken to relevant personnel there regarding scheduling, but
has so far been unable to speak to Respondent or receive confirmation that service of the OIP on
him is complete.
The Division’s motion is GRANTED IN PART. I POSTPONE the March 21, 2016,
hearing and ORDER that a telephonic prehearing conference be held at 2:30 p.m. Eastern on that
date. The Division shall coordinate with the correctional institution to arrange for Respondent’s
appearance at the conference.
Because service on Respondent has not yet been established, I DEFER RULING on
whether to grant leave for the filing of summary disposition motions and will address that issue
during the prehearing conference.
