SECOND EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time until
December 7, 2016 to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR 201.1101(a).
On September 29, 2015, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”) against UBS Financial Services
Incorporated of Puerto Rico (“Respondent”).1 The Order required Respondent to pay a total of
$15,000,000.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty to the
Commission and created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended.
In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that additional time is needed
for the appointment of the fund administrator and to finalize the development of the proposed
plan of distribution.
