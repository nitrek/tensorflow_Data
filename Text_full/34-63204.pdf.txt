On March 19, 2010, the Commission issued a “Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution and
Opportunity for Comment” (“Notice”) in connection with this proceeding pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103 (Exchange Act
Release No. 61745). The Notice advised parties that they could obtain a copy of the Plan of Distribution
(“Distribution Plan”) at www.sec.gov. The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on
the Distribution Plan could submit their comments, in writing, within 30 days of the date of the Notice.
No comments were received by the Commission in response to the Notice. On April 30, 2010, the
Commission issued an Order Approving Distribution Plan (Exchange Act Rel. No. 62017).
The Distribution Plan provides that the Fair Fund consisting of disgorgement, civil penalties, plus
any accrued interest be transferred by the Commission to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas for
distribution by the Fund Administrator when a validated list of payees and amounts with the
identification information required to make the distribution has been received and accepted by the staff.
The validated list of payees and amounts, which is in the amount of $9,842,383.88, has been received
and accepted.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $9,842,383.88 of the Fair
Fund to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, and the Fund Administrator shall distribute such
monies to investors, as provided for in the Distribution Plan.
By the Commission.
