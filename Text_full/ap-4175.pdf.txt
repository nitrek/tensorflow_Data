On August 18, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondents Bay City Transfer Agency and Registrar, Inc., and Nitin
M. Amersey. On September 14, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a notice and
accompanying evidence establishing that Amersey controls Bay City, thereby confirming that
both Respondents were served by September 7, 2016, and that both Respondents’ answers are
due September 30, 2016. See Bay City Transfer Agency and Registrar, Inc., Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 4151, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3423 (ALJ Sept. 13, 2016) (noting service and
answer due dates as to Amersey, and conditioning their application to Bay City on the
submission of evidence that Amersey controls Bay City).
A telephonic prehearing conference is scheduled for September 21, 2016, at 11:00 a.m.
Eastern. Id. However, I will be unavailable on September 21 and POSTPONE the prehearing
conference one week to Wednesday, September 28, 2016, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern. Again, Bay
City and Amersey are on notice that failure to file an answer, participate in a prehearing
conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding is grounds for default. OIP at 6; 17 C.F.R. §§
201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).
