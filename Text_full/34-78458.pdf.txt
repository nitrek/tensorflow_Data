In the Matter of
LINDA WOOLF

ORDER DENYING REQUEST TO VACATE BARS
Linda Woolf seeks to vacate a Final Judgment, dated April 16, 2013, to the extent that it
bars her from association with any nationally recognized statistical rating organization
("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1
The Final Judgment, among other things, enjoined Woolf against future violations of the
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. It did not, however, bar her from association
with an NRSRO or a municipal advisor. Accordingly, Linda Woolf's request to vacate NRSRO
and municipal advisor bars is denied.
By the Commission.
