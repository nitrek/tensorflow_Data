In the Matter of

THIRD EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested a third extension of time until
December 30, 2016 to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1101(a).
On June 5, 2015, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Public Administrative
and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933,
Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 102(e) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a
Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”)1 against Computer Sciences Corporation, Michael Laphen,
Michael Mancuso, Wayne Banks, Claus Zilmer, and Paul Wakefield (collectively,
“Respondents”). The Order required Respondents to pay a total of $190,938,390.002 in
disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties to the Commission and created

Securities Act Rel. No. 9804 (June 5, 2015).
The Extension Order issued February 24, 2016 incorrectly stated the Respondents were ordered to pay
$195,078,490.00 (Exchange Act Rel. No. 77223 (Feb. 24, 2016)).

a Fair Fund (“Computer Sciences Fair Fund”) pursuant to Section 308(a) of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002, as amended.
Additionally, in two related district court actions, defendant Wilfred Robert Sutcliffe
(“Sutcliffe”)3 was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $6,003.33 and prejudgment
interest of $1,060.62 and Edward Parker (“Parker”)4 was ordered to pay disgorgement in the
amount of $2,800.00 and prejudgment interest of $750.00, with all district court payments to
be made to the Commission and transferred into the Computer Sciences Fair Fund. With all
payments made, the total fair fund is $190,948,983.95.5
On February 24, 2016, the Commission issued an order extending the Division’s time
until May 30, 2016 to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution.6 On June 22, 2016, the
Commission issued a second order extending the Division’s time until September 30, 2016 to
submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution.7 In its request for a third extension of time, the
Division states that it needs additional time to finalize the proposed plan of distribution.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until December 30, 2016 to submit a Proposed Plan of
Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

The first extension order misstated this amount as $195,089,083.95. Also note, the total fair fund amount is
$20 less than the total of the amounts of the orders to pay entered for all respondents and defendants, because
there was a $20 shortfall in the amount paid by defendant Sutcliffe, which was written off by the Office of
Financial Management pursuant to their applicable delegated authority for de minimis errors.
