ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING
CONFERENCE AND TO
SHOW CAUSE

On March 3, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. I previously notified the parties that a telephonic prehearing conference would be held
on March 22, 2016. Joseph Denard Reid, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3712, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 999 (Mar. 16, 2016).
On March 17, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a declaration of service,
establishing that Respondents were served with the OIP by March 10, 2016, in accordance with
17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(ii), (iv). Accordingly, Respondents’ answers were due by March 23,
2016. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). To date, none of the Respondents has
filed an answer. In addition, none of the Respondents appeared at the March 22 prehearing
conference.
Accordingly, I ORDER Respondents to SHOW CAUSE by April 5, 2016, why the
registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to file
answers, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend this proceeding. If
Respondents fail to respond to this order, they will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be
determined against them, and the registrations of their securities will be revoked. OIP at 4; 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).
