GENERAL INFORMATION

1
SECTION

1

Historical Background
The University of Dayton is a private, coeducational school founded and directed by the
Society of Mary (the Marianists), a Roman Catholic teaching order. It is among the nation’s
largest Catholic institutions of higher learning.
The University had its earliest beginnings in 1850 when the Marianists purchased
Dewberry Farm, located south of Dayton, from Mr. John Stuart and began St. Mary’s School for
Boys, a boarding school for young men.
University status was granted in 1920 when enrollment stood at 171 male students. In
1935, female students were admitted on a full-time basis. Enrollment had passed one thousand
when World War II broke out. By 1950, with the return of the veterans, it was more than 3,500.
Current enrollment figures can be viewed at
http://community.udayton.edu/finadmin/ir/quick_facts.phpi. Sponsored research at the
University began in 1949 with a few faculty members and student assistants doing part-time
research for industry and government agencies. In 1956, the University of Dayton Research
Institute was formed to consolidate the administration of the growing research activities. Annual
research volume has increased from $4,000 in 1949 to over $90 million at the present time.
The main campus, located at the southern edge of the city of Dayton, covers more than
102 acres and is the location of the majority of academic, housing, and recreational facilities.
Other facilities, such as University-owned housing and apartments, as well as the basketball
arena are within walking distance of the main campus.

2

The University of Dayton enrolls students from Dayton, throughout Ohio, other states,
and many foreign countries in more than 75 different undergraduate and more than 60 different
graduate programs. These students have found the University to be an exciting and rewarding
institution in which to attain their academic goals.

Mission of the University

The following is from the University document“A Vision of Excellence and Focusing
the Vision for 20105”, dated September 10, 2004.
The University of Dayton is a comprehensive university committed to offering a broad
range of programs in liberal arts, the sciences, and the professions at the undergraduate level, to
providing selected programs on the graduate level to meet the needs of the community and
region, to sponsoring timely continuing education programs. As comprehensive, the University
views learning and scholarship as a shared task of discovering, integrating, applying and
communicating knowledge at the intersections of liberal and professional education, across the
disciplines, and through combining theory with practice.
As Catholic, the University commits itself to a distinctive vision of learning and
scholarship that includes: a common search for truth based on the belief that truth can be more
fully known and is ultimately one; a respect for the dignity of each human person created in the
image and likeness of God; and an appreciation that God is manifested sacramentally through
creation and the ordinary things in life. Ultimately, a Catholic vision of the intellectual life is

based upon the acceptance of the revelation of God in Jesus Christ as it has been received and
handed on by the Church. This challenge calls for integration of the human and the divine,
reason and faith, and promotes true understanding through a person's head and heart. The
University welcomes persons of all faiths and persuasions to participate in open and reflective
dialogue concerning truth and the ultimate meaning of life.
Founded in the Marianist tradition, the University is committed to a vision of a distinctive
educational community. As Marianist, the University focuses on educating the whole person in
and through a community that supports and challenges all who become a part of it. The
University forms an educational community thriving on collaboration by people from diverse
backgrounds with different skills who come together for common purposes. The University as
Marianist challenges all its members to become servant-leaders who connect scholarship and
learning with leadership and service.
This university community-comprehensive, Catholic and Marianist-exists not for itself, but to
render service. The University creates an environment in which its members, working in a
scholarly manner, are free to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their own work and the
work of others. In partnership, through the Research Institute, Campus Ministry, as well as
numerous student organizations, the University works with others to improve the human
community.

Section 2

The Dignity of Persons Within the University Community and
Standards of Behavior
So God created humankind in his image
In the image of God he created them:
Male and female he created them (Gen 1:27)
A primary assertion of both our religious and civil traditions is the inviolable dignity of
each person. Recognition of and respect for the person are central to our life as a Christian and
education community and are what allow us to pursue our common mission while being many
diverse persons. Thus discrimination, harassment, and any other conduct that diminishes the
worth of a person are incompatible with our fundamental commitment as a Catholic university
conducted in the Marianist tradition.
Every person regardless of race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national or ethnic origin,
sex/gender, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, military status, veteran status, familial
status or disability shall be treated with respect and dignity. No person shall be subject to any
sexual, racial, psychological, physical, verbal or other similar harassment or abuse, or be denied
equitable consideration for access to employment and the programs, services and activities of the
University.
The quality of our campus life and community is dependent on the conduct of each of its
members. The university expects that the behavior of employees will reflect civility, decency and
respect for oneself and others. While certain expectations are more fully elaborated in specific
policies, overall guidance should be respect for the dignity of each person. Failure to observe
these standards of behavior will result in disciplinary action. Such failure is not limited to the
regulations specifically listed in this handbook.

Affirmative Action Policy
The University is committed to policies of affirmative action designed to increase the
employment of minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and protected veterans. Please click
here for the University’s official Affirmative Action Policy. For information on additional HR
policies, please refer to the online University wide policy site at:
http://www.udayton.edu/policies/hr .

Equal Employment Opportunity Policy
In accordance with its Catholic and Marianist mission, the University reaffirms its
commitment to providing equal employment opportunities. Please click here to view the
University’s Equal Employment Opportunity Policy. For information on additional HR policies,

Section 2

Employment of Members of the
Sponsoring Religious Communities
To preserve its traditions and to further the achievement of its mission, the University
maintains a preference for employing members of its two sponsoring religious communities, the
Society of Mary and the Daughters of Mary Immaculate.

Disability Accommodation
The purpose of the Disability Accommodation Policy is to provide guidelines to the
University community to assure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
(ADA), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Revised), the Americans with Disabilities Amendments
Act (ADAAA), and any other related state or local laws. Additionally, this policy supports our
intentions to increase access and inclusion for disabled persons. Please click here to view the
University’s full Disability Accommodation Policy. For information on additional HR policies,
please refer to the online University wide policy site at: http://www.udayton.edu/policies/hr.

Management Prerogatives
The executives and officers of the University of Dayton have been vested with the
exclusive responsibility to operate, manage and direct its assets and employees so as to legally
achieve its objectives.
This right to manage, direct and control the operations of the University of Dayton and its
employees remains vested exclusively with its executives and officers, notwithstanding that this
handbook has been published to reflect the exercise of this exclusive management function.
The rights to manage include, but are not necessarily limited to, the right to establish or
change terms and conditions of employment, plan, control, and direct all of our operations, hire,
transfer employees, maintain efficiency, and to determine and control the methods, processes and
procedures used to meet our objectives.
Management in meeting its responsibilities need not necessarily exercise all of the rights
reserved to it, or if it exercises them in a particular way, it shall not be deemed a waiver or
relinquishment of its right to exercise such rights from time to time in ways that differ from this
handbook. From time to time in the event that changes in this handbook are deemed to be in the
best interest of the University of Dayton, such changes will be published as revisions to this
handbook for purposes of informing and communicating such changes to all employees of the
University of Dayton.
The employee understands and acknowledges that the University of Dayton, as the
employer, from time to time, will make changes in the terms and conditions of employment
contained in this handbook just as it will do so, from time to time, in the rate of pay.
The employee, by accepting employment at the University of Dayton and by receiving
the wages and benefits attributable to his/her position at the University of Dayton, acknowledges
these payments and benefits as consideration for the management prerogatives retained above
and for the right inherent in the University of Dayton to make changes in this employees'
handbook and the terms and conditions of employment, including the assignment of duties or the
reassignment of the employee to a different position, with any appropriate changes in

7

EMPLOYMENT
Section 2
compensation, in the event it deems this to be necessary. By continuing employment after such
changes, the employee ratifies and consents to such changes, and the payment of wages and
benefits thereafter shall be further consideration for such changes.

Employment Records
The Office of Human Resources is the primary custodian of the official employment
records of all staff members employed at the University both past and present.
Every staff member must report changes in personal status including name and address
changes, so that the records properly reflect the current status of every person employed and so
that informational bulletins including earning statements can be sent on a timely basis.
As a matter of policy with regard to employee personal privacy, we will collect and use
only that information that is necessary or relevant to the operating needs of the University.
Internal access will be limited to those who have legitimate business reasons. Information
regarding an employee's home address and telephone number will not be released unless there is
an obvious "need to know" or in case of an emergency. Employees' home addresses and
telephone numbers will not be given to other employees for use in mailings.
The following information is designated as directory information and will be provided
and verified: dates of employment, job title or position, and department. All other information
maintained in the personnel file for all staff members is considered confidential and is released
only after written request and consent of the employee. Information will be released to
government agencies when required by federal and state laws. Information may be disclosed in
response to summons, judicial order or subpoena.
All reference checks by outside employers requesting information on current or former
employees and verification of employment must be referred to the Office of Human Resources.
Departments should not release information. The Office of Human Resources is authorized to
reply to inquiries by verifying dates of employment and termination and job titles and
department.
The employee's personnel file shall be available for examination and review by the
employee. Such review or examination shall take place during regular business hours in the
Office of Human Resources in the presence of the record's custodian or his/her designee, and
only upon prior notice. Employees will be required to sign a written form requesting access to
his/her file and present valid identification.

Employment Process
The following hiring procedures apply for all non-faculty positions at the University of
Dayton. Where indicated, the hiring procedures for the Research Institute may differ. In addition,
where indicated, certain procedures may only apply for exempt positions (e.g. administrative/
professional.)

General Information about the Employment Process
The grade level and job classification should be determined in conjunction with the
Office of Human Resources.

8

EMPLOYMENT
Section 2
No testing should be administered by departments without prior approval and
coordination with the Office of Human Resources. Under the law, all testing must be validated to
show a correlation between performance on the test and performance on the job.
In selecting a candidate for a position, factors used in evaluating a candidate must be job
related and non-discriminatory. Examples of job-related criteria include an evaluation of the
candidate's experience, education, skills, abilities and knowledge. Statements that a candidate is
"overqualified" or "not a good fit" will not be accepted as job-related criteria. Examples of
discriminatory factors include race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national or ethnic origin,
sex/gender, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, military status, veteran status, familial
status or disability. A supervisor should consult with the Office of Compliance and Affirmative
Action when she/he believes that age or sex may constitute a bona fide occupational qualification
for a position.
It is advisable that reference checks be completed on the final candidate(s). Supervisors
must never contact the candidate's current employer/supervisor unless permission is obtained
from the candidate. Upon request, reference checks will be made by the Office of Human
Resources. In addition, the University has a formal agreement with an investigative agency to
perform a pre-employment criminal conviction history investigation (background check) on all
new hires and rehires who have been gone 90 days or longer.
Personnel Requisition and Essential Position Functions Form
When a vacancy for a non-faculty position must be filled for at least 90 days (3 months),
the position description must be created or modified on the online position management system,
PeopleAdmin (http://jobs.udayton.edu/hr). Once all the necessary departmental approvals have
been obtain, Human Resources will review the position for grade level and job classification
before it can be posted. The position must be approved by the Office of Human Resources and
posted on the University of Dayton’s career website before any recruitment activity is pursued.
Posting Requirements
When the Office of Human Resources approves and posts the position description, the
requestor will receive an email with specific written procedures that must be followed in the
recruitment process. These instructions serve as an extension of the policy manual and must be
followed. Position openings must be posted for a minimum of ten working days. Requests for
exceptions to the normal posting procedure must be made to the Office of Human Resources. A
decision will be made after consultation with the Office of Compliance and Affirmative Action.
A request to bypass the normal hiring procedure must be accompanied by a detailed written
request, a current copy of the job description and the proposed candidate's resume or
employment application.
Recruitment/Advertising
As reflected in the University Mission Statement, it is a goal of the University of Dayton to
ensure diversity among faculty, staff and students. Thus, it is important that we strive to recruit
persons who reflect the diversity of the reasonable recruitment area. For University

9

EMPLOYMENT
Section 2
administrative and professional positions, supervisors are required to discuss their recruitment
plan with the Office of Compliance and Affirmative Action. It is the normal practice of the
University to advertise in appropriate newspapers and journals as well as on the World Wide
Web, and to utilize resources designed to target female and minority populations. The Office of
Compliance and Affirmative Action is available to advise and assist supervisors in determining
where advertisements should be placed. When ready to place an advertisement, the hiring
supervisor must contact the Office of Human Resources. All advertisements will include a brief
job description and a list of required and preferred qualifications. In addition, all advertisements
must include the following diversity statement: “The University of Dayton, founded in 1850 by
the Society of Mary, is a Top Ten Catholic research university. To attain its Catholic and
Marianist mission, the University is committed to the principles of diversity, inclusion and
affirmative action and to equal opportunity policies and practices. We act affirmatively to recruit
and hire women, traditionally under-represented minority groups, persons with disabilities and
veterans.”
Receipt of Resume/Application and Affirmative Action Compliance Form
Applicants will apply electronically to the posting and submit their application as well as
any required documents such as a resume, cover letter, letter of reference, etc. The search
committee will access application materials online via PeopleAdmin. For Affirmative Action
purposes demographic /compliance information will be voluntarily collected from the applicant
as part of the application process online.
By conducting applicant tracking for all positions, the Office of Compliance and
Affirmative Action can monitor the success of recruitment efforts and work with supervisors to
ensure that a diverse pool of candidates is achieved. Once a posting closes, The Office of
Compliance and Affirmative Action will review the diversity of the applicant pool and prepare
an Applicant Flow Data Log, which will be kept on file. The Applicant Flow Data Log indicates
whether the applicant pool is representative and includes both gender and race diversity. If a
department is underutilized in female and/or minority representation and the applicant pool does
not reflect gender or racial diversity, the Office of Compliance and Affirmative Action will
contact the hiring supervisor to discuss the matter.
Pre-interview Process
The search committee has the responsibility of reviewing all applications and/or resumes
received during the application process. Prior to interviewing, the hiring supervisor must assign
a rating, status, selection reason (if applicable) and request permission from the Office of
Compliance and Affirmative action to begin interviews. This process will assist the Office of
Compliance and Affirmative Action in reviewing the qualifications of each applicant and will
provide adequate documentation should an applicant challenge why he/she was not offered an
interview for the position. If the diversity of the applicant pool for a particular position does not
reflect the availability of persons within the reasonable recruitment area, the Office of
Compliance and Affirmative Action may contact the hiring supervisor to discuss the next steps.
Interview Process

10

EMPLOYMENT
Section 2
Interview questions must be designed to provide fair and objective evaluation of each
candidate and should be developed in advance of committee interviews with candidates. A set of
identical questions should be asked of all candidates and questions must be job- related.
Hiring Proposal and Job Offer Process
After a selection has been made and before an employment offer has been extended, the
hiring supervisor must recommend the selected applicant for hire and complete a hiring proposal
through the online PeopleAdmin system. The hiring proposal should have the narrative interview
summary document attached. The narrative interview summary must specify job-related
distinctions between candidates and list all relevant and job-related information, which
contributed to the selection of one candidate over another. The hiring proposal should be
submitted to the Office of Compliance and Affirmative Action through the online system. The
hiring supervisor will be notified when the hiring proposal has been approved. After receiving
the approval from the Employment Manager, a verbal offer of employment can be made to the
candidate. When making the offer, the hiring supervisor must inform the candidate that the offer
is contingent upon the successful results of the background check. An offer packet including the
contingent offer letter and new hire paperwork will be sent by mail to the new hire. The Office
of Human Resources conducts any and all applicable background checks on the final candidate
once they have received the signed authorization form.
After the employment offer has been made an ePAF will be initiated within PeopleAdmin
by Human Resources. The information completed and approved in the PeopleAdmin system will
be used to generate the ePAF that will be reviewed and approved in Human Resources. The new
staff member is to be directed to the Office of Human Resources prior to the first day of work
with the appropriate form(s) of identification for the I-9 form. The following is a list of new hire
paperwork that should be completed before their first day of work.
Employment Eligibility Verification form (I-9);
Federal Withholding Certificate (W-4);
State Withholding Certificate (IT4);
Employee Data Sheet
Benefits-eligible employees will be contacted to attend a meeting on University benefits.
All new staff members are to complete the above documents in the Office of Human Resources,
118 St. Mary's Hall.
It is the responsibility of the immediate supervisor to obtain the appropriate keys and
equipment for a new staff member.
Temporary Employees
The University realizes the need for temporary or seasonal employees. Employment
agencies may be utilized to assist in temporary situations. In all cases, the Office of Human
Resources should be contacted before any temporary employee is hired. Long term temporary
positions (in excess of 90 calendar days) must be posted and the University's hiring procedure
11

EMPLOYMENT
Section 2
must be followed unless an exception is approved by the Office of Human Resources and the
Office of Compliance and Affirmative Action. Unless utilizing an employment agency, a
Personnel Action Form (PAF) and background check must be completed along with the other
necessary documentation (see previous page) before an employee begins work. The PAF should
also reflect a beginning and ending employment date for all assignments as approved by the
Office of Human Resources.
Independent Contractors
It is generally assumed that persons providing services to the University will be
considered an employee under one of the two types of positions above (exempt and non-exempt)
and will be paid through the University payroll as a result of a Personnel Action Form being
processed. Occasionally, however, it may be appropriate to pay someone for services as an
"independent contractor" on the basis of a "check request" submitted to either the purchasing
office, St. Mary's Hall room 403 or to the accounting office, Kettering Laboratories room 508 for
the Research Institute.
Federal regulations state that an independent contractor is one who carries on an
independent business, contracts to do a piece of work according to his/her own means and
methods and is subject to control only as to results. Of particular importance is the intent of the
parties. The parties' intent to create an independent contractor relationship must be documented.
Factors which are considered, among others, are whether the individual or entity:
a.

Supplies the tools or materials;

b.

Makes services available to the general public;

c.

Works for a number of clients at the same time;

d.

Directs the order or sequence in which the work is to be done;

e.

Determines the hours during which the work is to be done;

f.

Performs different type of work than regular employees;

g.

Is paid by the job as opposed to by the hour, week, or month;

h.

Has the right to delegate work and the right to hire/fire assistants.

The independent contractor designation is possible only where very specific conditions
are met. Since the University may be legally liable where this designation is misused, it is very
important that the Office of Human Resources be contacted in advance when there is any
question in this matter so as to ensure that the activities to be performed qualify for the
designation of independent contractor.

Staff Background Check Policy
Purpose:

12

EMPLOYMENT
Section 2
The purpose of this policy is to describe the terms and conditions under which background
checks are conducted. The University of Dayton is a comprehensive Catholic university, a
diverse community committed, in the Marianist tradition, to educating the whole person and to
linking learning and scholarship with leadership and service. The University of Dayton believes
that hiring qualified individuals to positions contributes to the University's overall strategic
success. Background checks serve as an important part of the selection process.
Policy:
The University of Dayton conducts background checks on all full-time, part-time and temporary
faculty and staff employees post-offer (contingency offer) as well as non-employees who are not
on the University’s payroll, but are on campus serving in various roles such as, volunteers,
contractors, visiting researchers, consultants, etc. The University of Dayton may also use a third
party administrator to conduct background checks. The type of information that can be collected
by this agency includes, but is not limited to, a criminal background check, education,
employment history, credit, and professional and personal references. This process is conducted
to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the candidate and determine his/her
suitability for employment.
The University of Dayton will ensure that all background checks are held in compliance with
applicable federal and state statutes, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
All criminal background screens are conducted post-offer (contingency offer). However, as part
of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, this information cannot be used as a basis for denying
employment, unless it is determined to be job-related.
The University of Dayton reserves the right to make the sole determination concerning
information or any employment decision arising out of the background check.
The University of Dayton requires all non-employees who routinely perform work on campus to
be in compliance with this policy.
Offer of Employment Process
Once a candidate has been identified for hire, the hiring manager submits a hiring proposal to the
Office of Affirmative Action. Once the Office of Affirmative Action approves the hiring
proposal, they will notify the Office of Human Resources. At that time, the hiring manager will
be notified to extend an offer of employment to the finalist.
When verbally making the offer of employment to the successful candidate, the hiring manager
must inform the candidate that the offer is contingent upon the successful results of the
background check. The Office of Human Resources then conducts any and all applicable
background checks on the final candidate.
General Guidelines:

Section 2
NEW HIRES: Background checks are required for all new hires. This includes all fulltime, part-time and temporary faculty and staff employees. The background check must
be completed and results verified before any employee begins work. At no time should
an employee begin work until the Office of Human Resources has verified results of the
background check.
REHIRES: A background check is required for all rehires that have been separated for
longer than 90 days.
NON-EMPLOYEES: Non-employees who will be working on campus continuously for
more than 90 days will be subject to a background check.
EMPLOYMENT CONTINGENCY: Background checks are to be processed after a
contingent offer of employment has been extended to the applicant. Note: The offer of
employment is contingent upon the successful results of the background check.
AUTHORIZATION BY APPLICANT: The candidate must authorize the background
check. This is done by having the applicant complete the Employment Background
Authorization form. This form is available to the applicant on the University of Dayton
website and can be sent via e-mail to the candidate as well. To expedite the process, the
candidate may fax the completed and signed form to the Office of Human Resources.

Note: All applicants must complete a Employment Background Authorization form as this is
required to be submitted to the third party administrator conducting the background check.
Verification of Background Checks
1. The results of the background check will be sent directly to the Office of Human
Resources.
2. The Employment Manager will review the report. If any discrepancies or criminal
history are noted, the Employment Manager will notify the Vice President of Human
Resources and Legal Affairs for final determination. The University reserves the right to
consult with the hiring department, or any other pertinent offices such as the Office of the
President or the Office of the Provost.
3. If the background check is favorable, the Office of Human Resources will notify the
hiring manager that the candidate is approved to begin employment.
Adverse Action Notifications
1. If a background check is returned with unfavorable results, the Office of Human
Resources will notify the hiring manager.
2. The Office of Human Resources will contact the candidate to inform him/her that the
University of Dayton is rescinding its contingent offer of employment. The candidate
will then receive written notification and a summary of the candidate’s rights under the
Fair Credit Reporting Act. The candidate will be given the opportunity to review a copy
of the report, which informs him/her of his/her rights to dispute inaccurate information.
3. The candidate may apply for job opportunities at the University of Dayton after one (1)
year has passed from the date that the contingent offer of employment was rescinded.

COMPENSATION MANAGEMENT
Section 3

Wage and Salary Administration
Each position at the University is defined as exempt or nonexempt based on the duties
and responsibilities of that position as stated in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Each
position is classified and is assigned a specific pay range by the Office of Human Resources. The
Office of Human Resources reviews specific positions to ensure that positions are correctly
classified and that job descriptions reflect any changes in the duties and responsibilities of the
position. The FLSA also requires that employers pay employees a minimum wage for each hour
worked and must pay nonexempt employees overtime pay at the rate of one and one-half times
the employee's regular rate for each hour worked over forty in a work week. For more
information on FLSA work time recordkeeping requirements for non-exempt employees, please
click on the FLSA Time/Recordkeeping FAQ (pdf).

Categories of Appointment and Pay Ranges
The policy of the University is to attempt to maintain pay rates that are competitive in the
appropriate local and national markets, taking into consideration the University's fiscal position
and its geographic location. All pay ranges are established and maintained by the Office of
Human Resources, St. Mary's Hall Room 118.

Wage and Pay Changes
Wage and pay recommendations following initial hire are submitted on a fiscal year basis
by principal administrators at the time budgets are prepared. Guidelines are established by the
Office of Human Resources and are distributed to each office annually along with budget
information. Pay increases are generally effective July 1 of each year.

Pay Procedures
Most employees are paid on a semi-monthly basis. The semi-monthly payment for time
worked through the 15th of each month is made on the 25th of that month. Payment for the
balance of the month is made on the 10th of the following month. In the event the 10th or 25th
falls on a Saturday, Sunday, holiday, or on a day that University is closed for normal business,
payment is made on the preceding workday. Employees in certain departments, such as public
safety are paid on a bi-weekly basis. They receive payment every other Friday for their services
during the two week work period ending on the preceding Sunday.
If you have any questions or problems regarding your paycheck, the check should not be
cashed until contact is made with the payroll office, St. Mary's Hall Room 303, (ext. 2949), by
the employee and/or the supervisor. Research Institute employees should contact the Research
Accounting Office, Kettering Laboratories Room 508, (ext. 3947).
Paychecks are not available before payday.
The University provides direct deposit service for staff members with any bank or credit
union in the United States. An authorization form to initiate the process is available in the payroll
office, St. Mary's Hall Room 303, or the Office of Human Resources. Day Air Credit Union and
Wright Patt Credit Union ask that their account holders sign up for this service at a branch office

21

COMPENSATION MANAGEMENT
Section 3
and they will forward this information to the University. It is recommended that staff members
take advantage of this service as a convenience both for themselves and for the University.

Overtime
Administrative and professional staff members are considered to be exempt employees
and thus are not compensated for overtime work. Exempt employees are compensated with a
salary and are not subject to federal law governing the regulation of overtime.
All secretarial/clerical staff and technicians including Research technicians are
nonexempt employees. Based upon the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), if these employees
work extra hours they must be compensated in the following manner: All hours worked up to 40
hours in one workweek are to be paid at the staff member's regular hourly rate. Hours worked in
excess of 40 hours in any one workweek must be paid at time and one half the regular hourly rate
in accordance with law. In case of nonexempt staff members whose pay rate is quoted on other
than an hourly basis, the payroll office will calculate hourly equivalent pays for the above
purpose. Any overtime worked is to be approved in advance by the appropriate supervisor.
For the purposes of computing overtime, the University of Dayton workweek begins at
12:01 a.m. Monday, and runs continuously until 12:00 midnight, Sunday. Overtime is computed
based on actual hours worked, i.e., if the staff member takes a vacation day or calls in sick during
the workweek and then works extra hours during the same workweek, payment will be paid at
the regular hourly rate until the actual hours worked reaches 40. Overtime must be reported on
the Weekly Overtime Report form that is available in the payroll office. Research Institute
employees must submit a separate employee activity report (time card).
The Office of Human Resources must always be contacted prior to an employee working
additional services for another University department and account. Any time an employee works
additional hours in a department other than the employee's primary department and exceeds a
total of 40 hours in a workweek, the secondary department will be responsible for paying the
employee in accordance with the law. A special calculation is used for determining the overtime
pay. Please contact the Office of Human Resources or the research accounting office, for
assistance in determining the actual overtime rate of pay in such cases.

Payroll Deductions
The following is a list of deductions that either must or may be taken through the payroll
process.

Taxes
1. F.I.C.A. (SOCIAL SECURITY/MEDICARE) - The University makes payroll deductions
as required by law. The University, as an employer, is required to match employee
contributions and to forward the combined amount to the appropriate governmental
agency in the employee's name.
2. FEDERAL INCOME TAX is deducted on a regular basis. The amount withheld and
forwarded to the Internal Revenue Service is based on the number of exemptions a staff
member claimed on the withholding exemption certificate filed at the time of
employment or as changed by the staff member subsequent to employment. The rate of
22

COMPENSATION MANAGEMENT
Section 3
withholding is determined from tables published by the Internal Revenue Service and is
based on the gross amount of payment due to an employee on a specific pay date.

the Dayton city limits.
5. SCHOOL DISTRICT TAX is deducted from payroll checks of employees who reside in
school districts that have passed School District Income Tax (SDIT).
6. TAX ON LIFE INSURANCE - Employer paid life insurance over $50,000 is considered
by the IRS as a taxable benefit. The IRS provides a table based on age, to dictate the cost
per $1,000 of coverage per month, regardless of the actual premium amount the
University pays for the insurance benefit. The University is required to report this cost as
income to the employee and withhold the appropriate taxes.
7. TAX ON GRADUATE TUITION REMISSION - Tuition remission for graduate classes
for children or spouse is a taxable benefit and the appropriate social security, federal,
state and city taxes will be withheld on the benefit. Tuition remission for graduate classes

Research Institute are normally open for services from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through
Friday.

Lunch Period
The normal unpaid lunch period provided staff members is one hour and, in general,
should be taken between 11:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., the actual time to be arranged so as not to
unnecessarily inconvenience the effectiveness of the operation in which a staff member is
employed. Whenever possible and when practicable offices should remain open during this
period, in the event more than one person is assigned to an office operation. To the extent
possible, all staff members are encouraged to leave their respective work areas during their lunch
period so as to enjoy this opportunity to relax. It is not in the best interest of all concerned for
staff members to partake of lunch in business and academic offices that are open and accessible
to the publics served. Public dining facilities are available in the Kennedy Union. Non-exempt
employees working a shift of 5-1/2 hours or more are entitled to at least a 30 minute unpaid meal
break. Non-exempt employees working a shift of 3-1/2 hours but less than 5-1/2 hours are
entitled to, when possible, a paid 15 minute rest period.

Rest Periods
When possible, nonexempt employees will be allowed two paid 15-minute rest periods
during each regular shift each workday. These rest periods should be scheduled during the
middle two hours of each half shift. The time taken should be such as not to disrupt the normal
operations or create a situation that might appear discourteous to members of the University

assignments at the University are service oriented to the students and the community.

Procedures for Reporting Illness and Absence
When an employee is unable to report to work as scheduled, the employee's immediate
supervisor or another designated person should be notified as early as possible prior to the start
of the workday.
Excessive absences or failure to properly notify the employee's supervisor of an absence
may be cause for disciplinary action.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT WORKING FOR THE VISION

SECTION

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT - WORKING FOR THE VISION
Section 4
The University's performance management program is known as Working for the Vision.
Working for the Vision is an annual performance management cycle that directly involves both
supervisor or academic administrator and the employee and activities included in the four major
components depicted below:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Planning performance
Managing performance
Assessing results
Career development

Annual performance development plans are completed for all staff members. For Research
Institute employees, the performance development plan is normally completed in March and
April. For all other employees, the plan is completed in late January or February. Forms and
instructions for the performance development plan are available on the Human Resources Web
site (http://www.udayton.edu/~hr/). After the plan is completed and signed by the employee and
supervisor, it is to be reviewed and signed by the appropriate higher-level supervisor. Copies are
then distributed to the staff member, the immediate supervisor, and the Office of Human
Resources for placement in the employee's file.
Working for the Vision assumes that employees are in the best position to identify the
activities they should perform to support the success of their units. If they are knowledgeable,
equipped to meet the challenges of their jobs, motivated, supported, and empowered to perform,
their capability to maximize their individual performance is enhanced. If all employees in a unit
are successful and maximize their individual performance, the overall performance of the unit is
maximized. If they are successful and are recognized and rewarded for their accomplishments,
their satisfaction with their job and the University will be higher.
The Working for the Vision program is a human resource process aimed at creating a
strong campus community by empowering and equipping all employees of the University to be
able to participate in achieving the Vision. It is intended to enable every employee to:


Be involved in planning the programs and projects of importance to the success of their
unit and defining their role in accomplishing them



Know what is expected of their performance by involving them in defining the criteria
that will be used to measure their success,



Be more self-managed



Receive feedback and assistance when they can actually use it to make any needed
adjustments in performance



Be more proactive in defining career objectives and involving their supervisor or
academic administrator in assisting them in achieving their goals,



Be confident that their contributions to the University are recognized and rewarded.



The Working for the Vision program plays a critical role in allowing the University of

Sexual Harassment)
The University’s Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy prohibits unlawful
discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national or ethnic origin,
sex/gender, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, military status, veteran status, familial
status or disability. Sexual harassment, which includes but is not limited to sexual violence, is
one form of sex/gender discrimination. The full Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy

Equity Complaint Process, and the Mandatory Reporting Policy.

33

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7
The Equity Complaint Process describes the process used in resolving complaints brought under
the Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy. The Nondiscrimination Resource Center
also provides “How It Works: A Quick Guide,” which provides a brief, easy to understand
explanation of the process.
The Mandatory Reporting Policy imposes a duty on all employees, including student employees,
to report promptly any information regarding potential violations of the Nondiscrimination and
Anti-Harassment Policy to the Title IX/504 Coordinator and Equity Compliance Officer. The
only exceptions to the mandatory reporting requirement involve employees who are clergy,
counselors or doctors acting in that capacity when someone tells them of a
discrimination/harassment concern. To view the Mandatory Reporting Policy in its entirety,
please click here.
The policies and process described above apply to all members of the University community
(i.e., staff, faculty, student and visitor), except faculty may use the faculty grievance process for
discrimination complaints that do not involve sex/gender.

Human Resources Advisory Council
Members of the Human Resources Committee are appointed by the vice president for
human resources from among the faculty and staff. It advises the vice president of human
resources on matters related to working conditions and employee benefits. The membership of
this committee is listed along with other University committees in the Campus Report each fall.
All employees should feel free to contact committee members regarding their concerns.

Personal Appearance and Attire
A good personal appearance, of all University employees, is essential to creating and
maintaining a favorable public image. Employees are expected to dress in a manner consistent
with the nature of work performed and the people served. Employees who have questions
concerning what constitutes proper attire should consult with their immediate supervisor.
Employees are also expected to observe and maintain proper habits of personal grooming and
hygiene at all times.

Name Badges
Wearing of name badges or other forms of identification may be required of certain
employees, e.g., those who meet the public or those who need to have access to restricted areas.
Questions concerning the wearing of a name badge should be directed to the immediate
supervisor with the determination resting with the appropriate vice president.

Uniforms
Uniforms are defined as special garments worn for identification and/or to present a
clean, sanitary, consistent appearance or, in some cases, for safety precautions. They may consist
of shirts, pants, jackets, dresses, coats (long or short), aprons or head coverings of a prescribed
color and tailoring.

34

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7

particular occupation; (b) identification is needed for the expeditious performance of one's
function or to provide evidence of authority or privilege; (c) there is need for a controlled
standard of cleanliness and sanitation of clothing; (d) the performance of job tasks causes
abnormal wear or soiling of clothing.

Confidentiality and Security of University Property
It is the policy of the University to maintain strict control over access to work locations,
records, computer information, and cash or other items of monetary value. Employees who are
assigned keys, given special access or assigned job responsibilities in connection with the safety,
security or confidentiality of such records, materials, equipment, or items of monetary or
business value will be required to use sound judgment and discretion in carrying out their duties
and will be held accountable for any wrongdoing or acts of indiscretion.
Information about the University of Dayton, its students, clients or employees should not
be divulged to anyone other than persons who have a right to know and are authorized to receive
such information. When in doubt as to whether certain information is or is not confidential,
prudence dictates that no disclosures be provided without first clearly establishing that such
disclosure has been authorized by appropriate supervisory or management personnel.
This basic policy of caution and discretion in the handling of confidential information
extends to both external and internal disclosure. Confidential information obtained as a result of
employment with the University of Dayton is not to be used by an employee for the purpose of
furthering any private interest or as a means of making personal gains. Use or disclosure of such
information can result in civil or criminal penalties, both for individuals involved and for the
University of Dayton.

Conflict of Interest Policy
The University of Dayton’s Conflict of Interest Policy is intended to provide a
framework for recognizing and managing employee conflicts of interest, and whenever possible,

Conflict of Interest Policy for Sponsored Research Programs
1.

Introduction

Research is a significant and essential part of the University of Dayton's mission as a
nonprofit, private educational institution. The University intends to serve society by converting
the results of its research into products, processes, and services that will be available in the
marketplace. To secure the resources necessary to support research, the University encourages
its employees to seek and participate in externally-sponsored research projects funded by
government agencies, foundations, nonprofit organizations, and industry, as well as Universitysponsored projects.

35

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7
In some instances, the most effective means of reducing technology to practice requires
active participation by a scientific investigator in a private enterprise as an advisor or consultant.
Participation in these activities may pose real or apparent conflicts with the integrity and
objectivity of research at the University, and with the investigator's professional commitment to
the University. Consequently, the purpose of this Conflict of Interest Policy for all university
employees engaged in sponsored research programs is to raise awareness of the duties and
responsibilities involved in resolving these potential conflicts.
When a University employee engages in a federally-sponsored project, the employee’s
conduct is subject to the provisions of various federal statutes and regulations. When he or she
consults for a business, non-profit agency, government agency, or other non-University
contractor or prospective contractor in the same technical field as the externally sponsored
project, care must be taken to avoid biasing the design, conduct, or reporting of the sponsored
project. If performing consulting services, the employee must fully disclose such interests to the
University and to the contractor insofar as they might appear to relate to the work at the
University or for the contractor. A real or apparent conflict of interest could arise, for example,
when a University employee participates, on behalf of a government agency or one of its
contractors, in the evaluation of the work (or proposed work) of another organization, or a
competitor, with which the employee has a consulting or employment relationship, or a
significant financial interest.
This policy promotes objectivity in research and other sponsored activities by defining
standards of conduct appropriate for each University employee participating in a sponsored
project. The intent is to ensure that sponsored research activities are neither compromised nor
appear to be compromised by any other interest of the responsible University employee.

2.
2.1

Definitions
Employee

The term "Employee" refers to any individual who has accepted full- or part-time
employment at the University of Dayton and receives compensation for such employment. This
includes all faculty and staff positions (including researchers).
2.2

Investigator

The term "investigator" refers to the principal investigator, co-investigator, or any other

reporting of externally-funded research or educational activities.
2.3

Conflict of Interest

Conflict of interest means an action, omission, or situation which may appear to
compromise the objectivity or integrity of an investigator’s design, conduct, or reporting of a
sponsored research project. A University employee is considered to have a conflict of interest
when the employee or any member of the employee's family (1) has an existing or potential
financial or other material interest that impairs or appears to impair the employee's independence

36

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7
and objectivity in the discharge of responsibilities to the University, or (2) may receive a
financial or other material benefit through inappropriate use of knowledge or information
confidential to the University, its sponsors, customers or suppliers. (See Section 3.3 for

daughter-in-law, or any other member of a household.
2.5

Conflict of Commitment

A conflict of commitment exists when an employee undertakes external commitments
that burden or interfere with the employee's obligations to the University.
2.6

Significant Financial Interest

A significant financial interest is anything of monetary value, including but not limited to
salary or other payments for services (e.g., consulting fees or honoraria); equity interests (e.g.,
stocks, stock options, or other ownership interests); and intellectual property rights (e.g., patents,
copyrights, and royalties from such rights) from organizations other than the University. The

aggregated for the employee and/or the employee’s family.

For employees in an academic department, the Appeal Officer is the Dean of the college
or school.
For an employee of the Research Institute, the Appeal Officer is the Director of the
Research Institute.
Gratuity

37

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7
Employees shall not offer or give entertainment, gifts or gratuities to representatives or
employees of sponsors, other than customary business courtesies that are reasonable in frequency
and value. Employees must be aware that customary business courtesies may differ depending
on the sponsor. For example, federal sponsors are under very strict requirements regarding gifts
and gratuities. Offering or giving any payment, gift, or other thing of value to such a person for
the purpose of obtaining or acknowledging favorable treatment (a “kickback”) may be a crime.
2.10

Sponsored Research Program

A sponsored research program is an individual contract or multiple contracts (Various),
grants and other purchase orders with defined statements of work, and is identified by the first
four digits of the account structure in the IFAS financial system. The first four digits of the
program are unique to an individual sponsor, except in the case of a Various program.

3.
3.1

Policy Statements
Scope

This policy applies to all University of Dayton employees who apply for, receive, or who
are currently working on a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, subgrant, subcontract, or
subcooperative agreement which is funded in whole or in part by any internal or external source
(federal, state, or private).
3.2

General Statement

The federal government has established technology transfer and economic
competitiveness as national priorities and actively encourages the development of relationships
between universities, government agencies, and industry to meet these objectives. However,
such relationships increase the risk of conflicts between the private interests of individuals and
those of the companies with which they are involved, or the public interests that government
funding is required to serve.
Each employee is expected to maintain a professional loyalty to the University and to
arrange outside obligations and financial interests such that they do not interfere with the basic
principles of research integrity, academic freedom, business development ethics, and public
interest. When performing research for government or private interest, or engaging in other
activities in which a conflict may arise, the employee must protect the integrity of all research
done at the University, future development of the University, and the good name of the
University. Furthermore, employees must refrain from unauthorized use of the University's
name or exploitation of their affiliation with the University for inappropriate purposes or private
gain.
University employees charged with the supervision of research, as well as those directly
engaged in research, have an obligation to act in an ethical manner. Supervisors of research
activities must ensure that employees are not placed in situations that could constitute conflicts
of interest or commitment.

38

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7
3.3

Disclosure Requirement

To minimize the occurrence of conflict of interest and identify situations where such
conflict might exist, the University requires annual disclosure statements from its employees.
The University will disclose all known conflicts of interest to sponsors when it cannot
satisfactorily manage an actual or potential conflict of interest.
When an employee engaging in externally sponsored work has a financial interest in a
business or with a non-profit agency, it is important to avoid actual or apparent conflicts between
obligations to the project sponsor, the University, and these outside interests. A conflict of
interest occurs when an employee compromises, or appears to compromise, the conduct of a
project due to an outside relationship that directly or indirectly affects the financial interests of
the employee or the employee’s family. Although financial interests are most often the source of
conflicts of interest, any situation that would compromise the objectivity or integrity of the
employee’s performance of duties on a sponsored research project are considered conflicts of
interest whether financially motivated or not.
Situations in which conflicts of interest may arise, or may be perceived to arise, include,
but are not limited to:
1. Undertaking an externally funded project when the employee has a significant financial
interest which may, or may be perceived to, bias the design, conduct, or reporting of the
research activity;
2. Purchasing items or services using project funds from an organization in which the employee
or members of their family have a significant financial interest;
3. Using for personal gain, or transmitting to a business or non-profit agency, externally
sponsored work products or proprietary information that are not made generally available.
This does not preclude appropriate licensing arrangements for inventions, or consulting in the
area of an externally sponsored project where there is significant additional work by the staff
member independent of the externally sponsored project;
4. Unauthorized use of privileged or confidential information acquired in connection with
externally-sponsored activities;
5. Influencing or attempting to influence the negotiation of grants or contracts between the
University and private organizations in which the employee or members of their family have
a significant financial interest;
6. Accepting gratuities or special favors from private firms with which the University does
business in connection with an externally-sponsored project, or offering gratuities or special
favors to representatives of these external organizations;
7. Entering a consulting arrangement with any organization or individual having a financial
interest in the results of an externally-funded project;
8. Proposing an externally-funded project to a sponsor for which the employee serves on the
sponsor's board of directors or as an officer with fiscal responsibility.
9. Involvement in any off-campus entrepreneurial venture or business in which the employee is
a principal;
10. Accepting employment or engaging in uncompensated activities outside the University that
conflicts with University duties and responsibilities;

39

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7
11. Having any significant financial interests in any firm or entity that supplies or is likely to
supply (other than a donation) equipment, materials, or services for work being performed at
the University;
12. Having any significant financial interests in, or research support from, any firm that markets,
produces, or has in pre-market testing a commercial product or product line that the
employee's work is intended either to evaluate or to further develop;
13. Having any significant financial interest with parties whose financial interest would be, or to
a reasonable observer familiar with the facts, would seem to be directly and significantly
affected by research or other work to be performed by the employee;
14. Having any other significant investment or interest by an employee or members of their
family in an external business organization that parallels activities in which the University is
currently engaged or prospectively engaged, whether or not the employee has undertaken to
perform continuing work or services for them.
15. Having any business development activities whereby the employee is actively working on an
initiative with the University, while working on the same initiative with an organization
outside the University.
16. Discussing future employment with a person who can influence future funding or
sponsorship decisions.

4.1

Procedures
Disclosure Statement

Employees who are investigators must disclose all significant financial interests
[including those of their family of which they are aware] that would reasonably appear to be
directly and significantly affected by the research or educational activities funded or proposed
for funding.
Employees shall complete, and update (when required or necessary) the Conflict of
Interest Disclosure Statement, stating the nature of the potential conflict, the organization(s)
involved, including the financial interest of the employees or their families, sponsored research
projects that might be affected, and other information that might assist supervisors in making a
determination concerning a conflict of interest. A copy of the completed form shall be sent to
each employee's supervisor for determination and resolution, and then forwarded to the Director
of the Research Institute for additional review and concurrence.
Employees will be prompted to review and if necessary update the Disclosure Statement
at the time of each proposal submission. Any potential conflict of interest not previously
disclosed shall be brought to the attention of the employees' supervisor by modifying or
completing a new Disclosure Statement.
If an employee fails to complete the Disclosure Form, fails to return it, or fails to disclose
a significant financial interest or other potential conflict of interest, the Director shall notify the
Contracts and Grants Office to (a) not submit the proposal, (b) withdraw the proposal if already
submitted, (c) decline an award if a disclosure is not made or if a conflict of interest is not
resolved, or (d) allow the project to proceed, pending resolution of the conflict.

40

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7
4.2

Initial Determination and Resolution

The supervisor is responsible for the initial determination of whether a conflict of interest
exists and noting this on a Supervisor Determination and Resolution form attached to the
Disclosure Statement. To make this determination, the supervisor will review and sign all
completed Disclosure Statements. Where potential conflicts of interest exist, the supervisor will
also review any additional information provided by the employee to make an objective decision.
If the supervisor determines that no conflict exists, no further action is required and the package
is submitted to the Research Institute Director for concurrence. The supervisor will note the
determination of a conflict of interest and one of two possible resolutions: (a) the employee may
proceed under specific conditions, or (b) the employee's participation is not approved. A copy of
the supervisor's determination will be provided to the employee.
Following resolution of any potential conflicts of interests at the division or department
level, the Determination and Resolution form will be forwarded to the Director for review and
concurrence. If the Director’s review determines that a significant financial interest, or any other
potential conflict of interest as defined above, may still exist, the Director shall seek additional
information to determine whether a significant financial interest, or other conflict of interest,
does indeed, exist. If it is determined that a significant financial interest or other potential
conflict of interest exists, the supervisor and employee, shall determine an acceptable plan of
action. This plan shall consist of the conditions or restrictions that shall be required by the
University to manage, reduce, or eliminate the actual or apparent conflict of interest. Examples
of the conditions or restrictions that might be imposed include:









public disclosure of the significant financial interest;
monitoring of the project by independent reviewers;
modification of the project plan;
disqualification of the employee from participation in all or a portion of the project or
business development activity;
withdrawal of the proposal or declination of an award;
divestiture of the significant financial interest;
severance of the relationship(s) that creates actual or potential conflicts, or;
notify the sponsor that a significant financial interest exists.

The Director shall notify the employee and the employee’s supervisor of the final determination.
The supervisor shall maintain completed Disclosure Forms, Determination and Resolution forms
and any supporting documentation related to a potential conflict of interest investigation for at
least three years. Employees shall update the Conflict of Interest Statement at least annually. If
an employee acquires a new reportable significant financial interest or potential conflict of
interest, the employee shall submit a revised or new Conflict of Interest Statement to their
supervisor, who will submit it to the Director within five (5) working days after acquisition.
4.3

Appeal

If the employee is not satisfied with the resolution of a conflict of interest situation, an
appeal can be made to the next level of supervision. The findings of the immediate supervisor

41

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7
will be reviewed and a determination will be made as to whether all pertinent factors were
considered. The employee will be allowed to present any facts that might not have been
considered or that may have been improperly interpreted in the initial review. The appeal officer
will make a determination based on the original review and any new information submitted since
the time of the original review. If the employee is still not satisfied, an appeal can be made to the
Vice President for Research. While the decision of the Vice President for Research is considered
to be final, the employee may elect to utilize the established University grievance procedure.
4.4

Noncompliance

Any employee who knows of, or could reasonably have been expected to know of, and
deliberately fails to respond appropriately to a potential conflict of interest shall be subject to
disciplinary action ranging from a written reprimand to discharge. The Vice President for
Research, after conferring with the employee's supervisor and other appropriate individuals, shall
determine the disciplinary action warranted. The nature and severity of the disciplinary action
shall be consistent with the University's established disciplinary procedures.
The Vice President for Research is responsible for ensuring adherence to these rules and
principles in this policy. Failure to adhere will result in sanctions that may include:





4.5

special monitoring of future work,
letter of reprimand,
removal from the project or activity,
salary or rank reduction, and
termination of employment.
Maintenance of Records

The Vice President for Research will keep federal agencies appropriately informed if the
University finds it is unable to satisfactorily manage an actual or potential conflict of interest
case. Furthermore, the University will maintain records of all financial disclosures and of all
actions taken to resolve actual or potential conflicts of interest until at least three years after the
latter of either the termination or completion of the award to which they relate, or the resolution
of any government action involving those records, whichever is longer.

Intellectual Property Policy
Research is recognized by the University of Dayton as an essential activity to develop
new knowledge, encourage the spirit of inquiry, and promote scholarship in all areas of learning.
As a result of such research, faculty members, professional and technical staff members,
students, and visitors to the University may develop technology with commercial value. This
technology could contribute significantly to economic, social, and cultural progress.
The material set forth in the University of Dayton Intellectual Property Policy and
Procedures document covers the ownership, management, and commercial development of
technology developed by UD faculty, staff, students as well as others participating in UD
programs. The term “technology” is broadly defined in this document to include technical

42

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Section 7
innovations, inventions and discoveries, and writings and other information in various forms
including computer software.
The principal rights governing the ownership and disposition of technology, known as
“intellectual property” rights, are derived primarily from legislation granting patent, copyright,
trademark, and integrated circuit mask work protection. In general, the University of Dayton
owns intellectual property created by faculty, staff, students, and others who participate in
University programs and use significant UD funds or facilities. When the University
commercializes an invention or another form of intellectual property, the net income is shared
with the inventor/author.
For additional information or if you have further questions, a complete copy of the
University’s Intellectual Property Policy and Procedures document can be obtained by contacting
the office of technology partnerships at the Research Institute, located at 1700 S. Patterson
Boulevard, Room M5200 or by visiting their Web site (http://www.udri.udayton.edu).

Misconduct in Research and Scholarship
It is the policy of the University of Dayton that high legal and ethical standards be
maintained in the areas of research and scholarship. Misconduct in research is considered a
major breach of the contract between the scholar or researcher and the University. This policy
has been designed to maintain high standards that provide (a) mechanisms for dealing with
instances of alleged misconduct; (b) a defined chain of responsibility for conducting research; (c)
assurance that individuals charged with supervision of other researchers and scholars can
realistically execute their responsibilities, particularly when research teams are large; (d)
assurance that named authors of papers and abstracts play a genuine role in the research and
accept responsibility for the quality of their contributions; (e) assurance that research data are
recorded and retained in a clear and appropriate manner; and (f) guidance and direction for
scholars and researchers concerning public announcement and publication or research findings.
For questions concerning this policy or to obtain the complete text of this policy, contact
the Office of the Provost, St. Mary’s Hall Room 212, or the Office of the Director of the
Research Institute, 1700 S. Patterson Boulevard Room S5050.

Staff Outside Employment and Additional University Services
The University of Dayton recognizes that there are opportunities for professional and
academic enrichment from the experience and contacts acquired by activities both on and off
campus. Many factors, however, should be examined when considering opportunities for outside
consulting, outside employment, or additional services inside the University but outside of the
employee’s primary work assignment. All such opportunities need to be evaluated as to their
appropriateness based on the best interests of the University and its mission, the professional
advancement of the individual, and the public service that might be rendered.

Policy on Ethical, Legal, and Secure Use of Electronic
Resources
Introduction
The University of Dayton (UD) values technology as a means of communicating
information and ideas to the UD community and the world. In keeping with UD’s commitment to
utilizing technology in teaching and learning, this policy provides direction in the appropriate use
of electronic resources on campus, by promoting the ethical, legal, and secure use of computing
and electronic communications. All users of UD electronic resources are expected to utilize such
resources in a responsible, ethical and legal manner consistent with UD mission and policies.

Scope
For the purposes of this policy, electronic resources include, but are not limited to, all
computer-related equipment, computer systems, software/ network applications, interconnecting
networks, facsimile machines, voicemail and other telecommunications facilities, as well as all
information contained therein (collectively, "electronic resources") owned or managed by UD.
Persons Covered by this Policy
This policy applies to all users of electronic resources owned or managed by UD.
General Principles
UD cherishes freedom of expression, the diversity of values and perspectives inherent in
an academic institution, the right to acknowledgment, and the value of privacy for all members
of the UD community. While the use of UD electronic resources may be a requirement for
coursework and work, access and use may be restricted or revoked in cases of misuse or repeated
abuse. UD reserves the right to limit access to its electronic resources when applicable UD
policies, state and/or federal laws or contractual obligations are violated. Although UD does not
typically block access to online content, it reserves the right to do so in cases where online
content or activity diminishes the capacity of our network, or where there is a threat to UD or its
core academic mission.
UD provides reasonable security against intrusion and damage to files stored on the
central computing facilities, but does not guarantee that its computer systems are secure. Other
users will not hold UD accountable for unauthorized access, nor can UD guarantee protection
against media failure, fire, floods, or other natural or man-made disasters.
UD does not, as a rule, monitor the content of materials transported over UD's network or
information posted on UD-owned computers and networks, but reserves the right to do so. At the
same time, UD may find it necessary to access and disclose information from computer and
network user accounts to the extent required by law to uphold contractual obligations or other
applicable UD policies or to diagnose and correct technical problems. UD may find it necessary
to scan any computer connected to UD networks for purposes of address management, network
performance, or investigations of policy violations.
Guidelines on Fair, Responsible and Acceptable Use
a) Use of UD’s electronic resources to damage, impair, disrupt or in any way cause
purposeful or reckless damage to UD networks or computers or external networks or
computers is prohibited.

44

CONDUCT AND ETHICS
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)

Section 7
Use of UD’s electronic resources to gain unauthorized access, to reproduce or use the
resources of others is prohibited.
Use of UD’s electronic resources to interfere with or cause impairment to the activities of
other individuals is prohibited.
Use of UD’s electronic resources to harass or make threats to specific individuals, or a
class of individuals, is prohibited.
Use of UD’s electronic resources in pursuit of unauthorized commercial activities is
prohibited.
Use of UD’s electronic resources to violate city, state, federal or international laws, rules,
regulations, rulings or orders, or to otherwise violate any UD rules or policies is
prohibited.

Reporting and Response to Violations
Members of the UD community who believe they have witnessed or been a victim of a
violation of UD's Policy on Ethical, Legal, and Secure Use of Electronic Resources should notify
or file a complaint with the appropriate UD office as follows: students should report suspected
violations to the Dean of Students; faculty members should report suspected violations to their
Dean or the Dean’s designated contact. Staff should report violations to their supervisor.
If the unit authority determines that a violation likely has occurred, this violation should
be reported to the office of the provost (if the violation involves students or faculty) or the Office
of Human Resources (if the violation involves staff). Designated persons in the provost and
human resources offices are responsible for recording, tracking and reporting violations to the
appropriate UD officials.
Related Policies and Guidelines
Because electronic communications encompass many different forms of communication
across many different media, there are several additional UD policies of which members of the
campus community should be aware exist. Refer to the appropriate sections of the Student
Handbook, Staff Handbook, Faculty Handbook, and the UD Bulletin.

Responsibilities Associated with Access to Electronic
Records and the Administrative Information System
The records contained within the Administrative Information System are made available
to those employees who demonstrate a need for information consistent with their responsibilities
and official functions for the University and consistent with normal professional and legal
practices.
Each employee is assigned a unique username and password to access the Administrative
Information System and is responsible for the safeguard and security of such. Usernames and
passwords may not be shared. Sharing of a username or password with anyone violates the
guidelines established for access rights to the Administrative Information Computing System.
Each employee will be held accountable for the use of prospect, applicant, student,
alumni, employee or financial data. Any employee found to have misused of the information
contained on the Administrative Computing System will be subject to disciplinary action,
including termination.

AIDS - Position Statement and Guidelines
Introduction
The University desires to protect the health and safety of the University community by
adopting and observing the following position and guidelines on AIDS in accordance with
medical knowledge as it develops.
The University is committed to educating members of the campus community about
AIDS, both to help limit the spread of the disease and to protect persons with AIDS from
discriminatory actions and breaches of privacy.
The University also seeks to provide competent health and counseling services to
students affected by communicable diseases, and to treat them with respect, compassion, and due
regard for their privacy. Cases of AIDS or related conditions, and inquiries, complaints, or
grievances related to AIDS, will be dealt with by appropriate members of the University staff on
an individual basis in accordance with these guidelines and with the best current medical
information and legal opinion. These guidelines are subject to revision at any time in the light of
new information or opinion.
Current Medical Information
The University recognizes that there is no risk of infection through casual contact.
However, there are activities at the University that could expose a person to blood or other risks
of infection (i.e. intercollegiate athletics). This is based on the following statements as the
current state of understanding concerning AIDS:
The U.S. Surgeon General's AIDS Report
"Everyday living does not present any risk of infection. You cannot get AIDS from
casual social contact. Casual social contact should not be confused with casual sexual contact,
which is a major cause of the spread of the AIDS virus. Casual social contact such as shaking
hands, hugging, social kissing, crying, coughing or sneezing, will not transmit the AIDS virus.
Nor has AIDS been contracted from swimming in pools or bathing in hot tubs or from eating in
restaurants (even if a restaurant worker has AIDS or carries the AIDS virus). AIDS is not
contracted from sharing bed linens, towels, cups, straws, dishes, or any other eating utensils. You
cannot get AIDS from toilets, doorknobs, telephones, office machinery or household furniture.”
NCAA Guideline 2H - Blood borne Pathogens and Intercollegiate Athletics
".... there is evidence that suggests that HIV has been transmitted in household contact
settings without sexual contact or IV needles showing among those household contacts. These
rare instances probably occurred through unrecognized wound or mucous membrane exposure."

48

Prevention and Control of AIDS; An Interim Report of the Board of Trustees of the
American Medical Association
"As with prevention and control of all contagious disease, prevention and control of
AIDS involves two, sometimes competing, concerns. First, the person who is afflicted with the
disease needs compassion and treatment, and both those who have had the disease and those who
have been infected with the virus should not be subjected to irrational discrimination based on
fear, prejudice or stereotype. Second, and of critical importance, the uninfected must be
protected; those individuals who are not infected with the AIDS virus must have every
opportunity to avoid transmission of the disease to them."
Position and Guidelines
Any reference to AIDS applies to persons who have AIDS (acquired immune deficiency
syndrome) or ARC (AIDS - related complex), and to currently healthy persons with positive tests
for an antibody to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Non-Discrimination
No person will be denied admission to or enrollment in the university, excluded from or
limited in the use of residential, dining or recreational facilities or denied participation in
instructional, cultural, religious, athletic, social or other activities, solely because of a diagnosis
or suspicion of AIDS.
No person will be denied employment, dismissed from employment, or restricted as to
work assignment or opportunities for job change or promotion, solely because of a diagnosis of
AIDS, ARC, or a positive antibody test for HIV.
Confidentiality
A person's health condition is confidential. Every reasonable effort should be made to
protect the privacy and confidentiality of persons with AIDS. When requesting information or
advice from a source on or off campus regarding a person with AIDS, members of the University
community are cautioned against revealing the person's name or giving other identifying
information. Members of the University community should not disclose the identity of a person
with AIDS except under the following circumstances:
1.

Where the law requires disclosure, such as when a physician who has diagnosed a case of
AIDS has to report the patient by name to public health authorities.

2.

A member of the University community may, unless prohibited by legal privilege, reveal
to the vice president in charge of that member's area the identity of an employee under
his/her jurisdiction of supervision who has AIDS. The vice president may in turn inform
the president of the University.

No member of the University community, except duly designated information officers, should
make any statement to representatives of the media about a case or alleged case of AIDS.
49

When, according to current medical knowledge and legal opinion, the behavior of a
person with AIDS poses a danger to that individual or to others, the vice president may reveal
such diagnosis and status to other University officials, law enforcement officials, the individual's
family, and others, as appropriate. Factors to be considered include the nature of the risk (how
AIDS is transmitted), the duration of the risk (how long that person has been infectious), the
severity of the risk (what the potential harm is to third parties), and the probabilities that the
disease will be transmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm. Such revelation will be made
only after consultation with legal and medical authorities. Initial consultation will be with the
University's director for legal affairs and University counsel and the medical director of the
Gosiger Health Center.
University Action
Unless the vice president determines that this review indicates a danger of exposure to
health and safety risks of the person with AIDS, or others, no person will be denied admission to
or enrollment to the University, suspended, dismissed, excluded from or limited to the use of
University facilities, or denied participation in University activities.
Without such prior determination, likewise no person will be denied employment,
dismissed or restricted as to work assignment or opportunities for job change or promotion.
After the vice president's review of any individual case, an evaluation shall be made
whether the University can reasonably accommodate the person with AIDS.
If the vice president determines that this review indicates a danger of exposure to health
and safety risks of the person with AIDS, or others, the University may take appropriate action,
which may include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Interruption of class attendance.
Change in living arrangements.
Change in academic, athletic or social activities.
Change of employment assignment.
Medical leave of absence.

Counseling and Education
While not required to do so, any persons with AIDS are urged to make their condition
known so they can receive proper services from appropriate University departments, with the full
confidence of the University's support as set forth in this statement.
Counseling of a person with AIDS should include advice to avoid activities that may lead
to spread of the disease to others, including sexual contact, blood donation, and sharing of
needles, razors, and other articles that may become contaminated with blood. The infected
person should also be advised to make the condition known to doctors, dentists, and others who
may be at special risk of acquiring the AIDS virus.

50

The University urges all members of its staff to become informed about AIDS.
Professional staff members in human resources, health education, health care, and counseling are
expected to have sufficient knowledge to provide clear and accurate answers to basic questions
about the nature, transmission, and health consequences of AIDS. From time to time the
University will plan and sponsor educational programs directed to all segments of the campus
community to impact current information and guidance about AIDS.

Alcohol - Serving Of
Attendance at a gathering at which alcohol is served is to be voluntary. Likewise,
nonalcoholic beverages and significant amounts of food should always be available. No one
should feel pressured to consume alcoholic beverages.
The unit hosting the event should be responsible for seeing that only moderate amounts
of alcohol are consumed. This can be done by controlling the amount of alcohol available and
the length of time during which it is available for consumption. It is advised that alcoholic
beverages be served by the glass rather than simply making it available by the bottle.
It is strongly urged that alcohol not be served at a function to which students are invited
as guests. The University has a very serious responsibility to its students, many of whom are
minors. Serving an alcoholic beverage to a student who is a minor can expose the server
personally and the University corporately to very substantial liability.
Plans for an event at which alcohol is served should be reviewed and approved in
advance by the appropriate dean or vice president. This approval should include authorization of
any University funds to be expended.

Distribution or Sale of Materials and Solicitation of or by
Employees
The purpose of this policy is to establish the University of Dayton’s intent to have a work
environment that is free from solicitation and distribution efforts that do not relate to University
business or interest. To view the University’s policy on Distribution and Solicitation, please
click here. For information on additional HR policies, please refer to the online University wide
policy site at: http://www.udayton.edu/policies/hr .

Drug-Free Workplace Policy
The University of Dayton has, in order to appropriately serve the needs of both
employees and students, implemented a drug free workplace and academic environment
consistent with federal and state law, including the terms and conditions whereby staff may be
disciplined for violation of these policies and tested for suspected use of an illegal drug or
alcohol. Please click here to view the University’s Drug-Free Workplace Policy. For information
on additional HR policies, please refer to the online University wide policy site at:

Environmental Safety, Hazardous Materials
Management and Risk Management
The University of Dayton strives to provide facilities, equipment and training that will
minimize risk to its employees, the general public, the environment and campus property. To do
this, the environmental safety office (ESO) has programs to address the issues of safety,
industrial hygiene, security, emergency preparedness, and environmental protection. Therefore,
understanding of and adhering to the following safety guidelines will help all employees do their
part to ensure a safe work environment.
The environmental safety office (ESO) is available to assist all employees in carrying out
their safety responsibilities. The office is located in the College Park Center (1529 Brown
Street), ext. 4503. Office hours are 8:30 a.m. 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Emergency
notification can be made through public safety at ext. 2121. ESO’s Web site lists many safety
and health programs and guidelines at
http://campus.udayton.edu/~UDCampusPlanning/EnvironmentalHealth/SafetyHome.html.
While only present in small quantities, a wide range of hazardous materials may be found
at the University including carcinogenic, radioactive, flammable, corrosive, and explosive
substances. Improper handling, use, and disposal of these hazardous materials may result in
adverse health effects or contamination to the environment.

2. Large quantity spills or small quantity highly toxic chemical spills that require special
equipment and/or specialized training should be cleaned up by the ESO. Notification
should be made to public safety for additional safety and security measures.
3. Chemical spills may require notification of the incident to State or Federal agencies. An
"Incident and Hazard Report Form" must be completed and forwarded to the ESO. Forms
may be obtained from the ESO.

If you have any doubt about how a spill should be cared for contact the environmental safety
office, (ext. 4503).
J.

Waste Disposal
1. Chemicals are to be disposed of according to specific procedures found on the
Chemicals Material Data Safety Sheet.
2. Solvents, flammable liquids, toxic materials are not to be poured or flushed down
sewers or drains.
3. Strict EPA regulations prohibit dumping anything into an outdoor storm drain.
4. Glass is not to be placed in wastebaskets. Broken glass that is contaminated with
chemicals cannot be recycled. Put this waste in an appropriately labeled container.
Glassware contaminated with a hazardous material (a broken mercury thermometer,
for example) must be treated as a hazardous waste.
5. A "Hazardous Waste Disposal Form" must be submitted to the ESO for approval,
prior to pick up by the ESO. These forms may be obtained in the ESO.

K.

When handling chemicals or equipment containing chemicals, safe handling or removal
must be considered before use. All persons who handle chemicals must have Hazard
Communication Training. In addition, laboratory workers must be trained in the
Laboratory Chemical Hygiene Plan. All training is conducted by the ESO. Arrangements
for training may be made by contacting the ESO.

L.

Eating and/or drinking is permitted in lunchrooms, food service areas, break rooms and
other areas that are free from, and physically isolated from, chemical exposure. No food
53

or drink may be stored in refrigerators designed for storage of chemicals or laboratory
materials.
M.

All containers are required to be labeled. Labels on all containers of potentially hazardous
materials should include warning information about these hazards. The environmental
safety office can answer any specific questions about property labeling requirements.

Employee Information and Training
Federal law guarantees employees the right-to-know what hazardous materials are found
in their workplace. The University complies with this law through its environmental safety office
(ESO). This office keeps a record of all known hazardous materials on campus and their
location. You may come to the ESO to inquire about any hazardous substance on campus and to
familiarize yourself with it by reading the Material Safety Data Sheet, or MSDS. The MSDS
contains information about the physical characteristics, hazard and health effects of the material,
waste disposal guidelines, and personal protective equipment needed to work safely with the
material. These MSDS's are routinely available for consultation, Monday through Friday, 8:30
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Emergency requests for a MSDS during other times can be made through the
public safety office (ext. 2121/911) who will contact the environmental safety administrator.
In addition to this general information, the University, through the environmental safety
office, will offer specific safety training programs. For certain positions, federal law and/or
University policy may require that an employee receive appropriate safety training. Attendance
at such training sessions is a serious obligation. Failure to receive mandatory training may
require the University to prohibit an employee from reporting to the workplace. In addition to
specialized training, sessions of general interest will be advertised to the whole University
community. You are encouraged to contact the environmental safety administrator for further
information on training available or to request assistance with designing safety training for your
workplace. A listing of available training can be found on the ESO webpage:
http://campus.udayton.edu/~UDCampusPlanning/EnvironmentalHealth/SafetyHome.html.

Procedures to Be Observed

Emergencies
Automobile Accident
If an accident occurs on campus, a report is to be made as soon as possible to the public
safety department (ext. 2121/911).
Facilities Problems
If problems arise in regard to heat, power or light or other aspects of the maintenance of a
building or the campus contact facilities management (ext. 3753) in order to report the nature of
the problem so that appropriate repairs can be made.
Fire Emergency
If you discover a fire:
1. If fire, smoke, or any evidence of fire is present, immediately activate the building
alarm system by using the fire/emergency pull station provided.
2. Assist any person in immediate danger to safety, if it can be accomplished without
risking injury to yourself.
3. Exit the building in a calm manner, using the stairs if necessary. Remember the
elevator cannot be used in a fire emergency.
4. Stay a safe distance from the building to allow emergency personnel access to the
building.
5. Remain outside the building, even if the alarm is silenced, until public safety gives
the "all clear". No other persons can allow access to the building.
Labor Disputes
In the event of a labor dispute which may include the setting up of picket lines, staff
members are required to continue to come to work and perform their normal activities. The
senior vice president for administration shall be responsible for determining whether the situation
is of such a nature that the closing of normal operations is required.

56

Weather Emergency
If the emergency siren on top of Kettering Laboratories is activated during the work day you
should:
1. Take cover inside the building away from windows and things that may fall on you. A
hallway is preferred.
2. Stay in your position until an "all clear" is given by public safety or by local
emergency broadcast on radio.
3. It is important that you stay inside the building for your protection.
NOTE: Sirens are tested at 12:00 noon on the first Monday of each month.
In the event of a dual emergency, such as the Emergency siren and a fire alarm are activated at
the same time, the fire alarm takes priority and exiting the building as quickly as possible to
another building is advised.
Weather-Related Campus Closing
The Provost, in consultation with the Assistant Vice President for Facilities Management,
determines the necessity of weather-related campus closings. It is the University's intent to make
the decision on closing by 5:30 a.m. so that the appropriate media contacts can be made by 6:00
a.m.
Class Cancellation:
When classes are cancelled, all administrative, clerical, technical and union employees
are expected to report to work as usual. Employees who do not report to work in a weather
emergency when the University remains open are permitted to utilize accrued vacation for the
hours they were to have worked.
University Closing:
When the University delays opening (for example, closed until 10 a.m.), essential
personnel are to report as usual. All other personnel are encouraged to remain home until
campus is open.
When the University is closed, classes are cancelled and offices are closed either for a
half or full day except those identified by the respective vice-president as essential to keep open.
Employees are not expected to report for work except for essential personnel.*
If a decision is made in midday to close immediately, the message will be relayed from
the Office of Human Resources or the office of the provost to division heads, department chairs,
and the director of UDRI for further dissemination. Employees are to be allowed to leave under
these circumstances and, in fact, are encouraged to do so for their own safety. Such midday
closings are rare, but circumstances may necessitate such action.
57

Any closing announcement will also include the Children's Center and the on-campus
employees of the Research Institute. The Research Institute employees at WPAFB are governed
by Base policies. Off-campus UD sites will be closed through a decision by the responsible
dean’s office that govern academic programming at each site.
Compensation Policy in the Event of a Campus Closing
Non-Exempt (Non-Union)** Employees:
1.

Non-essential employees who do not come to work will be paid for those hours they
normally would have worked during the campus closure.

2.

Essential employees who work during the closure will receive one and one-half
times their regularly hourly rate of pay for each hour worked.

3.

Non-essential employees who report to work during a closure will be paid straight
time for hours worked during the closing.

Exempt Employees:
Exempt employees who are designated as essential or non-essential will receive their
normal pay when the campus is closed for an emergency. However, those non-essential exempt
employees who do not come to work are asked to work from home.
Notes
1. Essential employees, exempt or non-exempt, are expected to make every effort to come to
work on days when the University is closed due to an emergency.
2. Each vice president will be responsible for keeping an updated list of essential personnel for
her/his division on file with the Office of Human Resources and for ensuring that each of
those individuals are notified of their status as an essential employee.
3. Employees who are on unpaid leave during a weather emergency will not have that leave
time reinstated or receive pay.
4. Employees with pre-approved vacation or paid medical leave will not receive additional
compensation or vacation/sick leave credit.
5. Employees must have been regularly scheduled to work on the closed day in order to
receive pay of any kind during a weather-related campus closing.
6. Employees who are unable to come to work because they reside in a county for which a
level 3 snow emergency has been declared may charge vacation or be docked for the work
day.
*Essential personnel are those employees who are either included in a previously designated list or who
are specifically required by their supervisors to work on the day(s) in question.
**Union employees wages are determined by a negotiated contract and therefore not subject to this
policy.

58

Escort Service
The regular staff of the department of public safety is augmented by a cadre of student
police cadets who provide escort service in fully marked department vehicles after dark from any
point on campus or within the residential student neighborhood to any other point within these
areas. To request an escort, call ext. 2124 or 2125.

Illness/Injury during Work Hours
In the case of injuries of non-emergency type such as minor burns, lacerations, punctures,
abrasions, etc., the Health Center will provide the necessary care and initial treatment. The
University Health Center in Gosiger Hall does not provide either primary care to campus
employees or care for campus employees who suffer a sudden illness, accident or occupationally
incurred injury of a very serious, life-threatening nature requiring immediate attention and
treatment. If unable to judge whether it is a very serious, life-threatening emergency or a nonemergency, treatment should be sought at the MedWork Occupational Health Care (449-0800)
located at 1435 Cincinnati Street Suite 100. Seriously injured or ill employees should call 911 for
transportation to the nearest emergency facility.
Employees must notify their supervisor whenever a work-related injury or occupational
illness occurs. The employee must complete the required "Report of Injury", “Medical Release”,
and “BWC-FROI” forms and submit them to his/her supervisor within 24 hours of injury. Forms
are available on-line at
http://campus.udayton.edu/~hr/hrwebsite/Benefits/Workers%20Compensation%20%20Forms.pd
f or from the Office of Human Resources. The supervisor will submit the "Report of Injury",
“Medical Release”, and “BWC-FROI” (when applicable) to the Office of Human Resources, St.
Mary's Hall Room 118, +4 zip 1614 within 48 hours of injury. All bills should be submitted to
the Office of Human Resources, St. Mary's Hall Room 118, +4 zip 1614, and not to the
University's Anthem insurance plan.
For employees located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, care for very serious, lifethreatening emergencies may be sought at the Wright-Patterson AFB Hospital by dialing 911 for
an ambulance. Treatment for non-emergency type injuries should be cared for at the nearest
Industrial Medical Center.

Investigative Services
Dispatchers are available 24 hours a day to handle complaints, reports of incidents and
calls for service from the University community. Investigations are conducted into all allegations
of misconduct, theft, and damage to person or University property (ext. 2107).

Maintenance and Repair of Office Equipment
Should you need maintenance or repair of office equipment, contact the office of
purchases (ext. 2641) or the Research Institute purchasing office (ext. 3822).

Reporting Theft, Damage, or Accident/Injury
1.

Call public safety (ext. 2121) IMMEDIATELY.
59

2.

Notify the environmental safety office of a possible insurance claim. This can be done by
phone (ext. 4503) and followed with an Incident and Hazard Report Form supplied by the
environmental safety office College Park Center Room 112.

3.

In cases of theft or damage of UD property, public safety will need detailed information
on the items stolen or damaged, the serial and UD barcode numbers, and the replacement
cost of each item. Contact property management (ext. 3822) if this information is not
available from your office records. If this information is not given when public safety
fills out the Offense Report, a Theft/Damage Listing Form will be provided. This form
MUST be completed and returned to public safety within three (3) working days of the
initial Offense Report.
Note: The University does not have insurance coverage for personal property belonging
to faculty and staff, students, or visitors.

4.

Replacement of property, if any, is subject to delay or denial until all procedures have
been properly executed. Reimbursements on insurance, if any, will not be possible unless
all offices are properly and timely notified.

5.

In cases of injuries that result in medical expenses which are not work related, submit
copies of all medical bills to the environmental safety office, College Park Center Room
112, as soon as possible.

Use of Offices Before or After Working Hours
While working in offices before or after normal working hours employees are encouraged
to exercise the following precautions:






If you are working alone on campus late at night call public safety (ext.2121).
Be alert. Report any suspicious activity.
Lock outer office doors.
Use escort service if needed.
Park in a well-lighted area.

Parking
All vehicles parked on University property must display either a valid permanent or
temporary University parking permit. For further information, please visit the Parking Services
website at http://community.udayton.edu/finadmin/publicsafety/parking/.

Public Service
The University is pleased when members of its community are able to make a significant
contribution to the wider public community. In offering this encouragement for public service,
the University understands that the service is to be rendered in such a way that it is compatible
with the responsibilities of the person's employment at the University.
Public service can entail a significant commitment of time and effort. Even in those cases
where the time required is less extensive, the requirements of office may be such that a person is
taken away from campus at a time when his/her employment with the University demands
60

his/her presence. Likewise, it is possible that one's responsibilities at the University would relate
to matters over which the employee would have influence as an office holder, creating the
potential for a significant conflict of interest.
Because of the potential for conflict between the expectations of one's employment at the
University and the seeking or holding of a public office or performance of other forms of
extended community service, an employee in this situation is asked to observe the following:
1. Notify his/her supervisor of the requirements of the position and discuss their
compatibility with the requirements of his/her employment. This request should be made
in writing, giving particular note to any special work arrangements the person is
requesting.
2. If the responsibilities are judged to be compatible, the supervisor will report this fact and
any special arrangements or accommodations to be made to the appropriate vice president
for final approval.
3. If the responsibilities are judged to be incompatible, this is also reported to the
appropriate vice president for review. If he/she concurs, the employee is advised of any
possibilities for requesting a leave from his/her service at the University. In this case, as
in others, extended absence or inability to be present during regularly scheduled work
hours can result in disciplinary action.
4. Whatever arrangements are made are summarized by the supervisor of the employee and
a copy is placed in the employee's permanent personnel file.
