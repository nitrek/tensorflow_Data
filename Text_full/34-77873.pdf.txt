ORDER DETERMINING WHISTLEBLOWER AWARD CLAIM
On April 7, 2016, the Claims Review Staff issued a Preliminary Determination
related to Notice of Covered Action Redacted (the “Covered Action”). The Preliminary
Claimant 1
Claimant 2
Determination recommended that
(“Claimant 1”) and
Claimant 2 (“Claimant 2”; collectively, “Claimants”) receive a joint whistleblower award
because Claimants voluntarily provided original information to the Commission that led
to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action pursuant to Section 21F(b)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-6(b)(1), and
Rule 21F-3(a) thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-3(a).
Further, the Claims Review Staff recommended that such award be set in the
Redacted
amount of
percent Redacted of the monetary sanctions collected or to be
collected in the Covered Action, which will yield an award of more than $450,000.00. In
arriving at this recommendation, the Claims Review Staff considered the factors set forth
in Rule 21F-6, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-6, in relation to the facts and circumstances of
Claimants’ application.
On April 11, 2016, Claimants provided written notice to the Commission of
Claimants’ decision not to contest the Preliminary Determination within the 60-day
deadline set out in Rule 21F-10(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, 17 C.F.R.

§ 240.21F-10(e). Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 21F-10(f), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(f),
the Preliminary Determination became the Proposed Final Determination of the Claims
Review Staff.
Upon due consideration under Rules 21F-10(f) and (h), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(f)
and (h), the Preliminary Determination of the Claims Review Staff is adopted.
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the Preliminary Determination, it is hereby
Redacted
ORDERED that Claimants 1 and 2 shall receive a joint award of
percent
Redacted of the monetary sanctions collected in this Covered Action, including any
monetary sanctions collected after the date of this Order.1
By the Commission.
