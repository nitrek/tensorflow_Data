UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
July 26, 2016

In the Matter of
American Transportation Holdings, Inc.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the public interest and the
protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of American
Transportation Holdings, Inc. (CIK No. 0001404526) because of recent, unusual and
unexplained market activity in the company’s stock taking place during a suspicious promotional
campaign, and because of concerns about the accuracy of publicly available information,
including but not limited to company press releases issued in June and July 2016. American
Transportation Holdings Inc. is a Nevada corporation with its principal executive offices in
Littleton, Colorado, with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”) operated by
OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the ticker symbol ATHI.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on July 26, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on August 8, 2016.
By the Commission.
