SIPC’S STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF AND STATUORY BASIS OF THE
DETERMINATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SIPC NOT TO
ADJUST THE STANDARD MAXIMUM CASH ADVANCE AMOUNT FOR
INFLATION
In its filing with the Commission, SIPC included statements concerning the purpose of

and statutory basis of the SIPC Board’s determination. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified above, and appear in the text, below.
*****
“Under the Securities Investor Protection Act, 15 U. S. C. Section 78aaa et seq. (“SIPA”),
the Board of SIPC must decide, every five years beginning no earlier and no later than January 1,
2011, whether to adjust for inflation the standard maximum amount that SIPC can advance to
satisfy customer claims for cash under SIPA. See SIPA § 78fff-3(e)(1).2 The Board considered
the question at its Meeting on June 18, 2015, and on July 16, 2015, after further deliberation, the
Board reached its determination. The Board’s determination is subject to the approval of the
Commission as provided under SIPA Section 78ccc(e)(2).3 If approved, any adjustment to the
standard cash maximum advance would take effect on January 1, 2017. See SIPA 78fff-3(e)(4).
Under SIPA Section 78fff-3(e)(3)(A), the SEC is required to publish in the Federal Register
notice of the maximum amount.
Per our notice to the Commission by letter dated August 18, 2015, this will re-affirm to
the Commission that effective January 1, 2017, and for the five years immediately thereafter, the
Board has determined that the maximum amount of the advance to satisfy a claim for cash will
remain at the current level of $250,000 per customer.

For convenience, references herein to provisions of SIPA shall be to the United States
Code, and shall omit “15 U.S.C.”

SIPA Section 78ccc(e)(2) establishes procedures governing proposed changes to SIPC’s
rules.

Consideration of the Statutory Criteria
In deciding whether to adjust the maximum cash advance amount, the Board is to
consider the following criteria under SIPA Section 78fff-3(e)(5):
(A)

the overall state of the fund and the economic conditions
affecting members of SIPC;

(B)

the potential problems affecting members of SIPC; and

(C)

such other factors as the Board of Directors of SIPC may
determine appropriate.

In furtherance of the Board’s consideration of the above factors, the SIPC staff solicited
and received comments and/or data from the staffs of FINRA, SIFMA, the SEC, and the FDIC.
The data related to member firms’ aggregate leverage, liquidity, and default risk, and to
aggregate customer free credit balances. The information was presented to the Board by the
SIPC staff, as part of an analysis by the staff of the state of the SIPC Fund and its projected
growth. The staff’s analysis focused on SIPC’s historical experience and examined 1) SIPC
advances in past and present liquidation proceedings; 2) amounts generated from assessments on
member broker-dealers; and 3) projected returns on SIPC investments. The analysis also
considered a 2013 study by consultants engaged by SIPC to examine the potential impact on the
SIPC Fund of an increase in the cash advance limit to $500,000. The conclusions reached by the
staff in their analysis were corroborated by the data received from the aforementioned authorities
and by the 2013 consultants’ study, namely, that the SIPC Fund is positioned to remain on a
steady growth path for the foreseeable future, barring any unforeseen catastrophic event.
The Board also reviewed the number of claims for cash exceeding the limit of protection
in past and present liquidation proceedings. This data suggests that an inflation adjustment may

4

not be necessary to further SIPC’s purposes, but that if an inflation adjustment is made, its
impact on the SIPC Fund may not be significant.
Of the more than 625,000 allowed claims in completed or substantially completed
liquidation proceedings as of December 31, 2014, the unsatisfied portion of cash claims
amounted to $25 million. More than half of that amount related to only three claims that were
submitted when the limit of protection for cash claims was less than the current $250,000. In the
six SIPA proceedings initiated since 2010, SIPC has advanced, net, funds for only one cash
claim in excess of $250,000.
The Board also noted that customer credit balances at brokerage firms had decreased at
the end of 2013 and 2014, and that due to broker-dealers’ offer of overnight “sweep” programs,
customer free credit balances were being moved to bank accounts, with the protection of such
accounts thereby transferred to the FDIC.
With regard to FDIC deposit insurance, increases to the limit of protection for cash
claims under SIPA historically have been in lockstep with increases in FDIC deposit insurance
under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1821 et seq. (“FDIA”).4 In 2008, and

The below compares the limits of protection for cash under SIPA and the FDIA:
SIPA: $20,000 (Pub. L. No. 91-598, § 6(f)(1)(A), 84 Stat. 1636, 1651 (1970))
FDIA: $20,000 (Pub. L. No. 91-151, §7, 83 Stat. 371, 375 (1969))
SIPA: $40,000 (Pub. L. No. 95-283, § 9, 92 Stat. 249, 265 (1978))
FDIA: $40,000 (Pub. L. No. 93-495, § 102(a), 88 Stat. 1500, 1502 (1974))
SIPA: $100,000 (Pub. L. No. 96-433, § 1, 94 Stat. 1855 (1980))
FDIA: $100,000 (Pub. L. No. 96-221, § 308, 94 Stat. 132, 147 (1980))
SIPA: $250,000 (Pub. L. No. 111-203, § 929H, 124 Stat. 1376, 1865 (2010))
FDIA: $250,000 ((temporary until 12/31/2009) Pub L No. 110-343, § 136, 122 Stat.
3765, 3799 (2008); (permanent) Pub. L. No. 111-203, § 335, 124 Stat. 1376,
1540 (2010)).

again, in 2010, parity with deposit insurance was the primary reason for SIPC’s request to
Congress to increase the SIPA limit of protection for cash claims.

FDIC coverage is currently

$250,000. While the Federal Deposit Insurance Act includes similar language to SIPA related to
adjusting for inflation, the adjustment is based upon a $100,000 coverage level, and the FDIC
has not increased coverage under the inflation provision.5
The Board expressed concern that a unilateral increase to the SIPA limit could have
unintended consequences, particularly in light of the issue not having been widely studied or
discussed. For example, increasing the SIPA limit above the deposit insurance limit could
incentivize the movement of funds to brokerage accounts as a savings vehicle, an outcome not
consistent with the intent of SIPA.
Finally, the Board considered the amount by which the limit of protection for allowed
cash claims would change if adjusted for inflation. Under SIPA Section 78fff-3(e)(1)(B), if the
Board determines that an adjustment is appropriate, then $250,000 is to be multiplied by
[t]he ratio of the annual value of the Personal Consumption
Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index (or any successor index
thereto), published by the Department of Commerce, for the
calendar year preceding the year in which such determination is
made, to the published annual value of such index for the calendar
year preceding the year in which this subsection was enacted.

15 U.S.C. section 78fff-3(e)(1)(B).6 Although the amount of the inflation adjustment need only
be considered if the Board determines to adjust the $250,000 for inflation, see SIPA Section
78fff-3(e)(1), that determination would be meaningless if the adjustment resulted in no change.
This was the case on January 1, 2011, when application of the formula would have increased the
limit to the adjusted amount of $254,449.52.7 However, under SIPA Section 78fff-3(e)(2),
because the adjusted amount must be rounded down to the nearest $10,000 if it is not a multiple
of $10,000, the limit would have remained at $250,000. Even if it had determined to do so, the
Board could not have adjusted the amount.
Conclusion
A present-day application of the formula would increase the limit by $20,000.8 The
Board weighed the relevant factors against a potential adjustment of $20,000. The Board

6

Under SIPA Sections 78fff-3(d) and 78fff-3(e)(1), the Board was required to adjust the
maximum cash advance, if at all, after December 31, 2010, but no later than January 1,
2011, and then, could do so every 5 years thereafter. Thus, the five-year period after
January 1, 2011, would occur in 2016. Under SIPA Section 78fff-3(e)(4), any adjustment
to the amount of the cash advance would take effect on January 1 of the year immediately
after the year in which the adjustment was made.

7

The calculation would be as follows: $250,000 multiplied by 1.017798 – the ratio of
111.112 (the annual value of the Price Index published by the Department of Commerce
for 2010, the calendar year preceding the year in which the determination was to be
made), to 109.169 (the published annual value of such index for 2009, the calendar year
preceding the year in which the subsection was enacted) – equals $254,449.52.

8

The $20,000 is arrived at as follows: $250,000 multiplied by 1.08763 which is the ratio
of 108.763 (the annual value of the Price Index published by the Department of
Commerce for calendar year 2014), to 100.000 (the published annual value of the index
for 2009, the calendar year preceding the year in which subsection 78fff-3(e)(1)(B) was
enacted ) which equals $271,907.50. Rounded down to $270,000, the adjusted limit
reflects an increase of $20,000 from the $250,000 limit. Because the determination is to
be made for the calendar year 2016, the annual value of the Price Index to be used is for
the “calendar year preceding the year in which such determination is made,” namely, the
year 2015. However, the 2015 annual value was not available until after the end of the
7

concluded that, on balance, in light of the unprecedented break with the FDIC limit that would
result, with possibly harmful consequences, and the absence of evidence that an appreciable
number of investors would be benefitted, an adjustment to the limit of protection for cash claims
was not appropriate. Accordingly, the Board determined that the standard maximum cash
advance amount should remain at $250,000 per customer.”

III.

NOTICE OF THE DETERMINATION OF THE SIPC BOARD NOT TO ADJUST
THE STANDARD MAXIMUM CASH ADVANCE AMOUNT FOR INFLATION
Effective January 1, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Securities Investor Protection

Corporation determined that an inflation adjustment to the standard maximum cash advance
amount, as defined in section 9(d) of the Securities Investor Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 78fff3(d), would not be appropriate for the five-year period beginning on January 1, 2017.
Accordingly, the Board determined that the standard maximum cash advance amount should
remain at $250,000 per customer, effective January 1, 2017 and for the five years immediately
thereafter.
For the Commission, by the Division of Trading and Markets, pursuant to
delegated authority.9
