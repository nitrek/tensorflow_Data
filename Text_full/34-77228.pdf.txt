In the Matter of

ORDER INSTITUTING
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS
AND NOTICE OF HEARING
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(j) OF
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934

TexStar Oil Corporation, and
Bonamour, Inc.
Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby
are, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”) against Respondents TexStar Oil Corporation (“TexStar”) and Bonamour, Inc.
(“Bonamour”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A. RESPONDENTS
1. TexStar (CIK No. 0000814920) is a Nevada corporation headquartered in Dallas,
Texas, whose common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). TexStar is delinquent in its periodic reports with the Commission. It has not filed
any periodic reports since August 2014, when it filed a Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
June 30, 2014. In the Form 10-Q, TexStar reported a net loss of $98,638 for the quarter. As of
February 19, 2016, its common stock was quoted for sale publicly under the ticker symbol
“TEXS” on OTC Pink, a securities marketplace operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc.
2. Bonamour (CIK No. 0001421871) is a Colorado corporation headquartered in Dallas,
Texas, whose common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). Bonamour is delinquent in its periodic reports with the Commission. It has not
filed any periodic reports since December 2014, when it filed a Form 10-K/A for the annual

period ended December 31, 2013. In the Form 10-K/A, Bonamour reported a net loss of
$387,153 for the year. As of February 19, 2016, its common stock was quoted for sale publicly
under the ticker symbol “BONI” on OTC Pink, a securities marketplace operated by OTC
Markets Group, Inc.
B. DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS
6. As discussed in more detail above, both of the Respondents are delinquent in their
periodic filings with the Commission, and have repeatedly failed to meet their obligations to file
timely periodic reports.
7. Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports, even if the registration is voluntary under Exchange
Act Section 12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports, and Rule 13a13 requires issuers to file quarterly reports.
8. As a result of the foregoing, Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems
it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings
be instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations contained in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford the Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
and,
B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of each class of securities
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of the Respondents identified in Section II
hereof, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate
names of any Respondents.
IV.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on
the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and
before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall file an Answer to the
allegations contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, as provided by
Rule 220(b) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b)].

2

If Respondents fail to file the directed Answers, or fail to appear at a hearing after being
duly notified, the Respondents, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3,
and any new corporate names of any Respondents, may be deemed in default and the
proceedings may be determined against them upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of
which may be deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f), and 201.310].
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondents personally or by certified,
registered, or Express Mail, or by other means permitted by the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2)
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2)].
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except
as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule
making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not
deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final
Commission action.
By the Commission.
