Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
May 20, 2016

In the Matter of
NuTech Energy Resources, Inc.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of NuTech Energy Resources, Inc. (“NERG”)
because of concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace
about the company’s operations and the company’s recent public announcements concerning an
unsolicited tender offer. NERG is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business
located in Gillette, Wyoming. Its stock is quoted on OTC Link, operated by OTC Markets
Group Inc., under the ticker: NERG.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on May 20, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on June 3, 2016.
By the Commission.
