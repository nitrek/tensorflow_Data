I.
On July 19, 2006, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans (“Fair Fund Rule”), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, the
Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) for
the distribution of monies placed into a Fair Fund in the above-captioned matter. The Notice
invited public comment on the proposed distribution plan through August 18, 2006.

On September 20, 2006, pursuant to Fair Fund Rule 1104, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1104, the
Commission extended, for good cause shown, the time for entering an Order approving or
disapproving the proposed distribution plan through December 16, 2006. 1
The Commission believes that because of the complexity of the comments received,
additional evaluation, review and analysis of the proposed distribution plan are required, and
therefore good cause has been shown to extend the time period provided in Rule 1104 for entry
of an order approving or disapproving the plan by an additional sixty days, to February 14, 2007.
II.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Rule on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. §
201.1104, for good cause shown, the time for entering an Order approving or disapproving the
proposed distribution plan is extended through February 14, 2007.
By the Commission.

Rule 1104 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1104,

provides:
At any time after 30 days following publication of notice of a proposed plan of disgorgement or of
a proposed Fair Fund plan, the Commission shall, by order, approve, approve with modifications,
or disapprove the proposed plan. In the discretion of the Commission, a proposed plan that is
substantially modified prior to adoption may be republished for an additional comment period
pursuant to 17 CFR 201.1103. The order approving or disapproving the plan should be entered
within 30 days after the end of the final period allowed for comments on the proposed plan unless
the Commission or the hearing officer, by written order, allows a longer period for good cause
shown.
Thirty days from the end of the final period for comments on the proposed distribution plan lapsed on September 17,
2006. Because of the complexity of the comments received, further evaluation, review and analysis was required,
and good cause was shown to extend the thirty day time period provided in Rule 1104 for entry of an order
approving or disapproving the plan by ninety days, to December 16, 2006.
