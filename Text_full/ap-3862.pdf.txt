In the Matter of
STAY ORDER
TIMOTHY QUINTANILLA, CPA

On May 23, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a motion to stay this
proceeding. The Division represents that the parties have agreed to a settlement in principle that
would fully resolve this proceeding and that it has received a signed offer of settlement from
Respondent. The Division further represents that it will timely recommend and submit the
settlement offer to the Securities and Exchange Commission for consideration. The Division
notes that Respondent consents to the Division’s motion to stay.
I construe the motion as a joint motion to stay within the meaning of Rule of Practice
161(c)(2). 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(c)(2). The motion is GRANTED and this proceeding is
STAYED, subject to compliance with that rule, requiring that this office be notified promptly if
any of the requirements of the rule are not met. Id.
