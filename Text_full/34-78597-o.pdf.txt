Before the
SECURITI ES AND EXCHANGE COMMI SSION
August 17, 2016
In the Matter of

Imperial Plantation Corporation

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of Imperial Plantation Corporation because of
questions regarding the accuracy of publicly available information about the company’s business
transactions and securities, including inconsistent disclosures about whether Imperial Plantation
Corporation received $1 million in a private placement of one billion shares of its stock, and
inaccurate disclosure that it cancelled the one billion shares when the shares remained
outstanding as of June 22, 2016. Imperial Plantation Corporation (CIK No. 0001542934), is a
Nevada corporation with its principal place of business listed as Tempe, Arizona with stock
quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under
the ticker symbol IMPC.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange

Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT, August 17, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT, on August 30, 2016.

By the Commission.
