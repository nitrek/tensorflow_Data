Amendment to Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) proposes to amend
Rule 15c6-1(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) to shorten the
standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from three business days after the
trade date (“T+3”) to two business days after the trade date (“T+2”). The proposed amendment
is designed to reduce a number of risks, including credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk and,
as a result, reduce systemic risk for U.S. market participants.

Introduction
The Commission originally adopted Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 in 1993 to establish T+3

as the standard settlement cycle for broker-dealer transactions, and in so doing, effectively
shortened the settlement cycle for most securities transactions (with certain exceptions), which at
the time was generally five business days after the trade date (“T+5”). 1 The Commission cited a
number of reasons for standardizing and shortening the settlement cycle, which included, among
others, reducing credit and market risk exposure related to unsettled trades, reducing liquidity
risk among derivatives and cash markets, encouraging greater efficiency in the clearance and
settlement process, and reducing systemic risk for the U.S. markets. 2
The Commission now proposes to amend Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1(a) to further shorten
the standard settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2. As discussed in greater detail below, the
Commission preliminarily believes that there are a number of reasons supporting shortening the
standard settlement cycle to T+2 at this time. As an initial matter, the Commission believes that
shortening the standard settlement cycle will result in a further reduction of credit, market, and
liquidity risk, 3 and as a result a reduction in systemic risk for U.S. market participants.

FR 52891, 52893 (Oct. 13, 1993) (“T+3 Adopting Release”). Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act
prohibits broker-dealers from effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a
security (other than an exempted security, government security, municipal security, commercial
paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds and
delivery of securities later than the third business day after the date of the contract unless
otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction. 17 CFR 240.15c6-1.

Credit risk refers to the risk that the credit quality of one party to a transaction will
deteriorate to the extent that it is unable to fulfill its obligations to its counterparty on settlement
date. Market risk refers to the risk that the value of securities bought and sold will change
between trade execution and settlement such that the completion of the trade would result in a
financial loss. Securities Transactions Settlement, Exchange Act Release No. 31904 (Feb. 23,

Since the Commission adopted Rule 15c6-1 in 1993, the financial markets have expanded
and evolved significantly. 4 During this period, the Commission has continued to focus on
further mitigating and managing risks in the clearance and settlement process, and how those
risks relate to managing systemic risk. 5 The Commission also notes that shortening the standard
settlement cycle at this time is consistent with the broader focus by the Commission on
enhancing the resilience and efficiency of the national clearance and settlement system and the
role that certain systemically important financial market utilities (“FMUs”), 6 particularly central
counterparties (“CCPs”), play in concentrating and managing risk. 7 In light of this ongoing
focus on further mitigating and managing risks in the clearance and settlement process, the

describes the risk that an entity will be unable to meet financial obligations on time due to an
inability to deliver funds or securities in the form required though it may possess sufficient
financial resources in other forms. See Standards for Covered Clearing Agencies, Exchange Act

(“Clearing Supervision Act”) enacted by Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), 12 U.S.C. 5301, et. seq., defines
“financial market utility” or “FMU” as any person that manages or operates a multilateral system
for the purpose of transferring, clearing, or settling payments, securities, or other financial
transactions among financial institutions or between financial institutions and the person. 12
U.S.C. 5462(6)(A). Section 803(6)(B)(i) of the Clearing Supervision Act generally excludes
certain persons from the definition of FMU including designated contract markets, registered
futures associations, swap or security-based swap data repositories, swap execution facilities,
national securities exchanges, and alternative trading systems. 12 U.S.C. 5462(6)(B)(i). The
term FMU includes not only U.S. registered clearing agencies but also other types of entities that
are not U.S. registered clearing agencies.

Commission preliminarily believes that a transition to a T+2 settlement cycle would yield
important benefits for market participants and the national clearance and settlement system.
The Commission preliminarily has considered the costs and benefits attendant to
shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2 and believes that the proposed amendment to
Rule 15c6-1(a) will yield benefits that justify the associated costs. The Commission also
preliminarily believes that the case for further shortening the standard settlement cycle at this
time is supported by certain progress and efficiencies already achieved by market participants
since the Commission’s adoption of Rule 15c6-1 in 1993, including significant technological
developments. The Commission, however, is sensitive to the effects this proposal could have on
a wide range of market participants. Accordingly, in addition to specific requests for comment,
the Commission seeks generally input on the economic effects associated with shortening the
standard settlement cycle to T+2, including any costs, benefits or burdens, and any effects on
efficiency, competition and capital formation.

Background
Rule 15c6-1(a) of the Exchange Act prohibits broker-dealers from effecting or entering

into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security (other than certain exempted securities) 8 that

Rule 15c6-1(a) does not apply to a contract for an exempted security, government
security, municipal security, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills.
17 CFR 240.15c6-1(a). The rule also provides an additional exemption for: (i) transactions in
limited partnership interests that are not listed on an exchange or for which quotations are not
disseminated through an automated quotation system of a registered securities association;
(ii) contracts for the purchase and sale of securities that the Commission may from time to time,
taking into account then existing market practices, exempt by order; and (iii) contracts for the
sale of cash securities that priced after 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) that are sold by an
issuer to an underwriter pursuant to a firm commitment offering registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) or the sale to an initial purchaser by a broker-dealer participating
in such offering. 17 CFR 240.15c6-1(b) and (c).

provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities later than the third business day after the
date of the contract unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the
transaction. 9 Subject to the exceptions enumerated in the rule, the prohibition in paragraph (a) of
Rule 15c6-1 applies to all securities. The definition of the term “security” in Section 3(a)(10) of
the Exchange Act covers, among others, equities, corporate bonds, unit investment trusts
(“UITs”), mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), American depositary receipts
(“ADRs”), security-based swaps, and options. 10 Many of these securities (e.g., options, and
certain mutual funds) generally settle on a settlement cycle less than T+3 and therefore will not
Additionally, as discussed further in the T+3 Adopting Release, the Commission
determined not to include transactions in municipal securities within the scope of Rule 15c6-1,
with the expectation that the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) would take the
lead in implementing three-day settlement of municipal securities by the implementation date of
the new rule. The Commission requested a report from the MSRB within six months of the
Commission’s adoption of Rule 15c6-1 outlining the schedule in which the MSRB intended to
implement T+3 in the municipal securities market. T+3 Adopting Release, 58 FR at 52899.
MSRB rules that established T+3 as the standard settlement cycle for transactions in municipal
securities became operative on June 7, 1995, the same date as Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1.

Settlement Time Frame, Exchange Act Release No. 35427 (Feb. 28, 1995), 60 FR 12798 (Mar.
8, 1995).

Although current Rule 15c6-1 establishes a settlement timeframe of no more than three
business days after the trade date, certain types of transactions routinely settle on a settlement
cycle shorter than T+3, which is permissible under the rule. See, e.g., note 11 infra.

Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), amended, among other things, the
definition of “security” under the Exchange Act to encompass security-based swaps. In July
2011, the Commission granted temporary exemptive relief from compliance with certain
provisions of the Exchange Act (including Rule 15c6-1) in connection with the revision of the
Exchange Act definition of “security” to encompass security-based swaps. See Order Granting

exemptions (including the exemption for Rule 15c6-1) are set to expire on February 5, 2017.

T+2. Accordingly, the discussion in this release is primarily focused on securities that currently
settle on a T+3 standard settlement cycle. 11 However, the Commission seeks comment on
whether and the extent to which other securities, as defined in Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange
Act, will be affected by the amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), as proposed.
A.

Overview of the Clearance and Settlement of Securities Transactions

“Clearance and settlement” refers generally to the activities that occur following the
execution of a trade. These post-trade processes are critical to ensuring that a buyer receives
securities and a seller receives proceeds in accordance with the agreed-upon terms by the
settlement date. The discussion that follows provides a basic description of the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions, and is organized in the following manner: (1) an overview
of the statutory framework and goals driving the national clearance and settlement system; (2) an
introduction to securities clearing agencies and other key market participants in the clearance and
settlement process; (3) an overview of the trade settlement process for the U.S. securities
markets; (4) a discussion of how the length of the settlement cycle may impact the presence of
credit, market, liquidity and systemic risk in the clearance and settlement process; and (5) an
overview of ongoing efforts by market participants to shorten the standard settlement cycle.

11

In today’s environment, ETFs and certain closed-end funds clear and settle on a T+3
basis. Open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds) generally settle on a T+1 basis, except for certain
retail funds which typically settle on T+3. Thus, the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a)
would require ETFs, closed-end funds, and mutual funds settling on a T+3 basis to revise their
settlement timeframes. See infra notes 213 and 214, regarding ETF secondary market trading,
including creation or redemption transactions for authorized participants.

1.

Statutory Framework

The national clearance and settlement system in place today is largely a product of the
difficulties experienced in the U.S. securities markets in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As
trading volumes increased during that time period, the manual process associated with
transferring certificated securities among market participants in a relatively uncoordinated
fashion created what came to be known as the “Paperwork Crisis.” The Paperwork Crisis nearly
brought the securities industry to a standstill and directly or indirectly caused the failure of a
large number of broker-dealers. 12 The breakdown in the handling of paper associated with the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions threatened to curtail the flow of debt and
equity instruments available for public investment and jeopardized the continued operation of the
securities markets. 13
In light of the experiences of the Paperwork Crisis, and with the objectives of improving
the operation of the U.S. clearance and settlement system and protecting investors, 14 Congress
amended the Exchange Act in 1975 to, among other things, (i) direct the Commission to
facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of transactions in securities, and (ii) provide the Commission with the authority to

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(1)(A) – (D), which lays out the Congressional findings for
Section 17A of the Exchange Act. In particular, Congress found that inefficient clearance and
settlement procedures imposed unnecessary costs on investors and those acting on their behalf
and that new data processing and communications techniques create the opportunity for more
efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement.

regulate those entities critical to the clearance and settlement process. 15 At the same time,
Congress empowered the Commission with direct rulemaking authority over broker or dealer
activity in making settlements, payments, transfers, and deliveries of securities. 16 Taken
together, these provisions provide the Commission with the authority to regulate entities that are
critical to the national clearance and settlement system. 17
Congress reaffirmed its view of the importance of a strong clearance and settlement
system in 2010 with the enactment of the Clearing Supervision Act. 18 Specifically, Congress
found that the “proper functioning of the financial markets is dependent upon safe and efficient
arrangements for the clearing and settlement of payments, securities, and other financial
transactions.” 19 Under the Clearing Supervision Act, registered clearing agencies providing CCP
and central securities depository (“CSD”) services are FMUs. 20 FMUs centralize clearance and
settlement activities and enable market participants to reduce costs, increase operational
efficiency, and manage risks more effectively. While an FMU can provide many risk

FMU has the potential to disrupt the securities markets if the FMU does not effectively manage
the risks in its clearance and settlement activities. 21 To address those risks, the Commission has
used its authority under the Exchange Act, as supplemented by the authority set forth under the
Clearing Supervision Act, to help ensure that the FMUs under its supervision are subject to
robust regulatory requirements. 22

Participating Entities

Clearance and settlement activities in securities markets are supported by an
infrastructure that is comprised of entities that perform a variety of different functions. These
functions for the U.S. securities markets are performed in most instances by FMUs that are

22

See, e.g., Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release, supra note 5. In addition, on
July 18, 2012, the Financial Stability Oversight Council designated as systemically important the
following then-registered clearing agencies: Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (“CME”); The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”); Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”); ICE Clear
Credit LLC (“ICC”); National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”); The Options Clearing
Corporation (“OCC”). See Press Release, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Financial Stability
Oversight Council Makes First Designations in Effort to Protect Against Future Financial Crises
(July 18, 2012), https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1645.aspx. As
such, these clearing agencies are also subject to the Clearing Supervision Act. In addition to its
authority to regulate clearing agencies, pursuant to Section 17A of the Exchange Act, the
Commission is also the supervisory agency, as that term is defined in Section 803(8) of the
Clearing Supervision Act, for DTC, FICC, NSCC, and OCC. The CFTC is the supervisory
agency for CME and ICE, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York oversees DTC’s banking
and trust company activities. The Commission jointly regulates ICC and OCC with the CFTC.

CCPs

A CCP, following trade execution, interposes itself between the counterparties to a
trade, becoming the buyer to each seller and seller to each buyer to ensure the performance of
open contracts. One critical function of a CCP is to eliminate bilateral credit risk between
individual buyers and sellers.
NSCC is the CCP 24 for trades between broker-dealers involving equity securities,
corporate and municipal debt, and UITs in the U.S. 25 NSCC facilitates the management of risk
among broker-dealers using a number of tools, which include: (1) novating and guaranteeing
trades to assume the credit risk of the original counterparties; (2) collecting clearing fund
23

Section 17A(b) of the Exchange Act requires any clearing agency performing the
functions of a clearing agency with respect to any security (other than an exempted security) to
be registered with the Commission, unless the Commission has exempted such entity from the
registration requirements. 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(1). The term “clearing agency” is defined broadly
to include any person who: (1) acts as an intermediary in making payments or deliveries or both
in connection with transactions in securities; (2) provides facilities for comparison of data
respecting the terms of settlement of securities transactions, to reduce the number of settlements
of securities transactions, or for the allocation of securities settlement responsibilities; (3) acts as
a custodian of securities in connection with a system for the central handling of securities
whereby all securities of a particular class or series of any issuer deposited within the system are
treated as fungible and may be transferred, loaned, or pledged by bookkeeping entry, without
physical delivery of securities certificates (such as a securities depository); or (4) otherwise
permits or facilitates the settlement of securities transactions or the hypothecation or lending of
securities without physical delivery of securities certificates (such as a securities depository). A
clearing agency may provide, among other things, CCP services and CSD services. See
15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23).
24

In addition to providing CCP services, NSCC provides a number of other non-CCP
services to market participants, including, for example, services that support mutual funds,
alternative investments and insurance products.
25

Certain SRO rules (e.g., Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Rule
6350B(b) and FINRA Rule 6274(b)) authorize broker-dealer members to settle transactions
outside of the facilities of a registered clearing agency, or “ex-clearing,” if both parties agree.

contributions from members to help ensure that NSCC has sufficient financial resources in the
event that one of the counterparties defaults on its obligations; and (3) netting to reduce NSCC’s
overall exposure to its counterparties.
In novation, when a CCP member presents a contract to the CCP for clearing, the
original contract between the buyer and seller is discharged and two new contracts are created,
one between the CCP and the buyer and the other between the CCP and the seller. The CCP
thereby assumes the original parties’ contractual obligations to each other. NSCC attaches its
trade guaranty 26 to novated transactions at midnight on T+1. 27 Through novation and the trade
guaranty, the two original trading counterparties to the transaction replace their bilateral credit,
market and liquidity risk exposure to each other with risk exposure to NSCC.
NSCC collects clearing fund deposits from its members to maintain sufficient financial
resources in the event a member or members default on their obligations to NSCC. 28 NSCC’s
rules also allow NSCC to adjust and collect additional clearing fund deposits as needed to cover

26

Pursuant to Rule 11 and Addendum K to NSCC’s Rules and Procedures, NSCC
guarantees the completion of CNS settling trades (“NSCC trade guaranty”) that have reached the
later of midnight of T+1 or midnight of the day they are reported to NSCC’s members. NSCC
also guarantees the completion of shortened process trades, such as same-day and next-day
settling trades, upon comparison or trade recording processing. See NSCC Rules and
Procedures, Rule 11, Section 1(c) and Addendum K (as of July 14, 2016) (“NSCC Rules and
Procedures”), www.dtcc.com/legal/rule-and-procedures.
27

NSCC has stated that it is currently in the process of seeking regulatory approval to move
its trade guaranty forward to the point of trade validation (for locked-in trades) and comparison
(for trades compared through NSCC). This initiative is referred to as the “Accelerated Trade
Guaranty” or “ATG.” See NSCC, Disclosures under the Principles for Financial Market
Infrastructures, at 17 n.11 (Dec. 2015) (“NSCC PFMI Disclosure Framework”),
http://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-and-compliance.
28

NSCC’s clearing fund is comprised of cash, securities, and letters of credit posted by
NSCC members to provide NSCC the necessary resources to cover member defaults. The
amount and timing of contributions to the clearing fund are determined pursuant to NSCC’s
rules. See NSCC Rules and Procedures, Rules 1 and 4.

the risks present while a member’s trades are unsettled. Each member’s required clearing fund
deposit is calculated at least once daily pursuant to a formula set forth in NSCC’s rules, 29 and is
designed to provide sufficient funds to cover NSCC’s exposure to the member. 30
Figure 1 below shows NSCC’s clearing fund deposits by quarter. As illustrated in Figure
1, the total amount that NSCC collects to mitigate the risks associated with member defaults has
varied from roughly $3 to $6.5 billion for the years 2010 through 2015. 31 The majority of these
deposits are held in cash, while a much smaller portion is held in highly liquid securities such as
U.S. treasury securities.

29

See NSCC Rules and Procedures, Rule 4 and Procedure XV.

30

Commission Rules 17Ad-22(b)(1) through (4) require a registered clearing agency that
performs CCP services to establish, implement, and maintain policies and procedures reasonably
designed to do the following: (1) measure its credit exposures at least once a day, and use margin
requirements to limit its exposures to potential losses from defaults by its participants; (2) use
risk-based models and parameters to set margin requirements and to review such requirements at
least monthly; (3) maintain sufficient financial resources to withstand a default by the two
participant families, if clearing security-based swaps, or one participant family otherwise, to
which it has the largest exposure; and (4) provide for an annual model validation process.

As mentioned above, NSCC also reduces its risk exposure as a CCP through netting.
Netting reduces risk in the settlement process by reducing the overall amount of obligations that
must be settled. The reduction in the overall amount of unsettled obligations translates into
relatively fewer and smaller settlement payments, thereby reducing the cost to trade. Netting
also lessens the risk by reducing the number of outstanding unsettled transactions linking market
participants, thereby reducing the likelihood that a settlement failure by one market participant
will trigger a chain reaction of additional defaults by other market participants. Through the use
of NSCC’s netting and accounting system, the Continuous Net Settlement System (“CNS”),
NSCC nets trades and payments among its participants, reducing the value of securities and

17

payments that need to be exchanged by an average of 97% each day. 32 NSCC accepts trades into
CNS 33 for clearing from the nation’s major exchanges and other trading venues and uses CNS to
net each NSCC member’s trades in each security traded that day to a single receive or deliver
position for the securities. 34 Throughout the day, cash debit and credit data generated by
NSCC’s members’ activities are recorded, and at the end of the processing day, the debits and
credits are netted to produce one aggregate cash debit or credit for each member. 35
When one of the counterparties does not fulfill its settlement obligations by delivering the
required securities, a “failure to deliver” occurs in CNS. Failures to deliver may be caused by
the NSCC member’s failure to receive securities from a customer or counterparty to a previous
transaction. 36 For illustration purposes, Figure 2 shows a recent seven-year period of time, in

32

See NSCC PFMI Disclosure Framework, supra note 27, at 8.

33

NSCC accepts CNS-eligible securities. To be CNS-eligible, a security must be eligible
for book-entry transfer on the books of DTC, and must be capable of being processed in the CNS
system. For example, securities may be ineligible for CNS processing due to certain transfer
restrictions (e.g., 144A securities) or due to the pendency of certain corporate actions. See Rule
1 of NSCC’s rules for the definition of CNS-eligible securities, and Rule 3 of NSCC’s rules for a
list of CNS-eligible securities. NSCC Rules and Procedures, Rules 1 and 3.
34

In CNS, compared and recorded transactions in CNS-eligible securities that are scheduled
to settle on a common settlement date are netted by specific security issue into one net long (i.e.,
buy) or net short (i.e., sell) position. CNS then nets those positions further with positions of the
same specific security issue that remain open after their originally scheduled settlement date,
which are generally referred to as “Fail Positions.” The result of the netting process is a single
deliver or receive obligation for each NSCC member for each specific security issue in which the
member has activity on a given day. See NSCC Rules and Procedures, Rule 11 and Procedure
VII and X.

See NSCC PFMI Disclosure Framework, supra note 27, at 9.

While NSCC provides final settlement instructions to its members each day, the payment
for and transfer of securities ownership occurs at DTC. At the conclusion of each trading day,
CNS short positions (i.e., obligations to deliver) at NSCC are compared against the long
positions held in the NSCC members’ DTC accounts to determine security availability. 38 If
securities are available, they are transferred from the NSCC member’s account at DTC to

37

NSCC failure-to-deliver data is publicly available on the Commission’s website at

NSCC’s account at DTC, to cover the NSCC member’s CNS short positions. CNS long
positions (i.e., the right to receive securities owed to the participant) are transferred from the
NSCC account at DTC to the accounts of NSCC members at DTC. On settlement date, NSCC
submits instructions to DTC to deliver (i.e., transfer) securities positions for each security netted
though CNS for each NSCC member holding a long position in such securities. Cash obligations
are settled through DTC by one net payment for each NSCC member at the end of the settlement
day.
(2)

CSDs

A CSD is an entity that holds securities for its participants either in certificated or
uncertificated (dematerialized) form so that ownership can be easily transferred through a book
entry (rather than the transfer of physical certificates) and provides central safekeeping and other
asset services. Additionally, a CSD may operate a securities settlement system, which is a set of
arrangements that enables transfers of securities, either for payment or free of payment, and
facilitates the payment process associated with such transfers. DTC serves as the CSD and
settlement system for most equity securities and a significant number of debt securities held by
U.S. market participants.
In its capacity as a CSD, DTC provides custody and book-entry transfer services for the
vast majority of securities transactions in the U.S. market involving equities, corporate and
municipal debt, money market instruments, ADRs, and ETFs. In accordance with its rules, DTC
accepts deposits of securities from its participants 39 (i.e., mostly broker-dealers and banks),

39

NSCC’s rules provide for several categories of membership with different levels of
access to NSCC’s services. This release uses the term “member” when referring to an NSCC
member that has full access to NSCC’s CCP services. See NSCC Rules and Procedures, Rule 1,
for the definition of the various membership categories. DTC’s rules also provide for different
20

credits those securities to the depositing participants’ accounts, and effects book-entry transfer of
those securities. The securities deposited with DTC are registered in DTC’s nominee name and
are held in fungible bulk for the benefit of its participants and their customers. Each participant
having an interest in the securities of a given issuer credited to its account has a pro rata interest
in the securities of that issuer held by DTC. By immobilizing securities (e.g., holding and
transferring ownership of securities positions in book-entry form, with DTC’s nominee reflected
as the registered owner on the issuer’s records) and centralizing and automating securities
settlements, DTC substantially reduces the number of physical securities certificates transferred
in the U.S. markets, which significantly improves operational efficiencies and reduces risk and
costs associated with the processing of physical securities certificates. These benefits not only
provide efficiencies to DTC and its participants, but to the investing public as well.
In addition to a securities account at DTC, each DTC participant has a settlement account
at a clearing bank to record any net funds obligation for end-of-day settlement, whether payment
will be due to or from the participant. During the day, debits and credits are entered into the
participant’s settlement account. The debits and credits arise from DVP transfers and from other
events or transactions involving the transfer of funds, such as principal and interest payments
distributed to a participant or intraday settlement progress payments by a participant to DTC. 40
Debits and credits in the participant’s settlement account are netted intraday to calculate, at any
categories of membership, including “participants.” This release uses the term “participant”
when referring to a participant of DTC. See Rules, By-Laws, and Organizational Certificate of
DTC Rule 1 for the definition of various categories of membership.
40

As noted above, a CSD operates a securities settlement system that provides for transfers
of securities either free of payment or for payment. When a transfer occurs for payment,
typically securities settlement systems provide “delivery versus payment” or “DVP,” whereby
the delivery of the security occurs only if payment occurs. The concept of DVP is sometimes
referred to as “DVP/RVP.” The term “receive versus payment” or “RVP” is from the
perspective of the seller.
21

time, a net debit balance or net credit balance, resulting in an end-of-day settlement obligation or
right to receive payment. DTC nets debit and credit balances for participants who are also
members of NSCC to reduce funds transfers for settlement, and acts as settlement agent for
NSCC in this process. Settlement payments between DTC and DTC’s participants’ settlement
banks are made through the National Settlement System of the Federal Reserve System. 41
b. Matching/ETC Providers - Exempt Clearing Agencies
Matching/ETC Providers electronically facilitate communication among a broker-dealer,
an institutional investor, and the institutional investor’s custodian to reach agreement on the
details of a securities trade. 42 These entities emerged as a result of efforts by market participants
to develop a more efficient and automated matching process that continues to be viewed as a
necessary step in achieving straight-through processing (“STP”) 43 for the settlement of
institutional trades. 44 Currently, there are three entities that have obtained exemptions from

41

See NSCC PFMI Disclosure Framework, supra note 27, at 9-10.

42

Electronic trade confirmation (“ETC”) was originally developed by DTC in the early
1970s as an alternative to the use of phone, fax or other manual processes. To facilitate greater
use of ETC by market participants to process institutional trades, the Commission approved rule
changes filed by several SROs that required the use of ETC for trades involving institutional
investors. See Exchange Act Release No. 19227 (Nov. 9, 1982), 47 FR 51658, 51664 (Nov. 18,
1982) (order approving confirmation rules for exchanges and securities association).
43

The Securities Industry Association (which in 2006 merged with The Bond Markets
Association to form the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association) has described STP
“as the seamless integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from end-toend — trade execution, confirmation, and settlement — without manual intervention or the rekeying of data.” Securities Industry Association, Glossary of Terms, reprinted in part in Kyle L

VI, No. 4, New York, N.Y.), Apr. 28, 2005, at 25-26,

Securities Industry Association, Institutional Transaction Processing Model, at 3 (May

Transaction Processing Committee (“ITPC”) published its first white paper in December 1999
22

registration as a clearing agency from the Commission to operate as Matching/ETC Providers. 45
The current Matching/ETC Providers use two methods, “Matching” and “ETC,” to facilitate
agreement on the trade details among the parties. When the parties reach agreement, it is
generally referred to as an “affirmed confirmation.”
ETC is a process where the Matching/ETC Provider simply provides the communication
facilities to enable a broker-dealer and its institutional investor to send messages back and forth
that ultimately results in the agreement of the trade details or affirmed confirmation, which is in
turn sent to DTC to effect settlement of the trade. 46 Specifically, the Matching/ETC Provider
will send the affirmed confirmations to DTC where the DTC participants who will be delivering
securities will authorize the trades for automated settlement. 47

with a subsequent version released in February 2001. The ITPC 2002 White Paper was
published in May 2002.
45

The Commission issued an interpretive release in 1998 concluding that matching
constitutes comparison of data respecting the terms of settlement of securities transactions, and
therefore an entity that provides matching services as an intermediary between a broker-dealer
and an institutional customer is a clearing agency within the meaning of Section 3(a)(23) of the
Exchange Act and is, therefore, subject to the registration requirements of Section 17A.
See Confirmation and Affirmation of Securities Trades, Exchange Act Release No. 39829 (Apr.
6, 1998), 63 FR 17943, 17946 (Apr. 13, 1998); Clearing Agency Standards, Exchange Act
Release No. 68080 (Oct. 22, 2012), 77 FR 66220, 66228 & n.94 (Nov. 2, 2012) (noting the 1998
interpretive release); see also 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23) (defining the term “clearing agency”). The
Commission has provided exemptions from registering as a clearing agency to certain entities
that operate matching and ETC services. See Order Granting Exemption from Registration as a
Clearing Agency for Global Joint Venture Matching Services-U.S., LLC, Exchange Act Release
No. 44188 (Apr. 17, 2001), 66 FR 20494, 20501 (Apr. 23, 2001); Order Approving Applications

2015).

23

In contrast, “Matching” is a process by which the Matching/ETC Provider compares and
reconciles the broker-dealer’s trade details with the institutional investor’s allocation instructions
to determine whether the two descriptions of the trade agree. If the trade details and institutional
investor’s allocation instructions match, an affirmed confirmation is generated, which also is
used to effect settlement of the trade. As with ETC, transmission of the affirmed confirmations
by the Matching/ETC Provider to DTC facilitates automated trade settlement. 48
ETC is considered less efficient than Matching because it is an iterative process where
each participant has to wait for a trigger before executing the next step in the process and has to
manually re-key trade data into several systems, resulting in delay and redundant flows of nonessential data. 49 Moreover, during this process broker-dealers and their institutional investors
often rely on internal systems that lack either automation, common message standards, or both,
resulting in a lack of synchronized automated data that can cause errors and discrepancies.
Matching, in contrast to ETC, is not an iterative process. Rather, matching eliminates the
separate step of producing a confirmation for the institutional investor to review and affirm.
Currently, Matching/ETC Providers assist many, but not all, market participants in affirming
institutional trade details as soon as possible after trade execution, thereby helping to ensure that
a trade will clear and settle by the end of the settlement cycle. 50
c. Market Participants – Investors, Broker-Dealers, and Custodians
A variety of market participants depend on the clearance and settlement services
facilitated by the FMUs and Matching/ETC Providers, including but not limited to institutional

50

See infra Part III.A.3. for affirmation rates for certain Matching/ETC Providers.

24

and retail investors, broker-dealers, and custodians (e.g., banks). Furthermore, the relevant
clearance and settlement steps that need to be accomplished by the FMUs, Matching/ETC
Providers, and financial service firms within the settlement cycle vary depending on whether an
investor is an institutional investor or a retail investor.
Institutional investors are entities such as mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, bank
trust departments, and insurance companies. Transactions involving institutional investors are
often more complex than those for and with retail investors due to the volume and size of the
transactions, the entities involved in facilitating the execution and settlement of the trade,
including Matching/ETC Providers and custodians, and the need to manage certain regulatory or
business obligations. 51 Trades involving retail investors are typically smaller in size than
institutional trades, and the settlement of retail investor trades generally occurs directly with the
investor’s or their intermediary’s broker-dealer and does not involve a separate custodian bank.
To clear and settle securities transactions directly through a registered clearing agency,
the rules of the clearing agencies provide that a broker-dealer or other type of market participant
must become a direct member of that clearing agency. 52 Generally broker-dealers that are direct
members of clearing agencies are referred to as “clearing broker-dealers.” Clearing brokerdealers must comply with the rules of the clearing agency, including but not limited to rules
51

The distinction between “retail investor” and “institutional investor” is made only for the
purpose of illustrating the manner in which these types of entities generally clear and settle their
securities transactions. For purposes of this release, the term “retail investor” includes any entity
that settles their securities transactions in a manner described in Part II.A.3.a. Similarly, the term
“institutional investor” is used to describe any entity that is permitted and chooses to settle their
securities transactions in the manner described in Part II.A.3.b.
52

Due to the financial and operational obligations of entities submitting trades to a clearing
agency, all clearing agencies have established specific requirements for initial membership and
ongoing participation in the clearing agency. See, e.g., NSCC Rules and Procedures, supra note
26, Rules 2A and 2B (discussing initial and ongoing requirements for membership).

25

relating to operational and financial requirements. Broker-dealers that submit transactions to a
clearing agency through a clearing broker-dealer are generally referred to as “introducing brokerdealers.” In general, broker-dealers executing trades on a registered securities exchange are
required to clear those transactions through a registered clearing agency. 53 Additionally,
pursuant to certain self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) rules, broker-dealers that effect
transactions in municipal and corporate debt securities are required to clear and settle those
transactions through a registered clearing agency. 54 Broker-dealers executing trades outside the
auspices of a trading venue (e.g., on an internalized basis) may clear through a clearing agency,
may choose to settle those trades through mechanisms internal to that broker-dealer, or may
settle the trades bilaterally. 55 Post-trade processing of securities transactions by broker-dealers
generally occurs in the back office and entails the following functions: (1) order management,
which keeps track of the orders that are sent to the various markets and of the subsequent related
executions that are received; (2) purchases and sales, which works closely with the appropriate
clearing agency to ensure the transactions have been accurately cleared and settled and to
reconcile the broker-dealer’s position; (3) cashiering, which is responsible for receiving and

53

See, e.g., FINRA Rules 6350A(a) and 6350B(a) (requiring that FINRA members must
clear and settle transactions in “designated securities” (i.e., NMS stocks) through the facilities of
a registered clearing agency that uses a continuous net settlement system). In addition, FINRA
Rule 6274(a) requires that a member must clear and settle transactions “effected on” the
Alternative Display Facility in ADF-eligible securities (i.e., NMS stocks) that are eligible for net
settlement through the facilities of a registered clearing agency that uses a continuous net
settlement system. Notwithstanding the requirements in Rules 6350A(a), 6350B(a) and 6274(a),
transactions in designated securities and transactions in ADF-eligible securities may be settled
“ex-clearing” provided that both parties to the transaction agree to the same. See FINRA Rules
6350A(b), 6350B(b), 6274(b).

delivering securities; and (4) asset servicing activities related to the processing of dividends,
stock splits, and other corporate actions.
Often, due to regulatory or business obligations, an institutional investor will not use its
executing broker-dealer to custody the institutional investors’ securities at DTC, but rather will
use a custodian bank for the safekeeping and administration of both their securities and cash. 56
The custodian may also provide other administrative services, such as: (1) acting as an agent or
fiduciary; (2) monitoring the purchase and sale of securities by the executing broker-dealers; and
(3) collecting dividends and interest.

Overview of Trade Settlement Processes

As described further below, the proposed amendment to paragraph (a) of Rule 15c6-1
would prohibit a broker or dealer from entering into a securities contract that settles later than the
second business day after the date of the contract unless expressly agreed upon by both parties at
the time of the transaction, subject to certain exceptions enumerated in the rule. To provide
context for understanding the proposed amendment and the related economic analysis that
follows, this section provides an overview of the current state of trade settlement processes under
current Rule 15c6-1. Given the differences in the clearance and settlement processes for trades
by retail and some institutional investors, the proposed amendment may have differing economic

56

Section 17(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”)
and the rules thereunder govern the safekeeping of a registered investment company’s assets, and
generally provide that a registered investment company must place and maintain its securities
and similar instruments only with certain qualified custodians. Section 17(f)(1)(A) of the
Investment Company Act permits certain banks to maintain custody of registered investment
company assets subject to Commission rules. See 15 U.S.C. 80a-17(f).

27

effects on different market participants involved in these transactions. Accordingly, the current
clearance and settlement processes are discussed below separately. 57
a. Retail Investor Trade Settlement Process
Trade comparison, which consists of reporting, comparing, matching, and validating the
buy and sell sides of a trade is the first step in the clearance and settlement of retail investor
transactions. At the trading venue, such as an exchange or non-exchange trading venue (e.g.,
alternative trading system or electronic communication network), a buy order is electronically
matched against a sell order. If the details of the trade submitted by the counterparties agree
(e.g., the security price and quantity), the trade is considered “locked in” and then sent from the
trading venue to NSCC. 58 The following is a high level description and illustration of what
generally occurs each day following execution of a retail investor trade and submission of the
trade to NSCC:

57

Although trades in open-ended investment company securities (i.e., mutual funds) are
subject to Rule 15c6-1, trades in these securities (other than ETFs and other types of exchangetraded products) are generally not executed in the secondary market, but rather between issuers
and their broker-dealer distributors. As a non-CCP service, NSCC administers an electronic
communication system, Fund/SERV, that centralizes and standardizes order entry, confirmation,
registration and money settlement for mutual fund companies, broker-dealers, banks and trust
companies, third party administrators and other intermediaries involved in the purchase and sale
of mutual fund shares. Pursuant to NSCC rules, an NSCC member may roll up their daily cash
obligation from Fund/SERV transactions into the member’s daily net obligations at NSCC.
NSCC Rules and Procedures, supra note 26, Rules 7, 12 and 52.
58

Trade comparison can be completed at NSCC, through a trading venue, or through a
Qualified Special Representative (“QSR”) (as defined in Rule 1 of NSCC’s Rules and
Procedures) on behalf of NSCC members, as permitted by clearing agency rules. Currently, over
99% of the trade data received by NSCC is received from a trading venue or QSR on a locked-in
basis (i.e., already compared by the marketplace of execution). However, NSCC provides
comparison services for transactions in fixed income securities (i.e., corporate and municipal
bonds) and for over-the-counter transactions that are not otherwise generally matched through
other facilities. NSCC performs its comparison process on the same timeline as locked-in trade
submissions. See NSCC PFMI Disclosure Framework, supra note 27, at 7.

28

Trade Date - NSCC validates trade data received from the trading venue and confirms
receipt of the transaction details by electronically sending communication to NSCC members
that are counterparties to the trade. This communication legally commits the members to
complete the trade. 59
T+1 - At midnight on T+1, NSCC novates the trade, becoming the buyer to the selling
broker-dealer, and the seller to the buying broker-dealer and attaches a trade guaranty. 60 (Step 1)
T+2 - NSCC issues a trade summary report to its members with a summary of all
securities transactions and cash to be settled the following day, specifically indicating the net
positions of securities and the net cash amount owed by the member or to be received by the
member. NSCC also sends an electronic instruction to DTC detailing the net positions and cash
that need to be settled for each member/participant. (Step 2)
T+3 - DTC transfers the securities electronically between the buying and selling brokerdealer accounts at DTC. The participant broker-dealers instruct their settlement banks to send
money to, or receive money from, DTC to complete the transaction. 61 (Step 3) Investors
receive securities and cash from their respective broker-dealers. (Step 4)

NSCC Rules and Procedures, supra note 26, Rule 5, Section 1.

NSCC accepts transactions for clearance on business days. Pursuant to Rule 1 of
NSCC’s Rules and Procedures, the term “business day” means any day on which NSCC is open
for business. However, on any business day that banks or transfer agencies in New York State
are closed or a qualified securities depository is closed, no deliveries of securities and no
payments of money shall be made through NSCC.
61

Both NSCC and DTC jointly provide all members/participants and their settling banks
with reports throughout the day indicating their net debit and net credit amounts for individual
members/participants as well as a net-net amount for each settling bank. Each NSCC member is
required to select a settling bank to handle the electronic payment or receipt of payments through
the Federal Reserve Bank’s Fedwire system.

b. Institutional Investor Trade Settlement Process
Institutional trade processing typically starts when an institutional customer or its agent
(sometimes referred to as the “buy side”) places an order to buy or sell securities with its brokerdealer. The broker-dealer will advise the institutional customer of the trade details, who in turn
may advise its broker-dealer how the trade should be allocated among its various accounts. 62

62

In instances where an institutional investor submits an order on behalf of other parties
(e.g., an investment manager on behalf of several mutual funds), the institutional investor will
instruct its broker-dealer as to how to allocate the transactions among the underlying entities.
The broker-dealer will reply by sending details of, or confirming, each allocation and if correct,
the institutional investor will affirm.

30

The process of verifying the allocation is completed through the confirmation/affirmation
procedures described in Part II.A.2.b., which discusses the automated post-trade pre-settlement
processing of institutional investor trades.
Institutional investors may choose to trade through an executing broker-dealer that clears
and settles its securities transactions though NSCC and DTC. However, depending on the size
and complexity of the trade and the number of trading partners involved in the transaction,
institutional investors may also choose to avail themselves of processes specifically designed to
address the unique aspects of their trades. Specifically, these transactions can be processed on a
trade-for-trade basis through a prime broker-dealer and settled on an RVP/DVP basis through
DTC 63 and the institutional customer’s custodial bank. 64
The following is a high level description and illustration of what generally occurs each
day following execution of an institutional investor trade and submission of the trade to DTC:
Trade Date through T+2 - The institutional investor sends to the Matching/ETC
Provider, its broker-dealer, and its custodian the allocation information for the trade. (Step 1)
The broker-dealer then submits to the Matching/ETC Provider trade data corresponding to each

63

DTC operates a DVP settlement system for settlement of securities on a gross basis and
settlement of funds on a net basis. Deliveries of securities are subject to DTC’s risk management
controls, which are designed so that DTC may complete system-wide settlement notwithstanding
the failure to settle of its largest participant or affiliated family of participants. See DTC,
Disclosure under the PFMI Disclosure Framework, at 10 (Dec. 2015),
http://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-and-compliance.
64

Through its ID Net Service, DTC allows its participant broker-dealers to net their
institutional investor customer transactions with the broker-dealer’s other transactions (including
the broker’s retail trades) to reduce the aggregate securities movement while still retaining the
trade-for-trade settlement between the DTC participant and the custodian bank. This service also
allows the banks to maintain their responsibility to pay for only those trades where all the shares
are delivered, while at the same time providing brokers with the benefits of netting through
NSCC’s CNS system.

31

allocation, including settlement instructions and, as applicable, commissions, taxes, and fees.
(Step 2)
If the transaction is processed through a matching service, the Matching/ETC Provider
compares the institutional investor’s allocation information with the broker-dealer’s trade data to
determine whether the information contained in each field matches. If all required fields match,
the Matching/ETC Provider generates a matched confirmation and sends it to the broker-dealer,
the institutional investor, and other entities designated by the institutional investor (e.g., the
institutional investor’s custodian). (Step 3)
If the institutional investor uses the ETC process, instead of comparing the institutional
investor’s allocation information with the broker’s trade data, the Matching/ETC Provider would
transmit the information to the broker-dealer and institutional investor so that each party could
verify that the trade was executed and allocated correctly and produce an affirmed confirmation.
T+2 - After the Matching/ETC Provider creates the matched confirmation (whether by
ETC or matching), the matching service submits it to DTC as an “affirmed confirmation.” After
the affirmed confirmation has been submitted, DTC participants that are delivering securities
then authorize the trades for automated settlement. DTC currently processes transactions in realtime from approximately 8:30 p.m. on the night before settlement day (T+2) until 3:30 p.m. on
settlement day (T+3) for DVP transactions and until 6:35 p.m. for free of payment transactions.
T+3 - DTC transfers the securities electronically between the buying and selling brokerdealer accounts at DTC. The participant broker-dealers instruct their settlement banks to send
money to, or receive money from, DTC to complete the transaction.

Impact of the Settlement Cycle

The length of the settlement cycle has varying degrees of impact across the range of
market participants described above. That impact stems, in large part, from the type of risk
exposure each entity brings to the clearance and settlement process and the nature of its
processes and systems for operating within the existing framework.
From the perspective of a CCP, such as NSCC, the length of the settlement cycle may
affect the CCP’s exposure to credit, market and liquidity risk that arises once a transaction has
been novated and the CCP takes offsetting (and guaranteed) positions as a substituted

33

counterparty for each of the parties to the original transaction. 65 A CCP takes a number of
measures to manage this credit risk to its members, including through financial resource
contributions from members and netting down the total outstanding exposure it may have to a
particular member. However, the extent to which a CCP must apply these risk mitigation tools
depends in large part on the length of time it is exposed to the risk that one or more of its
members may default on their settlement obligations, which in turn is driven by the length of the
settlement cycle.
The settlement cycle similarly determines the period of time during which a CCP faces
market risk following novation. Market risk, as a general matter, can arise for a CCP where a
member has defaulted during the settlement cycle, and the CCP faces the risk that the defaulted
member’s positions and other resources the CCP holds (i.e., defaulted member collateral, such as
clearing fund deposits) decline in market value as the CCP seeks to liquidate, transfer, or
otherwise dispose of those assets to minimize losses. 66 Finally, the settlement cycle can also
impact the amount of liquidity risk a CCP may need to anticipate for purposes of settling an open
transaction (the CCP often relies on incoming payments from some members to facilitate
payments to other members) or otherwise deploying financial resources to cover losses that may
result from a member’s default. 67 A DTCC paper published in 2011 notes that shortening the

risks faced by clearing agencies.

67

See id. Credit and liquidity risk may also be relevant to the functioning of a CSD, given
that the CSD will rely on incoming payments or deliveries of securities from certain participants
to make payments or deliveries to other participants. Where a CSD participant defaults, or
where a CCP or a CSD participant faces liquidity pressure, the CSD itself may need to deploy
financial resources to cover the shortfall. For example, the CSD may maintain a participant fund
(similar in function to a clearing fund) or have available lines of credit to access in such
instances.
34

settlement cycle may result in reduced liquidity obligations for NSCC. 68 In addition, that study,
which was conducted from October 19, 2010, through August 31, 2011, indicated certain
procyclical benefits to a reduced settlement cycle in observing how NSCC clearing fund
requirements would decline if the settlement cycle was shortened. 69 The results of the study are
reflected in the tables below.

According to the study, clearing fund savings (for NSCC’s members) resulting from
shorter settlement cycles are more pronounced during periods of high volatility. 70 By showing
the same data for August 2011, a period of high volatility, the study shows a greater decrease in
NSCC’s clearing fund requirements. 71

NSCC also conducted a study from April 2011 to September 2011 that indicated that

35

According to the study, in a T+2 settlement cycle, NSCC’s average liquidity obligations would
decline by 20%, thereby reducing members’ required clearing fund deposits. 72
For broker-dealers and investors, the impact of the length of the settlement cycle can be
understood in most cases through the perspective of liquidity risk. Over the course of the
settlement cycle, broker-dealers and investors will generally seek to manage two forms of
liquidity risk – (i) sudden or unexpected liquidity demands that may arise due to the CCP’s
ongoing management of credit, market and liquidity risk exposure during the settlement cycle, 73
and (ii) the need to timely obtain and deliver cash or securities to settle outstanding trades, as
well as using cash or securities to engage in trading activity across other markets with
mismatched settlement cycles, such as non-U.S. markets.
Broker-dealers that are CCP members (including broker-dealers that are NSCC members)
have financial resource obligations which the CCP may collect for risk management purposes. 74
These financial resource obligations may be at issue where a CCP member defaults and the CCP
requires the defaulting member’s resources or the other members’ mutualized resources to
address any credit, market and liquidity risk the CCP faces as it seeks to liquidate, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the defaulted positions and related collateral of the defaulting member. 75

72

See id. at 7.

73

In this respect, the liquidity risk can be linked to market risk faced by the CCP and its
member arising from the open position between the CCP and the member, as well as any
collateral posted by the member to the CCP to cover the CCP’s credit risk exposure to the
member. Where the market value of these open positions or the posted collateral fluctuates, the
CCP may seek additional margin or other financial resources from the member. See CCA
Proposal, 79 FR 29524.
74

See supra Part II.A.2.a.(1) for additional discussion regarding the use of financial
resource requirements for risk management purposes. See also NSCC Rules and Procedures,
supra note 26, Rules 4 and 4(A).
75

See CCA Proposal, 79 FR at 29524.

36

These financial resource obligations may also be incurred within a settlement cycle where a CCP
seeks additional resources to address potential risk that may increase due to changing or
otherwise volatile market conditions that can also be procyclical. 76 In such instances, the CCP
member’s obligation to make available financial resources to the CCP keys off of the period of
time during which the CCP faces the member. Therefore, the length of the settlement cycle can
impact the amount and types (e.g., stable, highly liquid assets) of financial resources a CCP may
require of its members, which in turn creates liquidity risk exposure and capital costs for the
member in terms of obtaining and delivering to the CCP the necessary financial resources in a
timely manner.
Further, for NSCC members/DTC participants, the length of the settlement cycle
determines the deadline by which cash or securities must be delivered into the
member/participant’s DTC account for settlement purposes. Thus, a member/participant may
face liquidity risk in obtaining (or recalling) from other markets with mismatched settlement
cycles the necessary resources to deliver in time for settlement. Similarly, the length of the
settlement cycle governs the time when the proceeds of a securities transaction may be made
available to the member/participant. A mismatch in timing between the settlement cycle for the
securities transaction and the settlement cycle for another market transaction, such as in the
derivatives or a non-U.S. market with a different settlement cycle, can lead in turn to liquidity
risk for the member in meeting all of its settlement obligations across markets. 77

76

See DTCC, DTCC Recommends Shortening the U.S. Trade Settlement Cycle (Apr.
2014), http://www.ust2.com/industry-action/.
77

For example and as noted earlier, the settlement cycle timeframe for open-end mutual
funds that settle through NSCC is generally T+1. However, the settlement cycle timeframe for
many underlying portfolio securities held by mutual funds is T+3. Settlement timeframes for
securities with non-standard settlements held by these funds may be longer than T+3. This
37

Broker-dealers that are not members of a CCP may similarly face certain of the liquidity
risks described above because the clearing broker-dealer may pass on related costs through
margin charges, as well as other charges and fees (which may, in some cases, be incorporated in
the clearing broker-dealer’s management of its credit risk to the non-clearing broker-dealer).
These costs may also, in turn, be applied to or passed on to both institutional and retail investors
by their executing or clearing broker-dealers. 78 For example, an industry study noted that some
NSCC members carry the exposure of their customers’ open positions during the settlement
cycle and that each day’s reduction in the settlement cycle could lessen these open exposures by
25%. 79 Therefore, the length of the settlement cycle can potentially affect the size and type of
financial resource demands broker-dealers may pass on to investors.
The impact that the length of the settlement cycle may have on the credit, market and
liquidity risk exposure faced by market participants can also lead to impacts on systemic risk.
First, the length of the settlement cycle will determine the number of unsettled transactions
present in the settlement system at any given point in time, and consequently the level of
exposure to credit, market and liquidity risks faced by market participants. This attendant credit,
market and liquidity risk, in turn, can affect the potential likelihood of a market participant
defaulting. In the event of a default of a major market participant, the default may entail losses

mismatch in timing presents potential liquidity risks for such funds as market participants with
respect to the receipt of portfolio proceeds and in satisfying their investor redemption
obligations. See Investment Company Act Release No. 31835 (Sept. 22, 2015), 80 FR 62273,
62282-83 (Oct. 15, 2015); see also, e.g., PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Shortening the
Settlement Cycle: The Move to T+2, at 13 n.18 (2015) (“ISC White Paper”),

38

so large as to create widespread or systemic problems. Further, the default of one member may
lead to the default of one or more other members, exacerbating any financial stress a CCP or
other market infrastructure may be experiencing because of the default. 80
As a more general matter, market participants rely on CCPs for prompt clearance and
settlement of transactions and the receipt of proceeds from those transactions. Thus, a significant
disruption in the clearance and settlement process and transmission of these proceeds could
potentially harm other market participants, particularly in instances where market participants in
centrally cleared and settled markets are linked through intermediation chains to each other and
to participants in uncleared markets (as is the case in the U.S. clearance and settlement system).
Shortening the settlement cycle is therefore one of the primary methods for reducing this risk. 81

Post-Rule 15c6-1 Adoption

Since the adoption of Rule 15c6-1, the Commission and various market participants have,
as described in greater detail below, explored the possibility of shortening the standard
settlement cycle further. Below is a description of these efforts.
a. SIA T+1 Initiative
After the implementation of the T+3 settlement cycle, the Securities Industry Association
(“SIA”) led an effort to shorten the settlement cycle to T+1 and implement STP. 82 In 2000, the

80

See T+3 Adopting Release, 58 FR at 52894; see also Clearing Agency Standards
Adopting Release, 77 FR at 66254 (discussing the need for default procedures to allow the
clearing agency to take action resulting from one or more member defaults in order to contain
resultant losses and liquidity pressures).

82

The SIA (which has since merged with other industry groups to form the Securities
Industry Financial Markets Association) was a trade association that represented U.S. brokerdealers.

39

SIA published its T+1 Business Case Final Report (“SIA Business Case Report”) which
concluded that the case for moving to a T+1 settlement cycle in the U.S. was “strong” based
upon several factors. 83 According to the SIA Business Case Report: (i) the move from T+3 to
T+1 would dramatically reduce the settlement risk exposure of the U.S. securities industry; 84 (ii)
the transition to a T+1 settlement cycle would enable the U.S. market to continue to maintain its
global competitiveness by serving as the catalyst for enhancing the current post-trade processing
and settlement process; 85 and (iii) the move to T+1 would serve the interests of U.S. investors by
synchronizing the clearance and settlement process across asset classes, thus enabling more
fungible, flexible trading and investing. 86
The SIA Business Case Report also identified ten “building blocks” essential to realizing
the goal of improving the speed, safety, and efficiency of the trade settlement process, and
included a cost benefit analysis for transitioning to T+1. 87 The implementation of these building

84

Id. at 1, 7. The SIA Business Case Report did not explicitly define the term “settlement
risk.” However, the report argued that a move to a T+1 settlement cycle would reduce credit risk
exposure and operational risk exposure. See id. at 39-41.

Id.; see also infra Part VI.D.1. for a discussion of the alternative of shifting to a T+1
settlement cycle.
87

See id. at 2-3. The 10 Building Blocks identified in the report are as follows: (1) modify
internal processes at broker-dealers, asset managers, and custodians to ensure compliance with
compressed settlement deadlines; (2) identify and comply with accelerated deadlines for
submission of trades to the clearing and settlement systems; (3) amend NSCC’s trade guaranty
process so that guaranty is provided on trade date; (4) report trades to clearing corporations in
locked-in format and revise clearing corporations’ output; (5) rewrite CNS processes at NSCC to
enhance speed and efficiency; (6) reduce reliance on checks and use alternative means of
payment, such as automatic debits allowed by the National Automated Clearing House
Association; (7) immobilize securities shares prior to conducting transactions; (8) revise the
prospectus delivery rules and procedures for initial public offerings; (9) develop industry
40

blocks, the report noted, would ensure that the transition to a T+1 settlement cycle would be
accomplished in an orderly and risk-effective manner. 88
In July 2002, the SIA shifted the principal focus of its initiative from shortening the
settlement cycle to achieving industry-wide STP and planned to reconsider the need to pursue a
reduction in the settlement cycle in 2004. 89 At that time, the SIA believed more work was
needed on improving operational processing to achieve STP before a transition to T+1 could be
considered. 90 The SIA’s reasoning for this shift in focus stemmed largely from an operational
risk concern, observing that while a shorter settlement cycle would be expected to decrease the
gross amount of unsettled trades subject to credit or market risk, it could increase operational risk
at that time by reducing the time available to correct errors prior to settlement. The SIA
therefore argued that the industry priority should be to ensure that a higher amount and rate of
trades were affirmed/confirmed on an earlier basis via STP, which in turn would be useful for a
later consideration of compressing the settlement cycle in an environment less prone to the
likelihood of operational risk. 91

to standardized industry protocols for broker-dealers, asset managers, and custodians.

b. Securities Transaction Concept Release
In March 2004, the Commission published a concept release (“Concept Release”) seeking
comment on methods to improve the safety and operational efficiency of the U.S. clearance and
settlement system and to help the U.S. securities industry achieve STP. 92 Specifically, the
Commission sought comment on, among other things, (i) the benefits and costs of shortening the
settlement cycle to a timeframe less than T+3; (ii) whether the Commission should adopt a new
rule or the SROs should be required to amend their existing rules to require the completion of the
confirmation/affirmation process on trade date (“T+0”); and (iii) reducing the use of physical
securities. 93 The purpose of the Concept Release was to build upon the domestic initiatives and
continue the exploration of methods to improve the operations of the national clearance and
settlement system. The Commission received sixty-three comment letters from a wide variety of
commenters, both domestic and international, including but not limited to, broker-dealers,
transfer agents, issuers, individual and institutional investors, academics, service providers, and
industry associations. 94 While the comments were informative and relevant at the time,
technological, operational and regulatory changes in the interim have addressed many of the
issues raised by the commenters.
The Commission received thirty-four comment letters expressing a position on shortening
the settlement cycle, 95 with the majority of the commenters either: (i) supporting shortening the

that supported the implementation of a T+1 settlement cycle noted the benefits of a shortened
settlement cycle, including reducing risks, reducing costs, improving efficiencies, and making

assets with finality the next trading day. 97 Several commenters based their general support on
the view that currently available technology (as it existed in 2004) would support a T+1 or T+0

technology facilitating “real time settlement” was not currently cost effective, it would be in the
future as technology develops and advances. 100 If real time settlement were feasible, this
commenter noted, the market architecture would make sure that the securities and cash were
available in good deliverable form for instant settlement before the execution of the trade,
thereby eliminating failures to deliver or pay for securities, as well as totally eliminate systemic
and counterparty risk. 101
Of the thirty-four comments on shortening the settlement cycle, fourteen commenters
expressed a preference to defer a decision on changing the settlement cycle until the industry
could implement STP or other complementary processes. 102 Reasons for deferring the decision
varied, but generally focused on the need for additional information or additional time for the
industry to implement STP successfully. 103 Some of these commenters also raised concerns

that may arise from the switch to T+1. 104 One commenter, in particular, noted that a regulatory

Since the publication of the SIA Business Case Report in 2000 and the publication of the

the possibility of further shortening the settlement cycle while observing significant changes in
the securities industry with respect to post-trade processes and technology. Below is a
discussion of a number of recent significant industry initiatives that have considered the question
of whether and when to further shorten the standard settlement cycle and that have informed the
Commission’s proposal.

BCG Study

In May 2012, DTCC commissioned a study to examine and evaluate the necessary
investments and resulting benefits associated with a shortened settlement cycle for U.S. equities
and corporate and municipal bonds. 106 The study, which was conducted by the Boston
Consulting Group (“BCG”) and published in October 2012, analyzed the costs, benefits,
opportunities and challenges associated with shortening the settlement cycle in the U.S.
securities markets to either T+1 or T+2, respectively. 107
The scope of BCG’s analysis included U.S. equities, corporate bonds, and municipal
bonds settling at DTC. 108 The study covered clearing and settlement processes at various types
of market participants (e.g., broker-dealers, buy-side firms, and custodian banks), in addition to
processes closely related to clearance and settlement (such as corporate action processing and
securities lending) and specific situations (such as post-trade processes for cross-border
transactions involving securities lending in the U.S.). 109

(Oct. 2012) (“BCG Study”),

ment_Cycle_October2012.pdf. The BCG Study also noted a “T+0” settlement cycle (i.e.,
settlement on trade date) “was ruled out as infeasible for the industry to accomplish at this time,
given the exceptional changes required to achieve it and weak support across the industry.” Id.

processes such as such as trade reconciliation and exception management, securities lending and
transactions with foreign counterparties (especially where time zones are least aligned). Id. at

would also need to be significantly altered to enable transactions late into the day. Id. For

The BCG Study did not advocate any specific approach to shortening the settlement
cycle, but noted that moving to a T+2 settlement cycle would be significantly less costly and take
less time to implement than either an immediate or gradual transition to T+1, while still
delivering significant benefits. 110
The BCG Study noted that market participants were aware that a T+2 settlement cycle
could be accomplished through mere compression of timeframes and corresponding rule changes
but that implementing a transition to T+2 without certain building blocks or enablers would limit
the amount of savings that would be realized across the industry. 111 In particular, BCG
identified the following T+2 enablers: (i) migration to trade data matching; 112 (ii) a crossindustry settlement instruction solution; (iii) dematerialization of physical securities; (iv) “access
equals delivery” 113 for all products 114, and (v) increased penalties for fails. 115 The study further
concluded that T+1 could be built on the aforementioned T+2 enablers but would also require
infrastructure for near-real-time trade processing, and transforming securities lending and foreign
buyer processes. 116

This migration would essentially entail a mandated “match to settle.” Mandated “match
to settle” would require institutional trades to be matched before settlement at DTC could occur.
See BCG Study, supra note 107, at 65.
113

In 2005, the Commission adopted Securities Act Rule 172, which, with certain
exclusions, provides an “access equals delivery” model that permits final prospectus delivery
obligations to be satisfied by the filing of the final prospectus with the Commission, rather than
delivery of the prospectus to purchasers. See Securities Offering Reform, Exchange Act Release
No. 52056 (July 19, 2005), 70 FR 44722, 44783-85 (Aug. 3, 2005).

In addition, BCG noted that acceleration of retail client funding processes “may” need to
take place to enable T+1 settlement. 117 Finally, BCG identified certain changes it believed that
regulators, including the Commission, DTCC, FINRA, the MSRB, and NYSE, would need to
make to their rules to enable a shorter settlement cycle. 118 These changes included, among
others, amending Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1. 119
Based on the foregoing, in April 2014, DTCC recommended shortening the U.S. trade
settlement cycle for equities, municipal bonds, and unit investment trusts to T+2 and stated it
would work with the industry to establish an implementation timeline. 120 Once achieved, DTCC
recommended a pause and further assessment of industry readiness and appetite for a future
move to T+1. 121 The recommendation was based on: (1) results from risk studies that measure
exposure and NSCC’s liquidity needs; (2) the results of the BCG Study; (3) input from industry
associations; and (4) one-on-one interviews with more than 50 firms across the securities
industry, which helped DTCC define behavioral and system changes required to shorten the
settlement cycle. 122

Industry Steering Committee and Industry Planning

In October 2014, DTCC, in collaboration with the Investment Company Institute (“ICI”),
the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”), and other market
participants, formed an Industry Steering Group (“ISC”) and an industry working group to

facilitate the transition to a T+2 settlement cycle for U.S. trades in equities, corporate and
municipal bonds, and UITs. 123 The impetus for moving to a T+2 settlement cycle, as stated by
the ISC, was to (i) reduce credit and liquidity risks to the industry and investors, (ii) reduce
operational risk; (iii) reduce liquidity costs and free up capital for broker-dealers by reducing the
required NSCC clearing fund contributions; (iv) enable investors to gain quicker access to funds
and securities following a trade execution, and better protect investors from the risk of a brokerdealer default between trade date and settlement date; (v) reduce operational costs; and (vi)
increase global harmonization. 124
In June 2015, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, in conjunction with the ISC, published a
white paper, 125 which included certain “industry-level requirements” and “sub-requirements”
that the ISC believed would be required for a successful migration to a T+2 settlement cycle to
occur. The ISC White Paper also included an implementation timeline that targeted the
transition to T+2 by the end of the third quarter of 2017.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, in conjunction with the ISC, published the T+2 Industry
Implementation Playbook (“T+2 Playbook”) in December 2015, which sets forth the requested
implementation timeline with milestones and dependencies, as well as detailing “remedial
activities” that impacted market participants should consider to prepare for migration to the T+2

specific industry-level requirements and sub-requirements that were identified in the ISC White
Paper.
Consistent with the ISC White Paper, the timeline provided in the T+2 Playbook targeted
the third quarter of 2017 for completing the migration to a T+2 settlement cycle. 127 In addition
to providing an implementation schedule, the T+2 Playbook was intended to serve as an industry
resource for individual firms as they make the necessary changes to procedures and technology
for transition to a T+2 settlement cycle. 128

Investor Advisory Committee Recommendations

In February 2015, the Commission’s Investor Advisory Committee (“IAC”) 129 issued a
public statement noting that shortening the settlement cycle will mitigate operational and
systemic risk, as well as “reduce credit, liquidity, and counterparty exposure risks,” which will
benefit both the securities industry and individual investors. 130 In its recommendation, the IAC
stated that it “strongly endorsed the direction of the recommendation by DTCC” to shorten the

T+2 settlement cycle), noting that retail investors would significantly benefit from a T+1
settlement cycle. 131 In the event that a T+2 standard settlement cycle is pursued, the IAC
recommended that the Commission work with industry participants to create a clear plan for
moving to T+1 shortly thereafter. 132
B.

Transition to T+2 in Non-U.S. Securities Markets

As market participants have worked to develop plans to shorten the standard settlement
cycle in the U.S. to T+2, several non-U.S. securities markets have already shifted to a T+2
settlement cycle, and certain other non-U.S. securities markets have announced plans to
transition to a T+2 settlement cycle. 133 These efforts to transition to a T+2 settlement cycle in
markets outside the U.S. have been driven in part by considerations specific to the needs of the
particular geographic region or market structure, as well as certain considerations identified by
policy makers, market participants, and industry experts as to how shortening the settlement
cycle to T+2 would reduce risk in the relevant market and increase the operational efficiency of
post-trade processes. The Commission preliminarily believes that many of the reasons

131

Id. According to the IAC, moving to a T+1 settlement cycle, matching the settlement
cycle that already exists for treasuries and mutual funds, would greatly reduce systemic risk and
benefit investors. See also Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, Technical
Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, Recommendations for
Securities Settlement Systems (Nov. 2001), at 4, 10, http://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d46.pdf
(recommending that the benefits and costs of a settlement cycle shorter than T+3 should be
evaluated).
132

Id.

133

In addition to the non-U.S. markets that have moved to a T+2 settlement cycle, certain
non-U.S. markets are on a settlement cycle shorter than T+2, including Israel, Chile, and Saudi
Arabia, which are on a T+0 cycle, and China, which is on a T+1 cycle.

52

motivating efforts in other jurisdictions to shorten the settlement cycle to T+2 are, in principle,
similar to those identified by the Commission in this proposal.
For example, national markets in the European Union (“EU”) moved to a harmonized
settlement cycle of T+2 134 to both achieve a successful integration of settlement infrastructures
across the EU as well as realize perceived benefits a shorter settlement cycle would bring in
reducing counterparty credit risk (and associated market and liquidity risks), greater automation
of back-office processes and reduced collateral requirements, and reduced costs for market
participants. 135
Australia and New Zealand transitioned to a T+2 settlement cycle in March 2016.
Industry support in those markets was predicated on the widespread agreement that shortening
the settlement cycle to T+2 would reduce counterparty, credit and operational risks, increase
market liquidity, reduce CCP margin requirements and reduce capital requirements for broker134

Prior to the so-called “big bang” migration to a T+2 settlement cycle on October 6, 2014,
the standard settlement cycle for exchange-traded shares was T+3 in all European securities
markets except Germany, Slovenia and Bulgaria, which already operated on a T+2 settlement
cycle. The 29 national markets that moved to a T+2 settlement cycle on October 6, 2014 were:
Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania,
Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain (certain fixed income
trades only), Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. See also, “A very smooth

acknowledged the existence of a global move toward shortened settlement cycles and the
importance of international harmonization with respect to shortened settlement cycles. 137
Japanese and Canadian policy makers, regulators and market participants are also considering a
transition to a T+2 settlement cycle, 138 with Canadian market participants of the view that, given
the interconnectedness between the Canadian and U.S. securities markets, a transition in Canada
to a T+2 settlement cycle should occur at the same time such a transition is achieved in the U.S.
markets. 139

Discussion

Proposal
1.

Current Rule 15c6-1

The Commission’s adoption of Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1 created a standard settlement
cycle for broker-dealer transactions. 140 The Commission took this step in part because it believed
that implementing faster settlement of securities transactions and improving the clearance and
settlement process would better protect investors. 141 Rule 15c6-1(a) provides that, unless
otherwise expressly agreed by the parties at the time of the transaction, a broker-dealer is
prohibited from entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security (other than an
exempted security, government security, municipal security, commercial paper, bankers’
acceptances, or commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities
later than the third business day after the date of the contract. 142 Rule 15c6-1(a) covers all
securities except for the exempted securities enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of the rule. The
Commission extended application of Rule 15c6-1(a) to the purchase and sale of securities issued
by investment companies (including mutual funds), 143 private-label mortgage-backed securities,
and limited partnership interests that are listed on an exchange. 144 The rule also allows a broker-

141

See T+3 Adopting Release, 58 FR 52891.

17 CFR 240.15c6-1(a).

143

The Commission applied Rule 15c6-1 to broker-dealer contracts for the purchase and sale
of securities issued by investment companies, including mutual funds, because the Commission
recognized that these securities represented a significant and growing percentage of brokerdealer transactions. See T+3 Adopting Release, 58 FR at 52900.

144

With regard to limited partnerships, the Commission excluded non-listed limited
partnerships due to complexities related to processing the trades in these securities and the lack
55

dealer to agree that settlement will take place in more or less than three business days, provided
that such an agreement is express and reached at the time of the transaction. 145
Rule 15c6-1(b) provides an exclusion for contracts involving the purchase or sale of
limited partnership interests that are not listed on an exchange or for which quotations are not
disseminated through an automated quotation system of a registered securities association. In
recognition of the fact that the Commission may not have identified all situations or types of
trades where settlement on T+3 would be problematic, paragraph (b) of the rule also provides
that the Commission may exempt by order additional types of trades from the requirements of
the T+3 settlement timeframe, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the
Commission determines that such an exemption is consistent with the public interest and the
protection of investors. 146
Pursuant to Rule 15c6-1(b), the Commission has granted an exemption for securities that
do not generally trade in the U.S. 147 Under this exemptive order, all transactions in securities
that do not have transfer or delivery facilities in the U.S. are exempt from the scope of Rule
15c6-1. Furthermore, if less than 10% of the annual trading volume in a security that has U.S.
transfer or deliver facilities occurs in the U.S., the transaction in such security will be exempt
from the rule unless the parties clearly intend T+3 settlement to apply. In addition, an ADR is

of an active secondary market. In contrast, the Commission included listed limited partnerships
primarily to ensure exclusion of these securities would not unnecessarily contribute to the
bifurcation of the settlement cycle for listed securities generally. See T+3 Adopting Release, 58
FR at 52899.

facilities in the U.S. for a foreign security but there are transfer facilities for an ADR receipt
based on such foreign security, under the order, only the foreign security will be exempt from
Rule 15c6-1. The Commission has also granted an exemption for contracts for the purchase or
sale of any security issued by an insurance company (as defined in Section 2(a)(17) of the
Investment Company Act 148) that is funded by or participates in a “separate account” (as defined
in Section 2(a)(37) of the Investment Company Act 149), including a variable annuity contract or a
variable life insurance contract, or any other insurance contract registered as a security under the
Securities Act. 150
Rule 15c6-1(c) provides a T+4 settlement cycle in firm commitment underwritings for
securities that are priced after 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. 151 Specifically, paragraph (c) states that
the three-day settlement requirement in paragraph (a) does not apply to contracts for the sale of
securities that are priced after 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on the date that such securities are priced
and that are sold by an issuer to an underwriter pursuant to a firm commitment offering
registered under the Securities Act or sold to an initial purchaser by a broker-dealer participating

to by the parties at the time of the transaction.
Rule 15c6-1(d) provides that, for purposes of paragraphs (a) and (c) of the rule, parties to
a contract shall be deemed to have expressly agreed to an alternate date for payment of funds and
delivery of securities at the time of the transaction for a contract for the sale for cash of securities
pursuant to a firm commitment offering if the managing underwriter and the issuer have agreed
to such date for all securities sold pursuant to such offering and the parties to the contract have
not expressly agreed to another date for payment of funds and delivery of securities at the time of
the transaction. 152

Proposed Amendment to Rule 15c6-1 to Shorten the Standard
Settlement Cycle to T+2

The Commission proposes to amend Rule 15c6-1(a) to prohibit a broker-dealer from
effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security (other than an exempted
security, government security, municipal security, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or
commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities later than the
second business day after the date of the contract unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the
parties at the time of the transaction. 153

152

17 CFR 240.15c6-1(d).

153

Rule 15c6-1(a) provides that the payment of funds and delivery of securities (other than
certain securities exempted) must occur no later than T+3, unless otherwise expressly agreed to
by the parties at the time of the transaction. At the time that Rule 15c6-1(a) was adopted, the
Commission stated its belief that usage of this provision “was intended to apply only to unusual
transactions, such as seller’s option trades that typically settle as many as sixty days after
execution as specified by the parties to the trade at execution.” T+3 Adopting Release, 58 FR at

Reasons to Transition from T+3 to T+2

As previously discussed, the length of the settlement cycle can impact the nature and
level of risk exposure for various market participants. 154 The Commission preliminarily believes
that the proposal to shorten the standard settlement cycle from three days to two days would
potentially offer market participants (e.g., CCPs, broker-dealers, custodians, and investors)
significant benefits through the reduction of exposure to credit, market, and liquidity risk, as well
as related reductions to systemic risk. Assuming current levels of trading activity remain
constant, shortening the time period between trade execution and trade settlement decreases the
total number of unsettled trades that exists at any point in time, as well as the total market value
of all unsettled trades. This reduction in the number and total value of unsettled trades should, in
turn, correspond to a reduction in market participants’ exposure to credit, market, liquidity and
systemic risk arising from those unsettled transactions. The reduction of these risks should, in
turn, improve the stability of the U.S. markets, and ultimately enhance investor protection.
In the case of a CCP, fewer unsettled trades and a reduced time period of exposure to
such trades will reduce the CCP’s credit, market and liquidity risk exposure to its members. As
discussed earlier, a CCP, through novation, acts as the counterparty to its members and faces
resultant credit risk in that a clearing member, both on behalf of purchasers of securities who
may fail to deliver the payment, and on behalf of sellers of securities who may fail to deliver the
securities. In each case, the CCP is required to meet its obligation to its members, which in
respect of the buyer is to deliver securities, and in respect of the seller is to deliver cash.

applied in limited cases to ensure that the settlement cycle set by Rule 15c6-1(a) remains a
standard settlement cycle.
154

For a more detailed discussion on risk, see supra Part II.A.4.

59

The CCP also faces market risk where, during the settlement cycle, a member defaults
and the CCP may be forced to liquidate open positions of the defaulting member and any
financial resources of the member it may hold (i.e., collateral) to cover losses and expenses in
adverse market circumstances. For example, if the market value of the securities has increased
in the interim between trade date and settlement date, the CCP may be forced to obtain the
replacement securities in the market at a higher price.
Finally, the CCP can face liquidity risks during the settlement cycle when a member
defaults, resulting in the CCP deploying financial resources to meet the CCP’s end-of-day
settlement obligations. 155 In each instance, the amount and period of risk to which the CCP is
exposed is a function of the length of the settlement cycle, and therefore shortening the
settlement cycle should reduce the CCP’s overall exposure to those risks.
The Commission preliminarily believes that shortening the standard settlement cycle to
T+2 will also result in related reductions in liquidity risk for broker-dealers that are CCP
members, and by extension introducing broker-dealers and investors that clear their trades
through CCP members. 156 As noted earlier, a CCP may take a number of measures to manage
the risks its members present, including through member financial resource contributions and
netting down the total outstanding exposure of a particular member. However, the extent to
155

The costs associated with deploying such resources are ultimately borne by the CCP
members, both in the ordinary course of the CCP’s daily risk management process and in the
event of an extraordinary event where members may be subject to additional liquidity
assessments. As discussed earlier, these costs may be passed on through the CCP members to
broker-dealers and investors.
156

See supra note 77 (discussing mutual fund settlement timeframes and related liquidity
risk, which may be exacerbated during times of stress). The Commission preliminarily believes
that shortening settlement timeframes for portfolio securities to T+2 will assist in reducing
liquidity and other risks for funds that must satisfy investor redemption requests subject to
shorter settlement timeframes (e.g., T+1).

60

which a CCP must apply these risk mitigation tools is dictated by the amount of unsettled trades
that remain outstanding as well as the time during which the CCP remains exposed to these risks.
Thus, by reducing the amount of unsettled trades and the period of time during which the CCP is
exposed to such trades, the Commission preliminarily anticipates a reduction in financial
resource obligations for CCP members. This anticipated benefit to CCP members should have,
in turn, a positive impact on the liquidity risks and costs faced by broker-dealers and investors.
First, it should reduce the amount of financial resources that CCP member broker-dealers may
have to provide for the CCP’s risk management process, both on an ordinary course basis as well
as in less predictable or procyclical instances where adverse general market conditions or a CCP
member default results in a sudden liquidity demand by the CCP for additional financial
resources from market participants. 157 This reduction in the potential need for financial
resources should, in turn, reduce the liquidity costs and capital demands clearing broker-dealers
face in the current environment.
Second, this anticipated reduction in CCP financial resource demands on its members
may, in turn, result in reduced margin charges and other fees that clearing broker-dealers may
pass down to introducing broker-dealers, institutional investors and retail investors, thereby
reducing trading costs and freeing up capital for deployment elsewhere in the markets by those
entities. Third, a shorter settlement cycle should enable market participants to gain quicker
access to funds and securities following trade execution, which should further reduce liquidity
risks and financing costs faced by market participants who may use those proceeds to transact in
other markets, including the derivatives markets and non-U.S. markets, that operate on a

157

Recommends Shortening the U.S. Trade Settlement Cycle, supra note 76.

61

mismatched settlement cycle. Similarly, by more closely aligning and harmonizing the
settlement cycles across markets, the rule would reduce the degree and period of time during
which market participants are exposed to credit, market and liquidity risk arising from unsettled
transactions.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that the reduction in credit, market and
liquidity risks described above should reduce systemic risk. Because of the procyclicality of
financial resource and other liquidity demands by CCPs and other market participants during
times of market volatility and stress, efforts to reduce these liquidity demands through a shorter
settlement cycle are expected to reduce systemic risk. 158 As the Commission noted in adopting
Rule 15c6-1 in 1993, reducing the total volume and value of outstanding obligations in the
settlement pipeline at any point in time will better insulate the financial sector from the potential
systemic consequences of serious market disruptions. 159 The Commission believes these views
are even more apt today given the increasing interconnectivity and interdependencies among
markets and market participants. 160 In addition, reducing the period of time during which a CCP
is exposed to credit, market and liquidity risk should enhance the overall ability of the CCP to
serve as a source of stability and efficiency in the national clearance and settlement system,

thereby reducing the likelihood that disruptions in the clearance and settlement process will
trigger consequential disruptions that extend beyond the cleared markets. 161
Lastly, the Commission preliminarily believes that significant advances in technology
and substantive changes in market infrastructures and operations that have occurred since 1993,
and which we believe are widely assimilated into market practices, provide a basis to
accommodate a further reduction in the standard settlement cycle to two days. For example, the
market has improved the confirmation/affirmation and matching process through the emergence
and integration of Matching/ETC Providers into the national clearance and settlement
infrastructure. According to statistics published by DTCC in 2011 regarding affirmation rates
achieved through industry utilization of a certain Matching/ETC Provider, on average, 45% of
trades were affirmed on trade date, while 90% were affirmed on T+1, and 92% were affirmed by
noon on T+2. 162 Additionally, the number of securities immobilized or dematerialized in U.S.
markets has continued to substantially increase in recent years. 163
The Commission notes that progress by market participants in this respect has become
particularly evident in recent years. For example, DTCC published in 2011 a report that
included a review of the status of the building blocks originally identified in the SIA Business

161

See CCA Proposal, 79 FR at 29598. Clearing members are often members of larger
financial networks, and the ability of a covered clearing agency to meet payment obligations to
its members can directly affect its members’ ability to meet payment obligations outside of the
cleared market. Thus, management of liquidity risk may mitigate the risk of contagion between
asset markets.

Case Report. 164 According to the DTCC report, many of the impediments identified in the SIA
Business Case Report have since been resolved and significant progress has been made toward
achieving many of the building blocks. Since that 2011 report was published, the Commission
has observed that market participants have begun to accelerate collective progress, largely under
the auspices of the ISC, to prepare for a transition to a T+2 settlement cycle. 165
More recently, the ISC, through its T+2 Playbook, has mapped out the technological and
operational changes necessary to support a two day settlement cycle. In many cases, these
changes require only incremental modifications to existing market infrastructures and systems
and processes. For example, the Commission preliminarily anticipates that a shortened
settlement cycle may require incremental increases in utilization by certain market participants of
Matching/ETC Providers, with a focus on improving and accelerating affirmation/confirmation
processes, as well as relative enhancements to efficiencies in the services and operations of the
Matching/ETC Providers themselves. The Commission preliminarily expects that these changes
may be necessary in a T+2 environment because certain steps related to the allocation,
confirmation, and affirmation of institutional trades will need to occur earlier in the settlement
cycle compared to in a T+3 environment. 166 The Commission also notes that market participants
have raised a number of additional anticipated benefits that may arise from shortening the
settlement cycle to T+2. In particular, the Commission observes that the ISC identified the

VI.C.5.a. for a discussion of the impact of technological improvements on costs estimates to

reduction in operational costs as an additional reason to move to a T+2 settlement cycle at this
time. 167
For all the reasons cited above, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is
appropriate to shorten the standard settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2. The Commission,
however, seeks public comment on these, and other potential benefits, that may be realized in the
current market structure by shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2.
Notwithstanding the Commission’s preliminary expectation of the risk-reducing benefits
noted above, the Commission also understands that the standard settlement cycle can have a
significant influence upon the activities and operations of a wide range of market participants –
from individual investors to financial services professionals to systemically important FMUs,
such as certain registered clearing agencies. When the Commission proposed Rule 15c6-1 in
1993, a number of commenters raised for consideration potential costs and burdens that various
market participants would have to assume to ensure compliance with an orderly transition from
T+5 to T+3. 168 In adopting the final rule and establishing a standard settlement cycle of T+3, the
Commission acknowledged the likelihood of market participant costs and burdens, but ultimately
determined, based on consideration of the anticipated benefits and contemporaneous industry
initiatives to achieve a T+3 environment, to adopt the rule. 169 In addition, the Commission noted
that calibrating the final rule’s implementation date to afford market participants sufficient time

to prepare for a T+3 environment was an important measure to address commenters’ concerns
about burdens and costs. 170
For the purposes of its current proposal, the Commission acknowledges that a transition
from a T+3 to T+2 standard settlement cycle, and implementation of the necessary operational,
technical, and business changes, will likely result in varying burdens, costs and benefits for a
wide range of market participants. According to the BCG Study published in 2012, the total
industry investments would be $550 million for a T+2 settlement cycle and nearly $1.8 billion
for a T+1 settlement cycle. 171 The Commission has remained mindful and observant of industry
initiatives and progress targeted at facilitating an environment where a shortened standard
settlement cycle could be achieved in a manner that reduces risk for market participants while
also minimizing the likelihood of disruptive burdens and costs.
Having taken these industry initiatives and their relative progress into careful
consideration, the Commission preliminarily believes there has been collective progress by
market participants sufficient to facilitate a transition to a T+2 environment 172 and believes that
this progress will continue, such as through the increased use of the matching services provided
by Matching/ETC Providers to achieve STP. 173 Therefore, the Commission preliminarily
believes that the risk-reducing benefits described above justify the anticipated burdens and costs
of moving to a T+2 settlement cycle at this time.

Business Case Report.

See infra Part VI.A. for a discussion of certain market frictions related to investments
required to implement a shorter settlement cycle.

66

Accordingly, similar to the approach taken when Rule 15c6-1 was adopted, the
Commission anticipates providing a compliance date that would afford market participants
sufficient time to complete any outstanding preparations in a manner that minimizes transition
risks and avoids disruptive or inefficient burdens and costs. The Commission, however, is
seeking public comment on the burdens and costs associated with implementing this proposal.
4.

Consideration of Settlement Cycle Shorter than T+2

The Commission recognizes that amending Rule 15c6-1(a) to shorten the standard
settlement cycle further than T+2 (i.e., T+1 or T+0) could potentially result in further risk
reduction in the national clearance and settlement system, and accordingly seeks input from
commenters on a future shortening of the settlement cycle, including relevant factors. 174
Such potential risk reduction notwithstanding, the Commission preliminarily believes that
shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2 is the appropriate step to take at this time for
several reasons. Information from market participants regarding the technologies and processes
used to settle securities transactions in the U.S. indicates that a successful transition to a
settlement cycle that is shorter than T+2 would comparatively require larger investments by
market participants to adopt new systems and processes. 175 In particular, transitioning to a
settlement cycle that is shorter than T+2 would require near real-time capabilities for certain
settlement processes, such as institutional matching.
Additionally, the lead time and level of coordination by market participants required to
implement the changes to technology and post-trade processes that would enable a transition to a
T+1 standard settlement cycle could be longer and greater than the time and coordination
174

Study in the context of a T+1 settlement cycle alternative.

67

required to move to a T+2 settlement cycle in the near term. 176 Accordingly, the additional time
that market participants may need to transition to T+1 settlement cycle in a coordinated fashion
would delay the realization of the expected risk-reducing benefits of shortening the settlement
cycle.
Also, movement towards adoption of a standard settlement cycle that is shorter than T+2
at this time may increase funding costs for market participants who rely on the settlement of
foreign currency exchange (or “FX”) transactions to fund securities transactions that settle
regular way. Because the settlement of FX transactions occurs on T+2, market participants who
seek to fund a cross-border securities transaction with the proceeds of an FX transaction would,
in a T+1 or T+0 environment, be required to fund the securities transaction before the FX
transaction settled. Finally, the Commission preliminarily believes that shortening the settlement
cycle to T+2 would assist market participants with the settlement of cross-border transactions
because the U.S. settlement cycle would be harmonized with non-U.S. markets that have already
transitioned to a T+2 settlement cycle. 177
B.

Impact on Other Commission Rules
1.

General

The Commission has reviewed its existing regulatory framework to consider the potential
impact a T+2 standard settlement cycle may have on other Commission rules. Based on this
review, the Commission preliminarily believes that no amendments to other Commission rules
are required at this time. However, shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2 could have
ancillary consequences for how market participants comply with existing regulatory obligations.
176

See BCG study, supra note 107, at 11, 48-49.

177

For further discussion regarding the potential benefits of harmonization of settlement
cycles for market participants engaging in cross-border transactions, see infra Part VI.C.1.

68

In this regard, some Commission rules require market participants to perform certain regulatory
obligations on settlement date, within a specified number of business days after the settlement
date, or are otherwise keyed off of settlement date. Below are examples, by way of illustration,
of such rules. If the standard settlement cycle is shortened by one day, as proposed, market
participants will have to perform those regulatory obligations within a shorter time period, and as
a result it may become necessary to implement changes to existing internal policies and
processes. 178 The Commission requests comment on whether it is necessary to amend or provide
interpretive guidance concerning any other Commission rules that may be impacted by
shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2. The Commission also requests comment on the
proposed amended Regulation SHO interpretation set forth below. 179
2.

Regulation SHO

Shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2 would reduce the timeframes to effect a
close-out under Rule 204 of Regulation SHO (“Rule 204”). 180 Rule 204 provides that a
participant 181 of a registered clearing agency must deliver securities to a registered clearing
agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale in any equity security by settlement

178

For a discussion of the economic implications of shortening the standard settlement cycle
to T+2 on other Commission rules, see Part VI.C.3. of this release.

179

The Commission further notes that certain SRO rules reference Rule 15c6-1 or currently
define “regular way” settlement as occurring on T+3 and, as such, may need to be amended in
connection with shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2. Further, certain timeframes or
deadlines in SRO rules key off of the current settlement date, either expressly or indirectly. In
such cases, the SROs may need to amend these rules in connection with shortening the standard
settlement cycle to T+2.

180

17 CFR 242.204.

181

For purposes of Regulation SHO, the term “participant” has the same meaning as in
Section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(24). See Amendments to Regulation
SHO, Exchange Act Release No. 60388 (July 27, 2009), 74 FR 38266, 38268 n.34 (July 31,
2009) (“Rule 204 Adopting Release”).

date, or if a participant has a fail to deliver position, the participant shall, by no later than the
beginning of regular trading hours on the applicable close-out date, immediately close-out the
fail to deliver position by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. 182 If a
fail to deliver position results from a short sale, the participant must close-out the fail to deliver
position by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following
the settlement date. 183 Under the current T+3 standard settlement cycle, the close-out for short
sales is required by the beginning of regular trading hours on T+4. If a fail to deliver position
results from a long sale or bona fide market making activity, the participant must close-out the
fail to deliver position by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third
consecutive settlement day following the settlement date. 184 Under the current T+3 standard
settlement cycle, the close-out for long sales or bona fide market making activity is required by
the beginning of regular trading hours on T+6. However, if a T+2 settlement cycle is
implemented, the existing close-out requirement for fail to deliver positions resulting from short
sales would be reduced from T+4 to T+3 based on the existing definition of settlement date in
Rule 204. 185 Similarly, with regard to fail to deliver positions resulting from long sales or bona
fide market making activity, the existing close-out requirement would be reduced from T+6 to
T+5.

Shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2 may also impact the application of other
provisions in Regulation SHO. Under Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO, 186 a broker-dealer may
only mark a sale as “long” if the seller is “deemed to own” the security being sold under
paragraphs (a) through (f) of Rule 200 187 and either (i) the security is in the broker-dealer’s
physical possession or control; or (ii) it is reasonably expected that the security will be in the
broker-dealer’s possession or control by settlement of the transaction. 188 In the Rule 204
Adopting Release, 189 the Commission stated that “if a person that has loaned a security to
another person sells the security and a bona fide recall of the security is initiated within two
business days after trade date, the person that has loaned the security will be ‘deemed to own’ the
security for purposes of Rule 200(g)(1) of Regulation SHO, and such sale will not be treated as a
short sale . . . . In addition, a broker-dealer may mark such orders as ‘long’ sales provided such
marking is also in compliance with Rule 200(c) of Regulation SHO.” 190 Thus, broker-dealers
that initiate bona fide recalls 191 on T+2 of loaned securities that sellers are “deemed to own”
under paragraphs (a) through (f) of Rule 200 may currently mark such orders as “long.” 192 The

190

Id. at 38270 n.55 (citations omitted).

191

Because a recall must be initiated by no later than the business day preceding the
settlement date to be delivered prior to the required Rule 204 close-out, any cancellation or
modification of a recall of a security would not constitute a bona fide recall.

192

In the release adopting the “naked” short selling antifraud rule, Rule 10b-21, 17 CFR
240.10b-21, we stated that “a seller would not be making a representation at the time it submits
an order to sell a security that it can or intends to deliver securities on the date delivery is due if
the seller submits an order to sell securities that are held in a margin account but the brokerdealer has loaned out the shares pursuant to the margin agreement. Under such circumstances, it
would be reasonable for the seller to expect that the securities will be in the broker-dealer’s
71

Commission limited this interpretation of Rule 200(g)(1) regarding the marking of sales of
loaned securities “long” to those in which bona fide recalls are initiated on or before the business
day preceding settlement date under the current T+3 settlement cycle because such recalls would
likely be delivered, under the industry standard for loaned but recalled securities, 193 within three
business days after initiation of a recall. As a result, such recalled securities would be available
by T+5 to close-out the fail to deliver on a “long” sale, or before the close-out for fails on sales
marked “long” is otherwise required by Rule 204 (i.e., no later than the beginning of regular
trading hours on T+6).
However, if a T+2 standard settlement cycle is implemented, bona fide recalls initiated
on T+2 (per footnote 55 in the Rule 204 Adopting Release described above) would likely not be
delivered before the close-out requirement for fails on sales marked “long” under Rule 204 (i.e.,

physical possession or control by settlement date.” See “Naked” Short Selling Antifraud Rule,
Exchange Act Release No. 58774 (Oct. 14, 2008), 73 FR 61666, 61672 (Oct. 17, 2008). Thus, a
seller of securities would not be deemed to be deceiving a broker-dealer under Rule 10b-21 if the
seller submits a sell order to an executing broker-dealer and informs the executing broker-dealer
that the seller’s shares are in the physical possession or control of a prime broker, but neither the
seller nor the executing broker-dealer knows or has reason to know that the prime broker has
loaned out the securities pursuant to a margin agreement. We note that this interpretation, which
concerns whether a seller has made a misrepresentation regarding the deliverability of its
securities in time for settlement, does not apply to rules other than Rule 10b-21.
193

See Master Securities Loan Agreement (“MSLA”), Paragraph 6.1(a), discussing the
termination of a loan of securities (“Unless otherwise agreed, either party may terminate a Loan
on a termination date established by notice given to the other party prior to the Close of Business
on a Business Day. The termination date established by a termination notice shall be a date no
earlier than the standard settlement date that would apply to a purchase or sale of the Loaned
Securities (in the case of notice given by Lender) or the noncash Collateral securing the Loan (in
the case of a notice given by Borrower) entered into at the time of such notice, which date shall,
unless Borrower and Lender agree to the contrary, be (i) in the case of Government Securities,
the next Business Day following such notice and (ii) in the case of all other Securities, the third
Business Day following such notice”). A sample MSLA can be found at:

no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on T+5 under a T+2 settlement cycle). 194
Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that it would be appropriate to modify its
interpretation to account for a T+2 standard settlement cycle to help ensure that such loaned but
recalled securities would be available by T+4 before the close-out period for fails on sales
marked “long” would otherwise be required by Rule 204 (i.e., no later than the beginning of
regular trading hours on T+5). Specifically, if a T+2 standard settlement cycle is implemented, a
broker-dealer seeking to mark an order “long” using this interpretation would need to initiate a
bona fide recall of a security on the settlement day before the settlement date (i.e., T+1),
provided the seller is also net long under Rule 200(c) of Regulation SHO. Otherwise, the general
requirements of Rule 200 of Regulation SHO would govern, and sales of loaned securities could
only be marked “long” if the seller is “deemed to own” the security being sold and either (i) the
security is in the broker-dealer’s physical possession or control; or (ii) it is reasonably expected
that the security will be in the broker-dealer’s possession or control by settlement of the
transaction. 195

Financial Responsibility Rules Under the Exchange Act

Certain provisions of the Commission’s broker-dealer financial responsibility rules 196
reference explicitly or implicitly the settlement date of a securities transaction. For example,

194

We note that a participant may not offset the amount of its fail to deliver position with
shares that the participant receives or will receive during the applicable close-out date (i.e.,
during T+4 or T+6, as applicable) but must take affirmative action, by borrowing or purchasing
securities of like kind and quantity, at or before the beginning of regular trading hours on the
applicable close-out date. See Rule 204 Adopting Release, supra note 181, 74 FR at 38272.
195

See 17 CFR 242.200(g).

196

The term “financial responsibility rules,” for purposes of this release, includes any rule
adopted by the Commission pursuant to Sections 8, 15(c)(3), 17(a) or 17(e)(1)(A) of the
Exchange Act, any rule adopted by the Commission relating to hypothecation or lending of
73

paragraph (m) of Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3 uses settlement date to prescribe the timeframe in
which a broker-dealer must complete certain sell orders on behalf of customers. 197 As another
example, settlement date is incorporated into paragraph (c)(9) of Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1, 198
which explains what it means to “promptly transmit” funds and “promptly deliver” securities
within the meaning of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(v) of Rule 15c3-1. 199 Further, the concepts
of promptly transmitting funds and promptly delivering securities are incorporated in other
provisions of the financial responsibility rules, including paragraphs (k)(1)(iii), (k)(2)(i), and
(k)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3, 200 paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Rule 17a-5, 201 and paragraph (a)(3) of Rule
17a-13. 202 The Commission is seeking comment regarding the potential impact that shortening
the standard settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2 may have on the ability of broker-dealers to
comply with the Commission’s financial responsibility rules.
4.

Exchange Act Rule 10b-10

Providing customers with confirmations pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 10b-10 serves a
significant investor protection function. Confirmations provide customers with a means of
verifying the terms of their transactions, alerting investors to potential conflicts of interest with
their broker-dealers, acting as a safeguard against fraud, and providing investors a means to
customer securities, or any rule adopted by the Commission relating to the protection of funds or
securities. The Commission’s broker-dealer financial responsibility rules include Exchange Act
Rules 15c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3-1), 15c3-3 (17 CFR 240.15c3-3), 17a-3 (17 CFR 240.17a-3),
17a-4 (17 CFR 240.17a-4), 17a-5 (17 CFR 240.17a-5), 17a-11 (17 CFR 240.17a-11), and 17a-13

evaluate the costs of their transactions and the quality of their broker-dealers’ execution. 203
Rule 10b-10 requires that a broker-dealer send a customer a written confirmation
disclosing information relevant to the transaction “at or before completion” of the transaction. 204
Generally, Rule 15c1-1 defines “completion of the transaction” to mean the time when: (i) a
customer is required to deliver the security being sold; (ii) a customer is required to pay for the
security being purchased; or (iii) a broker-dealer makes a bookkeeping entry showing a transfer
of the security from the customer's account or payment by the customer of the purchase price. 205
While the confirmation must be sent “at or before completion” of the transaction,
Commission rules do not require that the customer receive a confirmation prior to settlement. In
connection with the adoption of amendments to Rule 15c6-1 in 1993 to establish a T+3 standard
settlement cycle, the Commission at that time noted that broker-dealers typically send customer
confirmations on the day after trade date. Today, the Commission understands that, while
broker-dealers may continue to send physical customer confirmations on the day after trade date,
broker-dealers may also send electronic confirmations to customers on trade date. Accordingly,
the Commission preliminarily believes that implementation of a T+2 settlement cycle will not
create problems with regard to a broker-dealer’s ability to comply with the requirement under
Rule 10b-10 to send a confirmation “at or before completion” of the transaction. Nonetheless,
the Commission notes that broker-dealers will have a shorter timeframe to comply with the
requirements of Rule 10b-10 in a T+2 settlement cycle.

Compliance Date
The Commission recognizes that the compliance date for the proposed amendment to

Rule 15c6-1(a) must allow sufficient time for broker-dealers, clearing agencies, and other market
participants to plan for, implement and test the changes to their systems, operations, policies and
procedures in a manner that allows for an orderly transition to a T+2 standard settlement cycle,
taking into account any burdens on broker-dealers, clearing agencies, institutional and retail
investors and others, and any potential disruptions in the securities markets. In addition, the
Commission recognizes that a compliance date should provide sufficient time for broker-dealers
to address concerns regarding the potential for the transition to a T+2 settlement cycle to
inconvenience certain retail investors. 206 As previously mentioned, failure to appropriately
implement a transition to T+2 settlement may heighten certain operational risks for the markets.
On the other hand, delaying the transition to a T+2 standard settlement cycle further than
is necessary for these activities to occur would delay realization of the benefits that are expected
to result from shortening the settlement cycle.
As of March 2016, the industry identified September 5, 2017 as the target date for the
transition to a T+2 settlement cycle to occur, 207 and, as noted above, the ISC has proposed a
timeline for implementing the necessary industry changes. The September 5, 2017 T+2
implementation date was based on a timeline reflected in the T+2 Playbook, which identified

206

A shortened settlement cycle may require, for example, certain retail investors to fund
their securities transactions earlier, and may require broker-dealers to educate their customers,
update communications, and take other steps to minimize potential burdens on retail investors.
207

See Press Release, ISC, US T+2 ISC Recommends Move to Shorter Settlement Cycle On
September 5, 2017 (Mar. 7, 2016), http://www.ust2.com/pdfs/T2-ISC-recommends-shortersettlement-030716.pdf. In this press release, the ISC noted that ““[t]he T+2 implementation date
was chosen by the T+2 ISC after careful consideration, input from industry participants and
consultation with other markets globally.” Id.

certain regulatory and industry contingencies that would have to transpire, including necessary
regulatory actions, over a period of approximately a year and a half. 208 If the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) is adopted, the Commission then would consider that date as well
as other dates in setting a compliance date. 209 The Commission would take into consideration
such factors as any investor outreach efforts and other changes that firms may need to undertake
to address concerns that the transition may temporarily inconvenience retail investors. The
compliance date would be set at an appropriate time to help avoid, in light of the scope of the
industry changes that will be required, setting a transition occurring too quickly, which could
have negative consequences for the industry and investors, and could result in disruptions to the
securities markets.
V.

Request for Comment
The Commission is requesting comment regarding all aspects of the proposed

amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) that would shorten the current T+3 standard settlement cycle to
T+2 for securities transactions, subject to the exceptions in the rule. The Commission also seeks
comment on the particular questions set forth below, and encourages commenters to submit any
relevant data or analysis in connection with their answers.
1. The Commission invites commenters to address the merits of the proposed amendment to
Rule 15c6-1(a). Is it appropriate to amend Rule 15c6-1 to shorten the standard settlement
cycle to T+2? Why or why not?
208

See T+2 Industry Playbook, supra note 126.

209

The Commission understands that since the publication of the T+2 Playbook in
December 2015, industry planning and preparation for a move to T+2 has continued. In
considering an appropriate compliance date, should the Commission determine to adopt the
proposed amendment discussed herein, the Commission could take into account the current
status of industry preparation at that time, including progress that has occurred since the
publication of the T+2 Playbook timeline.

77

2. The Commission invites commenters to provide their views on whether the standard
settlement cycle should instead be shortened to T+1 or some other shorter settlement cycle.
Why or why not?
3. Is the current scope of securities covered by Rule 15c6-1, including the exemptions provided
in Rule 15c6-1(a), still appropriate in light of the Commission’s proposal to shorten the
standard settlement cycle to T+2? Are there any asset classes, securities as defined in
Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, or types of securities transactions for which the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would present compliance problems for brokerdealers? What would be the quantitative and qualitative impacts of maintaining those
exemptions?
4. Are there market participants today that agree to settle securities transactions later than T+3?
If so, to what extent does this occur and what are the circumstances that motivate these
market participants to settle later than T+3? If Rule 15c6-1(a) is amended to shorten the
standard settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2, is it anticipated that these market participants
would continue to settle securities transactions on a longer settlement cycle and/or is it
anticipated that additional market participants would settle securities transactions later than
T+2? Conversely, are there circumstances where expedited settlements (on timeframes less
than T+3) are conducted, and if so, how often and under what circumstances? What are the
circumstances that motivate earlier settlements? If Rule 15c6-1(a) is amended to shorten the
standard settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2, how will the proposed amendment affect these
expedited settlement decisions?

78

5. Should the temporary exemptive relief from compliance with Rule 15c6-1 for transactions in
security-based swaps be extended? 210 If so, why or why not?
6. Should the Commission consider any amendments to other provisions of Rule 15c6-1 for the
purposes of shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2? If so, which provisions and
why?
7. In conjunction with a change to the standard settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2 under Rule
15c6-1(a), should the Commission amend the settlement cycle timeframe under Rule 15c61(c) for firm commitment offerings priced after 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time from the current
requirement of T+4 to a settlement cycle timeframe shorter than T+4, such as T+3 or T+2?
If so, what settlement timeframe would be appropriate for transactions covered by Rule 15c61(c)? What would be the impact on risk, costs or operations of retaining the current
provision for firm commitment offerings but shortening the settlement cycle to T+2 for
regular-way transactions, as proposed? What would be the impact on risk, costs or
operations of shortening the settlement cycle for such offerings to a T+3 or T+2 timeframe?
Please provide data to the extent feasible on the costs/burdens that might be incurred/borne,
and benefits that may be realized, by market participants as a result of shortening settlement
cycle for firm commitment offerings priced after 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
8. Are the conditions set forth in the Commission’s exemptive order for securities traded
outside the United States still appropriate? 211 If not, why not? If the exemption should be
modified, how should it be modified and why? Are the conditions set forth in the

210

As noted in note 10, supra, certain of the exemptions included in the Commission’s 2011
exemptive order (including the exemption for Rule 15c6-1) are set to expire on February 5, 2017.
211

See supra note 147 and accompanying text.

79

Commission’s exemptive order for variable annuity contracts still appropriate? 212 If not,
why not? If the exemption should be modified, how should it be modified and why? Are
there other securities or types of transactions for which the Commission should consider
providing exemptive relief under Rule 15c6-1(b)?
9. Commenters are invited to provide data on the costs/burdens that may be incurred/borne, and
benefits that may be realized, by any category of persons as a result of the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), including, without limitation, broker-dealers, clearing
agencies, custodians, institutional investors, retail investors, and others.
10. Would shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2 as proposed create difficulties for
broker-dealers to comply with the requirements of Rule 15c6-1? Please provide examples.
11. How would retail investors be impacted by new processes that broker-dealers may implement
in support of a T+2 standard settlement cycle? For example, would broker-dealers require
retail investors to have a funded cash account prior to trade execution? Would shortening the
standard settlement cycle to T+2 result in retail investors encountering ongoing costs due to a
delay in their ability to make investments? Would shortening the standard settlement cycle
to T+2 result in any benefits to retail investors?
12. In addition to the prospective impact on costs/burdens, the Commission seeks comments
related to the credit, market, liquidity, legal, and operational risks (increase or decrease)
associated with shortening the standard settlement cycle, and in particular, quantification of
such risks.
13. What impact, if any, would the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) have on market
participants who engage in cross-border transactions? To what extent would harmonization
212

See supra note 150 and accompanying text.

80

of the U.S. settlement cycle with other markets that are on a T+2 settlement cycle result in
increased or decreased operational costs to market participants? To what extent would
harmonization increase or decrease risks associated with cross-border transactions or related
transactions, such as financing transactions?
14. What impact, if any, would the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) have on market
participants who engage in trading activity across various financial product classes, including
derivatives and ETPs? 213 For example, would shortening the settlement cycle for ETPs
affect the costs, such as net capital charges related to collateral requirements, of creating or
redeeming shares in ETPs that hold portfolio securities that are on a different settlement
cycle? 214 If so, would such a change in costs affect the efficiency or effectiveness of the
arbitrage between an ETP’s secondary market price and the value of its underlying assets?

213

ETPs constitute a diverse class of financial products that seek to provide investors with
exposure to financial instruments, financial benchmarks, or investment strategies across a wide
range of asset classes. ETP trading occurs on national securities exchanges and other secondary
markets that are regulated by the Commission under the Exchange Act, making ETPs widely
available to market participants, from individual investors to institutional investors, including
hedge funds and pension funds. The largest category of ETPs is comprised of ETFs, which are
open-end fund vehicles or unit investment trusts that are registered as investment companies
under the Investment Company Act. See Request for Comment on Exchange-Traded Products,
Exchange Act Release No. 75165 (June 12, 2015), 80 FR 34729 (June 17, 2015).
214

For example, the way a market participant executes a creation or redemption of an ETF
share resembles a stock trade in the secondary market. A market participant typically referred to
as an “Authorized Participant” or “AP” submits an order to create or redeem (“CR”) ETF shares
much like an investor submits an order to his broker to buy or sell a stock. Also, similar to a
stock trade, the CR order settles on a T+3 settlement cycle through NSCC. See ICI, ICI
Research Perspective Vol. 20 No. 5, 14 (Sept. 2014), https://www.ici.org/pdf/per20-05.pdf; see
also DTCC, Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) Processing, http://www.dtcc.com/clearingservices/equities-trade-capture/etf; DTCC, ETFs and CNS Processing,
https://www.dtcclearning.com/learning/clearance/topics/exchange-traded-funds-etf/aboutetf/etfs-and-cns-processing.html.

81

15. To what extent, if any, would a T+2 standard settlement cycle impact the interaction of the
creation and redemption process with the clearance and settlement process?
16. What impact, if any, would shortening the standard settlement cycle to T+2 have on the
levels of liquidity risk that currently exist as a result of mismatches between the settlement
cycles for different markets? For example, would shortening the standard settlement cycle to
T+2 reduce the level of liquidity risk mutual funds face as a result of the mismatch between
the current T+1 settlement cycle for transactions in open-end mutual fund shares that are
settled through NSCC and the T+3 settlement cycle that is applicable to many portfolio
securities held by mutual funds?
17. The Commission seeks comment on the status and readiness of the technology and processes
in the industry that could support a T+2 or shorter settlement cycle at this time, including
data metrics used to substantiate such support. The Commission also seeks comment on the
additional costs, including changes to business processes, associated with the transition to
T+1 or a shorter standard settlement cycle relative to the costs with respect to a transition to a
T+2 standard settlement cycle, as well as any operational or technological obstacles that
market participants may need to overcome before such shorter standard settlement cycle
could be implemented effectively. In addition, the Commission seeks comment on the
additional benefits that may be realized by market participants as a result of shortening the
standard settlement cycle to T+1 or a shorter settlement cycle relative to benefits with respect
to a T+2 standard settlement cycle, as well as the time that market participants would need to
make necessary system changes in support of a transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle.
18. Which, if any, Commission rules would need to be amended, and is there a need to provide
interpretive guidance concerning any Commission rules, to accommodate a T+2 standard

82

settlement cycle? The Commission invites commenters to describe any concerns they may
have regarding such prospective changes to Commission rules and/or new interpretive
guidance.
19. If a T+2 standard settlement cycle is adopted, the Commission’s Regulation SHO marking
interpretation would necessitate loaned but recalled securities being recalled on T+1 instead
of T+2. What operational issues might arise if this were the case? Would specific
operational difficulties arise for persons that lend securities?
20. What impact, if any, would the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) have on the ability of
broker-dealers to comply with existing requirements under the Commission’s financial
responsibility rules? In particular, would a T+2 standard settlement cycle or a shorter
standard settlement cycle create operational difficulties or other problems for broker-dealers
that may impact their ability to comply with the Commission’s financial responsibility rules?
In addition, would the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) increase the costs and burdens
that broker-dealers may incur in order to comply with the Commission’s financial
responsibility rules?
21. Would a T+2 standard settlement cycle create compliance or operational problems with
regard to a broker-dealer’s ability to meet the requirement under Rule 10b-10 to send a
confirmation “at or before completion” of the transaction?
22. Would the adoption of a T+2 settlement cycle create any legal or operational concerns for
issuers or broker-dealers in their ability to comply with the prospectus delivery obligations
under Rule 172? 215

215

For a more detailed discussion regarding Rule 172 and the “access equals delivery”
model, see supra note 113.

83

23. Is the status of the building blocks toward implementing a T+1 settlement cycle, as discussed
in the DTCC Proposal to Launch a Cost-Benefit Analysis, accurate and, if not, what efforts
would need to be made to advance the building blocks to support a T+2 settlement cycle?
24. What parameters should guide the Commission in identifying an appropriate compliance date
for the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1? Please provide analysis to support your
position. The Commission encourages commenters to include in their responses discussion
regarding the implementation date proposed by the ISC (i.e., September 5, 2017).
Specifically, the Commission notes that there are a number of milestones and dependencies
described in the T+2 Playbook, and solicits comment on the length of the compliance period
that would be needed to provide enough lead time for these industry preparations to be
completed and ensure an orderly transition from a T+3 to a T+2 settlement cycle.
25. Should the compliance date occur immediately following a weekend (including a holiday
weekend), with the view that two or three non-business days would provide additional time
for performing any final system changes or testing in anticipation of the transition to a T+2
settlement cycle? If not, which day of the week would be most suitable for the transition to
occur? Are there times of the month or year that should be avoided in order to facilitate a
successful implementation of the system changes necessary to support a T+2 settlement
cycle?
26. A new technology, known as “blockchain” or “distributed ledger” technology, is being tested
in a variety of settings to determine whether it has utility in the securities industry. 216 What

216

See generally, DTCC, “Embracing Disruption, Tapping the Potential of Disrupted
Ledgers to Improve the Post-Trade Landscape,” (Jan. 2016), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR2015-12-31/pdf/2015-32755.pdf. See also Nasdaq, “Building on the Blockchain” (Mar. 23,
2016), http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/Building-on-the-Blockchain.html
84

utility, if any, would a distributed ledger system or such related technology have in the
context of a shortened settlement cycle, and if any, how would it be used? What regulatory
actions, if any, would be necessary to facilitate the use of that technology? How would
market participants ensure their use of or interaction with such technology would comply and
be consistent with federal securities laws and regulations? Please explain.
VI.

Economic Analysis
The following economic analysis begins with a discussion of the risks inherent in the

settlement cycle and how a reduction in the length of the settlement cycle may impact the
management and mitigation of these risks. Next, it discusses market frictions that potentially
impair the ability of market participants to shorten the settlement cycle in the absence of a
Commission rule. These settlement cycle risks and market frictions frame our analysis of the
rule’s benefits and costs in later sections. The Commission preliminarily believes that the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) ameliorates these market frictions and thus reduces the
risks inherent in settlement.
This discussion of the economic effects of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a)
begins with a baseline of current practices. The economic analysis then discusses the likely
economic effects of the proposed amendment, such as the costs and benefits of the proposed
amendment as well as its effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 217 The

(discussing the future use of Blockchain technology in the markets); Matthew Leising,
“Blockchain Potential for Markets Grabs Exchange CEOs’ Attention”, Bloomberg Business

blockchain technology).
217

Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking
that requires the Commission to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
85

Commission has, where possible, attempted to quantify the economic effects expected to result
from this proposal. In many cases, and as noted below in further detail, the Commission is
unable to quantify the economic effects of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) and
solicits comment, including estimates and data from interested parties, that could help it form
useful estimates of the economic effects of the proposed amendment.
A.

Background

The proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would prohibit a broker-dealer from
effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security (other than an exempted
security, government security, municipal security, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or
commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities later than the
second business day after the date of the contract unless otherwise expressly agreed to by both
parties at the time of the transaction, subject to certain exceptions provided in the rule. In its
analysis of the economic impacts of the proposal, the Commission has considered the risks that
market participants, including broker-dealers, clearing agencies, and institutional and retail
investors are exposed to during the settlement cycle and how those risks change with the length
of the settlement cycle.
The settlement cycle spans the length of time between when a trade is executed and when
cash and securities are delivered to the seller and buyer, respectively. During this period of time,
each party to a trade faces the risk that its counterparty may fail to meet its obligations to deliver
appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether
the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).
Further, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when adopting rules
under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact that any new rule would have on competition,
and provides that the Commission shall not adopt any rule that would impose a burden on
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange
Act. 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).

86

cash or securities. When a counterparty defaults or fails to meet its obligations to deliver cash or
securities, the trade must be closed-out. Regardless of whether the non-defaulting party chooses
to enter into a new transaction as a result of the failed trade, it is likely to bear costs as a result of
counterparty default. For example, a party that chooses to enter into a new transaction must find
a new counterparty to contract with and must trade at a price that may not be the same as the
price of the original trade. 218 The length of the settlement cycle influences this risk in two ways:
(i) through its effect on counterparty exposures to price volatility, and (ii) through its effect on
the value of outstanding obligations.
First, additional time allows asset prices to move further away from the price of the
original trade. For example, if daily asset returns are statistically independent, then the variance
of prices over t days is equal to t multiplied by the daily variance of asset returns. Thus when
daily returns are independent and daily variance of returns is constant, the variance of returns
increases linearly in the number of days. 219 In other words, the more days that elapse between
when a trade is executed and when a counterparty defaults, the larger the variance of prices will
be, and the more likely it will be that the difference between execution price and the price
ultimately paid will be larger. For example, if a buyer whose counterparty fails decides to enter
into a new transaction to buy the same security, the buyer faces the risk that the price of the
security will have deviated from the price of the original transaction. The price change could be
218

As described above, in its role as a CCP, NSCC becomes counterparty to both initial
parties to a transaction. In the case of cleared transactions, while each initial party is not exposed
to the risk that their original counterparty defaults, both are exposed to the risk of CCP default.
Similarly, the CCP is exposed to the risk that either initial party defaults.

219

More generally, because total variance over multiple days is equal to the sum of daily
variances and variables related to the correlation between daily returns, total variance increases
with time so long as daily returns are not highly negatively correlated. See, e.g., Morris H.
DeGroot, Probability and Statistics 216 (Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. 1986).

87

positive or negative, but in the event of a price increase, the buyer must pay more than the
original execution price; in the event of a price decrease, the buyer may buy the security for less
than the original execution price. 220
Second, the length of the settlement cycle directly influences the quantity of transactions
awaiting settlement. For example, assuming no change in transaction volumes, the volume of
unsettled trades under a T+2 settlement cycle is two-thirds the volume of unsettled trades under
T+3 settlement cycle. Thus, counterparties would have to enter into a new transaction, or
otherwise close out two-thirds the number of trades in a T+2 standard settlement cycle due to
counterparty defaults than in a T+3 standard settlement cycle. This means that for a given
adverse move in prices, the financial losses resulting from counterparty default will be two-thirds
as large under a T+2 standard settlement cycle than under a T+3 standard settlement cycle.
Market participants manage and mitigate settlement risk in a number of specific ways
that are discussed in Part II.A. of this release. Generally, these methods entail costs to market
participants. In some cases, these costs may be explicit. For instance, broker-dealers may
explicitly charge customers for providing them with the implicit option to default on payment or
delivery obligations. Other costs are implicit, such as the opportunity cost of assets posted as
collateral, or limitations on the amount of credit that broker-dealers are willing to provide to their
customers.
By shortening the standard settlement cycle, each trade will be subject to credit and
market risk for a shorter amount of time, allowing for less time between trade execution and

would reduce liquidity risks that could arise between derivative and cash markets by allowing
investors to obtain the proceeds of securities transactions sooner. These are risks that affect all
market participants, are difficult to diversify away, and require resources to manage and mitigate.
CCPs and clearing members require participants to post financial resources in order to secure
members’ obligations to deliver cash and securities to the CCP. To the extent that collateral is
posted to CCPs and clearing members for the purposes of mitigating the risks of the clearance
and settlement process, that may represent an allocative inefficiency.
This allocative inefficiency could take on several forms. First, financial resources that
are used to mitigate the risks of the clearance and settlement process could have been put to
alternative uses, such as investment in less liquid assets. Second, assets that are valuable because
they are particularly suited to meeting financial resource obligations may have been better
allocated to market participants that hold these assets for their fundamental risk and return
characteristics. These allocative inefficiencies may reduce capital formation. Reducing the
financial risks associated with the overall clearance and settlement process would thereby reduce
the amount of collateral required to mitigate these risks, which would reduce the costs that
market participants bear to manage and mitigate these risks and the allocative inefficiencies that
may stem from risk management practices. 221 Hence, the Commission preliminarily believes
that these benefits generally provide securities market participants with incentives to shorten the
settlement cycle.
However, the Commission acknowledges that certain market frictions may prevent
securities markets from shortening the settlement cycle in the absence of regulatory intervention.

221

See infra Part VI.B. for further discussion of financial resources collected to mitigate and
manage financial risks; see also, infra Part VI.C. for more information about risk reduction.

89

The Commission has considered two key market frictions related to investments required to
implement a shorter settlement cycle. The first is a coordination problem that arises when some
of the benefits of actions taken by market participants are only realized when other market
participants take a similar action. For example, absent regulatory intervention such as the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), if a particular institutional investor makes a
technological investment necessary to reduce the time it requires to match and allocate trades
while its clearing broker-dealers do not, the institutional investor cannot fully realize the benefits
of its investment, as the settlement process is limited by the capabilities of the clearing agency
for trade matching and allocation. More generally, when each market participant must bear the
costs of an upgrade in order for the entire market to enjoy a benefit, the result is a coordination
problem, where each market participant is reluctant to make the necessary investments until it
can be sure that others will also do so. In general, these coordination problems may be resolved
if all parties can credibly commit to the necessary infrastructure investments. Regulatory
intervention is one possible way of coordinating market participants to undertake the investments
necessary to support a shorter settlement cycle. Such intervention could come through
Commission rulemaking or through a coordinated set of SRO rule changes.
In addition to coordination problems, a second market friction related to the settlement
cycle involves situations where one market participant’s investments result in benefits for other
market participants. For example, if a market participant invests in a technology that reduces the
error rate in its trade matching, not only does it benefit from fewer errors, but its counterparties
and other market participants may also benefit from more robust trade matching. However,
because market participants do not necessarily take into account the benefits that may accrue to
other market participants (also known as “externalities”) when market participants choose the

90

level of investment in their systems, the level of investment in technologies that reduce errors
might be less than efficient for the entire market. More generally, underinvestment may result
because each participant only takes into account its own costs and benefits when choosing which
infrastructure improvements or investments to make, and does not take into account the costs and
benefits that may accrue to its counterparties, other market participants, or other financial
markets.
Moreover, because market participants that incur similar costs to enable a move to a
shorter settlement cycle may nevertheless experience different levels of economic benefits, there
is likely heterogeneity across market participants in the demand for a shorter settlement cycle.
This heterogeneity may exacerbate coordination problems and underinvestment. Market
participants that do not expect to receive direct benefits from settling transactions earlier may
lack incentives to invest in infrastructure to support a shorter settlement cycle and thus could
make it difficult for the market as a whole to realize the overall risk reduction that the
Commission preliminarily believes a shorter settlement cycle may bring.
For example, the level and nature of settlement risk exposures vary across different types
of market participants. A market participant’s characteristics and trading strategies can influence
the level of settlement risk it faces. For example, large market participants will generally be
exposed to more settlement risk than small market participants because they trade in larger
volume. However, large market participants also trade across a larger variety of assets and may
face less idiosyncratic risk in the event of counterparty default if the portfolio of trades that
would have to be remade is diversified. 222 As a corollary, a market participant who trades a

222

See Ananth Madhavan, Morris Mendelson & Junius W. Peake, Risky Business: The
Clearance and Settlement of Financial Transactions, (Wharton Sch. Rodney L. White Ctr. for
91

single security in a single direction against a given counterparty may face more idiosyncratic risk
in the event of counterparty failure than a market participant who trades in both directions with
that counterparty.
Further, the extent to which a market participant experiences any economic benefits that
may stem from a shortened standard settlement cycle likely depends on the market participant’s
relative bargaining power. While large intermediaries, such as clearing broker-dealers, may
experience direct benefits from a shorter settlement cycle as a result of being required to post less
collateral with a CCP, if they do not effectively compete for customers through fees and services
as a result of market power, they may pass only a portion of these cost savings through to their
customers. 223
In light of the above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), which would shorten the standard settlement cycle from T+3 to
T+2 may mitigate the market frictions of coordination and underinvestment described above.
The Commission preliminarily believes that by mitigating these market frictions, the transition to
a shorter standard settlement cycle will reduce the risks inherent in the clearance and settlement
process.
The shorter standard settlement cycle might also have an impact on the level of
operational risk that exists in the U.S. clearance and settlement system as a result of existing
clearance and settlement processes. By shortening the settlement cycle by one day, market
participants involved in a securities transaction will have one less day to resolve any errors that

(Princeton University Press rev. ed. 2009), at 15 (defining the idiosyncratic component of any
payoff as the part that is uncorrelated with the discount factor).

See infra Parts VI.C.1. and VI.C.2.

92

might occur in the clearance and settlement process. As a result, tighter operational timeframes
and linkages required under a shorter standard settlement cycle might introduce new fragility that
could impact financial market participants, specifically an increased risk that operational issues
could impact transaction processing and related securities settlement. 224
Market participants may incur initial costs for the investments necessary to comply with a
shorter standard settlement cycle. 225 However, these costs may differ across market participants
and these differences may exacerbate coordination problems. First, differences in operational
costs across clearing agency members may be driven by member transaction volume, and so the
extent to which many of the upgrades necessary for a T+2 standard settlement cycle are optimal
for a member to adopt unilaterally may depend on its transaction volume. For example, certain
upgrades necessary for a T+2 standard settlement cycle may result in economies of scale, where
large clearing members are able to comply with the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) at a
lower per transaction cost than smaller members. As a result, larger members might take a short
time to recover their initial costs for upgrades; smaller members with lower transaction volumes
might take longer to recover their initial cost outlays and might be more reluctant to make the
upgrades in the absence of the proposed amendment.
In addition, the Commission acknowledges that the upgrades necessary to implement a
shorter standard settlement cycle may produce indirect economic effects. We analyze some of
these indirect effects, such as the impact on competition and third-party service providers, in the

For example, the ability to compute an accurate net asset value (“NAV”) within the
settlement timeframe is a key component for settlement of ETF transactions. See, e.g.,

speed and efficiency of the settlement process, but which are unrelated to a shorter standard
settlement cycle, are not within the scope of the economic analysis of this release.
B.

Baseline

In order to perform its analysis of the likely economic effects of the proposed amendment
to Rule 15c6-1(a), as well as the proposed amendment’s effects on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation, the Commission uses as its baseline the clearance and settlement process as it
exists at the time of this proposal. In addition to the current process that is described in Part
II.A.3., the baseline includes rules adopted by the Commission, including rules governing the
clearance and settlement system, SRO rules, 227 as well as rules adopted by regulators in other
jurisdictions to regulate securities settlement in those jurisdictions. 228 The following section
discusses several additional elements of the baseline that are relevant for the economic analysis
of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) because they are related to the financial risks
faced by market participants that clear and settle transactions and the specific means by which
market participants manage these risks.
1.

Clearing Agencies

As discussed above, one way NSCC mitigates the credit, market, and liquidity risk it
assumes through its novation and guaranty of trades is via multilateral netting of the delivery and
payment obligations across clearing members. By offsetting these obligations, NSCC reduces

226

See BCG Study, supra note 107, at 8.

227

See supra note 179.

228

See supra Part II.B.

94

the aggregate market value of securities and cash it must deliver to clearing members after the
trade is novated and the trade guaranty attaches. While netting reduces NSCC’s settlement
obligations by an average of 97% on each day, it does not fully eliminate the risk posed by
unsettled trades because NSCC is still responsible for payments or deliveries on trades it cannot
fully net. NSCC reported clearing an average of approximately $872 billion each day during the
fourth quarter of 2015, 229 suggesting an average net settlement obligation of approximately $26.2
billion each day. 230 Based on these estimates, and given that, under current practices, NSCC’s
trade guaranty attaches at midnight on T+1, the average notional value of unsettled trades
approaches $52.3 billion. 231
The aggregate settlement risk faced by NSCC is also a function of the probability of
clearing member default. NSCC manages the risk of clearing member default by imposing
certain financial responsibility requirements on its members. For example, as of 2015, brokerdealer members of NSCC that are not municipal securities brokers and do not intend to clear and
settle transactions for other broker-dealers must have excess net capital over the minimum net
capital requirement imposed by the Commission in the amount of $500,000. 232 Further, each
NSCC member is subject to ongoing membership requirements, including a requirement to
furnish NSCC with assurances of the member’s financial responsibility and operational

Disclosure for Central Counterparties, at 14 (Mar. 2016), http://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-andcompliance.

capability, including, but not limited to, periodic reports of its financial and operational
condition. 233
In addition to managing the risk of member default, clearing agencies also take steps to
mitigate the risks generated by member default. For example, in the normal course of business,
CCPs are not exposed to market or liquidity risk because they expect to receive every security
from a seller they are obligated to deliver to a buyer and they expect to receive every payment
from a buyer that they are obligated to deliver to a seller. However, when a clearing member
defaults, the CCP can no longer expect the defaulting member to deliver securities or make
payments. CCPs mitigate this risk by requiring clearing members to make contributions of
financial resources to the CCP. The level of financial resources CCPs require clearing members
to post may be based on, among other things, the market and liquidity risk of a member’s
portfolio, the correlation between the assets in the member’s portfolio and the member’s own
default probability, and the liquidity of the collateral assets.
2.

Market Participants – Investors, Broker-Dealers, and Custodians

As discussed in Part II.A.3., broker-dealers serve both retail and institutional customers.
Aggregate statistics from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System suggest that at
the end of 2015, U.S. households held approximately 39% of the value of corporate equity
outstanding, and 50% of the value of mutual fund shares outstanding, which provide a general
picture of the share of holdings by retail investors. 234

233

See, e.g., id., Rule 15, Section 2.

Accounts of the United States, Flow of Funds, Balance Sheets, and Integrated Macroeconomic
Accounts, at tables L.223 and L.224 (First Quarter 2016),
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20151210/z1.pdf.

96

In the fourth quarter of 2015, approximately 4,100 broker-dealers filed FOCUS
Reports 235 with FINRA. These firms varied in size, with median assets of approximately
$700,000 and average assets of nearly $1 billion dollars. Approximately 30 broker-dealers held
80% of the assets of broker-dealers overall, indicating a high degree of concentration in the
industry. Of the 4,100 filers, 186 reported self-clearing public customer accounts, while 1,497
reported acting as an introducing broker and sending orders to another broker-dealer for clearing.
Broker-dealers that identified themselves as self-clearing broker-dealers, on average, had higher
total assets than broker-dealers that identified themselves as introducing broker-dealers. While
the decision to self-clear may be based on many factors, this evidence is consistent with the
argument that there may currently be high barriers to entry for providing clearing services as a
broker-dealer.
Clearing broker-dealers face liquidity risks as they are obligated to make payments to
clearing agencies on behalf of customers who purchase securities. As discussed in more detail
below, from the perspective of clearing broker-dealers, customers have an option to default on
their payment obligations, particularly when the price of a purchased security declines during the
settlement cycle. 236 Therefore, clearing broker-dealers take measures to reduce the risks posed
by their customers. For example, clearing broker-dealers may require customers to contribute
financial resources in the form of margin to margin accounts, to pre-fund purchases in cash
accounts, or may restrict the use of unsettled funds. These measures are in many ways analogous
to measures taken by clearing agencies to reduce and mitigate the risks posed by their clearing
235

FOCUS Reports, or “Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single” Reports, are
monthly, quarterly, and annual reports that broker-dealers generally are required to file with the
Commission and/or SROs pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17a-5, 17 CFR 240.17a-5.

members. In addition, clearing broker-dealers may also mitigate the risks posed by customers by
charging higher transaction fees that reflect the value of the customer’s option to default, thereby
causing customers to internalize the cost of the default options inherent in the settlement
process. 237 While not directly reducing the risk posed by customers to clearing members, these
higher transaction fees at least allocate to customers the direct expected costs of customer
default.
Another way the settlement cycle may affect transaction prices is related to the use of
funds during the settlement cycle. To the extent that buyers may use the cash to purchase
securities during the settlement cycle for other purposes, they may derive value from the length
of time it takes to settle a transaction. Testing this hypothesis, studies have found that sellers
demand compensation for the benefit that buyers receive from deferring payment during the
settlement cycle and that this compensation is incorporated in equity returns. 238
The settlement process also exposes investors to certain risks. The length of the
settlement cycle sets the minimum amount of time between when an investor places an order to
sell securities and when the customer can expect to have access to the proceeds of that sale.
Investors take this into account when they plan transactions to meet liquidity needs. For
example, under T+3 settlement, investors who experience liquidity shocks, such as unexpected
expenses that must be met within two days, could not rely on obtaining funding solely through a
237

sale of securities because the proceeds of the sale would be available in three days, at the earliest,
and not two. One possible strategy to deal with such a shock under T+3 settlement would be to
borrow cash on day two to meet payment obligations on day two and repay the loan on day three
with the proceeds from a sale of securities, incurring the cost of one day of interest on the shortterm loan. Another strategy that investors may use is to hold financial resources to insure
themselves from liquidity shocks.
3.

Investment Companies

As noted above, 239 shares issued by investment companies settle on different timeframes.
ETFs and certain closed-end funds generally settle on T+3. By contrast, mutual funds generally
settle on a T+1 basis, except for certain retail funds which settle on T+3. Mutual funds that settle
on a T+1 basis currently face liquidity risk as a result of a mismatch between the timing of
mutual fund transaction order settlements and the timing of fund portfolio security transaction
order settlements. Mutual funds may manage these particular liquidity needs by, among other
methods, using cash reserves, back-up lines of credit, or interfund lending facilities to provide
cash to cover the settlement mismatch. 240 As of the end of 2015, there were 9,156 open-end
funds (excluding money market funds, but including ETFs). 241 The assets of these funds were

approximately $14.95 trillion. 242 Within these figures, there were 1,521 ETFs with $2.1 trillion
in assets. 243
Under Section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act, an open-end fund is required to pay
shareholders who tender shares for redemption within seven days of their tender. 244 In addition
to this requirement, as a practical matter open-end funds that are sold through broker-dealers
meet redemptions within three days because broker-dealers are subject to Rule 15c6-1(a).
Furthermore, Rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act, 245 the “forward pricing” rule,
requires funds, their principal underwriters, and dealers to sell and redeem fund shares at a price
based on the current NAV next computed after receipt of an order to purchase or redeem fund
shares, even though cash proceeds from purchases may be invested or fund assets may be sold in
subsequent days in order to satisfy purchase requests or meet redemption obligations.

The Current Market for Clearance and Settlement Services

As described in Part II.A.2., two affiliated entities, NSCC and DTC, facilitate clearance
and settlement activities in U.S. securities markets in most instances. There is limited
competition in the provision of the services that these entities provide. NSCC is the CCP for
trades between broker-dealers involving equity securities, corporate and municipal debt, and
UITs for the U.S. market. DTC is the CSD that provides custody and book-entry transfer
services for the vast majority of securities transactions in the U.S. market involving equities,
corporate and municipal debt, money market instruments, ADRs, and ETFs. There is also
limited competition in the provision of Matching/ETC services – three entities that have obtained

exemptions from registration as a clearing agency from the Commission to operate as
Matching/ETC Providers. 246
Broker-dealers compete to provide services to retail and institutional customers. Based
on the large number of broker-dealers, there is likely a high degree of competition among brokerdealers. However, the markets that broker-dealers serve may be segmented along lines relevant
for the analysis of competitive impacts of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). As noted
above, the set of broker-dealers that indicate they clear public customer accounts by self-clearing
tends to be smaller than the set of broker-dealers that indicate they do so by introducing and not
self-clearing. This could mean that introducing broker-dealers compete more intensively for
customers than clearing broker-dealers. Further, clearing broker-dealers must meet requirements
set by NSCC and DTC, such as financial responsibility requirements and clearing fund
requirements. These requirements may represent barriers to entry for clearing broker-dealers,
limiting competition among these entities.
Competition for customers impacts how the costs associated with the clearance and
settlement process are allocated among market participants. In managing the expected costs of
risks from their customers and the costs of compliance with SRO and Commission rules, clearing
broker-dealers decide what fraction of these costs to pass through to their customers in the form
of fees and margin requirements, and what fraction of these costs to bear themselves. The level
of competition that a clearing broker-dealer faces for customers will dictate the extent to which it
is able to exercise market power in passing through these costs to their customers; a clearing
broker-dealer with little competition for customers is likely to pass on a majority of its costs to

246

See supra note 45.

101

its customers, while one with heavy competition is likely to choose to bear the cost internally to
avoid losing market share.
In addition, several factors impact the current levels of efficiency and capital formation in
this market. First, at a general level, market participants occupying various positions in the
clearance and settlement system must post or hold liquid financial resources, and the level of
these resources is a function of the length of the settlement cycle. For example, NSCC collects
clearing fund contributions from members to ensure that it has sufficient financial resources in
the event that one of its members defaults on its obligations to NSCC. As discussed above, the
length of the settlement cycle is one determinant of the size of NSCC’s exposure to clearing
members. As another example, mutual funds may manage liquidity needs by, among other
methods, using cash reserves, back-up lines of credit, or interfund lending facilities to provide
cash. These liquidity needs, in turn, are related to the mismatch between the timing of mutual
fund transaction order settlements and the timing of fund portfolio security transaction order
settlements.
Holding liquid assets solely for the purpose of mitigating counterparty risk or liquidity
needs that arise as part of the settlement process could represent an allocative inefficiency, as
discussed above, both because firms that are required to hold these assets might prefer to put
them to alternative uses and because these assets may be more efficiently allocated to other
market participants who value them for their fundamental risk and return characteristics rather
than for their collateral value. To the extent that intermediaries bear costs as a result of
inefficient allocation of collateral assets, these may be reflected in transaction costs.
The settlement cycle may also have more direct impacts on transaction costs. As noted
above, clearing broker-dealers may charge higher transaction fees to reflect the value of the

102

customer’s option to default and these fees may cause customers to internalize the cost of the
default options inherent in the settlement process. However, these fees also make transactions
costly and may, at the margin, influence the willingness of market participants to efficiently
share risks or to supply liquidity to securities markets. Taken together, inefficiencies in the
allocation of resources and risks across market participants may serve to impair capital
formation.
Finally, market participants may make processing errors in the clearance and settlement
process. 247 Industry participants have commented that a lack of automation and manual
processing have led to processing errors. Although some of these errors may be resolved within
the settlement cycle and not result in a failed trade, those that are not may result in failed trades,
which appear in the failure to deliver data above. 248 Further, market participants may
incorporate the likelihood that processing errors result in delays in payments or deliveries into
securities prices. 249 Although errors and the correction of errors are a part of current market
practices in a clearance and settlement system, the Commission does not have data available to
estimate the rate of processing errors and the time needed to correct these processing errors, but
invites commenters to provide relevant qualitative and quantitative information to inform our
analysis of these errors.

Analysis of Benefits, Costs, and Impact on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital
Formation
1.

Benefits

The proposed amendment is likely to yield benefits associated with the reduction of risk
in the settlement cycle. By shortening the settlement cycle, the proposed amendment would
reduce both the aggregate market value of all unsettled trades and the amount of time that CCPs
or the counterparties to a trade may be subject to market and credit risk from an unsettled
trade. 250 First, holding transaction volumes constant, the market value of transactions awaiting
settlement at any given point in time under a T+2 settlement cycle will be approximately one
third lower than under a T+3 settlement cycle. In addition, given that most trades are novated
and guaranteed by NSCC at midnight on T+1, unsettled trades are currently guaranteed for two
days. Shortening the settlement cycle by one day would reduce the time that unsettled
transactions are guaranteed by NSCC by approximately one half. Using the risk mitigation
framework described in Part VI.B.1., based on published statistics from the last quarter of
2015 251 and holding average dollar volumes constant, the aggregate notional value of unsettled
transactions at NSCC would fall from nearly $52.3 billion to approximately $26.2 billion. 252
Second, a market participant that experiences counterparty default and enters into a new
transaction under a T+3 settlement cycle is exposed to more market risk than would be the case
under a T+2 settlement cycle. As a result, market participants that are exposed to market, credit,
and liquidity risks would be exposed to less risk under a T+2 settlement cycle. This reduction in

252

See supra note 230. Calculated as $52.32 billion / 2 days = $26.16 billion.

104

risk may also extend to mutual fund transactions conducted with broker-dealers that currently
settle on a T+3 basis. 253 To the extent that these transactions currently give rise to counterparty
risk exposures between mutual funds and broker-dealers, these exposures may decrease as a
consequence of a shorter settlement cycle.
The Commission notes that industry participants have suggested further benefits of a T+2
standard settlement cycle relative to a T+3 standard settlement cycle as a result of reduced
procyclicality of counterparty exposures and clearing fund requirements, and presented an
analysis consistent with such benefits. 254 These benefits depend on the assumptions that underlie
models of counterparty exposures and clearing fund requirements.
A portion of the savings by intermediaries from less costly risk management under a T+2
standard settlement cycle relative to a T+3 standard settlement cycle may flow through to
investors. Intermediaries such as broker-dealers may mitigate settlement risks through collateral
requirements on their customers in the form of securities or cash. Such protection is likely to
require less collateral to manage settlement risks when settlement cycles are shorter. To the
extent that lower collateral needs result in lower collateral requirements, investors may be able to
profitably redeploy financial resources once used to satisfy collateral requirements by, for
example, converting them into less-liquid assets that offer higher returns in exchange for bearing
additional liquidity risk.
Industry participants might also individually benefit through reduced clearing fund
deposit requirements. In 2012, the BCG Study estimated that cost reductions related to reduced

253

See supra note 11 and Part VI.B.3, and infra Part VI.C.1.

254

See DTCC Recommends Shortening the U.S. Trade Settlement Cycle, supra note 76, at

2-3.

105

clearing fund contributions would amount to $25 million per year. 255 In addition, a shorter
settlement cycle might reduce liquidity risk by allowing investors to obtain the proceeds of their
securities transactions sooner. Reduced liquidity risk may be a benefit to individual investors,
but it may also reduce the volatility of securities markets by reducing liquidity demands in times
of adverse market conditions, potentially reducing the correlation between market prices and the
risk management practices of market participants. 256
In addition, the harmonization of settlement cycles may reduce the need for some market
participants engaging in cross-border and cross-asset transactions to hedge risks stemming from
mismatched settlement cycles, resulting in additional benefits. For example, under the current
T+3 settlement cycle, a market participant selling a security in U.S. equity markets to fund a
purchase of securities in European markets would face a one day lag between settlement in
Europe and settlement in the U.S. The participant could choose between bearing an additional
day of market risk in the European trading markets by delaying the purchase by a day, or funding
the purchase of European shares with short-term borrowing. Additionally, because the FX
market has a T+2 settlement cycle, 257 the participant would also be faced with a choice between
bearing an additional day of currency risk due to the need to purchase Euros as part of the
transaction, or to incur the cost related to hedging away this risk in the forward market.

Synchronization of settlement cycles across U.S. equity markets, currency markets, and
European equity markets and other markets would remove the need for market participants to
bear additional risk or incur costs related to borrowing or hedging risks.
The benefits of harmonized settlement cycles may also accrue to mutual funds. As
described above, 258 transactions in mutual fund shares typically settle on a T+1 basis even when
transactions in their portfolio securities settle on a T+3 basis. As a result, there is a two-day
mismatch between when these funds make payments to shareholders that redeem shares and
when they receive cash proceeds for portfolio securities they sell. This mismatch represents a
source of liquidity risk for mutual funds. Shortening the settlement cycle by one day will reduce
the length of this mismatch. As a result, mutual funds that settle on a T+1 basis may be able to
reduce the size of cash reserves or the size of back up credit facilities that some currently use to
manage liquidity risk from the mismatch in settlement cycles.
The Commission preliminarily believes that these benefits are unlikely to be substantially
mitigated by the exceptions to Rule 15c6-1(a) discussed in Part III.A.1. Market participants that
rely on Rule 15c6-1(b) in order to transact in limited partnership interests that are not listed on an
exchange or for which quotations are not disseminated through an automated quotation system of
a registered securities association are likely to continue to make use of that exception under the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). Similarly, market participants involved in offerings that
currently settle by the fourth business day under Rule 15c6-1(c) will likely continue to settle by
T+4. There may be transactions covered by Rules 15c6-1(b) and (c) that in the past did not make
use of these exceptions because they settled within three business days, but that may require use
of these exceptions under the proposed amendment because they require more than two days to
258

See supra note 9 and Part VI.B.3.

107

settle. However, these markets are opaque and the Commission does not have data on
transactions in these categories that currently settle within three days but that might make use of
this exception under the proposed amendment. In addition, market participants involved in
transactions which now voluntarily settle in two days or less may experience fewer risk reduction
benefits as a result of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) than market participants that
currently settle in the standard three business days.
Finally, the extent to which different types of market participants experience any benefits
that stem from the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) may depend on their market power.
As shown in the discussion and diagrams above, 259 the clearance and settlement system involves
a number of intermediaries that provide a range of services between the ultimate buyer and seller
of a security. Those market participants that have a greater ability to negotiate with customers or
service providers may be able to retain a larger portion of the operational cost savings from a
shorter settlement cycle than others, as they may be able to use their market power to avoid
passing along the cost savings to their clients.
2.

Costs

The Commission preliminarily believes that compliance with a T+2 standard settlement
cycle will involve initial fixed costs to update systems and processes. 260 While the Commission
does not have all of the data necessary to form its own estimates of the costs of updates to
systems and processes, the Commission has used inputs provided by industry studies discussed
in this release to quantify these costs to the extent possible in Part VI.C.5.

259

See supra Part II.A.3. for diagrams of retail and institutional trade settlement flow.

260

Industry estimates have suggested some updates to systems and processes might yield
operational cost savings after the initial update. See infra Part VI.C.5.a. for industry estimates of
the costs and benefits of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a).

108

The operational cost burdens associated with the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a)
for different market participants might vary depending on each participant’s degree of direct or
indirect inter-connectivity to the clearance and settlement process, regardless of size. 261 For
example, market participants that internally manage more of their own post-trade processes will
directly incur more of the upfront operational costs associated with the proposed amendment to
Rule 15c6-1(a), because they must directly undertake more of the upgrades and testing necessary
for a T+2 standard settlement cycle. As mentioned in Part II.A.2.c., other market participants
might outsource the clearance and settlement of their transactions to third-party providers of
back-office services. The exposures to the operational costs associated with shortening the
standard settlement cycle will be indirect to the extent that third-party service providers pass
through the costs of infrastructure upgrades to their customers. The degree to which customers
bear operational costs depends on their bargaining position relative to third-party providers.
Large customers with market power may be able to avoid internalizing these costs, while small
customers in a weaker negotiation position relative to service providers may bear the bulk of
these costs.
Further, changes to initial and ongoing operational costs may make some self-clearing
market participants alter their decision to continue internally managing the clearance and
settlement of their transactions. Entities that currently internally manage their clearance and
settlement activity may prefer to restructure their businesses to rely instead on third-party
providers of clearance and settlement services that may be able to amortize the initial fixed cost
of upgrade across a much larger volume of transaction activity.

261

See infra Part VI.C.5.b. for more detail of the specific operational cost burdens that each
type of market participant may incur.

109

The way that different market participants are likely to bear costs as a result of the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) may also vary based on their business structure. For
example, a shorter standard settlement cycle will require payment for securities that settle
regular-way by T+2 rather than T+3 (subject to the exceptions in the rule). Generally, regardless
of current funding arrangements between investors and broker-dealers, removing a day between
execution and settlement would mean that broker-dealers could choose between requiring
investors to fund the purchase of securities one day earlier while extending the same level of
credit they do under T+3 settlement, or providing an additional day of funding to investors. In
other words, broker-dealers could pass through some of the costs of a shorter standard settlement
cycle by imposing the same shorter cycle on investors, or they could pass these costs on to
investors by raising transactions fees to compensate for the additional day of funding the brokerdealer may choose to provide. The extent to which these costs get passed through to customers
may depend on, among other things, the market power of the broker-dealer. At most, the brokerdealer might pass through the entire initial investment cost to its customers, while if the brokerdealer faces perfect competition for its customers, the broker-dealer may not pass along any of
these costs to its customers. 262
However, broker-dealers that predominantly serve retail investors may experience the
burden of an earlier payment requirement differently from broker-dealers with more institutional
clients or large custodian banks because of the way retail investors fund their accounts. Retail
investors may find it difficult to accelerate payments associated with their transactions, which
may cause broker-dealers who are unwilling to extend additional credit to retail investors to

262

See supra Part VI.C.1. for more on the impact of broker-dealer market power. See infra
Part VI.C.5.b.3. for quantitative estimates of the costs to broker-dealers.

110

instead require that these investors pre-fund their transactions. 263 These broker-dealers may also
experience costs unrelated to funding choices. For instance, retail investors may require
additional or different services such as education regarding the impact of the shorter standard
settlement cycle.
At the same time, some market participants may face lower implementation costs as a
result of their current business structure and practices. As mentioned earlier, 2011 DTCC
affirmation data show that, on average, 45% of trades were affirmed on trade date, while 90%
were affirmed on T+1. 264 In addition, market participants that trade in markets that have already
implemented a T+2 settlement cycle may face lower costs in transitioning to a T+2 cycle in the
U.S, as many of the systems and process improvements may already have been adopted in order
to support settlement in other markets.
Finally, a shorter settlement cycle may result in higher costs associated with liquidating a
defaulting member’s position, as a shorter horizon may result in larger price impacts, particularly
for less liquid assets. For example, when a clearing member defaults, NSCC is obligated to
fulfill its trade guaranty with the defaulting member’s counterparty. One way it accomplishes
this is by liquidating assets from clearing fund contributions from clearing members. However,
the liquidation of assets in a short period of time may have an adverse impact on the price of an
asset. Shortening the standard settlement cycle from three days to two days would reduce the
amount of time that NSCC would have to liquidate its assets, which may exacerbate the price
impact of liquidation.

263

3.

Economic Implications through Other Commission Rules

In Part 0., the Commission noted that the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), by
shortening the standard settlement cycle, could have ancillary consequences for how market
participants comply with existing regulatory obligations that relate to the settlement timeframe.
The Commission also provided illustrative examples of specific Commission rules that include
such requirements or are otherwise are keyed-off of settlement date, including Regulation
SHO, 265 and certain provisions included in the Commission’s financial responsibility rules. 266
Financial markets and regulatory requirements have evolved significantly since the
Commission adopted Rule 15c6-1 in 1993. Market participants have responded to these
developments in diverse ways, including implementing a variety of systems and processes, some
of which may be unique to the market participant and its business, and some of which may be
integrated throughout the market participant’s operations. Because of the broad variety of ways
in which market participants currently satisfy regulatory obligations pursuant to Commission
rules, in most circumstances it is difficult to identify with precision those practices that market
participants will need to change in order to meet these other obligations. Under these
circumstances, and without additional information, the Commission is unable to provide an
estimate of these ancillary economic consequences. The Commission invites commenters to
provide quantitative and qualitative information about these potential economic consequences.
In certain cases, based on information about current market practices, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) is unlikely to change the
means by which market participants comply with existing regulatory requirements. For example,

265

17 CFR 242.200 et seq.

266

See supra Part III.B.3.

112

under the proposed amendment, broker-dealers will have a shorter timeframe to comply with the
customer confirmation requirements of Rule 10b-10. However, it is the Commission’s
understanding that broker-dealers typically send physical customer confirmations on the day
after trade date and many broker-dealers send electronic confirmations to customers on trade
date. The Commission preliminarily believes that because of the lack of ancillary consequences
in these cases, market participants are unlikely to bear additional costs to comply with these
requirements under a shorter standard settlement cycle.
In certain cases, however, the proposed amendment may incrementally increase the costs
associated with complying with other Commission rules where those rules potentially require
broker-dealers to engage in purchases of securities. Two examples of these types of rules are
Regulation SHO and the Commission’s financial responsibility rules. In most instances,
Regulation SHO governs the timeframe in which a “participant” of a registered clearing agency
must close out a fail to deliver position by purchasing or borrowing securities. Similarly, some
of the Commission’s financial responsibility rules relate to actions or notifications that reference
the settlement date of a transaction. For example, Rule 15c3-3(m) 267 uses settlement date to
prescribe the timeframe in which a broker-dealer must complete certain sell orders on behalf of
customers. As noted above, settlement date is also incorporated into paragraph (c)(9) of Rule
15c3-1, 268 which explains what it means to “promptly transmit” funds and “promptly deliver”
securities within the meaning of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(v) of Rule 15c3-1. As explained
above, the concepts of promptly transmitting funds and promptly delivering securities are

267

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(m).

268

17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(9).

113

incorporated in other provisions of the financial responsibility rules. 269 Under the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), the timeframes included in these rules will be one day closer to
the trade date.
The Commission preliminarily believes that shortening these timeframes will not
materially affect the costs that broker-dealers are likely to incur to meet their Regulation SHO
obligations and obligations under the Commission’s financial responsibility rules after the
settlement date. Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledges that a shorter settlement cycle
could affect the processes by which broker-dealers manage the likelihood of incurring these
obligations. For example, broker-dealers may currently have in place inventory management
systems that help them avoid failing to deliver securities by T+3. Broker-dealers may incur
incremental costs in order to update these systems to support a shorter settlement cycle.
In cases where market participants will need to adjust the way in which they comply with
other Commission rules, the magnitude of the costs associated with these adjustments is difficult
to quantify. As noted above, market participants employ a wide variety of strategies to meet
regulatory obligations. For example, broker-dealers may ensure that they have securities
available to meet their obligations by using inventory management systems or they may choose
instead to borrow securities. An estimate of costs is further complicated by the possibility that
market participants could change their compliance strategies as a result of shortening the
standard settlement cycle.
The Commission invites commenters to provide quantitative and qualitative information
about the impact of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) on the costs associated with

269

See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(v); 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(k)(1)(iii), (k)(2)(i),
(k)(2)(ii); 17 CFR 240.17a-5(e)(1)(A); 17 CFR 240.17a-13(a)(3).

114

compliance with other Commission rules.
4.

Effect on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

A shorter settlement cycle might improve the efficiency of the clearance and settlement
process through several channels. The Commission preliminarily believes that the primary effect
that a shorter settlement cycle would have on the efficiency of the settlement process would be a
reduction in the credit, market, and liquidity risks that broker-dealers, CCPs, and other market
participants are subject to during the standard settlement cycle. A shorter standard settlement
cycle will generally reduce the volume of unsettled transactions that could potentially pose
settlement risk to counterparties. By shortening the period between trade execution and
settlement, trades can be settled with less aggregate risk to counterparties or the CCP. A shorter
standard settlement cycle may also decrease liquidity risk by enabling market participants to
access the proceeds of their transactions sooner, which may reduce the cost market participants
incur to handle idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (i.e., liquidity shocks that are uncorrelated with the
market). That is, because the time interval between a purchase/sale of securities and payment is
reduced by one day, market participants with immediate payment obligations that they could
cover by selling securities would be required to obtain short-term funding for one less day. 270 As
a result of reduced cost associated with covering their liquidity needs, market participants may,
under particular circumstances, be able to shift assets that would otherwise be held as liquid
collateral towards more productive uses, improving allocative efficiency. 271
In addition, a shorter standard settlement cycle may increase price efficiency through its
effect on credit risk exposures between financial intermediaries and their customers. In

270

See supra Part VI.B.2.

271

See supra Part VI.A. for more on collateral and allocative efficiency.

115

particular, a prior study noted that certain intermediaries that transact on behalf of investors, such
as broker-dealers, may be exposed to the risk that their customers default on payment obligations
when the price of purchased securities declines during the settlement cycle. 272 As a result of the
option to default on payment obligations, customers’ payoffs from securities purchases resemble
European call options and, from a theoretical standpoint, can be valued as such. Notably, the
value of European call options are increasing in the time to maturity 273 suggesting that the value
of call options held by customers who purchase securities is increasing in the length of the
settlement cycle. In order to compensate itself for the call option that it writes, an intermediary
may include the cost of these call options as part of its transaction fee and this cost may become
a component of bid-ask spreads for securities transactions. By reducing the value of customers’
option to default by reducing the option’s time to maturity, a shorter standard settlement cycle
may reduce transaction costs in U.S. securities markets. In addition, to the extent that any
benefit buyers receive from deferring payment during the settlement cycle is incorporated in
securities returns, 274 the proposed amendment may reduce the extent to which these returns
deviate from returns consistent with changes to fundamentals.
As discussed in more detail above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) will likely require market participants to incur costs
related to infrastructure upgrades and will likely yield benefits to market participants, largely in
the form of reduced financial risks related to settlement. As a result, the Commission

272

See Madhavan et al., supra note 222.

273

All other things equal, an option with a longer time to maturity is more likely to be in the
money given that the variance of the underlying security’s price at the exercise date is higher.
274

See supra Part VI.B.2.

116

preliminarily believes that the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) could affect competition
in a number of different, and potentially offsetting, ways.
The prospective reduction in financial risks related to shortening the standard settlement
cycle may represent a reduction in barriers to entry for certain market participants. Reductions in
the financial resources required to cover an NSCC member’s clearing fund requirements that
result from a shorter standard settlement cycle could encourage financial firms that currently
clear transactions through NSCC clearing members to become clearing members themselves.
Their entry into the market could promote competition among clearing members at NSCC.
Furthermore, if a reduction in settlement risks results in lower transaction costs for the reasons
discussed above, market participants that were, on the margin, discouraged from supplying
liquidity to securities markets due to these costs could choose to enter the market for liquidity
suppliers, increasing competition.
At the same time, the Commission acknowledges that the process improvements required
to enable a shorter standard settlement cycle could adversely affect competition. Among
clearing members, where such process improvements might be necessary to comply with the
shorter standard settlement cycle required under the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), the
cost associated with compliance might create barriers to entry, because new firms will incur
higher fixed costs associated with a shorter standard settlement cycle if they wish to enter the
market. Clearing members might choose to comply by upgrading their systems and processes or
may choose instead to exit the market for clearing services. The exit of clearing members could
have negative consequences for competition between clearing members. Clearing activity tends

117

to be concentrated among larger broker-dealers. 275 Clearing member exit could result in further
concentration and additional market power for those clearing members that remain.
Alternatively, some current clearing members may choose to comply by ceasing to be
clearing members and instead outsourcing their operational needs to third-party service
providers. Use of third-party service providers may represent a reasonable response to the
operational costs associated with the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). To the extent that
third-party service providers are able to spread the fixed costs of compliance across a larger
volume of transactions than their clients, the Commission preliminarily believes that the use of
third-party service providers might impose a smaller compliance cost on clearing members,
including smaller broker-dealers, than if these firms directly bore the costs of compliance. The
Commission preliminarily believes that this impact may stretch beyond just clearing members.
The use of third-party service providers may mitigate the extent to which the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) raises barriers to entry for broker-dealers. Because these barriers
to entry may have adverse effects on competition between clearing members, we preliminarily
believe that the use of third-party service providers may mitigate the adverse effects of the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) on competition between broker-dealers.
Existing market power may also affect the distribution of competitive impacts stemming
from the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) across different types of market participants.
While, as noted above, reductions in settlement risk could promote competition among clearing
members and liquidity suppliers, these groups may benefit to differing degrees, depending on the
extent to which they are able to capture the benefits of a shortened standard settlement cycle.

275

See id.

118

For example, clearing brokers tend to be larger than other broker-dealers, 276 and may generally
be able to appropriate more of the savings from clearing fund deposit reductions for themselves
if they have market power relative to their customers by passing only a small portion of savings
through to their customers through fees or transactions costs. However, those that predominantly
serve retail investors may be in a better bargaining position relative to those that predominantly
serve institutional investors, and therefore may capture more of the benefits stemming from the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). Broker-dealers that serve retail investors may similarly
be able to use their market power relative to their customers to retain more of the clearing fund
deposit reduction as profits by maintaining their transaction costs and fees instead of passing
these through to their customers. Institutional investors may be in a relatively better bargaining
position by virtue of their large size and may be more likely to successfully negotiate lower fees
or transaction costs and share in the savings associated with lower clearing fund deposits.
Finally, a shorter standard settlement cycle might also improve the capital efficiency of
the clearance and settlement process, which would promote capital formation in U.S. securities
markets and in the financial system generally. 277 A shorter standard settlement cycle would
reduce the amount of time that collateral must be held for a given trade, thus freeing the
collateral to be used elsewhere earlier. For a given quantity of trading activity, collateral would
be committed to clearing fund deposits for a shorter amount of time. The greater collateral
efficiency promoted by a shorter settlement cycle might also indirectly promote capital formation
for market participants in the financial system in general, because the improved capital efficiency

276

277

See supra Part VI.A. and Part VI.C.4. for more discussion about capital formation and
efficiency.

119

of a shorter settlement cycle means that a given amount of collateral can support a larger amount
of economic activity.
5.

Quantification of Direct and Indirect Effects of a T+2 Settlement Cycle

As mentioned previously, several industry groups have released cost estimates for
compliance with a shorter standard settlement cycle, including the SIA, the ISC, and BCG.
However, only the BCG Study performed a cost-benefit analysis of a T+2 standard settlement
cycle. We first summarize the cost estimates in the BCG Study in the subsection immediately
below and then, in the following subsections, we provide our own evaluation of these estimates
as part of our discussion of the potential direct and indirect compliance costs related to the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). In addition, the Commission encourages commenters to
provide additional information to help quantify the economic effects that we are currently unable
to quantify due to data limitations.
a. Industry Estimates of Costs and Benefits
The BCG Study concluded that the transition to a T+2 settlement cycle would cost
approximately $550 million in incremental initial investments across industry constituent
groups, 278 which would result in annual operating savings of $170 million and $25 million in
annual return on reinvested capital from clearing fund reductions. 279
The BCG Study also estimated that the average level of required investments per firm
could range from $1 to 5 million, with large institutional broker-dealers incurring the largest
amount of investments on a per-firm basis, and buy side firms at the lower end of the
278

The BCG Study generally refers to “institutional broker-dealers,” “retail broker-dealers,”
“buy side” firms, and “custodian banks,” without defining these particular groups. The
Commission uses these terms when referring to estimates provided by the BCG Study but notes
that its own definitions of various affected parties may differ from those in the BCG Study.
279

See BCG Study, at 9-10.

120

spectrum. 280 The investment costs for “other” entities, including DTCC, Omgeo, service
bureaus, RIAs and non-self-clearing broker-dealers totaled $70 million for the entire group.
Within this $70 million, DTCC and Omgeo were estimated to have a compliance cost of $10
million each. The operational cost savings per entity ranged from $30-55 million per year, with
broker-dealers serving retail investors saving the largest absolute amount, and buy side firms
saving the least. Custodian banks were estimated to save approximately $40 million per year. 281
The BCG Study also estimated the annual clearing fund reductions resulting from
reductions in clearing firms’ clearing funds requirements to be $25 million per year. The study
estimated this by considering the reduction in clearing fund requirements and multiplied it by the
average Federal Funds target rate for the 10-year period up until 2008 (3.5%). The BCG Study
also estimated the value of the risk reduction in buy side exposure to the sell side. The implied
savings were estimated to be $200 million per year, but these values were not included in the
overall cost-benefit calculations.
Several factors limit the usefulness of the BCG Study’s estimates of potential costs and
benefits of the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). First, technological improvements, such
as the increased use of computers and automation in post-trade processes, that have been made
since 2012, when the report was first published, may have reduced the cost of the upgrades
necessary to comply with a shorter settlement cycle. While this may, in turn, reduce the costs
associated with the proposed amendment, it may also reduce the scope of investments required
by the proposed amendment, 282 as a larger portion of market participants may have already
280

Id. at 30-31.

281

See id. at 41.

282

See supra Part VI.A. While market participants may have already made investments
consistent with implementing a shorter settlement cycle, the fact that these investments have not
121

adopted many processes that would reduce the cost of a transition to a T+2 settlement cycle. In
addition, the BCG Study considered as a part of its cost estimates operational cost savings as a
result of improvements to operational efficiency, which the Commission preliminarily considers
an ancillary benefit of a shorter settlement cycle.
Lastly, the BCG Study was premised on survey responses by a subset of market
participants that may be affected by the rule – surveys were sent to 270 market participants and
70 responses were received, including 20 institutional broker-dealers, prime brokers and
correspondent clearers; 12 retail broker-dealers; 17 buy side firms; 14 registered investment
advisors (RIAs); and seven custodian banks. Given the low response rate, as well as the
uncertainty regarding the sample of market participants that was asked to complete the survey,
we cannot conclude that the cost estimates in the BCG Study are representative of the costs of all
market participants. 283
b.

Commission Estimates of Costs

The proposed amendment might generate direct and indirect costs for market participants,
who may need to change multiple systems and processes to comply with a T+2 standard
settlement cycle. As noted in Part II.A.5.c.(2), the T+2 Playbook included a timeline with
milestones and dependencies necessary for a transition to a T+2 settlement cycle, as well as
activities that market participants should consider in preparation for the transition. The
Commission preliminarily believes that the majority of activities for migration to a T+2
settlement cycle will stem from behavior modification of market participants and systems

resulted in a shorter settlement cycle is consistent with the existence of coordination problems
among market participants.
283

See BCG Study, supra note 103, at 15.

122

testing, and thus the majority of the costs of migration will be from labor. 284 These
modifications may include a compression of the settlement timeline, as well as an increase in the
fees that brokers may impose on their customers for trade failures. Although the T+2 Playbook
does not include any direct estimates of the compliance costs for a T+2 settlement cycle, we
utilize the timeline in the T+2 Playbook for specific actions necessary to migrate to a T+2
settlement cycle to directly estimate the inputs needed for migration, and form preliminary
compliance cost estimates in the next section.
In addition, the T+2 Playbook, the ISC White Paper, and the BCG Study identify several
categories of actions that market participants might need to take to comply with a T+2 settlement
cycle – processing, asset servicing, and documentation. 285 While the following cost estimates
for these remedial activities span industry-wide requirements for a migration to a T+2 settlement
cycle, we do not anticipate each market participant directly undertaking all of these activities for
several reasons. First, as noted in Part II.A.2.c., some market participants work with third-party
service providers for activities such as trade processing and asset servicing, and thus may only
indirectly bear the costs of the requirements. Second, certain costs might only fall on specific
categories of entities – for example, the costs of updating the CNS and ID Net system would
only directly fall on NSCC, DTC, and members/participants of those clearing agencies. Finally,
some market participants may already have the processes and systems in place to accommodate a
T+2 settlement cycle or would be able to adjust to a T+2 settlement cycle with minimal cost. For
example, some market participants may already have the systems and processes to reduce the

284

See id. at 15.

285

See T+2 Playbook, supra note 126, at 11.

123

amount of time needed for trade affirmation and matching. 286 These market participants may
thus bear a significantly lower cost to update their trade affirmation to comply with a T+2
standard settlement cycle. 287
In the following section, we examine several categories of market participants and
estimate the compliance costs for each category. Our estimate of the number and type of
personnel is based on the scope of activities necessary for the participant to migrate to a T+2
settlement cycle, the participant’s role within the clearance and settlement process, and the
amount of testing required to ensure an error-free migration. 288 Hourly salaries for personnel are
from SIFMA’s Management and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013. 289 Our
estimates use the timeline from the T+2 Playbook to determine the length of time personnel
would work on the activities necessary to support a T+2 settlement cycle. The timeline provides
an indirect method to estimate the inputs necessary to migrate to a T+2 settlement cycle, rather
than relying directly on survey response estimates. We acknowledge many entities are already
undertaking activities to support a migration to a T+2 settlement cycle in anticipation of the

287

The BCG Study, as it is based on survey responses from market participants, does reflect
the heterogeneity of compliance costs for market participants. However, for reasons mentioned
in Part VI.C.5.a., we are not able to fully accept the BCG Study’s cost estimates.
288

For example, FMUs that play a critical role in the clearance and settlement infrastructure
will require more testing associated with a T+2 settlement cycle than institutional investors.
289

To monetize the internal costs, the Commission staff used data from SIFMA publications,
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800 hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35
(professionals) or 2.93 (office) to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and
overhead. See SIFMA, Management and Professional Earnings in the Security Industry – 2013

proposed amendment. However, to the extent that the costs of these activities have already been
incurred, we consider these costs sunk, and do not include them in our analysis.
(1)

FMUs – CCPs and CSDs

CNS, NSCC/DTC’s ID Net service, and other systems will require adjustment to support
a T+2 standard settlement cycle. According to the T+2 Playbook and the ISC White Paper,
regulation-dependent planning, implementation, testing, and migration activities associated with
the transition to a T+2 settlement cycle could last up to five quarters. 290 We preliminarily
believe that these activities will impose a one-time compliance cost of $10.9 million 291 for DTC
and NSCC each. After this initial compliance cost, we preliminarily expect that both DTCC and
NSCC will incur minimal ongoing costs from the transition to a T+2 settlement cycle, because
we believe that the majority of costs will stem from pre-migration activities, such as
implementation, updates, and testing.
(2)

Matching/ETC Providers – Exempt Clearing Agencies

Matching/ETC Providers may need to adapt their trade processing systems to comply
with a T+2 settlement cycle. This may include actions such as updating reference data,
configuring trade match systems, and configuring trade affirmation systems to affirm trades by
12:00 p.m. on T+1. Matching/ETC Providers will also need to conduct testing and assess post-

290

See T+2 Playbook, supra note 126, at 11. To monetize the internal costs, Commission
staff used data from the SIFMA publications. Our time estimates account for the fact that a
portion of the timeline has already elapsed in anticipation of a transition to a T+2 standard
settlement cycle, and those costs are already sunk.
291

The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity, industry testing, and migration lasting five quarters. We
assume 10 operations specialists (at $129 per hour), 10 programmers (at $256 per hour), and 1
senior operations manager (at $345/hour), working 40 hours per week. (10 × $129 + 10 × $256 +
1 × $345) × 5 × 13 × 40 = $10,907,000.

125

migration activities. We preliminarily estimate that these activities will impose a one-time
compliance cost of up to $10.9 million 292 for each Matching/ ETC Provider. However, we
acknowledge that some ETC providers may have a higher cost burden than others based on the
volume of transactions that they process. We expect that ETC providers will incur minimal
ongoing costs after the initial transition to a T+2 settlement cycle because we preliminarily
believe that the majority of the costs of migration to a T+2 settlement cycle entail behavioral
changes of market participants and pre-migration testing.
(3)

Market Participants – Investors, Broker-Dealers, and
Custodians

The overall compliance costs that a market participant incurs will depend on the extent to
which it is directly involved in functions related to trade confirmation/affirmation, clearance and
settlement, asset servicing, and other activities. For example, retail investors may bear few (if
any) direct costs in a transition to a T+2 standard settlement cycle, because their respective
broker-dealer handles the back-office functions of each transaction. However, as is discussed
below, this does not imply that retail investors will not face indirect costs from the transition,
such as those passed through from broker-dealers or banks.
Institutional investors may need to configure systems and update reference data, which
may also include updates to trade funding and processing mechanisms, to operate in a T+2
environment. The Commission preliminarily estimates that this will require an initial

292

The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for trade systems, matching, affirmation, testing, and postmigration testing lasting five quarters. We assume 10 operations specialists (at $129 per hour),
10 programmers (at $256 per hour), and 1 senior operations manager (at $345/hour), working 40
hours per week. (10 × $129 + 10 × $256 + 1 × $345) × 5 × 13 × 40 = $10,907,000.

126

expenditure of $2.32 million per entity. 293 However, these costs may vary depending on the
extent to which a particular institutional investor has already automated their trade processes.
We preliminarily expect institutional investors will incur minimal ongoing direct compliance
costs after the initial transition to a T+2 standard settlement cycle.
Broker-dealers that serve institutional investors will not only need to configure their
trading systems and update reference data, but may also need to update trade
confirmation/affirmation systems, documentation, cashiering and asset servicing functions,
depending on the roles they assume with respect to their clients. We preliminarily estimate that,
on average, each of these broker-dealers will incur an initial compliance cost of $4.72 million. 294
We preliminarily expect that these broker-dealers will incur minimal ongoing direct compliance
costs after the initial transition to a T+2 standard settlement cycle.
Broker-dealers that serve retail investors may also need to spend significant resources to
educate their clients about the shorter settlement cycle. We preliminarily estimate that these
broker-dealers will incur an initial compliance cost of $8.6 million each. 295 However, unlike
293

The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for trade systems, reference data, and testing activity to last
four quarters. We assume 2 operations specialists (at $129 per hour), 2 programmers (at $256 per
hour), and 1 senior operations manager (at $345 per hour), working 40 hours per week. (2 × $129
+ 2 × $256 + 1 × $345) × 4 × 13 × 40 = $2,319,200.
294

The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for trade systems, reference data, documentation, asset
servicing, and testing to last four quarters. We assume 5 operations specialists (at $129 per
hour), 5 programmers (at $256 per hour), and 1 senior operations manager (at $345 per hour),
working 40 hours per week. (5 × $129 + 5 × $256 + 1 × $345) × 4 × 13 × 40 = $4,721,600.
295

The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for trade systems, reference data, documentation, asset
servicing, customer education and testing to last five quarters. We assume 5 operations
specialists (at $129 per hour), 5 programmers (at $256 per hour), 5 trainers (at $208 per hour)
and 1 senior operations manager (at $345 per hour), working 40 hours per week. (5 × $129 + 5 ×
$256 + 5 × $208 + 1 × $345) × 5 × 13 × 40 = $8,606,000.
127

previously mentioned market participants, we expect that broker-dealers that serve retail
investors may face significant one-time compliance costs after the initial transition to T+2.
Retail investors may require additional education and customer service, which may impose costs
on their broker-dealers. The Commission preliminarily believes that a reasonable upper bound
for the costs associated with this requirement is $30,000 per broker-dealer. 296 Assuming all
clearing and introducing broker-dealers must educate retail customers, the upper bound for the
costs of retail investor education would be approximately $50.5 million. 297
Custodian banks will need to update their asset servicing functions to comply with a
shorter settlement cycle. We preliminarily estimate that custodian banks will incur an initial
compliance cost of $1.16 million, 298 and expect them to incur minimal ongoing compliance costs
after the initial transition because we preliminarily believe most of the costs will stem from premigration updates and testing.
(4)

Indirect Costs

In estimating these implementation costs, we note that market participants who bear the
direct costs of the actions they undertake to comply with Rule 15c6-1 may pass these costs on to
their customers. For example, retail and institutional investors might not directly bear the cost of

296

This estimate is based on the assumption that a broker-dealer chooses to educate
customers using a 10-minute view that takes at most $3,000 per minute to produce.
See Crowdfunding, Exchange Act Release No. 76324 (Oct. 30, 2015), 80 FR 71388, 71529 &
n.1683 (Nov. 16, 2015).
297

Calculated as $30,000 per broker-dealer × (186 broker-dealers reporting as self-clearing
+ 1,497 broker-dealers reporting as introducing but not self-clearing) = $50,490,000.

298

The estimate is based on the T+2 Playbook timeline, which estimates regulationdependent implementation activity for asset servicing and testing to last two quarters. We
assume 2 operations specialists (at $129 per hour), 2 programmers (at $256 per hour), and 1
senior operations manager (at $345 per hour), working 40 hours per week. (2 × $129 + 2 × $256
+ 1 × $345) × 2 × 13 × 40 = $1,159,600.

128

all of the necessary upgrades for a T+2 settlement cycle, but might indirectly bear these costs as
their broker-dealers might increase their fees to amortize the costs of updates among their
customers. We are unable to quantify the overall magnitude of the indirect costs that retail and
institutional investors may bear, because it will depend on the market power of each brokerdealer, and its willingness to pass on the costs of migration to a T+2 standard settlement cycle to
their customers. However, we preliminarily believe that in situations where broker-dealers have
little or no competition, broker-dealers may at most pass on the entire cost of the initial
investment to their customers. As discussed above, this could be as high as $4.72 million for
broker-dealers that serve institutional investors, and $8.6 million for broker-dealers that serve
retail investors. However, in situations where broker-dealers face heavy competition for
customers, broker-dealers may bear the costs of the initial investment entirely, and avoid passing
on these costs to their customers.
As noted in Part VI.B.4., the ability of market participants to pass implementation costs
on to customers likely depends on their relative bargaining power. For example, CCPs, like
many other utilities, exhibit many of the characteristics of natural monopolies and, as a result,
may have market power, particularly relative to broker-dealers who submit trades for clearing.
This means that they may be able to share implementation costs they directly face related to
shortening the settlement cycle with broker-dealers through higher clearing fees. Conversely, if
institutional investors have market power relative to broker-dealers, broker-dealers may not be in
a position to impose indirect costs on them.
(5)

Industry-Wide Costs

To estimate the aggregate, industry-wide cost of a transition to a T+2 standard settlement
cycle, we take our per-entity estimates and multiply them by our estimate of the respective

129

number of entities. The Commission preliminarily estimates that there are 965 buy-side firms,
186 broker-dealers, and 53 custodian banks. 299 Additionally, as noted in Part II.A.2.b., there are
three Matching/ETC Providers, and 1,683 broker-dealers that will incur investor education costs.
One way to establish a total industry initial compliance cost estimate would be to multiply each
estimated per-entity cost by the respective number of entities and sum these values, which would
result in an estimate of $4.0 billion. 300 The Commission, however, preliminarily believes that
this estimate is likely to overstate the true initial cost of transition to a T+2 settlement cycle for a
number of reasons. First, our per-entity estimates do not account for the heterogeneity in market
participant size, which may have a significant impact on the costs that market participants face.
While the BCG Study included both estimates of the number of entities in different size
categories as well as estimates of costs that an entity in each size category is likely to incur, it did
not provide sufficient underlying information to allow the Commission to estimate the
relationship between participant size and compliance cost and thus we cannot produce
comparable estimates. The Commission seeks comment on the extent to which market
participants believe that the compliance costs for the proposed rule will scale with market
participant size.

299

The estimate for the number of buy-side firms is based on the Commission’s 13(f)
holdings information filers with over $1 billion in assets under management, as of December 31,
2015. The estimate for the number of broker-dealers is based on FINRA FOCUS Reports of
firms reporting as self-clearing. See supra note 235 and accompanying text. The estimate for the
number of custodian banks is based on the number of “settling banks” listed in DTC’s Member
Directories, available at http://www.dtcc.com/client-center/dtc-directories.
300

Calculated as 186 broker-dealers (self-clearing) × $8,606,000 + 1683 broker-dealers
(self-clearing and introducing) × $30,000 + 53 custodian banks × $1,159,000 + 965 buy-side
firms × $2,319,000 + 3 Matching/ETC Providers × $10,900,000 + 2 FMUs × $10,900,000 = $
4,005,034,800.

130

Second, the Commission’s estimate assumes that broker-dealers will not repurpose
existing systems that allow them to participate in foreign markets that require settlement by T+2.
For example, approximately 99 of the broker-dealers that reported self-clearing also reported that
they were affiliates or subsidiaries of foreign broker-dealers or banks. To the extent that a
broker-dealer has a foreign affiliate or parent that already has systems in place to support T+2
settlement in foreign markets, it may bear lower costs under the proposed amendment to Rule
15c6-1(a) than the estimate above. Removing all 99 of these broker-dealers from the
computation of total industry initial compliance cost estimate presented above results in a
reduction of this estimate to approximately $3.2 billion. 301 The Commission seeks comment on
the extent to which participants believe that the compliance costs for the proposed rule may be
less for those broker-dealers that can repurpose existing systems that they currently use for their
activities in foreign markets.
Third, investments by third-party service providers may mean that many of the estimated
compliance costs for market participants are duplicated. The BCG Study suggests that
“leverage” from service providers may yield a savings of $194 million, reducing aggregate costs
by approximately 29%. 302 Based on information gathered from the recent available financial
reports of service providers, the Commission preliminarily believes that a reasonable range of
estimates for the average cost reduction associated with service providers across all entities could

301

Calculated as 87 broker-dealers (self-clearing) × $8,606,000 + 1683 broker-dealers (selfclearing and introducing) × $30,000 + 53 custodian banks × $1,159,000 + 965 buy-side firms ×
$2,319,000 + 3 Matching/ETC Providers × $10,900,000 + 2 FMUs × $10,900,000 = $
3,153,040,800.
302

See BCG Study supra note 107, at 79.

131

be between 16% and 32%. 303 However, the Commission seeks further comment on the extent to
which the efficiencies generated by the investments of service providers might reduce the
compliance costs of market participants. Applying this range to the total industry initial
compliance cost estimate presented above yields a range of total industry initial compliance cost
estimates between $2.7 billion and $3.4 billion.
Taking into account potential cost reductions due to repurposing existing systems and
using service providers as described above, the Commission preliminarily believes that $2.1
billion to $4.2 billion represents a reasonable range for the total industry initial compliance
costs. 304
In addition to these initial costs, a transition to a shorter settlement cycle may also result
in certain ongoing industry-wide costs. Though we preliminarily believe that a move to a shorter
settlement cycle will generally bring with it a reduced reliance on manual processing, a shorter
settlement cycle may also exacerbate remaining operational risk. This is because a shorter
settlement cycle would provide market participants with less time to resolve errors. For
example, if there is an entry error in the trade match details sent by either counterparty for a
trade, both counterparties would have one extra day to resolve the error under the baseline than
303

Commission Staff hand collected information on operating margins for business
segments related to settlement services of three large service providers for fiscal years 2013,
2014, and 2015. The median estimate was 16.4%. To arrive at the lower bound of 16%, the
Commission assumes service providers capture all of the cost reduction they provide; to arrive at
the upper bound, the Commission assumes that service providers share half of the overall cost
reduction with their customers. Generally, the extent to which service providers share the
efficiencies they provide with their customers may depend on service providers’ bargaining
power. See, e.g., Binmore, Ken, Ariel Rubinstein, and Asher Wolinsky, The Nash Bargaining
Solution In Economic Modelling, The RAND Journal of Economics, 17, no. 2, Summer, 1986, at
176-188.
304

The lower bound of this range is calculated as ($4.0 billion – $0.9 billion cost reduction
related to broker-dealers with foreign parents or affiliates) x (1 – 0.32) = $2.1 billion.

132

in a T+2 environment. For these errors, a shorter settlement cycle may increase the probability
that the error ultimately results in a settlement fail. However, given the variety of operational
errors that are possible in the clearance and settlement process and the low probability of some of
these errors, we are unable to quantify the impact that a shorter settlement cycle may have on the
ongoing industry-wide costs stemming from a potential increase in operational risk.
Another industry-wide potential cost of shortening the settlement cycle is related to CCP
member default. A shorter settlement cycle may provide CCPs with a shorter horizon in which
to manage a defaulting member’s outstanding settlement obligations. Besides potentially
increasing the operational risks associated with default management, a shorter settlement cycle
may also have implications for CCPs that must liquidate a defaulting member’s securities and, if
circumstances require, the securities of non-defaulting members, in order to meet payment
obligations for unsettled trades. A shorter settlement cycle leaves a CCP with less time in which
to liquidate the securities and may increase the price impact associated with liquidation.
Current margin models at CCPs may account for the price impact associated with
liquidating collateral. Although a CCP’s margining algorithm may account for the additional
impact generated by a shorter liquidation horizon for the defaulting member’s clearing fund
deposits, margin requirements may not reflect the costs that a liquidation over a shorter horizon
may impose on other market participants. For example, a CCP may impose haircuts on collateral
to account for the costs of liquidating collateral in the event of a clearing member default,
causing clearing members to internalize a portion of the cost of liquidating illiquid assets. While
the haircut may mitigate the risk that the price impact associated with liquidation of collateral
assets over a shorter period of time causes the CCP to fail to meet its settlement obligations, the

133

reduction in the price of collateral assets may affect other market participants who may be
sensitive to the value of these assets.

Alternatives

Shift to a T+1 Standard Settlement Cycle

The Commission has considered the consequences of a shift to a T+1 standard settlement
cycle. 305 The Commission preliminarily believes that although a move to a T+1 standard
settlement cycle could have similar qualitative benefits of market, credit, and liquidity risk
reduction as a move to a T+2 standard settlement cycle, the types of necessary investments and
changes necessary to move to a T+1 standard settlement cycle also introduce greater costs for
market participants.
As stated earlier, a T+1 standard settlement cycle might result in a larger reduction in
certain settlement risks than would result from a T+2 standard settlement cycle because, as
explained above, the risks associated with counterparty default tend to increase with time. Price
volatility, as measured by the standard deviation of the price, is concave in time, which means
that as a period of time increases, volatility will increase, but at a decreasing rate. This suggests
that the reduction in price volatility from moving from T+2 settlement to T+1 settlement is larger
than the reduction in price volatility from moving from T+3 settlement to T+2 settlement.
Similarly, assuming constant trading volume, the volume of unsettled trades for a T+1 settlement
cycle would be reduced again by one-third, and, as a result, for any given adverse movement in
prices, the financial losses resulting from counterparty default will be two-thirds less than those
under a T+3 settlement cycle.

305

See supra Part III.A.4. for a discussion on the consideration of a settlement cycle shorter
than T+2.

134

At the same time, the Commission preliminarily believes that the initial costs of
complying with a T+1 settlement cycle will be greater than with a T+2 settlement cycle.
Successful transition to a settlement cycle that is shorter than T+2 could require significantly
larger investments by market participants to adopt new systems and processes. The upgrades
necessary for a T+1 settlement cycle might include changes such as a transformation of lending
and foreign buyer processes, real-time or near real-time trade processing capabilities, as well as a
further acceleration of the retail funding timeline, which would require larger structural changes
to the settlement process and more cross-industry coordination than the upgrades for a T+2
settlement cycle would. Because these upgrades could require more changes across multiple
markets and settlement systems, they may be more expensive to implement than the upgrades
necessary for T+2 settlement. Additionally, the lead time and level of coordination by market
participants required to implement such changes to transition to a T+1 standard settlement cycle
would be longer and greater than the time and coordination required to move to a T+2 standard
settlement cycle, which could delay the realization of the risk-reducing benefits of shortening the
settlement cycle and increase the risk that market participants would not be able to transition to
T+1 in a coordinated fashion.
Further, and as noted above, a move to a T+1 standard settlement cycle could introduce
additional financial risks and costs as a result of its impact on transactions in certain foreign
markets. Because settlement of spot FX transactions occurs on T+2, market participants who
transact in an environment with a shorter settlement cycle would be required to pre-fund
securities transactions in foreign currencies. Under these circumstances, a market participant
would either incur opportunity costs and currency risk associated with holding FX reserves or be
exposed to price volatility by delaying securities transactions by one day to coordinate settlement

135

of the securities and FX legs. In addition, shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 may make it
more difficult for market participants to timely settle cross-border transactions because the U.S.
settlement cycle would not be harmonized with non-U.S. markets that have already transitioned
to a T+2 settlement cycle. 306 The disparity between the settlement cycles would most likely
increase the costs associated with such cross-border transactions.
The BCG Study estimated that the transition to a T+1 settlement cycle would cost the
industry $1.77 billion in incremental investments (compared to $550 million for a T+2
settlement cycle), with an annual operational cost savings of $175 million per year and $35
million from clearing fund reductions (compared to $170 million and $25 million per year in a
T+2 settlement cycle, respectively). Risk reduction benefits were estimated to be $410 million
for a T+1 settlement cycle (compared to $200 million per year in a T+2 settlement cycle). 307
Although the Commission preliminarily believes that these numbers cannot be fully accepted as
cost estimates for the proposed amendment, 308 the magnitude of the difference between the BCG
Study’s T+2 and T+1 cost and benefit estimates likely indicate additional larger structural
changes necessary to transition to a T+1 settlement cycle.
In addition, the SIA T+1 Report estimated the initial investment costs of a shortened
standard settlement cycle of T+1 to be $8 billion, with net annual benefits of $2.7 billion per
year. The report estimated that broker-dealers would have an initial investment of $5.4 billion,
with net annual benefits of $2.1 billion per year; asset managers would have an initial investment
of $1.7 billion, with net annual benefits of $403 million per year; custodians would have an

initial investment of $600 million, with net annual benefits of $307 million per year; and
infrastructure service providers would have an initial investment of $237 million, with net annual
loss of $81 million per year. Although these estimates have higher costs and benefits than the
estimates in the BCG Study, the SIA estimates were made in 2000, and are much older than the
BCG Study estimates, which were made in 2012. In the sixteen years since the publication of
the SIA T+1 Report, significant technological and industry changes may have affected the costs
and benefits of a T+1 standard settlement cycle, which may limit the usefulness of the report’s
estimates for assessing the costs and benefits of a T+1 standard settlement cycle today. 309
2.

Straight-Through Processing Requirement

The Commission has also considered the consequences of mandating specific clearance
and settlement practices, such as straight-through processing, in lieu of the proposed rules. STP
involves the electronic entry of trade details during the settlement process, which avoids the
manual entry and re-entry of trade details. By avoiding the manual entry of trade details, STP
can speed up the settlement process as well as reduce error rates. However, the Commission
preliminarily believes that although many of the costs and benefits of a T+2 standard settlement
cycle could be achieved by mandating specific clearance and settlement practices, there are
several reasons why mandating a shorter settlement cycle may substantively differ from a
specific practice requirement.
First, the Commission preliminarily believes that many of the proposed rule’s benefits
stem directly from the fact that the length of the settlement cycle has been shortened, and not
from the particular practices used to comply with the proposed rule. As discussed above in
Part VI.C., the Commission preliminarily believes that shortening the settlement cycle is likely to
309

See SIA Business Case Report at 3.

137

reduce a number of risks associated with securities settlement, including credit and market risks
that stem from counterparty exposures. Moreover, the Commission preliminarily believes that
intermediaries that manage these types of risk as a result of their role in the clearance and
settlement system may share a portion of potential cost savings associated with reduced risks
with financial market participants. While the Commission acknowledges that an alternative
approach that primarily focuses on mandating STP may achieve some of the operational benefits
associated with a shortened settlement cycles, such an approach may not reduce counterparty
exposures and attendant risks.
Furthermore, the Commission recognizes that STP may be a natural enabler for a shorter
settlement cycle, but it may not be the most efficient enabler. The Commission preliminarily
believes that market participants may have a variety of methods to comply with the proposed
rule, and may prefer the least costly method of shortening the settlement cycle. By allowing
market participants to choose how to comply with a shorter settlement cycle, rather than
mandating a specific practice, the proposed rules may allow the market to realize the benefits of
a shorter settlement cycle at the lowest cost to market participants.
Additionally, mandating specific clearance and settlement practices instead of mandating
a shortened settlement cycle may have adverse effects on competition in the market for backoffice services. Back-office service providers may have a variety of methods to help their clients
comply with a shorter settlement cycle, and mandating specific clearance and settlement
practices may adversely affect the number of providers that market participants might use, and a
reduction in competition among back-office service providers that can comply with required
practices may result in higher compliance costs for market participants.

Request for Comment

The Commission seeks comment on the potential economic impact of the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a). In addition, the Commission seeks comment on related issues
that may inform the Commission’s views regarding the economic impact of the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a), as well as alternatives to the proposed amendment. The
Commission in particular seeks comment on the following:
1. The Commission invites commenters to provide additional data on the time it takes to
complete each step within the current clearance and settlement process. What are current
constraints or impediments for each step within the clearance and settlement process that
would limit the ability to shorten the settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2? Are there similar or
additional limitations for shortening the settlement cycle beyond T+2? Do these constraints
or impediments vary by market participant type?
2. The Commission invites commenters to provide additional data on the current timing of trade
matching. What portion of trades is affirmed on trade date? What portion of trades is
currently matched such that they could already be settled on a T+2 settlement cycle? How
does the timing of trade matching vary by the type of market participant?
3. The Commission invites commenters to discuss the costs and benefits of the industry changes
(e.g., technology changes and business practices) necessary to comply with a T+2 standard
settlement cycle related to trade matching. What are the costs of implementing such
changes? What cost-savings would these changes yield? What operational risks might these
changes create?
4. The Commission invites commenters to provide additional data on the expected collateral
efficiency gains from a T+2 standard settlement cycle. How would clearing fund deposits
change as a result of the proposed amendment? To what extent does this change fully
139

represent the change to the level of risk associated with the settlement cycle for securities
transactions?
5. The Commission invites commenters to discuss the impact of a T+2 settlement cycle on
broker-dealers and their customers. What types of adaptations will be necessary to comply
with a T+2 settlement cycle, and what are their relative costs and benefits?
6. The Commission invites commenters to discuss the potential impact of a T+2 standard
settlement cycle with respect to cross-border and cross-asset class transactions. What are the
costs and benefits of harmonizing with certain markets’ settlement cycles? Would a T+2
standard settlement cycle make any cross-border or cross-asset transactions more or less
difficult?
7. The Commission invites commenters to discuss the anticipated market changes, if any, if the
proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) were not adopted. Which activities necessary for
compliance with a T+2 standard settlement cycle would occur in the absence of the proposed
rule amendment? Which market participants, if any, would move to a T+2 settlement cycle
in the absence of the proposed rule amendment?
8. The Commission seeks comment on the alternative of shifting to a T+1 standard settlement
cycle. Would such an alternative be appropriate and preferable to a T+2 standard settlement
cycle? Why or why not? What are the costs and benefits of such an alternative relative to
the baseline and the proposal?
9. The Commission seeks comment on the alternative of mandating specific clearance and
settlement practices, such as STP. Would such an alternative be appropriate and preferable
to a T+2 standard settlement cycle? Why or why not? What are the costs and benefits of
such an alternative relative to the baseline and the proposal?

140

10. The Commission seeks comment on several topics related to the response of market
participants to the shift to a T+2 settlement cycle in certain foreign markets. The
Commission seeks comment on the following:
•

Commenters are invited to discuss the impact that the shift to a T+2 settlement cycle
in certain foreign markets (e.g., E.U. markets) has had on their clearance and
settlement operations. Are there any responses to changes in the settlement cycle of
these markets that may alter the costs or benefits of adopting a T+2 standard
settlement cycle in the U.S.?

•

Commenters are invited to discuss their preparations for upcoming migrations to a
T+2 settlement cycle in foreign markets. Do these preparations alter the costs and
benefits of adapting to a T+2 standard settlement cycle in the U.S.?

•

Has the experience of migrating to a T+2 settlement cycle in certain foreign markets
allowed commenters to make any other observations relevant to the proposal to adopt
a T+2 standard settlement cycle in the United States?

VII.

Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
Under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 310 a rule is

“major” if it has resulted, or is likely to result in:

310

•

An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;

•

A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or

•

Significant adverse effects on competition, investment, or innovation.

Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

141

The Commission requests comment on whether the proposed amendment to Rule 15c61(a) would be a “major” rule for purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
Fairness Act. In addition, the Commission solicits comment and empirical data on:
•

The potential effect on the U.S. economy on annual basis;

•

Any potential increase in costs or prices for consumer or individual industries; and

•

Any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation.

VIII. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) requires the Commission, in promulgating rules,
to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. 311 Section 603(a) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 312 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to prepare and
make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules
to determine the impact of such rulemaking on “small entities.” 313 Section 605(b) of the RFA
states that this requirement shall not apply to any proposed rule which, if adopted, would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 314
The Commission has prepared the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis in
accordance with Section 603(a) of the RFA in relation to the proposed amendment to Exchange
Act Rule 15c6-1(a).

311

See 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

312

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

313

Section 601(b) of the RFA permits agencies to formulate their own definitions of “small
entities.” See 5 U.S.C. 601(b). The Commission has adopted certain definitions for the terms
“small business” and “small organization” for the purposes of rulemaking in accordance with the
RFA. These definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10, 17
CFR 240.0-10.
314

See 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

142

A.

Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action

The Commission is proposing to amend Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1(a) to shorten the
standard settlement cycle for securities transactions (other than those excluded by the rule) from
T+3 to T+2. The Commission believes that proposing the amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) to
shorten the standard settlement cycle from three days to two days could potentially offer market
participants significant benefits through the reduction of exposure to credit, market, and liquidity
risk, as well as related reductions to systemic risk.
B.

Legal Basis

The Commission is proposing an amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) under the authority set
forth in the Exchange Act, particularly under Sections 15(c)(6), 315 17A, 316 and 23(a) 317 of the
Exchange Act.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Rule and Rule Amendment

Paragraph (c) of Exchange Act Rule 0-10 provides that, for purposes of Commission
rulemaking in accordance with the provisions of the RFA, when used with reference to a broker or
dealer, the Commission has defined the term “small entity” to mean a broker or dealer: (1) with total

capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior
fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d)
under the Exchange Act, 318 or if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total
capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last business day of
the preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and (2) is not
315

15 U.S.C. 78o(c)(6).

316

15 U.S.C. 78q-1.

317

15 U.S.C. 78w(a).

318

17 CFR 240.17a-5(c).

143

affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small
organization. 319
The proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would prohibit broker-dealers, including
those that are small entities, from effecting or entering into a contract for the purchase or sale of
a security (other than an exempted security, government security, municipal security,
commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, or commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds
and delivery of securities no later than the second business day after the date of the contract
unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction. Currently,
based on FOCUS Report 320 data, as of December 31, 2015, we estimate that there are 1,235
broker-dealers that may be considered small entities.
D.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements

The proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) would not impose any new reporting or
recordkeeping requirements on broker-dealers that are small entities. However, the proposed
amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) may impact certain broker-dealers, including those that are small
entities, to the extent that broker-dealers may need to make changes to their business operations
and incur certain costs in order to operate in a T+2 environment.
For example, conversion to a T+2 standard settlement cycle may require broker-dealers,
including those that are small entities, to make changes to their business practices, as well as to
their computer systems, and/or to deploy new technology solutions. Implementation of these
changes may require broker-dealers to incur new or increased costs, which may vary based on
the business model of individual broker-dealers as well as other factors.

319

17 CFR 240.0-10(d).

320

See supra note 235.

144

Additionally, conversion to a T+2 standard settlement cycle may also result in an increase
in costs to certain broker-dealers who finance the purchase of customer securities until the
broker-dealer receives payment from its customers. To pay for securities purchases, many
customers liquidate other securities or money fund balances held for them by their broker-dealers
in consolidated accounts such as cash management accounts. However, some broker-dealers
may elect to finance the purchase of customer securities until the broker-dealer receives payment
from its customers for those customers that do not choose to liquidate other securities or have a
sufficient money fund balance prior to trade execution to pay for securities purchases. Brokerdealers that elect to finance the purchase of customer securities may incur an increase in costs in
a T+2 environment resulting from settlement occurring one day earlier unless the broker-dealer
can expedite customer payments.
E.

Duplicative, Overlapping or Conflicting Federal Rules

The Commission believes that there are no federal rules that duplicate, overlap or conflict
with the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a).
F.

Significant Alternatives

The RFA requires that the Commission include in its regulatory flexibility analysis a
description of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which would accomplish the
stated objectives of applicable statutes and which would minimize any significant economic
impact of the proposed rule on small entities. 321 Pursuant to Section 3(a) of the RFA, the
Commission’s initial regulatory flexibility analysis must consider certain types of alternatives,
including: (a) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables
that take into account the resources available to small entities; (b) the clarification, consolidation,
321

5 U.S.C. 603(c).

145

or simplification of the compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for small entities;
(c) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (d) an exemption from coverage of
the rule, or any part of thereof, for such small entities. 322
The Commission considered alternatives to the proposed rule amendment that would
accomplish the stated objectives of the amendment without disproportionately burdening brokerdealers that are small entities, including: differing compliance requirements or timetables;
clarifying, consolidating or simplifying the compliance requirements; using performance rather
than design standards; or providing an exemption for certain or all broker-dealers that are small
entities. The purpose of Rule 15c6-1(a) is to establish a standard settlement cycle for brokerdealer transactions. Alternatives, such as different compliance requirements or timetables, or
exemptions, for Rule 15c6-1(a), or any part thereof, for small entities would undermine the
purpose of establishing a standard settlement cycle. For example, allowing small entities to
settle at a time later than T+2 could create a two-tiered market that could work to the detriment
of small entities whose order flow would not coincide with that of other firms operating on a T+2
settlement cycle. Additionally, the Commission believes that establishing a single timetable (i.e.,
compliance date) for all broker-dealers, including small entities, to comply with the amendment
is necessary to ensure that the transition to a T+2 standard settlement cycle takes place in an
orderly manner that minimizes undue disruptions in the securities markets. With respect to using
performance rather than design standards, the Commission used performance standards to the
extent appropriate under the statute. For example, broker-dealers have the flexibility to settle
transactions under a standard settlement cycle shorter than T+2. In addition, under the proposed
rule amendment, broker-dealers have the flexibility to tailor their systems and processes, and
322

Id.

146

generally to choose how, to comply with the rule.
G.

Request for Comment

The Commission encourages written comments on matters discussed in the initial RFA.
In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the number of small entities that would be
affected by the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) and whether the effect(s) on small
entities would be economically significant. Commenters are asked to describe the nature of any
effect(s) the proposed amendment to Rule 15c6-1(a) may have on small entities, and to provide
empirical data to support their views.
IX.

acceptances, or commercial bills) that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities
later than the second business day after the date of the contract unless otherwise expressly agreed
to by the parties at the time of the transaction.
