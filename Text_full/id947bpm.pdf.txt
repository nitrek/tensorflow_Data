In the Matter of
FOX ENERGY CORP.

INITIAL DECISION ON DEFAULT
February 1, 2016

APPEARANCES:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement, Securities and
Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on December 4, 2015, alleging
that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its periodic
filings. Respondent was served with the OIP by December 15, 2015, and its answer was due by
December 28, 2015. Fox Energy Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3414, 2015 SEC
LEXIS 5141 (Dec. 17, 2015).
A telephonic prehearing conference was held on December 29, 2015, and though
Respondent was sent a copy of the order setting the prehearing conference, only the Division of
Enforcement appeared. Fox Energy Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3455, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 2 (Jan. 4, 2016). I then ordered Respondent to show cause by January 15, 2016, why the
registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer,
appear at the scheduled prehearing conference, or otherwise defend this proceeding. Id. I
warned that if Respondent failed to respond to the order to show cause it would be deemed in
default, the proceeding determined against it, and the registration of its securities revoked. Id.
To date, Respondent has not filed an answer, responded to the order to show cause, or otherwise
defended the proceeding.
Findings of Fact
Respondent is in default for failing to file an answer, attend the prehearing conference, or
otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
Accordingly, as authorized by Rule 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following
allegations in the OIP to be true.

Fox Energy Corp., Central Index Key No. 1411166, is a void Delaware corporation
located in St. Joseph, Missouri, with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with
the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2008, which reported a net loss of $3,134 from the company’s January 11,
2008, inception through September 30, 2008.
In addition to its repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondent failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to it by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, or through its failure to maintain a
valid address on file with the Commission, did not receive such letters.
Conclusions of Law
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require issuers of securities
registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the
Commission current and accurate information in annual and quarterly reports, even if the
registration is voluntary under Exchange Act Section 12(g). Specifically, Exchange Act Rule
13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports and Exchange Act Rule 13a-13 requires domestic
issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those
requirements is mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s
Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22,
2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007).
By failing to timely file required periodic reports, Respondent violated Exchange Act Section
13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
Sanction
Exchange Act Section 12(j) authorizes the Commission “as it deems necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a class of securities or
suspend the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondent’s failure to file required periodic reports is serious because it violates a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondent’s violation is also recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic
2

reports for several years. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268,
2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No.
57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008). Respondent is culpable because it
knew, or should have known, of its obligation to file periodic reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§
249.308a, .310 (Commission Forms 10-Q, 10-K); China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No.
70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be
warranted even without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations); Robert L.
Burns, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3260, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2722, at *40 n.60
(Aug. 5, 2011) (stating that the Commission has “repeatedly held that ignorance of the securities
laws is not a defense to liability thereunder”). By not participating in this proceeding,
Respondent forfeited an opportunity to show it has made efforts to remedy its past violations and
to offer assurances against further violations.
On these facts, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke the
registration of each class of Respondent’s registered securities.
Order
I ORDER that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registration of each class of registered securities of Fox Energy Corp. is REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule of Practice 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, I FURTHER ORDER
that a party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twelve days after service
of the initial decision. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(b). A party may also file a motion to correct a
manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule of Practice 111. See
17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a
party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the order resolving
such motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The initial decision will not become final until
the Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality
unless a party files a petition for review or motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the
Commission determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision as to a party. If any of
these events occur, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party.
In addition, a respondent has the right to file a motion to set aside a default within a
reasonable time, stating the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specifying the nature of
the proposed defense. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). The Commission can set aside a default at any time
for good cause. Id.
