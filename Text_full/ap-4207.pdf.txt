In the Matter of
MIDDLEBURY SECURITIES, LLC

ORDER

GREGORY OSBORN

On October 31, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent Gregory Osborn. The OIP: found that Osborn had violated
and aided and abetted and caused the violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; imposed on
Osborn a cease-and-desist order, a permanent associational bar, a permanent investment company
bar, and a permanent penny stock bar; and ordered further proceedings to determine the amount of
disgorgement, civil penalties, and prejudgment interest, if any, to impose on Osborn. See OIP at 7-9.
On September 27, 2016, Osborn submitted to this office a “Penalty [R]eassessment
Request.” Among other relief, the request asks “the ALJ and the SEC” to “reduce the [b]arring to
‘time served’ or 3 years.” Because I lack the authority to grant the relief Osborn seeks, I construe his
request as one directed solely to the Commission. This office has forwarded a copy of the request to
the Office of the Secretary for filing.
SO ORDERED.
