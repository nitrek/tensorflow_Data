FOREWORD
This is the 20th Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to the Congress for the fiscal year July 1, 1953 to June 30,
1954. The report describes the Commission's activities during the
year in discharging its duties under the various statutes which it
administers, including the supervision of registration of securities for
sale to the public, the surveillance of the securities markets, the
regulation of the activities of brokers and dealers, the regulation of
registered public utility holding company systems and investment
companies and litigation in the courts.
The year was marked by the enactment by the Congress, by
unanimous vote, of the first substantial amendment to the laws
regulating the offering and sale of securities in many years. This
amendment was drafted following extensive conferences with representatives of the securities industry and members of Congressional
committees. The most important change accomplished was the
revision of the definitions of "offering" and "selling" to provide for
increased dissemination of information to prospective investors about
securities being offered, thereby furthering the concept of full disclosure. This legislation is described in detail in this report.
During the year the Commission engaged in an intensive program
of revising and simplifying its rules, forms and procedures for the
purpose of removing unnecessary complexities and duplications. The
Commission also reviewed and revised its administrative organization
and processes with a view to providing more aggressive and effective
enforcement of the securities laws for the greater protection of investors. One aspect of this program is an endeavor to obtain more
effective cooperation between the Commission and state securities
administrators. The details of the Commission's activities in these
respects are also included in this report.

AMENDMENT

OF SECURITIES LAWS AND REVISION
RULES AND FORMS

AMENDMENT OF SECURITIES

OF

LAWS

During the fiscal year Congress adopted by a unanimous vote a.
statute amending the securities acts administered by the Commission,
the first such amendment in many years.' It effected important
changes in the Securities Act of 1933 and limited changes, largely
technical, in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, and the Investment Company Act of 1940. After conferences during the fall of 1953 with representatives of the securities
industry and with the Chairmen of the Committees and subcommittees of the Senate and House of Representatives having jurisdiction,
the Commission prepared a draft bill. The original bill contained provisions dealing with eight problems, seven of which were enacted as
outlined below. The eighth, a proposal to increase the maximum exemption from registration pursuant to section 3(b) of the Securities
Act from $300,000 to $500,000, was not adopted. The changes made
are summarized below:
1. Dissemination

of information

during waiting period.-The

Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration with the Commission
of securities to be publicly offered. Prior to the amendment, the Act
prohibited the offering of a security for sale as well as the actual
consummation of a sale prior to the effective date of the registration
statement. Although it is a basic purpose of the Act that information
concerning securities to be offered to the public shall be given widespread distribution during the so-called waiting period between the
filing and effective dates of the registration statement, normally a
period of about twenty days, sellers of securities had been reluctant
to give full effect to this purpose because of uncertainty whether dissemination of information by means of the preliminary or so-called
"red herring" prospectus during this period might be construed as
illegal sales activity which would subject them to civil and criminal
liabilities and penalties.
To eliminate this deterrent to furnishing prospective investors with
information concerning securities to be offered, the amended act perIpublic Law 677, &'!d Congress, Chapter 667, 2d SeSSIOn(68 Stat. 683), approved August 10, 1954,
effective October 10, 1954.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMNI:ISSION

mits written offers during the waiting period by means of a prospectus
which meets the requirements of the Commission's rules. It thus removes the difficult distinction, inherent in previous practice, that it
was lawful and desirable for an underwriter or dealer to disseminate
information during the waiting period but illegal to offer to sell or to
solicit offers to buy. The Act as amended, however, continues to
make sales, contracts of sale, and contracts to sell unlawful before the
registration statement becomes effective.
2. Use of prospectuses after effective date of registration.The Securities Act requires persons selling securities to deliver prospectuses to purchasers in the initial distribution of a security, regardless of how long the distribution might take. Prior to its amendment
it also required the delivery of a prospectus by securities dealers in
trading transactions for one year after the commencement of an offering even though the initial distribution of the security had long been
completed. This one-year period for trading transactions, as distinguished from actual distribution, had been recognized as unrealistically
long. Accordingly, the Act was amended to reduce the one-year period to 40 days after the effective date of the registration statement
or after the commencement of the public offering, whichever date is
later. The statutory provision requiring a dealer to deliver a prospectus so long as he is disposing of an unsold allotment or otherwise
participating in an initial distribution remains unchanged. For certain types of investment companies which continuously offer securities, the amended Act requires the use of prospectuses in all transactions, so long as securities of the same class are currently being
offered or sold by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.
3. Simplification of information requirements for prospectuses
used more than 13 months.-Before
amendment, the Securities Act
required that prospectuses which are used more than 13 months after
the effective date of a registration statement should contain information as of a date within one year of its use. This produced a hardship
in many cases. As amended, the Act provides that where a prospectus is used more than 9 months after the effective date the information contained therein shall be as of a date within 16 months of
such use.
4. Extension of credit by dealers in new issues.-The
Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 prohibited the extension of credit by dealers to
purchasers of a new issue for six months after the offering period. It
was felt that the six-month period was unnecessarily long and that a
3D-day period, as provided by the amended Act, would be sufficient
to insure against the misuse of credit in distributions.
5. "When-issued" trading.-The
amendment removes an ambiguity in the Securities Exchange Act by eliminating the last sentence

TWENTIETH

ANNUAL REPORT

3

of section 12 (d) of that Act which placed seemingly unnecessary and
irrelevant limitations on the authority of the Commission to adopt
rules for the effective regulation of "when-issued" trading.
6. The offering of institutional
type of debt securities.-The
Trust Indenture Act of 1939 required inclusion of a summary of
certain specified indenture provisions in a prospectus used in the sale
of debt securities. This created problems in the formulation of
simpler forms of prospectuses for this type of security. The amendment makes clear that the summary need be included in the prospectus only to the extent required by the rules and regulations of the
Commission. It should therefore facilitate the simplication of prospectuses. As discussed below the Commission has adopted a simple
and short form for the registration of institutional type debt securities.
7. Simplified registration procedures for investment companies.In order to have a supply of registered shares on hand at all times,
investment companies which engage in continuous offerings of their
shares have heretofore been required to file new registration statements under the Securities Act periodically. The statutory amendment will permit such a company to increase the number of its
registered shares by amendment of its registration statement in lieu
of filing a new registration statement.
REVISION

OF RULES AND FORMS

The Commission constantly reviews its rules and forms with a view
to making such revisions and clarifications as are necessary and
appropriate to keep pace with changing practices and new developments. During the past fiscal year the Commission gave particular
attention to clarifying and simplifying many of the existing rules and
forms. A primary objective is to eliminate duplication and to
encourage concisenesswithout the sacrifice of any safeguards necessary
for the protection of investors.
Considerable progress was made by the Commission during the 1954
fiscal year in carrying out this program. At the present time it is
engaged in preparing further revisions, including those made necessary
by the recent amendments of the securities acts. Certain of the
changes made during the 1954 fiscal year are outlined below. Other
revisions of rules and forms which are of primary interest to special
groups, such as brokers and dealers and public utility holding companies, are described in the parts of this report dealing with the
regulation of the activities of such persons and companies.
Form S-5.-Form S-5 was revised to simplify registration under
the Securities Act of 1933 and result in more intelligible prospectuses
for open-end management investment companies."

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Form S-9.-Form S-9 has been adopted for the registration of nonconvertible fixed interest debt securities of American and Canadian
companies. It is available for use by an issuer which has been in
business at least 10 years, has a prescribed substantial earnings history,
and has filed annual and other periodic reports pursuant to section
13 or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The standards
prescribed in this new form were developed after a thorough analysis
of all debt issues registered with the Commission during the years
1951 to 1953, inclusive. By this process, informational requirements
have been limited essentially to five items, namely, financial statements of the issuer consisting principally of a balance sheet and a
five-year summary of earnings and surplus; a brief statement of the
principal business of the issuer and related matters; a description of
the use of proceeds of the financing; a description of the securities
being offered; and offering price information. The form does not
require the detailed information prescribed by the general registration forms for securities which do not meet the standards prescribed
for Form &-9. Because of the substantially shorter prospectuses
permissible with this form the Commission expects to be in a position
to consider favorably requests to reduce substantially the waiting
period between the filing date and the effective date of registration
statements for such security issues,"
Rule 173.-Provisions of various Acts administered by the Commission authorize it to institute injunctive actions and create certain
civil liabilities. Since rights arising because of violations of these
Acts may prove unenforceable against persons who are not residents
of the United States where it is impossible to obtain service upon them,
Rule 173 was adopted under the Securities Act to implement the
provisions of that Act, and to afford to the Commission and others
the same opportunity to enforce rights or obligations against such
persons as is available in the case of residents. Similar rules also
have been adopted under other acts, and appropriate forms to be
used for filing irrevocable consents to service have been adopted.'
Rule 415.-Rule 415, adopted under the Securities Act, simplifies
the registration procedure for securities offered at competitive bidding.
It provides that, under certain conditions, a post-effective amendment reflecting the results of the bidding becomes effective without
further order upon the filing thereof with the Commission or a regional
or branch office. Appropriate amendments to and rescission of such
other rules as were necessary in this connection were also adopted."

$300,000 in anyone year made by Canadian issuers or by domestic
issuers having their principal business operations in Canada. The
promulgation of this regulation followed the amendment of the extradition agreements between the United States and Canada. It is
a part of a comprehensive program designed to prevent fraud and
remedy certain abuses in the sale of Canadian securities in this country in violation of American law.
Its adoption was an experiment in international cooperation in
stamping out security frauds across the border. The Securities Commission of the Province of Ontario, after the close of the fiscal year,
indicated its dissatisfaction with the operation of the Regulation and
the Commission is presently studying whether it should be modified
or withdrawn. The Commission is also studying other aspects of
the problem of securities sales to United States citizens from the
Dominion of Canada. Regulation D is merely one phase of a much
larger over-all problem,"
"When-Issued"
Trading.-Regulation
X-12D-3 provided for the
registration for "when-issued" trading on national securities exchanges
of unissued short-term warrants and unissued securities other than
short-term warrants. Form I-J was required to be filed for the registration of warrants and Form 2-J for other unissued securities.
Regulation X-12D-3 had been obsolete for most purposes since the
Commission amended rule X-12A-4 in June 1950 to provide that an
unissued short-term contract as well as an issued short-term warrant
could be traded on an exchange as an exempted security and the only
cases in which Regulation X-12D-3 still served a substantial practical
purpose arose where the securities to be traded were the subject of a
voluntary subscription or exchange right granted to the holders of a
security traded on the exchange. During the fiscal year rule X-12A-5
was amended to cover these cases and generally to simplify the requirements. As amended, rule X-12A-5 is far less burdensome to
issuers and exchanges than the provisions of Regulation X-12D-3,
and nevertheless affords adequate protection to investors. Upon the
adoption of the amendments to rule X-12A-5 the Commission rescinded Regulation X-12D-3 including Forms 1-J and 2-J.
The Commission also rescinded rules X-12A-6, X-12A-7, X-12A-8,
and X-12A-9 providing exemptions from registration under the Securities Exchange Act. Situations to which rules X-126A-6 and rule
X-12A-8 related are covered by rule X-12A-5, as amended, and rules
X-12A-7 and X-12A-9, having been promulgated in the light of
particular circumstances, were no longer of general usefulness."

Regulation X-12D-l, registration was effective under the Securities Exchange Act only as to a

specified amount of a class of security, so that, if additional shares or
amounts of the same class were to be subsequently issued, a new application on Form 8-A was required to be filed for registration of such additional amounts. During the fiscal year the regulation was amended
to provide that the original application for registration is deemed
to cover the entire class of security, and the subsequent registration
of any additional unissued shares or amounts of the same class becomes
effective automatically when they are issued, without any further application, certification or order. The new procedure makes unnecessary a large majority of the applications previously filed on Form 8-A,
since most such applications have been filed to register additional
blocks of a class of security already registered. Consequently, applications on Form 8-A will be filed henceforth only in the event that a
new class of securities is to be registered. The Commission believes
that the time and expense to be saved by registrants, exchanges and
the Commission through the operation of this new procedure will be
considerable.
Revisions have also been made in Form 8-A which considerably
shorten the old form, principally by deleting certain requirements
made unnecessary in view of the new class registration technique."
Forms 8-K and lo-K.-These
forms, which are used by companies
having securities listed on stock exchanges or registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 for current reports and annual reports, respectively, were revised during the fiscal year. Form 8-K was revised to
eliminate certain items to limit the requirements with respect to exhibits and to clarify those concerning financial statements.
One of
the principal changes made in the revision of Form 10-K brings its
requirements into conformity with corresponding requirements of the
Commission's proxy rules. Thus, it is provided that, if a proxy statement has been filed under those rules, certain information furnished
in such statement need not be repeated in answer to corresponding
items of Form lO-K, and no refiling or incorporation by reference of
the proxy statement for this purpose is necessary. In addition,
financial statements contained in such proxy statements, or in annual
reports to security holders, may be incorporated by reference where
such financial statements substantially meet the requirements of Form
10-K.
Clarification also has been made of the provision which permits
companies filing reports with the Federal Power Commission to
substitute their reports to that Commission and thereby satisfy in
large part the requirements of this Commission's Form 10-K. A
new general instruction has been added to Form lo-K to make the
form available for use by railroads, motor carriers and communication
companies which formerly used Forms 12-K and 12A-K, providing

for the use of annual reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission
or the Federal Communications Commission, or annual reports to
stockholders, to satisfy substantially all requirements of this Commission's form. Accordingly, Forms 12-K and 12A-K were rescinded."
RuIe X-l2A-l.-This
rule provided an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act for the capital stock
of certain banking institutions traded on a national securities exchange.
During the fiscal year the rule was amended to extend the scope of the
exemption so that, when a national securities exchange merges into or
is absorbed by another exchange, the exemption which was available
for such securities on the merged or absorbed exchange will continue
in effect on the surviving exchange."
Rescission of Form 9-K and of Rules X-13A-13 and X-15D-13.In reviewing its activities, procedures and requirements to determine
the extent to which eliminations, revisions or modifications might be
made without a material adverse effect on the public interest, the
Commission invited all interested persons to submit their views and
comments in regard to a proposal to rescind Form 9-K, the form for
quarterly reports for gross sales and operating revenues, and Rules
X-13A-13 and 15D-13, the rules relating to the filing of such reports
under the Securities Exchange Act. After considering the comments
and data submitted, the Commission rescinded this form and its
related rules, although the Commission is continuing to keep under
study the adequacy of its annual and interim reporting requirements.'!
Proxy rules.-Rule X-14A-8 formerly provided for inclusion in an
issuer's proxy material of stockholder proposals which were proper
subjects for action by security holders, but did not specifically provide
that state law was the standard for determining what constituted
"a proper subject for action although the Commission's staff had so
interpreted the rule." The proxy rules as amended specifically
provide that a security holder's proposal may be omitted from the
management proxy material if it is one which, under the laws of the
issuer's domicile, is not a proper subject for action by security holders.
The rule places the burden of proof upon the management to show that
a particular security holder's proposal is not a proper one for inclusion
in management's proxy material. Thus, if management contends
that a proposal may be omitted because it is not proper under state
law, it will be incumbent upon management to refer to the applicable
statute or case law and furnish a supporting opinion cf counsel
satisfactory to the Commission.
Under paragraph X-14A-8 (c) (5) of the amended rule management
is specifically permitted to omit from its proxy material tl proposal

which is a recommendation or request with respect to the conduct of
the ordinary business operations of the issuer.
Prior to recent revisions of the proxy rules, a stockholder proposal
included in the management's proxy material had to be repeated in
subsequent proxy statements, upon request, provided it received 3%
of the total number of votes cast at the last annual or subsequent
special meeting. This resulted in repetitive submissions of proposals
which had received very modest stockholder interest. The proxy
rules now provide that a proposal may be omitted for a period of three
years from the last previous submission if the proposal was submitted
within the previous five years and received less than a 3% vote in
the case of a single submission, less than a 6% vote upon a second
submission, or less than a 10% vote upon a third or subsequent
submission during such 5-year period.
Rule X-14A-8 of the proxy rules formerly provided that any stockholder proposal submitted to an issuer with respect to an annual
meeting would, if submitted more than 30 days in advance of the
corresponding date on which proxy material was released for the last
annual meeting, be prima facie deemed to have been submitted within
a reasonable time. The rule has been amended to extend this period
from 30 days to 60 days, so as to give more time for the consideration
of security holders' proposals."
Rule X-16B-6.-This rule which grants a partial exemption from
section 16 (h) of the Securities Exchange Act with respect to profits
which might otherwise be deemed to have been realized and recoverable where there is a purchase by an officer, director or 10% stockholder of an equity security pursuant to the exercise of an option or
similar right and a subsequent sale of such security was amended to
clarify the conditions under which the exemption is available."
Form. N-8B-I.-Form
N-8B-I is the basic form for registration of
management investment companies under the Investment Company
Act. Recent revisions have been made based on the Commission's
experience with these companies and take into consideration the fact
that the form is now used chiefly by newly-organized companies and
consequently call for much less information than was previously
required. 14
Forms N-30A-I and N-30B-1.-These

,

OF THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to
investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale by use of the mails or other instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit or other fraudulent
practices in the sale of securities. Disclosure is obtained by requiring the issuer of such securities to file with the Commission a registration statement, and related prospectus, containing significant
information about the issuer and the offering. These documents are
available for public inspection as soon as they are filed. In addition
the prospectus must be furnished to the purchaser at or before delivery of the security. The contents of the registration statement
are the primary responsibility of the issuer and the underwriter; the
Commission has no authority to control the nature or quality of a
security to be offered for public sale or to approve or disapprove its
merits or the terms of its distribution.
DESCRIPTION OF mE

REGISTRATION PROCESS

Registration Statement and Prospectus

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may be
secured by filing with the Commission a registration statement on
the applicable form containing prescribed disclosures. The Commission has adopted several such forms designed to disclose appropriately for the type of issue involved the classes of information
specified in Schedule A of the Act. In general the registration statement must describe such items as the names of persons who participate
in the direction, management, or control of the issuer's business; their
security holdings, remuneration paid and options or bonus and profitsharing privileges allotted to them; the character and size of the business enterprise; its capital structure and past history and earnings;
its financial statements, certified by independent accountants; underwriters' commissions; pending or threatened legal proceedings; and
the purpose to which the proceeds of the offering are to be applied.
The prospectus constitutes a part of the registration statement and
presents in summary the more important of the required disclosures.
Although several different registration forms are currently available,
the majority of registrants use Form 8-1, the general form for busi9

ness companies. Next in deman.d is Form 8-5, designed for open-end
management investment companies. During the 1954 fiscal year
out of 649 registration statements filed, 432 or two-thirds were on
Form 8-1 while 123 or nearly one-fifth were on Form 8-5.
Examination Procedure

The commission is charged with the responsibility of preventing the
sale of securities to the public on the basis of statements which on their
face appear to contain inaccurate or incomplete information. The
staff of the Division of Corporation Finance examines each registration statement for compliance with the standards of disclosure
and usually notifies the registrant by an informal letter of comment
of any material respect in which the statement apparently fails to
conform to these requirements. The registrant is thus afforded
an opportunity to file an amendment before the statement becomes
effective. In addition, the Commission has power, after notice
and opportunity for hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement. No such orders were issued
during the 1954 fiscal year
Time Required to Complete Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission completes its analysis in the shortest
possible time consistent with the public interest. Congress provided
for a lapse of 20 days in the ordinary case between the filing date of a
registration statement and the time it may become effective. The
waiting period is designed to provide investors with an opportunity
to become familiar with the proposed security. Widespread publicity
is given to information disclosed in the registration statement immediately on its filing. The commission is empowered to accelerate
the effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period where the
facts justify such action. In exercising this power, the Commission is
required by statute to take into account the adequacy of the information already available to the public, the complexity of the particular
financing, and the public interest and protection of investors.
The median time which elapsed between the filing and the effective
date with respect to 629 registration statements that became effective
during the 1954fiscal year was 22 days, one less than the corresponding
figure in the preceding year. This time was divided among the three
principal stages of the registration process as follows: (a) from date of
filing registration statement to date of letter of comment, 10 days;

TWENTIETH

(b) from date of letter of comment to date of filing first material
amendment, 7 days; and (c) from date of filing first amendment to
date of filing final amendment and effective date of registration, 5 days.
VOLUME OF SECURITIES

REGISTERED

Securities effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933
during the fiscal year 1954 totalled $9.2 billion, the second highest
volume in the twenty-year period of the Commission's history. The
amount of registrations in each of the post-war years has exceeded
$5 billion and reached a high point of $9.5 billion in 1952. These
figures cover all registrations including new issues sold for cash by the
issuer, secondary distributions, and securities issued for other than
cash proceeds, such as exchange transactions and issues reserved for
conversion of other securities.
The most important category of registrations, new issues to be sold
for cash for account of the issuer, amounted to almost $7.5 billion in
the 1954 fiscal year as compared with an average of somewhat over
$6 billion for the last five fiscal years. In this five-year period, 51
percent of the dollar volume of new cash issues consisted of debt
securities, 40 percent common stock, and 9 percent preferred stock.
The relatively high proportion of common stock registrations in
recent years results in part from the large amount of securities registered by investment companies.
Figures for each of the fiscal years 1935 through 1954 appear
in appendix table 1, showing the number of statements, total amounts
registered, and a classification by type of security for new issues
to be sold for cash for account of the issuing company. More detailed
information on registrations for the 1954fiscal year is given in appendix
table 2.
Of the dollar amount of securities registered in the 1954 fiscal year,
80.5 percent was for account of issuers for cash sale, 17.9 percent for
account of issuers for other than cash sale and 1.7 percent was for the
account of others, as shown below. Most of the registrations involving issues not to be sold for cash cover securities reserved for conversion of other registered securities.

Electric and gas companies have accounted for the largest volume of
registrations not only in the 1954 fiscal year but for several years
past. Registrations of securities by companies in this field during the
last five years have averaged more than two billion dollars per year,
the large amount mainly reflecting two factors. First, the great
post-war expansion of public utilities plant facilities has been financed
to a considerable extent by funds raised in the capital markets, whereas
in other industries more reliance has been placed on internal sources
of funds, including retained earnings and depreciation accruals.
Second, as compared with other industries, more of their securities
have been offered publicly and registered under the 1933 Act, rather
than placed privately with institutional investors.
The next largest volume of issues in the 1954 fiscal year was registered by investment companies. Issues of these companies, which
have formed approximately one-fifth of total registrations of new cash
issues in recent years, are classified according to type of organization
for the fiscal years 1953 and 1954:

panies in this group have used internal sources of funds to a major
extent, and also have sold a large proportion of their securities
privately.
About 67 percent of the net proceeds of the corporate securities
registered for cash sale for account of issuers in the fiscal year 1954was
designated for new money purposes, including plant, equipment and
working capital. Almost 6 percent was for retirement of securities
and 27 percent for other purposes, principally the purchase of securities
by investment companies. This distribution follows fairly closely the
pattern of the last five years.

STATEMENTS

During the 1954 fiscal year 649 registration statements were filed
covering proposed offerings aggregating $8,983,752,628, compared
with 621 statements covering an aggregate of $7,399,059,928 in the
1953 fiscal year, an increase of approximately $1,585,000,000. The

DISCLOSURES

OBTAINED BY THE REGISTRATION

PROCESS

Disclosures secured by the staff's examination of registration statements during the 1954 fiscal year are illustrated by the following
examples.
Dealings with promotera.-e-A corporation which operated two dog
racing tracks proposed a public offering of debentures and common
stock by means of a prospectus which failed to disclose adequately
transactions with the promoters and certain facts bearing on the
risks involved. Before the registration statement was permitted to
become effective, a section was inserted at the beginning of the

14

SECURITIES

AND EXCHA..~GE COMMISSION

prospectus disclosing transactions pursuant to which the corporation acquired the tracks from the promoters. It showed, among
other things, that the promoters received from the corporation shortterm notes in the amount of $300,000 and debentures of the issue to
be registered in the amount of $300,000, together with rights to purchase at 1~ per share a total of 167,502 shares of common stock of
the corporation which was to be offered to the public at a price of
$1.00 per share; that the promoters and officerswere to receive annual
salaries aggregating $62,500 plus a bonus; and that for the corporation's latest fiscal year, its :first year in operation, four officers had
waived a portion of their salaries to the aggregate extent of $24,000
to enable the corporation to pay interest on its outstanding debentures. In addition it was pointed out that the book value of the
corporation's tangible assets for each $1,000 of debentures outstanding was $573.64; that the corporation's first year of operations resulted
in a deficit, and its liabilities exceeded its assets as of the date of its
most recent balance sheet; and that the value of the common stock
had been diluted by the sale of 209,956 shares of such stock at 1~
per share.
Effect of declining sales on earnings.-The
prospectus filed in
January 1954 with the registration statement of a company engaged
in a highly competitive line of manufacture contained somewhat
broad generalizations under "Recent Developments" indicating that
the volume of sales and level of earnings had fallen off. After the
staff elicited from representatives of the company details concerning
the extent and effect of this downward trend, the prospectus was
amended to include the specific statement that "Sales for the month
of December 1953 approximated 62% of average monthly sales for
the SL." months ended August 31, 1953, earnings for the quarter ended
November 30, 1953 approximated 52% of average quarterly earnings
for the six months ended August 31, 1953, and sales backlog at January 31, 1954 approximated 62% of such backlog at August 31, 1953."
Estimates of mineral reserves and profit margin.-The
prospectus accompanying a registration statement filed by a company proposing to erect a sulphur mining plant stated that only 25.8 acres of the
308 acres held by the company had been explored and was accompanied by an engineering report which estimated that the 25.8 acres
contained 1,027,283 long tons of recoverable sulphur. As to the
remaining acreage, the officers were said to "hope and believe" that
substantial deposits of sulphur underlay most of the tract. It was
added "With domestic prices at around $30.00 per ton and world
prices ranging from $75 upward, and it is hoped production costs will
be around $5.00 per ton, the Corporation believes it can make a good
showing profit-wise." After inquiries by the Commission's staff con-

TWENTIETH

ANNUAL REPORT

cerning, among other things, the justification for the engineer's
estimate of sulphur in the light of the procedures he employed, the
prospectus was amended to disclose that the accomplished drilling
indicated there were 115,000 tons of sulphur in the explored part of
the acreage; that at that stage the company could not say there was
more than 115,000 tons; and that the plant then under construction
could not be financially successful if no more than 115,000 tons of
sulphur were found. The amended prospectus omitted the estimate
of sulphur mining costs and included a statement that the sulphur
concentration was such as to make it likely that operating costs
would be high. It also disclosed that, whereas the 600,000 shares
to be offered for public sale were priced at $1.00 per share, a total
of 2,651,250 shares had been acquired by the promoters "at no substantial cost to themselves other than time and effort spent."
Reflection in financial statements of rate refund by utility
company.-In
1952, a regulatory agency issued an order permitting
a utility company registering securities under the Securities Act
to put into effect increased rates, but requiring it to refund any
portion of such increase ultimately found not justified by that agency.
In a further order issued in 1954, establishing rates to become effective
during 1954, that agency stated that it would appear that the refund
which would have to be made would be in the neighborhood of
$32,000,000, subject to reduction for adjustment of purchase contracts
and income taxes. These facts were disclosed in the registration
statement as orginally filed but the accompanying financial sta tements
reflected no provision for the net effect of the refund. As a result of
the staff's letter of comment and subsequent conference with representatives of the registrant, the financial statements were amended
to reduce the net income in excess of 20 per cent for the two years and
the interim period affected, being the amounts of the estimated net
refund, and to include the sum of these amounts as a liability in the
balance sheet.
Impact of seasonal business on earnings.-Effective and fair disclosure of results of operations for interim periods is often troublesome, particularly when a company's operations are subject to marked
seasonal variation. An aggravated instance of this situation was
found in the case of a registrant which has shown a very rapid expansion during the last five years.
The financial statements of this company as initially filed revealed
that the net profit for the first five months of the current fiscal year
amounted to approximately $1,500,000, and indicated that, owing to
the seasonal nature of the business, earnings for the first five months
of a fiscal year had historically been materially greater than for the
balance of the year. The extent of the past seasonal variation could

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

not be determined from the financial data furnished. Therefore, a
danger existed that the five months' earnings of $1,500,000 could be
misinterpreted as indicating an annual rate grossly in excess of the
amount which reasonably could be anticipated.
In order to avoid
this danger, the registrant was required to furnish the results of
operations for the same period of the previous fiscal year for comparison
with the :first five months of the current fiscal year. When the comparison was furnished, it was observed that the net profit for the:first
five months of the previous fiscal year was approximately equal to
the net profit for the entire fiscal year. The registrant was thereupon
requested also to add a statement in respect of the net profit reported
for the :first five months of the current fiscal year indicating that
substantially all earnings for the entire fiscal year had historically
been made during the :first five months.
EXEMPTION

FROM REGISTRATION

UNDER THE ACT

The Commission is authorized under Section 3 (b) of the Act to
adopt rules providing exemption from the registration requirements
for public offerings of securities not exceeding a maximum of $300,000.
Among the six types of exemption provided by the Commission under
this authority, the three most commonly used are: Regulation A, the
general exemption for issues up to $300,000 for issuers; Regulation B,
the exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights up
to $100,000 j and Regulation D, the exemption for Canadian securities
with the same dollar limitations as Regulation A.
Exemption from registration under Section 3 (b) of the Act does
not carry exemption from the civil liabilities for material misstatements or omissions imposed by Section 12 (2) or from the criminal
liabilities for fraud imposed by Section 17.
Exempt Offerings under Regulation A

New procedure.-Regulation
A was revised in March 1953 so as
to make it mandatory to use an offering circular containing specified
information which includes financial statements. In order to assure
uniformity in the standards required of offering circulars filed under
this new Regulation, the headquarters staff participated with the
regional officesin the processing of material filed pursuant to the Regulation. Beginning in the latter part of the fiscal year, the Commission
instituted a program of transferring to the regional offices responsibility for the examination and processing of Regulation A cases.
Denial or suspension of exemption.-While
Regulation A provides for the denial or suspension of the exemption in appropriate
cases, the Commission has exercised its power to issue orders thereunder sparingly because it believes it is preferable to resolve disclosure
problems in conferences with issuers and underwriters wherever pos-

Volume of filings.-During
the 1954 fiscal year 1,175 notifications
were filed under Regulation A covering proposed offerings of $187,153,226, compared with 1,528 notifications covering proposed offerings of $223,350,026, in the 1953 fiscal year. Included in the 1954
totals are 142 notifications covering stock offerings of $24,747,941
'with respect to companies engaged in the oil and gas business, and
172 filings covering offerings of $29,903,097 with respect to mining
companies. In addition, 2,382 items of sales literature, excluding
initial offering circulars, were filed.

Confidential reports of sales.-As an aid in determining whether
violations of law have occurred in the marketing of securities exempt
under Regulation B, the Commission obtains confidential reports of
actual sales made pursuant to such exemption. During the 1954
fiscal year, 1,699 such reports covering aggregate sales of $770,042
were filed.
Exempt

Offerings under

Regulation

D

By the adoption of Regulation D on March 6, 1953, as a companion to the revised Regulation A, the Commission provided for
the first time an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Act for' public offerings of securities, not exceeding $300,000 in
anyone year, made by Canadian issuers or by domestic issuers
having their principal business operations in Canada. To obtain
the exemption, an offeror must file 'with the Commission a notification, and in all cases an offering circular, containing pertinent information regarding the issuer and the security proposed to be sold in
the United States. This information must include finanical
statements .
.During the 1954 fiscal year 46 notifications were filed under Regulation D covering aggregate offerings of $11,334,350. They represented 42 issuers proposing to explore for uranium or other minerals,
three to engage in the oil and gas business, and one in lumbering.
After the close of the 1954fiscal year, the Commission on August 16,
19.54 issued its first order pursuant to Regulation D suspending
exemption with respect to a public offering.of securities of Northwest
Uranium Corporation. 1 The reasons assigned by the Commission
for the suspension included reasonable catise to believe that the use
of the company's offering circular would and did operate as a fraud
and deceit upon the purchasers of said securities,

Actions

Injunctions are sometimes sought to restrain continued violation of
the Securities Act when it appears that damage to the public is
threatened.
The cases during the fiscal year 1954 were of a varied nature. In
S. E. O. v. Ohemi-Oote Perlite Oorporation and Otto T. Ball.' the
'Commission's complaint charged that the defendants had sold per-sonally owned stock of the defendant Ball in Chemi-Cote Perlite
Corporation without registration, and that the defendants represented
that the corporation was in excellent financial condition with assets
in excess of $23,000,000 when, in fact, the company had a deficit of
$185,000 and assets not exceeding $100,000; that the company's
perlite mining claims were worth $4,500,000 when, in fact, there was
no reasonable basis for any such valuation; that the proceeds from
the sale of such securities being sold at $10 per share would be used
by Chemi-Cote Perlite Corporation for the purpose of financing its
operation when, in fact, in some instances one-half of the proceeds
from the sale of such stock was being paid to salesmen as commissions,
and the stock being offered was the personally owned stock of the
defendant Otto T. Ball. The defendants consented to a final judgment enjoining them from further violation of the registration and
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act.
S. E. O. v. Professional Life Insurance Oompany, J. Olifton Butler
Agencies and J. Olinton Butler 3 was an action to enjoin the defendants
from violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the
Securities Act. The complaint alleged that the defendants had purchased an office building for the defendant, Professional Life Insurance Company, for $465,000, and within a few days thereafter
arranged to have such building appraised at $650,000, an appreciation
of $185,000 over cost, and a short time thereafter issued a dividend
of stock of the company to J. Clinton Butler based upon the claimed
appreciation in value of the building. The shares received by the
defendant Butler as a stock dividend were later sold by him without
disclosing to purchasers that such shares were owned by him personally and that the proceeds would be retained by him and not
placed in the treasury of Professional Life Insurance Company. It
was also alleged that the defendants omitted to state to purchasers
that Professional Life Insurance Company was operating at a loss
and had no surplus or realized profits at the time the shares were
sold. A stipulation was entered into between the Commission and
the defendants whereby it was agreed that the defendants, J. Clinton

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Butler and J. Clinton Butler Agencies, a registered broker-dealer,
would consent to the entry of a permanent injunction and that J.
Clinton Butler would completely disassociate himself from the management and control of Professional Life Insurance Company. When
the Commission was satisfied that the terms of the stipulation had
been complied with, it moved for the dismissal of the action against
Professional Life Insurance Company. The injunction against J.
Clinton Butler and J. Clinton Butler Agencies continued in effect.
The broker-dealer registration of J. Clinton Butler Agencies was
withdrawn.
A judgment was entered in an action, S. E. O. v. Glen F. McBurney 4
in which the Commission's complaint filed in the previous year,
alleged that the defendant in the sale of units of interest in oil and
gas rights in a leasehold interest had violated the registration and the
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act. Although the defendant
filed an answer to the fraud count, he later consented to the entry of
judgment on both counts.
In S. E. O. v, Kaye, Real & 00., Inc., John A. Kaye and Stanwood
Oil Oorporation." the complaint alleged that defendant John A. Kaye
has been controlling stockholder of Kaye, Real & Co., Inc., a broker
and dealer in securities, and of Stanwood Oil Corporation, and that
the defendants had been selling stock of Stanwood Oil Corporation
without registration and had been employing a fraudulent scheme
involving acquisition of control of the management and operations of
Stanwood Oil Corporation by defendants John A. Kaye and Kaye,
Real & Co., Inc., to whom approximately 1,000,000 shares out of a
total of 1,472,519 shares outstanding had been issued; that the
defendants thereupon disseminated numerous false statements concerning the increased value of Stanwood stock by reason of the acquisition by said corporation of various other companies and business
enterprises,"
Other actions taken by the Commission during the fiscal year resulted in injunctions of violations of the registration provisions of the
Securities Act include: S. E. C. v. Dominaire Constructions, Inc. and
V. L. Arnold,7 involving an offering of securities to develop mortarless
interlocking concrete blocks; S. E. O. v. Lever Motors Corporation,S
involving an offering of securities for the development of a lever-type

Participation as Amicus Curiae

In Wilko v, Swan,10 in a decision reversing the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit," the Supreme Court sustained the position
urged by the Commission as amicus curiae that a customer cannot be
deprived by a securities firm of the court remedy afforded him by
Section 12 (2) of the Securities Act for alleged misrepresentations in
the sale of securities through a pre-transaction stipulation for arbitration of future disputes. In an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice
Reed, the Court held that the pre-transaction agreement contravened
the anti-waiver provisions of Section 14 of the Act, and conflicted
with the remedial purposes of the legislation.
The Commission also participated as amicus curiae in Bentsen v.
Blackwell, in which the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari 1Z
and subsequently dismissed the writ after the oral argument had "developed the undesirability of deciding the questions in this case on
the pleadings" .13 Petitioner had sought certiorari solely on the question whether the civil recovery provisions of Section 12 (2) of the
Securities Act require that the mails or instruments of interstate
commerce be used to transmit the particular misrepresentations complained of, or whether, as the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
had ruled 14 and as the Commission had urged, it sufficed that the
mails were used elsewhere in the sale transaction-in this case allegedly
to deliver the documents essential to the investment contracts sold.

AD:\I1NISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES
OF 1934

EXCHANGE ACT

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities transactions on the
organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets. Accordingly, the Act provides for the regulation of such transactions and of
matters related thereto. It requires that information as to the condition of corporations whose securities are listed on a national securities
exchange shall be made available to the public and provides for the
registration of such securities, such exchanges, brokers and dealers
in securities, and associations of brokers and dealers. It also regulates
the use of credit in securities trading. While the authority to issue
rules regarding such credit is lodged in the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, the administration of these rules and of the
other provisions of the Act is vested in the Commission.

Exchange was permitted to withdraw its registration as a national
securities exchange.
Information pertinent to the organization, rules of procedure,
trading practices, membership requirements and related matters of
each exchange is contained in its registration or exemption statement,
and any changes in such information are required to be reported
promptly by the exchanges. During the year, the exchanges reported
numerous changes, including the following:
The New York and American stock exchanges rescinded rules which
had placed limitations on purchases made by certain members on the
floors of these exchanges for accounts in which they had an interest.
The N ew York, American, Midwest, Los Angeles and San Francisco
stock exchanges rescinded rules, commonly referred to as the "Daylight Margin Rules", which had required exchange members to deposit at the close of each trading day an amount which would represent sufficient margin, under the terms of the Federal Reserve Board's
regulation T, for the maximum position taken by the member during
the trading day. The rescission of these rules had the effect of placing
exchange members in the same position as the general public with
respect to the initial margining of transactions and the withdrawal of
proceeds of sales.
The N ew York and American stock exchanges rescinded rules
which, with certain exceptions, had prohibited partners of member
firms or voting stockholders of member corporations from having
margin accounts (except at a bank) if their firm or corporation carried
margin accounts for customers, and which had prohibited member
firms and member corporations carrying margin accounts for customers
from making transactions in securities if the market value of securities
carried in proprietary accounts was equal to or greater than their net
capital.
The Boston Stock Exchange amended its rules relating to the registration: of corporations as member corporations of the exchange by
rescinding the provisions that prohibited member corporations from
carrying margin accounts and required member corporations to segregate customers' free-credit balances in special bank accounts with
restrictions on withdrawals from such accounts. This action was
designed to bring its rules pertaining to member corporations into
conformity with rules of various other exchanges.
The Pittsburgh Stock Exchange amended its rules to permit corporations engaged in the securities business to become members of the
exchange.
The Salt Lake Stock Exchange completed the revision of its rules
which, together with the new constitution it had adopted in the preceding year, were designed, among other things, to strengthen the financial

24

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

responsibility of its members and to improve inspection and audit
requirements.
The New York, American, Boston and San Francisco stock exchanges revised the minimum net capital requirements for members,
member firms and member corporations by providing, among other
things, that aggregate indebtedness may not exceed 2000% of net
capital. The previous limit had been 1500%.
The Midwest Stock Exchange changed the minimum net capital
requirement of member corporations from 10% to 6%% of aggregate
indebtedness, so that aggregate indebtedness may not exceed 1500%
of net capital as compared with the previous 1000% limit. The
Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange provided that aggregate indebtedness of member corporations may not exceed 2000% of net
capital as compared with the previous 1000% limit. These changes
established uniformity in capital requirements between corporate and
other members of these two exchanges.
The N ew York, Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles, Midwest, Philadelphia-Baltimore, Pittsburgh and San Francisco stock exchanges
adopted new schedules of increased commission rates. The new rates
are substantially identical on these exchanges. They contain an innovation which provides for a discount from the regular commission
where a purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of a single security
for one account is completed within 30 calendar days.
The Cincinnati Stock Exchange, effective May 3, 1954, adopted a
new schedule of increased commission rates applicable to stocks
traded solely on that exchange.
The Honolulu Stock Exchange adopted a revised Constitution and
Rules for the purpose of clarifying and strengthening the provisions
thereof. The revision included a new schedule of increased commission rates.
Disciplinary Action by Exchanges

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission any
action of a disciplinary nature taken by it against any of its members,
or against any partner or employee of a member, for violation of the
Securities Exchange Act or any rule thereunder or of any exchange
rule. During the year, 5 exchanges reported 40 cases of disciplinary
action against members, member firms and partners of member firms.
The actions reported included fines ranging from $100 to $5,000 in
17 cases, with total fines aggregating $9,807.50, expulsion of 1 individual and suspension of another from exchange membership, revo-

cation of the registration of 1 member as a specialist, and censure of
individuals and firms for infractions of exchange rules. The rules
violated included those pertaining to specialists, floor traders, short
sales, capital requirements and the filing of financial statements.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

Unless a security is registered under the Act (or is exempt therefrom), it is unlawful to effect any transaction in the security on any
national securities exchange. Pursuant to Section 12 an issuer may
register a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and the exchange an application which discloses pertinent
information concerning the issuer and its affairs. Each such issuer
is required by Section 13 to file periodic reports keeping that information current. These applications and reports furnish details about
the issuer's capital structure, the terms of its securities, information
about the persons who direct, manage, or control its affairs, remuneration paid its officers and directors, allotment of options and bonus
and profit-sharing arrangements; and financial statements certified
by independent accountants.
Applications for registration of securities and periodic reports filed
under this Act are examined by the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance to determine that the fair and adequate disclosure
required by the statute appears to have been made.
The Commission has greatly simplified the registration process by
the adoption of new Rule X-12D1-1, under which the old procedure
of registration by separate successive applications, each covering
a specified number of shares or a certain principal amount of bonds
of a given class of security, was changed to a new method providing
for the registration by a single application covering an entire class
of security, regardless of the amount already issued or which may
subsequently be issued.
Statistics of Securities Registered on Exchanges

At the close of the 1954 fiscal year, 2,204 issuers had 2,641 stock
issues and 1,009 bond issues registered on national securities exchanges.
During the year, securities of 37 new issuers became registered on
exchanges while the registration of all securities of 43 issuers was
terminated.
The following table shows for the fiscal year the number of applications filed under Section 12 and of reports filed under Section 13
and, pursuant to undertakings contained in registration statements
filed under the Securities Act to supply information equivalent to

Suspension

of Trading

The Commission is authorized by the Act, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months
or withdraw the registration of a security on an exchange if the issuer
fails to comply with any provision of the Act or the rules and regulations; and it may summarily suspend trading in such a security for
a period not exceeding 10 days if the public interest so requires.
The Commission summarily prohibited trading in the common
stock of Adolph Gobel, Inc. on the American Stock Exchange by
ordering successive 10-day suspensions from March 13, 1953 to
February 19, 1954. It had received advice from Gobel's accountants
that, on the basis of information they had discovered after their
audit, certified financial statements included in Gobel's annual report
for 1952 understated the reported loss of $437,070.57by approximately
$213,000. The Commission also commenced a proceeding to determine whether to suspend or withdraw exchange registration of this
stock, and conducted hearings on this question. New accountants
retained by Gobel found the amount of loss in question to be $582,021.89. Meanwhile certain creditors filed a petition for reorganization
of Gobel under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act.
The Commission on February 18, 1954 ordered its proceedings
terminated and published its findings and opinion stating it was
satisfied that, since the disclosures made were substantially correct,
there was no further need to deny stockholders access to the exchange
market. The Commission pointed out that the report of the new
accountants, explored in the record of the proceeding, took into account the allegations of the former accountants, analyzed the transactions which required different accounting treatment on Gobel's
books, and contained a detailed reconciliation between the loss
reported in the statement certified by the former accountant and
reported by the new accountants. In addition, the Commissio-i
noted that the affairs of Gobel had come under the direction of a
trustee, subject to court supervis 'on.

The N ew York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange
figures are as reported by those exchanges. There is no duplication
of issues between those two exchanges. However, over half the issues
of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, comprising about
85% of the number of shares so listed, were also admitted to trading
on from one to nine regional exchanges, and about 30% of the issues
of stocks and number of shares on the American Stock Exchange were
also admitted to trading on from one to six regional exchanges.
The amounts shown for "all other exchanges" in the above table
were based on the number of shares outstanding exclusive of treasury
shares, instead of on the number of registered shares as in previous
years, producing slightly smaller aggregates in consequence.
The bonds on the New York Stock Exchange included United
States Government and New York State and City issues with an
aggregate market value of $78,109,634,000.
:Market Value of Stocks on Exchanges

The $135.3 billion aggregate market value of all stocks available

$140.5 billion at the close of 1952. On the New York Stock Exchange,
aggregate stock values increased from $117.3 billion on December 31,
1953 to $139.2 billion on June 30, 1954. Reports as of the latter date

X ew listings of stocks exclusively on the regional exchanges are not
sufficiently numerous to offset the reduction in number of their
exclusive listings which goes on continually because of retirements,
mergers, loss of exclusive status by listing on aNew York stock
exchange, and other reasons. Only 7 regional exchanges obtained any
exclusive stock listings during 1953, such listings consisting of 4 preferred and 5 common issues. Preferred stock listings are frequently
made for other purposes than trading, a usual purpose being compliance with statutes with respect to legality for trust investment.
The 5 new common stock issues listed had a year-end market value
aggregating only $5,300,000. The regional exchanges continue to
obtain substantial new listings of stocks which are also lisped on one
or the other of the N ew York stock exchanges. Their principal
acquisitions, however, are unlisted trading privileges in stocks listed
elsewhere, predominantly on the N ew York Stock Exchange. The

ANNUAL REPORT

Block Distributions Reported by Stock Exchanges

Rule X-10B-2, in substance, prohibits any person engaged in distributing a security from paying any other person for soliciting or
inducing a third person to buy the security on a national securities
exchange. An exemption from the prohibition of the rule is provided
for those cases where compensation is paid pursuant to the terms of
a plan, :filedby a national securities exchange and declared effective
by the Commission, authorizing the payment of such compensation
in connection with a distribution of securities.
Pursuant to the terms of this exemption, two types of plans have
been developed to permit distributions of large blocks of securities to
be made on a national securities exchange. The first of these, designated the "Special Offering Plan", was evolved in 1941 as a result of
numerous conferences between representatives of the Commission
and of various stock exchanges, and the Commission declared effective
a special offering plan for each of the following nine exchanges on the
date shown opposite each:
New York Stock Exchange
San Francisco Stock Exchange
American Stock Exchange
Philadelphia-Baltimore
Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange
Cincinnati Stock Exchange

15,1948

The second type of plan, designated the "Exchange Distribution
Plan", was initially declared effective for the New York Stock Exchange on August 21, 1953 for an experimental period ex...piring on
February 26, 1954 which expiration date was subsequently extended
to February 28, 1955. The American, Midwest, and San Francisco
stock exchanges each :filed plans similar to that of the N ew York
Stock Exchange and they were also declared effective for an experimental period expiring on February 28, 1955.
These two types of plans permit a block of securities to be distributed
through the facilities of a national securities exchange when it has been
determined that the regular market on the floor of the exchange cannot
absorb the particular block within a reasonable time and at a reasonable price or prices. They contain antimanipulative controls and also
require participating members to make certain disclosures to persons
whose orders are solicited. The principal differences between the
provisions of the two plans is in the manner of determining the offering
price of the security and the charges to buyers on their purchases of
the security. In this regard, a special offering is made at a fixed price
consistent with the existing auction market price of the security while

30

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

an exchange distribution is made in the regular auction market on the
floor of the exchange.
Buyers of a security which is the subject of a special offering are not
charged any commission on their purchases and obtain the security at
the net price of the offering. On the other hand, buyers of a security
which is the subject of an exchange distribution on the New York
Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and San Francisco Stock
Exchange pay commissions in agency transactions and are charged
net prices in principal transactions. In exchange distributions on the
Midwest Stock Exchange, however, purchasers need not be charged
commissions in agency transactions and may be charged the equivalent
of a commission in principal transactions.
In addition to these two methods of distributing large blocks of
securities on stock exchanges, a third method is commonly employed
to distribute blocks of securities listed on exchanges to the public
over the counter, commonly referred to as a "Secondary Distribution".
Such distributions take place when it has been determined that it
would not be possible or in the best interest of the various parties
involved to sell the shares on the exchange in the regular way or by
employing either the special offering or exchange distribution technique. The distributions generally take place after the close of
exchange trading. As in the case of special offerings, buyers obtain the
security from the dealer at the net price of the offering, which usually
is at or about the most recent price registered on the exchange. It is
generally the practice of exchanges to require members to obtain the
approval of the exchange before participating in such secondary
distributions.
The following table shows the number and dollar volume of special
offerings and exchange distributions reported by the exchanges having
such plans in effect, as well as similar figures for secondary distributions which exchanges have approved for member participation and
reported to the Commission.

TRADING PRIVILEGES

ON EXCHANGES

Number of Issues Admitted to Unlisted Trading

Securities are said to be admitted to unlisted trading on a stock
exchange when the admission to trading is approved by the exchange
without application by or agreement with the issuer. Such admissions are governed by section 12(f) of the Securities Exchange Act
the respective clauses of which section are referred to in the following
text and tables.
In the tables, the "Clause 1" stocks are the residue of those admitted to unlisted trading prior to March 1, 1934, and they are shown
in two categories, those which are "unlisted only" and those which
are also listed and registered on a stock exchange other than that
where they are admitted to unlisted trading. The "Clause 2" stocks
are those admitted to unlisted trading pursuant to Commission grants
of applications by stock exchanges conditioned on existing listing and
registration on some other stock exchange. The "Clause 3" stocks
are those admitted to unlisted trading pursuant to Commission grants
of applications by stock exchanges conditioned upon the availability
of information substantially equivalent to that filed in the case of
listed issues. The following table, for comparative purposes, also
shows the number of listed stock issues on each stock exchange.

Changes in Securities Admitted to Unlisted Trading Privileges

The usual considerable number of notifications of minor changes in
securities admitted to unlisted trading was received during the fiscal
year from the stock exchanges pursuant to paragraph (a) of rule
X-12F-2.
Applications for continuance of trading in unlisted issues after more
important changes than those contemplated under paragraph (a) of
rule X-12F-2 are made under paragraph (b) thereof. Three such
applications were filed during the fiscal year by the American Stock;
Exchange, of which 2 were granted and 1 withdrawn.
DELISTING

OF SECURITIES

FROM EXCHANGES

Securities Delisted by Application

During the fiscal year ending June 30,1954, the Commission granted
20 applications filed by exchanges or issuers to strike securities from
exchange listing and registration pursuant to section 12 (d) and rule
X-12D2-1.
The applications included 11 by exchanges, covering 8
stock and 9 bond issues; and 9 by issuers, covering 8 stock issues, 1 of
which was removed from 2 exchanges. The applications by exchanges
were based on the undesirability, for various reasons, of further exchange trading. The applications by issuers were based on liquidation in one instance, reduced public holdings and limited trading volumes in two, and on the fact that the stock remained listed on another
exchange in the remaining instances.
Securities Dellsted by Notification

Notifications effecting the removal because of redemption or retirement of 115 issues from listing and registration on national securities
exchanges were received during the fiscal year. Removals from more
than one exchange brought the total removals to 136. The American
Stock Exchange removed 7 issues from listing and registration when
they became listed and registered on the N ew York Stock Exchange.
The exempted exchanges removed 3 issues from listed trading thereon.
MANIPULATION AND STABILIZATION
Manipulation

The Securities Exchange Act prohibits manipulative practices in the
securities markets. The Commission's analysts constantly watch for
unusual or unexplained market activity. They observe the tickers of
the leading exchanges and examine the quotation sheets of all exchanges.. The financial news-ticker, leading newspapers and various
financial publications and services are also closely followed. Overthe-counter surveillance is maintained by the examination of the bids
and offers appearing in the sheets of the national quotation services
and charts are kept on securities having actively quoted markets.

34

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

When unusual or unexplained market activity is observed, all known
information regarding the security is evaluated and a decision made as
to the necessity for an investigation. These investigations take two
forms. The "quiz" or "preliminary" investigation is designed rapidly
to discover evidence of unlawful activity. If a quiz discloses no evidence of violations it is closed. If violations are discovered, the information obtained in the quiz is made available to the proper division
of the Commission or to the appropriate outside agency for punitive
or corrective action. If the quiz indicates that more intensive investigation is necessary, a formal order may be issued by the Commission. Such an order empowers members of the staff to subpoena
pertinent material and to take testimony under oath. Virtually all
of the Commission's investigations are privately conducted so that
no unfair reflection will be cast on any persons or securities and the
trading markets will not be upset.
The following table shows the number of quizzes and formal investigations initiated in the fiscal year 1954 and the number closed or completed during the same period and tho number pending at the ending
of the fiscal year:

When securities are to be offered to the public their markets are
watched very closely to make sure that the price is not artificially
raised prior to the distribution.
.All registered offerings and all
offerings made under Regulations A and D (in all some 1849 offerings
having a value exceeding $9,365,000,000) were so observed during the
fiscal year. Hundreds of other smaller offerings, such as secondary
distributions and distributions of securities under special plans filed
by the exchanges, were also checked and many were kept under
special observation for considerable lengths of time.
Stabilization

All stabilizing operations are very carefully observed. During the
fiscal year, stabilizing was effected in connection with stock offerings
aggregating 21,759,000 shares having an aggregate public offering
price of $403,086,000. Bond issues having a total offering price of

TWENTIETH

A.."il'.'1JALREPORT

$65,000,000 were also stabilized. To accomplish this stabilization,
220,257 shares of stock were purchased by the offerors at a cost of
$3,657,000. Bonds costing $442,500 were also bought by stabilizers.
In connection with these operations more than 7,000 stabilizing
reports were received and examined during the fiscal year.
During the fiscal year, the Commission engaged in the formulation
and release for public comment of rules relating to the stabilization of
securities under the Securities Exchange Act.' Three proposed rules
deal with (l) permissible underwriters' trading prior to and during a
distribution; (2) the times, methods and prices at which stabilizing
transactions are permissible; and (3) permissible stabilizing transactions in connection with the offering of rights to security holders
to subscribe for additional securities.
Following the Commission's Statement of Policy in 1940/ rather
than promulgate specific rules in connection with stabilizing practices,
the Commission had depended upon informal interpretations, some of
which were issued in the form of releases but most of which were
individually rendered by letter or telephone in answer to specific request. The Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the
House of Representatives recommended in a report, dated December
30, 1952, that "The Commission should earnestly and expeditiously
grapple with the problem of stabilization with the view either of the
early promulgation of rules publicly covering these operations, or of
recommending to the Congress such changes in legislation as its experience and study show now to be desirable." 3 The proposed rules
were circulated for public comment on May 18, 1954, after intensive
study by the staff and review by the Commission.
After the close of the fiscal year, a public hearing was held on July
8, 1954, and since that time an ad hoc committee of the public has
conferred with and submitted additional proposals to the staff. The
final recommendations of the staff with respect to the proposed rules
are expected to be submitted to the Commission in the near future.

Recovery of Insiders' Profits by Company

For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which
may have been obtained by an insider by reason of his relationship
to his company, sections 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 17 (b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf of the
issuer of any profit realized by the insider from certain purchases and'
sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within
any period of less than 6 months. The Commission is not charged
with the enforcement of the civil remedies created by these provisions,
which are matters for determination by the courts in actions brought

by the proper parties. However, the Commission has participated
as amicus curiae in a number of suits instituted under these provisions
where questions of statutory interpretation are involved.
REGULATION

OF PROXIES

Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under sections 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12 (e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 the Commission has adopted Regulation
X-14 requiring the disclosure of pertinent information in connection
with the solicitation of proxies, consents and authorizations in respect
of securities of companies subject to those statutes. The regulation
also provides means whereby any security holders so desiring may communicate with other security holders when management is soliciting
proxies, either by arranging for the independent distribution of their
own proxy statements or by including their proposals in the proxy
statements sent out by management.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form at least 10 days prior to the date of the
proposed solicitation. Where preliminary material fails to meet the
prescribed disclosure standards, the management or other group
responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an
opportunity to avoid such defects in the preparation of the proxy
material in the definitive form in which it may be furnished to all
stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the calendar year 1953 1,860 solicitations were made pursuant to Regulation X-14. of which 1,838 were conducted by management and 22 by non-management groups.
The purpose for which proxies are most often sought is the voting
for nominees for directors. In 1953 this was an item of business in
1,715 stockholders' meetings, while at 119 meetings it was not involved. The remaining 26 solicitations sought consents or authorizations from stockholders with respect to proposals not involving any
meeting or any election of directors.
The 1,838 management solicitations were made in 1953 by 1,695
companies, the difference of 143 in these figures reflecting repeated
solicitations made in certain cases. Such repeated solicitations,
whether by management or opposition groups, arise especially in
connection with proxy contests.
During the first five months of 1954, twenty-five companies were
subject to proxy contests for control or for representation on the
board of directors compared to 18 such contests during the entire
.cal~ndar year 1953.

Simplification of Forms and Rules Applicable to the Registration of BrokerDealers

The Commission during the fiscal year substantially revised forms
and rules pertaining to the registration of brokers and dealers.'
â¢ Becurrnes Exchange Act release No. 5000(February 15, 1954).

TWENTIETH

ANNUAL REPORT

39

This action was taken in connection with a comprehensive review of
rules, regulations, forms and procedures, to eliminate duplication and
to simplify the requirements wherever practicable without prejudice
to the public interest or to the protection of investors.
In adopting the new forms for registration as a broker-dealer and
in revising applicable rules, the Commission acted on the view that,
wherever possible, an application for registration should be limited
generally to information necessary to determine whether a registrant,
or an applicant for registration, or any controlled, or controlling
person, is subject to a statutory disqualification.
Form BD adopted during the year, applicable to brokers and dealers,
is an all-purpose form to be used: (1) as the form of application for
registration; (2) as the form to amend such an application; and (3)
as the form of supplemental report to be filed by a registered person.
The new four page Form BD contains only nine items or questions,
whereas Form 3-M previously used as an application for registration,
consisted of twelve pages and required furnishing information under
twenty-seven items. Adoption of Form BD made it possible to
rescind the single-purpose Forms 3-M, 4-M, 5-M and 6-~f formerly
used by broker-dealers. As a part of these actions the Commission,
in each instance, amended applicable rules under the controlling
statutes.
Both the previous and the current rules require that the information
contained in the application for registration of brokers or dealers be
kept current by amendments to the original application. By providing
that the new forms may be used as supplements to tlie old forms,
persons registered before adoption of the new forms are now required
only to furnish current information with respect to the information
in the abbreviated and simplified new forms. It is anticipated that,
after these initial supplements have been filed, there will be a substantial reduction in the volume of amendments required to be filed
with the Commission by registered broker-dealers.
Administrative Proceedings

The Commission is empowered, with due regard for the public
interest and the protection of investors, to deny or revoke the registration of brokers and dealers pursuant to section 15 (b) of the Act
and, pursuant to section 15A and 19 (a) of the Act, to suspend or expel
brokers and dealers from membership in a national securities association or national securities exchange, where misconduct of various
types on the part of the broker-dealer, or its partners, officers,directors
or employees is shown:

.As shown in the above table, there were no proceedings on1 the
question of denial of registration pending at the beginning of the
fiscal year. However, 18 such proceedings were instituted during
the year of which 16 related to applications for registration filed by
Canadian brokers and dealers. The Commission orders for proceedings in the latter group charged, in effect, that the Canadian brokers
and dealers had sold and delivered to persons in the United States
stock of certain Canadian companies in violation of the securities
registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
and the broker-dealer registration provisions of the Exchange Act.
During the pendency of these proceedings, 9 of the respondents
withdrew their applications for registration; one application was
cancelled because of the death of the respondent and one proceeding
is still pending. The Commission issued orders of denial in the
remaining 5 cases,"
Three administrative proceedings decided during the year involved,
among other things, the failure of a firm to comply with the net
capital requirements of the Commission. In one case the Commission
revoked registrant's registration 6 because its aggregate indebtedness
exceeded 2000 per centum of its net capital, and in another the Commission made similar findings with respect to violation of the net
capital rule and also found that registrant failed to keep its books
and records current and failed to disclose that the controlling interest
in the firm had been sold to an undisclosed person.' In the third
case violation of the net capital rule was also found but the Commission
noted that the firm had revised its practices and concluded that a
suspension from membership in the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. for a period of 10 days was a sufficient sanction."
Some of the other proceedings disposed of during the year involved
violations of rule X -17 A-5 in that the registrants in some instances
filed false and misleading financial statements with this Commission,

and in other instances failed to file statements of financial condition
as required by the rule. In other instances, permanent injunctions
restraining the registrants from engaging in and continuing unlawful
acts and practices in connection with the purchase and sale of securities
were the basis for the revocation orders.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

Section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act empowers the Commission to make periodic, special, and other examinations of the books
and records of brokers and dealers. Under this section the Commission conducts an inspection program to determine whether brokers
and dealers are complying with the requirements of the Acts administered by the Commission.
During the fiscal year the Commission's Regional Offices reported
on 788 such inspections, 621 of which were inspections of members of
the NASD. As in former years, a substantial number of violations
of the rules and regulations were discovered, including non-compliance
with the capital rule, the hypothecation rule and Regulation T prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
There were a very few instances where brokers and dealers were taking secret profits. There were a number of transactions in which the
reasonableness of the price charged to the customer in relation to the
current market price, or the concurrent cost, was questionable, and a
substantial number of miscellaneous infractions too scattered and
varied to classify.
The Commission does not necessarily take formal action against a
registered broker or dealer who appears from these inspections to
have violated the Acts. The character of the activity and the public
interest are considered in determining whether action is appropriate.
If the violations appear to be inadvertent or the result of misinformation, the Commission affords the broker-dealer an opportunity to
correct its practices if possible, or to satisfy the Commission that they
will not continue.
The extent of the broker-dealer inspection program depends primarily on the availability of funds. Many members of the investing
public have the erroneous impression that every registered brokerdealer firm is inspected regularly in a manner comparable to the
examinations made of banking institutions.
This, of course, is not so,
and would be possible only with a substantial increase in personnel
and a corresponding increase in costs.
In addition to the .Commission, inspections of brokers and dealers
are made by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
some of the national securities exchanges and some of the states.
These inspections vary widely in character, scope, and frequency.
There have been cases where several agencies have inspected a single

TWENTIETH AlIj'NUAL REPORT

43

firm in a relatively short period of time, and others where a firm subject to inspection by several agencies has remained uninspected for
an extended period. This problem calls for coordination between
inspecting agencies designed to avoid multiplicity of inspections of
some firms and long-term omission of inspections of other firms.
A survey conducted by the SEC Liaison Committee of the National
Association of Securities Administrators, working in cooperation with
this Commission, indicated a lack of uniformity in inspection programs and differences in jurisdiction which make impracticable a
system whereby the findings of one inspecting agency would be available to other agencies. The results of this survey were discussed with
representatives of National Association of Securities Administrators,
various national securities exchanges and the 1\ational Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc.
This study culminated in adoption of a program for the interchange
of information as to dates of inspection between inspecting agencies.
However, under this program, the results of any inspections are confidential to the inspecting agency. This pooling of information as to
when and by whom inspections have recently been made permits the
scheduling of routine inspections so as to reduce haphazard duplications of inspections and omissions to inspect. The program applies
only to routine inspections, and no inspecting agency is in any way
restricted in its freedom to inspect or investigate for good cause, such
as on a customer's complaint or an indication of unsatisfactory financial condition. To evaluate the program would be impracticable at
this early date, but there are indications that it will effectively reduce
the number of uninspected and overinspected firms.
The active participants at the year-end included the Commission,
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the San Francisco
Stock Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange and practically every
state whose laws and procedures provide for an effective inspection
or examination program, including the states of California, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. It is anticipated that, as other exchanges and
states develop effective inspection programs, their participation in
this cooperative effort will become of increasing importance. In
addition to the states named above many others which conduct limited inspection programs have signified their cooperation to the extent
of their jurisdiction and inspection facilities.
Investigations

Investigations of brokers and dealers may result from the inspection program, complaints from members of the public or information

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

received from sources such as state securities commissions, securities
exchanges and associations and "better business bureaus." When
investigations are completed and the evidence has been analyzed, the
:staff, where appropriate, recommends to the Commission that it
institute injunctive action or institute proceedings to revoke registration or to suspend or expel from membership in the national securities
exchange or association to which the broker or dealer may belong, or
refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.
The number of such investigations during the fiscal year were as

Financial Reports

The Commission's rule X-17A-5 requires brokers and dealers to
file financial reports each calendar year. During the 1954 fiscal year
3950 such reports were filed. Examination of the financial report
filed by a broker-dealer affords the staff an opportunity to determine
whether, as of the date of the report, the firm is in compliance with
the capital requirements prescribed by rule X-15C3-1, and if it is
not, the fum is given an opportunity, if consistent with the public
interest and the protection of investors, to bring its financial condition
up to the required standards. If the firm fails to do so promply, the
Commission takes appropriate action.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.
Membership

The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. continued as
the only national securities association registered with the Commission. The Association reported that during the fiscal year its
membership increased by 57 to a total of 3,091 at June 30, 1954, as a
result of 281 admissions to, and 224 terminations of membership.
The Association also reported that at June 30, 1954 there were registered with it as registered representatives 35,679 individuals, including generally all partners, officers, salesmen, traders and other
persons associated with, or employed by, member firms in capacities
which involve their doing business directly with the public. The
number of persons so registered increased by 2,091 during the year
as a result of 6,087 initial registrations, 2,250 re-registrations and
6,246 terminations of registration.
Disciplinary Actions

During the fiscal year the Commission received from the NASD
reports of final action in twenty-seven disciplinary proceedings in

TWENTIETH

ANNUAL REPORT

45

which formal complaints alleging violations of specified provisions of
the Association's Rules of Fair Practice had been filed against members, eight of which involved members and the remaining nineteen
involved not only members, but also one or more registered representatives of such members.
In five of the proceedings members were expelled, in seven members
were fined and in six were censured, and in ten no disciplinary action
was taken against the members. With respect to registered representatives, the registrations of seven were revoked, four were suspended,
fines were imposed on four representatives and censure upon six, and
the complaint was dismissed in one case. In a few of the cases more
than one type of sanction was imposed with respect to the person
disciplined. The fines imposed ranged from $100 to $3,500 and the
suspensions from 14 days to one year. In some instances costs were
assessed.
<Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Actions

Section 15A (g) of the Act provides that disciplinary actions by the
N ASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion
,or on the application of any aggrieved person. Two such petitions,
described in earlier Annual Reports, were pending at the close of the
last fiscal year and during the year their status remained unchanged. 9
In addition, three other petitions were filed during the year. One of
these, filed on behalf of Gilbert Parker Investing, Inc. under this
section and in the alternative under section 15A(b) (4) described
below, concerned a decision by the NASD that Parker and his firm
were not eligible for membership because of a disqualification arising
from an earlier N ASD disciplinary action. This petition was withdrawn prior to determination by the Commission.
Petitions for review were filed with the Commission with respect to
two decisions of the Board of Governors of the N ASD expelling
members found to have violated designated rules in selling oil royalties
to customers at unfair prices and to have by such violations been
guilty of conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of
trade. Both these appeals were pending at the end of the fiscal
year.
Commission Review of Action on Membership

The Act in section 15A (b) (4) and the by-laws of the NASD provide
that, except where the Commission with due regard to the public
interest approves or directs to the contrary, no broker or dealer may be
, The pending cases concern petrtions filed by Earl L. Combest from" two-year suspension as registered

and a fine of $2,500, and by OtIS & Co. from a two-year suspension from membersrnp.
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year the suspension of Combest was cancelled but the action imposing the tine
was affirmed.

admitted to or continued in membership if he or any controlling or
controlled person is expelled or is currently under suspension from
such an association for violation of a rule prohibiting conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, or is subject to an
order of the Commission denying or revoking his broker-dealer registration, or was a "cause" of any such order of expulsion, current
suspension or denial or revocation.
Pursuant to this authority the Commission approved applications
for the continuation in membership of three firms while employing
persons formerly associated with Charles E. Bailey & CO.lOand one
firm employing a person formerly associated with Mason, Moran & Co."
The status of two other cases pending at the start of this fiscal year
was unchanged at the year end."
Commission Action on NASD Rules

Section 15A (j) of the Act provides that the Commission shall
disapprove changes in the rules of a national securities association
unless such changes appear to the Commission to be consistent with
the requirements for such rules as contained in sub-section 15A(b) of
the Act.
The Commission, on June 30, 1952, had disapproved, pending further order, a rule adopted by the Association providing for notice
under certain conditions to a member (the "employer member")
before another member (the "executing member") knowingly executes
purchases or sales of a security for the account of a partner, officer,
registered representative or employee of the employer member."
At the same time the Commission gave notice that it had under consideration a proposal to adopt rule X-10B-6 which had the same
broad objective. Broadly stated, both rules were designed to provide notice to a firm of transactions by employees or associates
effected through other firms so that a member, in his own interest
and in the interest of his customers, might weigh the effect, if any,
of such transactions handled outside his own office.
The Commission on the basis of further study of the problem involved and on the comments received on its proposed rule concluded
that its own rule should not be adopted and that the Association's
rule should be permitted to become effective. The Commission by
order, therefore, vacated its earlier order which had disapproved the
Association's proposed rule. i4

Rules Applicable to NASD

As another step in its program for the simplification of rules,
the Commission adopted amendments to paragraph (b) of its rule
X-15AJ-l and to Forms X-15AA-l and X-15AJ-2 under the Securities Exchange Act which had the effect of reducing the information
required to be filed with the Commission by national securities assoeiations." The amendments eliminated a requirement that such an
association file annually with the Commission as a part of its registration statement a list of members arranged on a geographical basis
and information concerning the amount of dues payable each year
by each member. The amendments were adopted at the request of
the NASD on the grounds that the information had little value but
was difficult and expensive to compile.
In addition the Association during the year amended sections 4,
5 and 6 of Article XV of the by-laws and section 27 (a) of Article III
of the Rules of Fair Practice all of which relate to registered representatives. The effect of the integrated amendments to the by-laws
was to provide for continuous jurisdiction over a registered representative so that a change of employment from one member to another
would no longer terminate the responsibility of the representative for
actions committed during a previous employment. Section 27(a) of
the Rules of Fair Practice imposed on a member an obligation to
supervise certain activities of specified employees. The amendment
to this section extended the scope of the rule to encompass all registered representatives, instead of only salesmen, and to all transactions
with or for a customer, instead of only sales or offers to customers.
LITIGATION

UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT

During the fiscal year the Commission found it necessary to apply
to the federal courts on a number of occasions for injunctive relief
to prevent continuing violations of the Securities Exchange Act.
One such action was S.E.O. vs. Lawrence L. Smith,16 in which the
Commission's complaint charged the defendant with violating the
anti-manipulative and anti-fraud provisions of the Act in that he
effected a series of transactions in a security registered on a national
securities exchange for the purpose of inducing others to purchase or
sell shares of such security. The orders were placed with several
brokers. The complaint alleged that the defendant represented to
brokers that he would pay for the securities purchased for his account
on the settlement date when, in fact, the defendant knew that he
could not settle and pay on the due date. It was also charged that

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the defendant issued checks in purported payment for securities purchased on his order when, in fact, the defendant knew he had insufficient funds available to honor such checks. Because of the activities of the defendant, certain brokers and dealers were forced to sell
the securities on the market at prices less than the amount agreed
to be paid by the defendant and less than the cost of such securities
to such brokers and dealers. The defendant consented to the entry
of judgment.
In connection with an investigation the Commission found it
necessary to file a complaint in S.E.O. vs. Charles M. Weber, doing
business as Weber-Millican Oompany,17 a registered broker-dealer, to
require registrant to permit representatives of the Commission to
examine certain books and records. The complaint alleged that
Weber-Millican refused to make available for reasonable inspection
and examination by representatives of the Commission, as required
by the Act, books and records which the defendant must keep and
make available pursuant to the rules adopted under the statute.
The defendant consented to the entry of judgment.
A complaint charging violation of the Commission's net capital
rule was filed in S.E.O. vs. W. E. Buford & 00., Inc:" The complaint alleged that the defendant's aggregate indebtedness to other
persons exceeded 2000 per centum of its net capital as defined in the
rule. In addition to an injunction the Commission also sought the
appointment of a receiver. Subsequent to the filing of thc complaint
and the entry of a temporary restraining order, the defendant entered
into certain transactions and arrangements with creditors which
brought its financial condition within the standards prescribed by the
rule promulgated for the protection of investors. Under the circumstances the Commission entered into a stipulation with the defendant
forming the basis of the court's order wherein W. E. Buford & Co.,
Inc. consented to the entry of a judgment to enjoin the defendant
from future violations of the rule and undertook to file with the
Commission monthly financial reports for one year. It was provided
that if the defendant is in full compliance with the requirements of
the Commission's rule for the one-year period, the court may vacate
the judgment on motion of the defendant. However, the defendant
agreed that if during that period he should violate the rule, he would
not oppose an application by the Commission for the appointment of
a receiver of the defendant's business. Jurisdiction was retained by
the court for the purpose of giving full effect to this arrangement.
In S.E.a. vs, George McKaig,19 the Commission alleged that

pany, hypothecated securities of customers under circumstances
which permitted the securities to be subjected to liens in excess of
those permitted by Commission rules. In addition to charging other
violations of the hypothecation rules, the complaint also charged
that the defendant permitted his indebtedness to exceed the limitations prescribed by the Commission's net capital rule, that he failed
to keep required books and records, and filed uncertified accounts of
financial condition, although required to file certified reports. The
action was pending at the end of the fiscal year.
Participation

as Amicus Curiae

In Connell v. Errion." the Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae
by invitation of the Court. It expressed the view that the antifraud provisions of rule X-10B-5 under section 10 (b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 were applicable to a combination purchase of
securities and property which did not come within the definition of
securities under the Act, and that under section 29 (b) of the Act the
defrauded seller could obtain rescission of the entire transaction,
including the transfer of the non-securities, for violation of the rule,
or obtain monetary relief by way of damages as an alternative to
specific restitution. Defendants had sought dismissal of the complaint which was based upon alleged violations of the rule. In deny-ing the motion to dismiss, the Court indicated from the bench that
its conclusion was based largely upon the Commission's arguments."
Textron, Inc. v, American Woolen Oompany 22 was a suit to enjoin
announcement of the results of a vote for officers and directors of
the American Woolen Company taken at a stockholders' meeting
because a substantial number of proxies counted for and necessary
to the existence of a quorum allegedly had been obtained in violation
of the Commission's proxy rules under section 14 (a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission filed a statement with the
Court expressing the view.with which the Court subsequently agreed,
that a shareholder could maintain a private action in a federal district court based upon an alleged violation of the Commission's proxy
rules in a proper case, notwithstanding the fact that the Commission
itself did not institute an action. The Court found, however, that
the alleged violations did not invalidate the proxies for the purpose
of being counted toward a quorum, and that under the circumstances
federal jurisdiction could not be based on the Securities Exchange
Act, although the Court took jurisdiction on other grounds.

PART IV
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 provides forthree separate areas of regulation of holding company systems which
control electric utility companies and companies engaged in the retail
distribution of natural or manufactured gas. The first embraces
those provisions of the Act which require physical integration of the
public utility and related properties of holding company systems, and
the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of the systems. The second area of regulation covers financing
operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries,
acquisitions and dispositions of securities and properties, their ac-counting practices and servicing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. The third area includes the provisions of the Act
providing exemptions for intrastate and foreign holding company
systems and systems which are only incidentally holding company
systems and those provisions of the Act regulating the right of a person
who is affiliated with a public utility company to acquire securities re- -

suIting in a second such affiliation.
COMPOSITION

OF REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMSSUMMARY OF CHANGES

On June 30, 1954 there were 29 public utility holding company
systems which were subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act
as registered holding company systems. Included were 25 registered
holding companies which function solely as holding companies, 10
other registered holding companies which were also operating companies, 133 electric and gas utility subsidiaries and 156 non-utility
subsidiaries, a total of 324 companies. For the convenience of discussion these 29 registered systems are referred to as "active systems"

-and-a table showing the composition of such systems as of June 30,
19M appears in appendix table 9. In addition there were 6 companies
which had registered as holding companies but which had disposed of
.all of their utility subsidiaries.
On June 30, 1953 there were 35 active registered holding company
systems aggregating 372 companies. 1 The six systems which had
ceased to be active registered systems as of June 30, 1954,2 comprised
-eight registered holding companies, 11 electric and gas utility subsidiaries and six non-utility subsidiaries. One public utility company
.registered as a holding company during 1954, because it had entered
into a contract for the purchase of another utility company, but
-ceased to be a registered holding company in the same fiscal year
following the cancellation of this contract.
Active registered systems added one public utility subsidiary and
four non-utility subsidiaries in 1954. Fifteen public utility subsidiaries with net assets aggregating $265 million and two non-utility
'subsidiaries with assets of $5 million 3 were divested by their respective
holding company parents and as a result were no longer subject to
the Act as components of registered systems." Twenty-three companies were absorbed by mergers or consolidations, 9 were eliminated
by dissolution, and 16 companies ceased to be associated with the
active systems as a consequence of exemptions and other changes in
'status. The following table shows the changes which occurred during the year in the composition of active registered holding company

American & Foreign Power Company, Inc.

During the fiscal year the Commission entered an order granting'
American & Foreign Power Company, Inc. an exemption as a holding
company and as a subsidiary of Electric Bond and Share Company
pursuant to sections 3 (a) (5) and 3 (b) of the Act.s After the close
of the fiscal year, the Commission disposed of certain remaining
claims in prior reorganizations proceedings for fees and expenses
arising out of the section 11 (e) proceedings." As a result of the
order active regulatory supervision over the company has been
reduced to a minimum, consisting of only such attention as is required
by section 3 (c) of the Act in the continuing but limited surveillance
of companies exempted from the statute. A summary of the proceedings before the Commission and the courts leading to the corporate.

American Gas and Electric Company

American Gas and Electric Company controls the largest of the
regional integrated holding company systems. During the fiscal year
the Commission approved a voluntary proposal for the acquisition by
Indiana & Michigan Electric Company, a subsidiary operating company, of all of the assets of Citizens Heat, Light and Power Company,
another subsidiary operating company, following which the latter"
was dissolved.' The transaction was consummated on April 26, 1954.
As the result of two other proposals approved by the Commission
American Gas and Electric Company acquired all of the outstanding
common stock of Flat Top Power Company, a non-affiliated publicutility company 8 and The Ohio Power Company, a subsidiary of
American Gas and Electric Company, acquired the electric generating
and distribution facilities of the village of Arlington, Ohio." The
company also holds 37.8 percent of the common stock of Ohio Valley
Electric Company, recently organized to generate power for the
Atomic Energy Commission's plant at Portsmouth, Ohio.
Pending for determination by the Commission is a proposal filed
pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Act providing for, among other
things, the merger of two system operating companies, The Ohio Power
Company and Central Ohio Light & Power Company."
American Natural Gas Company

American Natural Gas Company is solely a holding company with
four direct subsidiaries, Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, Milwaukee Gas Light Company, Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Company
and American Natural Gas Service Company. An indirect subsidiary, Milwaukee Solvay Coke Company, was owned by MilwaukeeGas at the end of the fiscal year.
At the beginning of the fiscal year the Commission had pending
for decision a question concerning the retainability of the interest
of American Natural Gas in Milwaukee Solvay, a non-utility, as an
"other business" under section 11 (b) (1) of the Act. The Commission decided to permit the retention of this interest on the ground
that circumstances giving rise to its earlier order permitting retention had not changed sufficiently to require divestment, subject
however, to the Commission's continuing jurisdiction to determine
whether future conditions may require such action,"

1953 the Commission released jurisdiction over fees and expenses
claimed by certain participants in the proceedings which terminated
with the plan of dissolution approved by the Commission on March 21,
1953P
This action disposed of the remaining questions connected
with the reorganization of the American Power & Light system. The
company has filed an application for an order pursuant to section
5 (d) of the Act declaring that it has ceased to be a holding company.
Central Public Utility Corporation

At the beginning of the fiscal year the Commission had pending
for decision the approval of a plan filed pursuant to section 11 (e)
of the Act by Central Public Utility Corporation ("Cenpuc"). This
plan provided for the elimination from the system of Central Indiana
Gas Company, Cenpuc's only domestic public utility subsidiary; the
dissolution of Central Natural Gas Corporation, a non-utility subsidiary; the merger with Cenpuc of Islands Gas and Electric Company,
an exempt holding company subsidiary; and an application for exemption pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the Act of Cenpuc and its
subsidiaries to be granted upon consummation of the preceding steps."
Subsequently Cenpuc filed an amendment to this plan requesting that
the proposals relating to the merger of Islands Gas with Cenpuc and
the application for exemption be eliminated. 14 The Commission
approved the plan providing for the distribution by Cenpuc to its
stockholders on a pro rata basis of the reclassified stock of Central
Indiana Gas Company and the liquidation and dissolution of Central
Natural Gas Corporation." Those provisions of the original plan,
which the company had requested to have withdrawn, were not
considered.
During the year the Commission issued three other orders pertaining to this system under section 11 (e) of the Act. In one the Commission authorized the withdrawal of an application for approval of
a plan providing for the recapitalization of Islands." In another
it approved certain applications for fees and expenses incurred in
connection with an earlier plan of reorganization approved by the
Commission on June 13, 1952,17and in the third it approved, and
released jurisdiction with respect to, the procedures for the selection
of a new board of directors of Central Indiana Gas Company following
its divestment by Cenpuc."

Cities Service Company

Cities Service Company is a registered holding company under
commitment pursuant to section 11 (b) of the Act to dispose of all of
its utility interests. The only public utility interests still owned by
Cities at the beginning of the fiscal year included two domestic gas
utility subsidiaries, Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Company and The Gas
Service Company, and one foreign gas utility, Dominion Natural Gas
Company, Ltd., a subsidiary company exempt pursuant to section
3 (b) of the Act. A contract was entered into with a neighboring
public utility company, ::\Iissouri Public Service Company, for the
sale to it by Cities Service of its holdings of all of the common stock
of The Gas Service Company subject to the requisite regulatory
approvals. Following hearings before the Commission, in which the
Missouri Public Service Commission and the Kansas State Corporation Commission appeared as parties, Cities Service and Missouri
Public Service withdrew their respective applications. On April 6,
1954 the Commission approved a proposal for the sale of the stock of
Gas Service Company at competitive bidding." The sale was
consummated on April 20, 1954.
During the fiscal year the Commission also issued an order releasing
jurisdiction over fees and expenses arising out of a plan to bring the
system of Arkansas Natural Gas Corporation (formerly a registered
holding company subsidiary and now known as Arkansas Fuel Oil
Corporation) into compliance with section 11 (b) of the Act.20

leases, wells and equipment to The Mauufacturers Light and Heat
Company, a subsidiary of Columbia Gas System, Inc., also a registered
holding company." ' In the second case, New York State Natural
Gas Corporation, a non-utility subsidiary, requested approval of a
proposal to acquire certain gas producing and transmission properties

The Commission also approved various claims for fees and expenses
in connection with the reorganization."
Electric Bond and Share Company

Pursuant to the provisions of plans approved by the Commission
under section 11 (e) in previous fiscal years, Electric Bond and Share
Company is in the process of reducing to less than 5 percent its holdings of the common stocks of its only domestic utility subsidiary,
United Gas Corporation, with the intention of qualifying for an exemption under section 3 (a) (5) of the Act and of transforming itself into
a registered investment company under the Investment Company
Act of ]940.
Several remaining residual matters pertaining to the effectuation of
plans filed in prior years were acted upon by the Commission during
the fiscal year. Among these were transactions pertaining to the disposal of (a) portions of Bond and Share's holdings of United Gas
common stock," which holdings had been reduced as of June 30, 1954
to 12.1 percent of such outstanding stock and (b) all of Bond and
Sharp's holdings of 4,256 shares of common stock of Portland Gas and
Coke Company," which had been received as a liquidating distribution from Bond and Share's former subsidiary, American Power and
Light Company.
Applications for fees and expenses incurred by various participants
in connection with Bond and Share's final comprehensive plan of
reorganization were also considered by the Commission during the
fiscal year, and the Commission issued an order authorizing and directing Bond and Share to pay certain fees and expenses." Certain
other applications for approval of fees and expenses were pending at
the close of the fiscal year.
Electric Power & Light Corporation

At the close of the prior fiscal year appeals were pending from an

effect, that the Commission's jurisdiction to pass upon fees and expenses in a section 11 (e) reorganization of a subsidiary does not
extend to fees proposed to be paid by a parent registered holding
company to individuals retained by it to perform services in connection with the subsidiary's reorganization. The Commission and a
stockholders' committee petitioned the United States Supreme Court
for certiorari on June 21, 1954.29 Certiorari was granted on the Commission's petition on October 14, 1954 and the Committee's petition
was denied on the same date.

The application of the Commission to the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware for enforcement of its order approving and denying fees and expenses claimed by participants in the
proceedings for the reorganization of Engineers Public Service Company," which was referred to in the 19th Annual Report, was decided
-on February 16, 1954.31 The district court awarded fees to certain
claimants in amounts larger than had been allowed by the Commission.
'Subsequently the Commission issued a supplemental order approving
;the payment of additional compensation to one claimant," and filed
a notice of appeal in the United States Court of Appeals, Third
Circuit, with respect to those portions of the district court's order
relating to the allowances to two other claimants."

General Public Utilities Corporation ("GPU") is a holding company
-controlling the electric utility system which emerged from the reorganization of the former Associated Gas and Electric Company system.
Its seven domestic electric utility subsidiaries operate in the States
of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Earlier proceedings regarding the integration and simplification of
this company's system are described in the 19th Annual Report.
Hearings before a hearing examiner were held during the year on a re-quest by GPU that the Commission modify its order, entered December 28, 1951 pursuant to section 11 (b) (1) of the Act insofar as said
order directed GPU to divest itself of its subsidiaries Northern Pennsylvania Power Company and the Waverly Electric Light and Power

International Hydro-Electric System

During the fiscal year a number of steps were taken in further consummation of the plan for the reorganization of International HydroElectric System ("IRES") into an investment company. Details of
this plan were summarized in the 19th Annual Report. Steps taken
included the retirement of IRES' preferred stock and the sale of 125,000 shares of the common stock of New England Electric System thus
reducing IRES' holdings to 5.07 percent of the outstanding shares.
At the end of the fiscal year steps remaining to be taken in consummation of the plan included disposition of applications for fees
and expenses aggregating approximately $1,500,000, disposition of tax
claims, resolution of a controversy now pending before the United
States District Court for the District of Massachusetts concerning an
election for members of the Board of Directors, and the formulation
of definitive plans for conversion of IRES into an investment
company.
The 19th Annual Report contained a description of the proposal of
IRES' Trustee to sell certain properties of Eastern New York Power
Corporation, subsidiary of IHES, to the New York State Electric and
Gas Corporation. On appeal by the City of Plattsburg, New York,
the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on November
12, 1953 affirmed the order of the district court approving the contract
of sale."

by selling 100,231 shares of such stock to the public. After the sale,
Koppers filed an application requesting the Commission to modify the
order of June 26, 1945 so as to permit it to continue ownership of its
remaining holdings of 13,000 shares of the common stock of Eastern,
and requesting an order under section 5 (d) of the Act declaring that
it had ceased to be a holding company. The Commission granted
both of these requests and dismissed a pending application by Koppers
for exemption pursuant to section 3 (a) of the Act on the ground that
the relief granted under section 5 (d) of the Act rendered such application moot."
An application by Eastern requesting an exemption pursuant to
section 3 (a) of the Act was still pending at the close of the fiscal year.
Upon application by the Commission for enforcement of its order
approving and denying various applications for fees and expenses
incident to the reorganization of Eastern Gas & Fuel Associates, the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,
affirmed the Commission's denial of reimbursement to Koppers for
expenses it had incurred in connection with such reorganization. The
court reversed the Commission with respect to its denial of fees
claimed by a stockholders' committee member by reason of securities
transactions effected by the wife of such committee member while the
reorganization proceedings were in progress." Both Koppers and the
Commission appealed from the decision of the district court to the
United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, where the
appeals are pending.

States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in part and
reversed in part 40 an order of the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of New York." which enforced in part and remanded

In an independent action for damages for alleged fraud in the reorganization proceedings filed by Ennis M. Nichols et al. against Long
Island, described at page 83 of the 19th Annual Report, the United
States Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order of dismissal, but did not indicate explicitly in its judgment that litigation of
those charges was also barred in the reorganization proceedings on theground of res judicata."
Subsequently, on the basis of the decision
of the Court of Appeals, the District Court held that appellants werebarred from proceeding further both in the independent action and.
directly in the reorganization proceedings." Thereupon, appellants.
petitioned the Court of Appeals to amend and clarify its earlier judg~
ment so as to eliminate the bar to direct proceedings in the roorgan-ization court. However, the Court of Appeals amended its judgment
to state explicitly that further proceedings in the reorganization court.
were likewise barred under its findings of res judicata."

During the fiscal year Middle South applied pursuant to section
l1(c) of the Act for an extension of time to comply with the Commission's order of March 20, 195351 requiring Middle South and its subsidiaries to dispose of their direct and indirect interests in the nonelectric properties owned by certain subsidiaries. The Commission
granted a one year extension from March 20, 1954 to comply with the
order, except with respect to certain water properties located at Crystal Springs, Mississippi.P
Subsequently, on April 15, 1954 Middle
South sold the Crystal Springs water properties to Union Water Service Company, a non-affiliated company, for a base price of $50,000.
New England Electric System

New England Electric System ("NEES") and its subsidiary com-,
panies constitute the largest utility system in New England. As of
December 31, 1953 the system had 30 subsidiaries, including 10 gas
utility companies, 16 electric utility companies, two combined gas.
and electric utility companies, one service company and one real
estate company.
The principal problems remaining to be resolved by the system
pursuant to section 11 (b) of the Act pertain to the retainability of
its gas properties. One attempt to dispose of these properties in
1951 failed because the successful bidder was unable to finance the.
purchase." However, considerable progress has been made toward
the further segregation of the electric and gas properties of the system and in effecting divestments.
Two proposals providing for rearrangement of the gas and electric
properties of certain subsidiaries and related financing transactions
were approved by the Commission during the fiscal year. In one of
these, the gas and electric properties of Beverly Gas and Electric
Company, Gloucester Electric Company, Gloucester Gas Light Company, Salem Electric Lighting Company and Salem Gas Light Com-.
pany were separated and merged respectively into a single newly
organized gas company, North Shore Gas Company, and into a
single newly organized electric company, Essex County Electric
Company." The other proposal provided, among other things, for
the transfer by Suburban Gas and Electric Company of its gas
properties to the Mystic Valley Gas Company, formerly Malden and
Melrose Gas Light Company; the merger of Arlington Gas Light .

expenses to all but two of the more than 60 participants in the various
proceedings for the reorganization of the Standard Power system under
section 11 of the Act.81 There remain for determination by the
Oommission one fee claim for $3,500,000, one undetermined claim,
and certain expenses. Upon a challenge by the claimant of the large
fee to the jurisdiction of the Commission the United States District
Oourt for the District of Delaware directed that he be permitted
to file his claim with the court, but that proceedings thereon be
stayed until the Oommission had an opportunity to hear and determine
such claim."
On ~1ay 5, 1954 Standard Power filed a plan pursuant to section
11 (e) of the Act proposing the settlement of all claims between itself
and H. ~r. Byllesby and Company. The alleged claims and cross
claims have not heretofore been passed upon by the Oommission,
although various aspects of them, and the transactions out of which
they arose, have been considered. In addition, there is pending in
the United States District Oourt for the District of Delaware, an
action for an accounting brought on behalf of Standard Power against
Byllesby and others."
On July 8, 1954 a plan for the liquidation of Equitable Auto Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Philadelphia, was approved by the
Commission and subsequently consummated."
The uncertainties respecting the amounts of fee claims and Federal
tax liabilities to be borne by Standard Gas and Philadelphia have
affected the timing of Standard Power's plans to become a registered
investment company as disclosed in the 19th Annual Report. No
application for this purpose has been filed with the Oommission as yet.
As of the close of the fiscal year 1954, Standard Power's assets
consisted mainly of 53.6 percent of the common stock of Standard
Gas and small amounts of the common stocks of present and former
public utility subsidiaries of Standard Gas and Philadelphia. Standard Gas' assets consisted principally of all of the common stock of
Philadelphia and minor investments in other companies. Philadelphia Oompany's assets comprised 13 percent of the common stock
of Duquesne Light Company, 51 percent of the common stock of

public utility interests to not more than 4.9 percent of the total voting
securities of anyone utility company and is in the process of trans.
forming itself into a closed-end, non-diversified investment company.
The proposals approved by the Commission leading toward the
transformation of United Corporation into an investment company
and proceedings before the Commission and the Federal courts
relating thereto were described in the 18th Annual Report.
The 19th Annual Report contained a description of the litigation
instituted by certain stockholders of United Corporation in the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, involving
certain orders of the Commission approving the final plan for the
corporate simplification of the United Corporation system pursuant
to section 11 (e) of the Act. A protective committee for the option
warrant holders had intervened in these proceedings. The Court of
Appeals affirmed the Commission's orders approving the plan and
held that it had jurisdiction to review the orders in their entirety,
including those provisions subject to enforcement by a district court.
The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to the warrant
holders' committee on October 12, 195385 and denied the petition of
the stockholders on January 11, 1954.86 On January 4, 1954 the
Supreme Court determined that the Court of Appeals had erroneously
taken jurisdiction over those provisions of the plan which the Commission had reserved for district court enforcement." These related
to the cancellation of United Corporation's option warrants without
compensation to the holders thereof and the amendment of the corporation's charter and by-laws to provide for cumulative voting and
a 50 percent quorum at stockholders' meetings. The Supreme Court
affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals in respect of other portions of the Commission's order which were not subject to district
court enforcement. Subsequently, the Supreme Court denied the
petitioners' application for a stay and for leave to file a petition for
rehearing.f
On March 18, 1954, counsel for the Committee representing the holders of option warrants filed an application with the
Commission requesting, among other things, the reopening of the
proceedings before the Commission so as to permit presentation of
further evidence in support of modification of the Commission's
opinion and order requiring cancellation of the warrants. The

At the beginning of the fiscal year there was pending in the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit a petition by certain stockholders of the corporation under section 24 (a)
of the Act for review of the Commission's order dated May 2, 1952 90
approving a program for the investment of $24,500,000 of the company's surplus funds pursuant to section 9(c) (3) of the Act. The
petition also sought review of an order of the Commission dated
June 24, 1952,91approving a proposal by United Corporation to make
a public offering of its holdings of the common stock of South Jersey
Gas Company. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition." Subsequently the Commission granted United Corporation's application
for an amendment of the Commission's order of May 2, 1952 which
would allow greater flexibility in respect of the acquisition of securities
pursuant to its investment program.P
During the fiscal year the Commission participated in three proceedings in the Federal courts relating to its orders approving and
denying applications for fees and expenses arising out of the various
proceedings for the reorganization of United Corporation. On September 15, 1953 the United States District Court for the Northern
District of N ew York, affirmed 94 an order of the Commission 95which
denied reimbursement to United Corporation for expenses and fees
incurred by it in the reorganization of its former subsidiary, Niagara
Hudson Power Corporation. An appeal filed by United Corporation
in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on
December 15, 1953 was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
On March 2, 1954, the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware affirmed in part and reversed in part an order of the
Commission dated June 4, 195296 allowing and denying fees in connection with the reorganization proceedings of United Corporation.
The Commission's order made determinations with respect to 14
applications. Three were granted in the amounts requested; eight
were granted in substantially reduced amounts; and three applications were denied. The District Court affirmed part of the order,
but reversed and remanded the Commission's order as to one applica00Holding Company Act Release No. 11209.

The 19th Annual Report contains a description of the Commission's
order dated June 16, 1953 approving and denying applications for
fees and expenses which arose from the dissolution of Public Service
Corporation of New Jersey, a former subsidiary of United Corporation, pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Act. A petition for review
was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
by the counsel to Public Service, whose application for fees was
granted in reduced amount, and by United Corporation, whose expenses in connection with the reorganization of Public Service were
disallowed by the Commission. The Court of Appeals reversed that
portion of the Commission's order approving a reduced allowance for
the counsel to Public Service and affirmed the Commission's action
denying allowances of expenses to United Corporation." A petition
for certiorari filed by United Corporation with the "United States
Supreme Court on May 27, 1954 was denied on October 14,
1954.
REVISION OF RULES, FORMS AND PROCEDURES

Early in the fiscal year the Commission initiated a program to
reexamine all rules, forms and procedures under the Act. The purpose of this program was to make it possible for the Commission
better to carry out its functions with a reduced staff. The program
has resulted in substantial revision of rules and forms, thereby reducing
duplicative filing requirements, eliminating the demand for material
no longer needed in administering the Act, and streamlining procedures
where streamlining seemed appropriate.
Revisions of Rules and Regulations

Rule U-11 was revised on October 5, 1953 so as to facilitate investment in the equity securities of public utilities by certain individuals
and corporations. Under the revised rule any individual who has
previously been authorized by the Commission to acquire as much as
five percent of the voting securities of two or more electric or gas utility
companies or holding companies may acquire unlimited amounts of
additional securities of such companies without obtaining prior authorization by the Commission. A company which is not itself a holding
company or a subsidiary of a registered holding company and which
has previously been authorized to acquire as much as five percent of
the voting securities of two or more electric or gas utilities or holding
companies may acquire additional voting securities of such companies
up to, but not including, 10 percent of the total voting power without
prior approval. Previously each acquisition above 5 percent required

separate approval. Experience has shown, however, that Commission
examination of subsequent acquisitions above 5percent served no useful
purpose, once the creation of an affiliation had been approved, until
the acquisitions became sufficient to cause the acquirer to become a
holding company. Both the industry and the Commission are saved
needless labor and expense by the revision."
A new rule, rule U-13, was adopted on December 24, 1953 to
facilitate the conversion of certain registered holding companies into
investment companies as a means of compliance with the provisions
of section 11 (b) of the Act. Two registered holding companies,
Electric Bond and Share Company and The United Corporation,
have disposed of the greater part of their domestic utility interests
and have been authorized by the Commission to convert themselves
into investment companies to be registered as such pursuant to the
Investment Company Act of 1940. Standard Power and Light Corporation and the International Hydro-Electric System have indicated
a similar intention. The new rule exempts nonutility companies
acquired by these registered holding companies, pursuant to an overall
investment program previously approved by the Commission, from
the obligations and duties imposed upon them by the statute as
subsidiaries or affiliates.'?"
Rule U-20 was amended effective September 15, 1954 to prescribe
Form U-1 for the filing of all applications and declarations and
amendments thereto under sections 6 (b), 7, 9 (c) (3),10,12 (b), 12 (c),
12 (d) and 12 (f) of the Act. Previously, a separate form, Form U-A,
was required to be used for the filing of amendments. The practical
effect of the revision was to eliminate Form U-A in the great majority
of cases arising under the Act.'
Rule U-22 was amended effective September 15, 1954 for the purpose of extending the privilege of incorporation by reference in the
filing of all applications and declarations under the Act, Formerly,
the rule permitted applicants and declarants to incorporate by reference only to other documents filed under this statute.
The rule, as
amended, permits incorporation by reference to documents filed with
the Commission under any Act administered by it..2
A new rule, rule U-29, was adopted effective April 30, 1954, to
require the filing under separate cover by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries of their published reports to stockholders
and certain other information, all of which was previously incorporated as exhibits to the annual reports filed by registered holding
company systems. The objectives of this revision were to pave the

way for the consolidation of annual reporting requirements under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as more fully described below, and to permit more
efficient disposition of voluminous records after they have ceased to
be the subject of active use."
The Commission adopted an amendment to rule U-50 4 which,
along with companion revisions of certain rules under the Securities
Act of 1933,5 was designed to eliminate certain mechanical and administrative impediments which hindered the prompt public offering
of securities following the receipt of bids from prospective underwriters.
Offerings subject to rule U-50 are required to be acted upon by the
Commission under both statutes. Formerly, the company selling the
securities was required to obtain two sets of orders under each statute.
The first orders, in which all provisions of the registration statement
and declaration were cleared, except the price of the sale, to be determined at competitive bidding, and the successful bidders' reoffering
price to the public, were entered prior to the published invitations for
bids. The second orders, giving this information, were entered following determination of the winning bid and offering price and were
required to be obtained before the securities could be offered for sale
to the public. The rules as amended permit immediate award of the
securities to the successful bidder and public offering without the
necessity of the second set of clearance orders in all cases where two or
more bona fide bids are received unless in Ii particular case the Commission should reserve jurisdiction. In its prior experience under
rule U-50 the Commission had only on rare occasions disapproved
an award where two bids were received
Rule U-40 was amended so as to exempt the acquisitions by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries of securities of companies whose principal business is the ownership or licensing of trade
names, trade marks, and service marks used by public utilities in the
ordinary course of their business. b Previously the acquiring company
was required to obtain a specific order of approval from the Commission. This revision was adopted as a result of a petition for such
an amendment filed on December 4, 1953, pursuant to section 4 (d)
of the Administrative Procedure Act and rule XIX of the Commission's Rules of Practice,"

allocated among the associate companies in the system. It provides
in substance that the tax shall be allocated so that each company
included in the consolidated tax return for the system will bear that
percentage of the consolidated income tax which the income tax
liability of such company on a separate return basis would be to the
aggregate income tax liabilities of the individual companies based on
separate returns. Early in 1953 the Commission had occasion to
consider a specific request by a registered holding company for a
modification of the requirements of this rule. Since the issues raised
by this request appeared sufficiently broad in scope to warrant reconsideration of the rule, the Commission published a notice inviting
comments on the rule." Numerous comments and recommendations
were received from various registered holding companies and from 10
regulatory bodies.
Thereafter the Commission published a notice proposing a cbange
in the rule, the effect of wbich would have been to eliminate intercompany dividends in allocating the tax." After receiving extensive
comments from interested members of the public and holding a public
hearing on the proposal, the Commission directed its staff to make
further studies of the problem." Since the end of the fiscal year the
Commission has revised rule U-45 (b) (6) so as to permit the allocation of taxes among companies in registered holding company systems
in accordance with either of the first two methods specified in Section
1552 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, subjecb, however, to certain limitations. 10&
With minor exceptions, rule U-50 requires competitive bidding in
connection with the issuance or sale of securities by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries. During the fiscal year the
Commission instituted a study as to whether competitive bidding is
a condition which should be imposed upon the statutory exemption
afforded by section 6 (b) of the Act. On November 25, 1953 the
Commission published a notice of a proposed amendment to rule U-50
which would exempt from the competitive bidding requirements of the
rule securities issued by certain public utility subsidiaries of
registered holding companies."
Such amendment would implement
the exemption provisions of section 6 (b) of the Act which, subject
to such terms and conditions as the Commission deems appropriate in
the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers,
exempt such issues if they have been expressly authorized by a State
commission. Extensive written comments on the proposed amendCompany Act release No. 11761 (Mar. 12, 1953) â¢

ment were received from representatives of the industry, public
regulatory bodies and members of the general public, and on February
18, and March 31, 1954 public hearings were held on the proposal.
At the end of the fiscal year the Commission had not acted on the
proposal.
The employee stock option plan as a means of incentive compensation for executives and employees has been used only to a very limited
extent in the public utility industry. The Commission has not permitted a declaration in respect of any stock purchase plan or stock
option plan to become effective. In the fiscal year 1953 the Commission received from holding companies a number of requests concerning
the issuance of stock to officers or employees of a registered holding
company or any of its subsidiary companies pursuant to an employees'
stock option plan. On )'Iay 15, 1953, the then Director of the Division of Corporate Regulation, acting upon direction of the Commission, sent a letter to each registered holding company stating that the
Commission would give expeditious consideration to stock purchase
plans meeting the prescribed standards which, in effect, would have
made such plans stock option plans. On February 12, 1954, the Commission promulgated for comment a proposed new rule, Rule U-51,
which would make it possible for registered holding companies and
their subsidiaries to use employee stock option plans with appropriate
safeguards to protect the public interest and the interest of investors
and consumsrs.':' .A public hearing on the proposed rule was held on
April 8, 1954. After the close of the fiscal year, the Commission
announced that, following thorough consideration of the entire record
in the matter, it had decided not to adopt the proposed rule U-51
and it also announced withdrawal of the )'Iay 15, 1953 letter referred
to above."
The Public Utility Holding Company Act prohibits a registered
holding company or subsidiary from having as an officer or director
any officer, partner, or representative of any bank, trust company
or investment banker, except as permitted by regulations of the Commission as not adversely affecting the public interest and the interests of investors and consumers. Rule U-70, as presently in
effect, grants exemptions from this prohibition to persons whose
only financial connections are with commercial banking institutions
and small banking investment firms meeting certain described requirements. During the fiscal year the Commission published a proposal
to revise this rule so as to eliminate the numerous complex exemptions inserted from time to time over the years to meet specific

situations which are no longer of particular significance. The proposed revision would simplify the rule and give registered holding
companies and their subsidiaries some additional latitude in the
selection of directors." At the end of the fiscal year, the Commission
had not acted on the proposal.
During the year the Commission promulgated notices of proposals
to adopt statements of policies setting forth the requirements which
it considered should be met by public utility companies subject to
the regulatory provisions of the Act in their indentures securing
first mortgage bonds and in the protective provisions pertaining to
their preferred stocks In the past, the requirements imposed upon
issuers of mortgage bonds and preferred stocks have varied from time
to time and from issuer to issuer with the result that there have been
charges of unequal treatment by some issuers. The object of the
proposed statements of policies is to reduce this variation and to
provide all interested persons with information as to the standards
respecting indenture and preferred stock charter provisions which
these types of security issues will be measured against." Voluminous
comments were received from representatives of registered holding
company systems and from interested members of the public and these
are under study by the staff.
Revisions of Forms

Generally speaking, the forms prescribed for reporting to the
Commission by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries
had received little attention during the past several years, and much of
the required data was either available in other sources or no longer
essential. In other respects the reports were inadequate. The three
principal forms used by registered systems were revised during the
fiscal year by the elimination of some items, the restatement of
others and an overall attempt to simplify language. The financial
statement requirements in these forms have been strengthened, and
now conform generally to the basic accounting regulations promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Form U5S, which is the annual system report required to be filed
by registered holding companies pursuant to the requirements of the
Act, was redesigned so that a single report may now be used to satisfy
the annual reporting requirements under both the Public Utility
Holding Company Act and the Securities Exchange Act for all
associate companies in a particular holding company system." As an
example, this has enabled one registered system to reduce the number

of separate reports required to be filed by the various system companies
under both statutes from 11 to one. The revision of Form U5S
should result in a real reduction in the time required to be spent by
the Commission's staff in examining annual reports of companies
subject to both the Public Utility Holding Company Act and the
Securities Exchange Act.
Form U-13-60, which is the annual report form for mutual and
subsidiary service companies associated with registered holding
company systems, was also simplified.'? Items calling for material
contained in the system annual report on Form U5S and for detail no
longer deemed necessary were eliminated.
Form U-l, which is used for filing most applications and declarations in respect of financing, acquisitions of securities and assets and
certain other transactions regulated by the Act, was revised and
brought up to date during the fiscal year.IS One important new
requirement was that the financial statements, required to be filed
as exhibits to the form, be prepared in accordance with the Commission's Regulation S-X. The privilege of incorporation by reference of material filed under all statutes administered by the Commission, instead of only to the Holding Company Act, was part of the
revision.
Processing of Fee Applications for Services Rendered in Section 11
Reorganization Proceedings

At the beginning of the present fiscal year the Commission was
faced with a substantial backlog of applications for fees rendered in
prior Section 11 reorganizations. To facilitate handling this backlog,
a new procedure was inaugurated in December 1953 for disposing of
such applications. Under the new procedure, after fee applications
have been filed, the Commission enters an order directing the company or companies who will pay the fees to file with it a report setting
forth, in a manner so as to indicate the proposed allocations thereof
among the affected companies, the amounts of fees and expenses
which those companies have already paid or, after negotiation with
applicants, have agreed to pay, and in cases where negotiations were
unsuccessful, the amounts which such companies recommend for
payment. To avoid any possibility that its original order might be
construed as a waiver of its jurisdiction over fee agreements negotiated pursuant thereto, the Commission reserves jurisdiction therein
of its right to exercise the full power with respect to fees and expenses
which are conferred upon it by the Act.
While the company is carrying on the negotiations and preparing
the report to the Commission referred to above, the staff of the Divi17

sion of Corporate Regulation independently studies and prepares an
analysis of the fee applioa tions on file and makes a preliminary Division
recommendation to the Commission of the amounts which should be
approved as fees for each fee applicant. The Commission is then in a
position, upon receiving the company report, to compare the figures
agreed upon or recommended by the company with those independently recommended by its staff and to determine whether it can approve and direct payment of some or all of the fees agreed upon or the
fees recommended or compromise figures without a public hearing.
Although this new procedure is not adaptable to all of the fee applications pending before the Commission, the Commission has found generally that its use in appropriate cases has greatly facilitated disposition of the cases and has reduced to a minimum the necessity of holding
extensive fee hearings. Since December 1953, the new procedure has
been employed for handling fee applications related to reorganizations
of five holding company systems."
COOPERATION

WITH STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES

The Commission has continued to pursue its long established policy
of cooperating to the fullest extent with state public utility commissions and municipal regulatory bodies on all matters of mutual
interest. Aside from day-to-day contacts, most of which are informal
in nature, there were significant instances during the past fiscal year
of cooperation on the part of the Commission with state and local
authorities on public utility matters.
An underlying objective of the Act is to supplement and strengthen
local regulation of public utilities. Notices of proceedings and of
proposals to amend or adopt rules, forms and regulations under the
Act, which are considered likely to be of interest to state and local
authorities, are sent to those agencies. All matters of general interest
are circulated in this manner among the members of the National
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners.
In response to the Commission's published notice dated November
25, 1953/Â° inviting comments on the proposed amendment to rule
U-50, which would exempt from the competitive bidding requirements
of the rule securities issued by certain state regulated public utility
subsidiaries of registered holding companies, comments and recommendations were received from 41 state commissions and from the
Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia.

The proposal by Cities Service Company, a registered holding
company, to sell all of its holdings of the common stock of The Gas
Service Company to Missouri Public Service Company, discussed more
fully in a preceding section of this report, was also the occasion
for active participation by state regulatory authorities. Following
the filing with the Commission of the proposed contract between
Cities Service and Missouri Public Service, the public utility commissions of the States of Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma,
in which Gas Service operated, were notified of the pending proceedings and of the date set for the hearing and were kept fully advised of
all subsequent developments. The Missouri Public Service Commission and the Kansas State Corporation Commission appeared and were
admitted as parties in the proceedings before the Commission.
FINANCING

OF REGISTERED PUBLIC UTILITY
COMPANY SYSTEMS

HOLDING

The volume of securities sold for cash or issued in exchange for
refunding purposes by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries during the fiscal year 1954 exceeded that for the preceding
year, even though 17 companies with assets of $270 million were
removed from the jurisdiction of the Act as a result of divestments
pursuant to section 11. A major improvement in the markets for new
securities and continuance of the high rate of post-war public utility
expansion appear to be the principal contributory factors in the
past year's record.
In 1954 registered systems sold $902.9 million of securities to the
public and to institutional investors as compared with $712.2 million
in 1953. In both years this external financing accounted for 26 percent of the total volume of financing by the entire electric and gas
utility industries. The aggregate volume of security sales upon which
the Commission was required to act pursuant to sections 6 and 7 of
the Act, including both sales to the public and intra-system sales,
increased to $1,154.5 million in 1954 from the $993.2 recorded in the
previous year, despite a modest decline in security sales by subsidiaries to their holding company parents from $281.0 million in 1953
to $251.6 million in 1954.
The following table sets forth in detail for the two years the volumes
of securities of various types issued and sold by registered holding
companies and their subsidiaries under sections 6 and 7 of the Act.
Portfolio sales and issuances in connection with reorganizations
are excluded.

As indicated by the preceding table, the numbel' of issues acted
upon by the Commission in 1954 was 100 less than the number for
1953, whereas dollar volume of financing increased $161.3 million
during the past year. This reflects principally a decline in the number
of medium term note issues sold by subsidiaries to their respective
parents.
The electric and gas utility and non-utility operating companies
of registered systems sold $218 million of common stocks in 1954.21
This represents the largest volume of equity financing accomplished

interest resulting from partial divestments. While such a comparison
may be somewhat affected by differences in the methods of subsidiary
financing employed in various systems, it is significant that the total
sales of common stocks by the operating companies of registered
systems accounted for 25 percent of their security sales in 1954, while
total sales of common stocks by all other operating companies in the
electric and gas industries not subject to the Act showed a corresponding ratio of 18 percent.
The financing of registered holding companies (exclusive of holding
companies which are also operating companies) followed a much different pattern. In the fiscal year 1954 they sold $139.0 million of debt
securities and $22.5 million of common stock. They sold $119.5
million of common equity securities in 1953, $108 million in 1952
and an average of more than $80 million in each of the three fiscal
years 1949 to 1951. The amounts of common equity and debt
securities sold for new money purposes in each of the past six fiscal
years by these companies are shown in the following table.

The debt financing of $139 million by these registered holding
companies in 1954 represented almost entirely debenture issues by
holding companies in those systems whose operating subsidiaries
have no long-term debt securities in the hands of the public.
The effect of the comparatively small volume of common stock
sales by registered holding companies in 1954 was to reduce to 12.3
percent the percentage of the aggregate external financing of registered systems which was represented by common stocks. In 1953,
26 percent of the total external financing of registered systems was
accounted for by sales of common stocks.
The sharp decline in holding company common stock financing
during 1954 reflects in part the carry-over of funds derived from the
sales of unusually large amounts of holding company common stocks
in 1952 and 1953 as indicated above. Another factor in the year's
results was the financing by one large registered holding company,
The Columbia Gas System, Inc., which presented unusual problems.
That company finances all of its subsidiaries' requirements and faced

TWENTIETH

the problem of raising $130 million to finance the expansion program
of its system. Because of the usual lag in the development of earnings
power on recent property additions and the lag in the procurement of
rate revisions applied for, the company's earnings dropped to a point
where management considered it unwise to attempt to raise the needed
capital by the sale of common stock. As an alternative Columbia's
management proposed and the Commission approved the sale of $90
million of sinking fund debentures in the fiscal year 1954/2 representing 62 percent of the total external debt financing of all registered systems in that year. The debentures included $50 million
subordinated debentures convertible into common stock beginning on
January 1, 1955. This issue represented the second convertible issue
ever authorized by the Commission under section 7 of the Act (the
other having been issued in connection with reorganization under
section 11 of the Act),23and it reflected the extraordinary circumstances present in the case. Columbia sold $22 million of common
stock in 1953 and $20 million in 1952. The consolidated capitalization of the Columbia system as of June 30, 1954,reflecting both debenture issues, showed a debt ratio of 55.2 percent and a common equity
ratio of 44.8 percent.
The continued high level of financing activity by registered systems
in 1954was typical of the electric and gas utility industries as a whole.
The first six months of the fiscal year 1954 witnessed a decline of
nearly one percent in the cost of public utility bond money with a
corresponding improvement in the price structure of the common
and preferred stock markets. It is apparent that this development
acted as a potent stimulant to both financing plans and expansion
plans throughout the year. The drop in financing costs also stimulated a modest revival of refunding operations. Registered systems
sold $20 million of refunding issues in 1954 and all other electric and
gas utilities sold $291 million of securities for that purpose. The
latter total includes two bond issues aggregating $105 million sold for
the purpose of refunding two issues which had been outstanding only
about 12 months.
Plant construction expenditures by the electric and gas utility
industries for the fiscal year 1954 recorded the modest increase predicted in the 19th Annual Report. Industry estimates indicate that
construction expenditures for the next two fiscal years may
amount to approximately $3.8 billion in 1955 and approximately $3.5
billion in 1956.
The rights offering continued to dominate the common stock financing of registered systems in 1954, despite the relaxation in 1953 of the

FINANCING OF ELECTRIC GENERATING COMPANIES SUPPLYING
FACILITIES OF THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION

Two generating companies which have been organized to furnish
power to facilities of the Atomic Energy Commission are subject to
the Act because they are subsidiaries of registered holding companies.
The initial equity financing of the first of these, Electric Energy, Inc.
(EEl), was approved by the Commission on January 15, 1951.32
The purchasers of the common stock were Central Illinois Public
Service Company, 20%; Illinois Power Company, 20%; Kentucky
Utilities Company, 10%; Middle South Utilities, Inc., 10%; and
Union Electric Company of Missouri, 40%; for an aggregate consideration of $3,500,000. Of these, Middle South and Union Electric are
registered holding companies, Kentucky Utilities and Illinois Power
are exempt holding companies, and Central Illinois is an independent
operating public utility."
EEl has a 25-year contract to furnish the Atomic Energy Commission installation at Paducah, Ky., with 735,000 kw. of power. Since
1951 the Commission has approved additional equity financing of
$2,700,000,34and debt financing in the form of 25-year first-mortgage
bonds in the amounts of $100,000,000 at 3 percent, $65,000,000 at
3% percent, and $30,000,000 at 4% percent." $740,350 in fees and
expe ises for the organization and financing of EEl have been
approved."
Following a similar pattern, the Ohio Valley Electric Company
(OVEC) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Indiana-Kentucky Electric
Company, were organized to construct generating capacity for the
furnishing of 1,800,000 kw, to the Atomic Energy Commission's
plant at Portsmouth, Ohio. The initial equity financing for this
system, consisting of 200,000 common shares to be sold for an aggregate of $20,000,000, was approved by the Commission on November 7,
1952,37with the shares being purchased by the sponsors in the following

PART V
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the federal courts. The Commission's duties
under Chapter X are, at the request or with the approval of the court,
to provide the court and investors with independent expert assistance
on the various legal and financial questions that arise in the proceeding
and to prepare advisory reports on plans of reorganization. The
Commission has no right of appeal in a Chapter X proceeding, but it
may participate in appeals taken by others.
The Commission acts in a purely advisory capacity. It has no
authority either to veto or to require the adoption of a plan of reorganization or to render a decision on any other issue in the proceeding.
Its recommendations are made for the benefit of the judge and the
security holders, affording them its disinterested views in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. Generally, the Commission participates only in proceedings in which there is a substantial
public investor interest.
The Commission, due to budget considerations and the need to make
the most effective use of its reduced personnel, is engaged in a re-examination of its functions under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. In
view of the impact upon the federal courts of any curtailment of the
activities of the Commission under Chapter X, the Commission has
sought to obtain the views of the Federal Judiciary as an aid to the
Commission's study of its Chapter X activities. This problem was
presented to the Judicial Conference of the United States on September 23, 1954 and it was suggested that the Federal Judges be invited
to comment upon the functions of the Commission in Chapter X.
The Judicial Conference approved the suggestion and a questionnaire
has been sent to the Federal Judges through the Administrative Office
of the United States Courts, the results of which will be carefully
studied by the Commission.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission participated during the 1954 fiscal year in 49
proceedings involving the reorganization of 69 companies with aggregate stated assets of $553,998,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness
of $329,286,000. During the year the Commission, with court ap88

TWENTIETH

A.~AL

REPORT

89

proval, filed notices of appearances in 4 new proceedings under Chapter
X involving 6 companies with aggregate stated assets of $8,520,000
and aggregate stated indebtedness of $17,373,000. Proceedings involving 13 principal debtor corporations and 1 subsidiary debtor were
dosed during the year. At the end of the year, the Commission was
actively participating in 36 reorganization proceedings involving 55
companies with aggregate stated assets of $489,029,000and aggregate
stated indebtedness of $307,340,000.
Problems in tbe Administration of the Estate

A fundamental aim of Chapter X is to make available to the court,
the parties and the security holders full and accurate information
regarding the debtor's affairs. The independent trustee customarily
transmits to security holders a report on the history and financial
condition of the debtor, the operation of its business, and the desirability of its continuance. Such reports enable security holders to
consider suggestions for a plan of reorganization or proposed plans of
others and aid the court in considering problems before it. The
Commission has consulted through its staff with trustees in connection
with their investigations and the preparation of their reports.
The Commission generally renders assistance in connection with
the varied problems that arise in the administration of the estate.
For example, the Commission has rendered significant aid in the discovery and prosecution of causes of action against former management
or other fiduciaries who may have misused their positions of trust.
In this field of activity, the Commission had occasion to investigate
the affairs of Texas Gas Utilities Company in reorganization under
Chapter X in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The Commission's inquiry uncovered substantial
evidence of mismanagement and overreaching on the part of the
former president of the company. The trustee, using the evidence
developed by the Commission, obtained a substantial judgment from
the former president and others for the benefit of the estate of the
debtor.'
Activities with Respect to Allowances

The Commission makes specific recommendations to the courts
respecting allowances for fees and expenses. The Commission itself
receives no fees or expenses from estates in reorganization and is
primarily concerned with the fairness of the result to the parties and
the public investors.
The reorganization under Chapter X of Central States Electric Corporation was conducted in the District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia. The trustees brought an action in the District Court
I

Huff v, Duke,

et al., Unreported, W. D. Tex., 1954.

90

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE CO:MMISSION

for the Southern District of New York against former officers and
directors of the debtor and others. This action was ultimately unsuccessful 2 and certain of the defendants made an application in the
District Court in New York for allowances of expenses and attorneys'
fees pursuant to Article 6A of the New York Corporation Law which
provides for indemnification to officers and directors of litigation expenses under certain conditions. One defendant, who was not an
officer, sought such an allowance on general equitable principles. The
District Court granted awards to all the applicants," and the trustees
appealed. On the appeal, the Commission, as amicus curiae, urged
that the state indemnification statute should not have been held applicable to a debtor in a Chapter X proceeding, pointing out among
other things that the awards contemplated by the state statutes were
inconsistent with the purpose of Chapter X to insure prosecution of
all causes of action in favor of the estate. The Commission urged
that in any event awards made for legal services and expenses in
connection with an action on behalf of the debtor's estate were within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court in Virginia, where the
reorganization proceeding was pending. The Court of Appeals agreed
that the reorganization court "had the sole power to determine and
measure the rights of the defendants to reimbursement," 4 Accordingly, the Circuit Court for the Second Circuit reversed the order
granting awards.
In another significant appeal involving allowances, in it case where
the Commission was an active participant from the outset, the District
Judge had granted overall allowances substantially in excess of the
Commission's recommendations, although the allowances to certain
creditors' representatives were less than the amounts recommended
by the Commission. The Commission supported an appeal by the
creditors' representatives.
The Court of Appeals agreed that the
overall fees awarded were too high in view of the size of the estate and
the work involved. It pointed out among other things that the record
showed that thousands of hours of the trustees' work was without
commensurate accomplishment or benefit to the estate. The Court
also agreed that creditors' representatives who had been responsible
for increasing the size of the estate and had performed other valuable
services should be awarded more than the District Judge had granted
them. The Court of Appeals revised the allowances in substantial
conformity with the Commission's recommendations."

Consummation of Plan

The Commission examines the corporate charters, by-laws, trust
indentures, and other instruments which are to govern the internal
structure of the reorganized debtor, and in general strives to assure
investors the inclusion of protective features and safeguards which its
experience has shown to be desirable. Another matter with which the
Commission has been concerned in connection with the consummation
of plans of reorganization is the problem of unexchanged securities.
Chapter X provides that a period of not less than five years following
the final decree may be fixed by the judge within which security holders
may make the exchange called for by the plan, after which they are
barred from any participation. The Commission has been anxious to
assure that all security holders obtain the new securities or cash
distributable to them under the plan of reorganization. Accordingly,
it has endeavored to see that adequate notice and publicity is given of
the bar date, that a professional search is made where possible, and
that the bar date is extended when appropriate.
In the reorganization of Chicago, .Aurora &: Elgin Railroad Company,
the plan provided that holders of the outstanding bonds of the company would upon' surrender of their bonds on or before January 15,
1954, receive in exchange therefor shares of common stock of the
successor companies. In December 1953, the Commission learned
that the exchange agent was holding 55,732shares of stock and $18,370
in accrued dividends for bondholders of the debtor. The Commission
petitioned for an order extending the date for exchanging the outstanding bonds and directing the exchange agent to publish a notice
of the new bar date and to mail written notices to holders of the
unexchanged bonds. The District Court granted the Commission's
request and as a result of the notices given by the exchange agent,
some 33,000 shares were claimed by and delivered to their owners.
In this, as in several other cases, the extension of time granted by the
court proved efficacious in reducing the number of security holders
who failed to make the exchange.

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as
specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which
meets the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with
the Oommission. The Act operates by requiring that indentures to
be qualified include specified provisions which provide means by which
the rights of holders of securities issued under such indentures may be
protected and enforced. These provisions relate primarily to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee
so as to provide reasonable financial responsibility and to minimize
conflicting interests. The Act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all liability of the indenture trustee, and imposes on the trustee, after default, the duty to use the same degree
of care and skill as a prudent man would use in the conduct of his
own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act,
and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must
be contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities
issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and securities
issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority
which, although exempted from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the Trust
Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

ADl\IINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT
ACT OF 1940

COMPANY

The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of companies engaged primarily in the business of
investing, reinvesting, and trading in securities. The Act requires,
among other things, disclosure of the finances and investment policies
of these companies. prohibits such companies from changing the nature
of their business or their investment policies without the approval of
their stockholders, regulates the means of custody of the companies'
assets, prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from
constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies,
requires management contracts to be submitted to security holders
for their approval, prohibits transactions between such companies
and their officers, directors and affiliates except with the approval of
the Commission, and regulates the issuance of senior securities. The
Act requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves
adequate to meet maturity payments upon their certificates.
COMPANIES

REGISTERED

UNDER

THE ACT

As of June 30, 1954, 384 investment companies were registered
under the Act, and it is estimated that on that date the aggregate
value of their assets was approximately $8,700,000,000. This represents an increase of approximately $1,700,000,000over the corresponding total at the beginning of the 1954 fiscal year. During the latest
period for which data are available, the 12 months ended March 31,
1954, about 219 registered open-end management and closed-end
management investment companies reported to the Commission
sales to the public of approximately $673,000,000 of their securities
and redemptions and retirements of approximately $267,000,000
leaving a net investment by the public in such companies of approximately $406,000,000, compared with a corresponding net investment
for the preceding 12-month period of approximately $545,000,000.
Investment companies registered at the end of the 1954 fiscal year

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
TYPES OF NEW INVESTMENT

COMPANIES

REGISTERED

During the 1954 fiscal year 20 new investment companies were
registered under the Act, of which 8 were open-end management
companies (which redeem their shares on presentation by the shareholder) and 10 were of the closed-end management type (in which the
shareholder does not have a redemption privilege). Two companies
of the unit type were also registered. During the year registration
was terminated with respect to 5 management companies of which 1
was open-end and 4 were closed-end.
Among the open-end management investment companies which
registered during the year one was a company incorporated in Canada
which secured authority to register in accordance with the Commission's policies regarding Canadian investment companies described
below. Another open-end company had a stated investment policy
emphasizing investments in securities of corporations with substantial
interests in California. Of the closed-end companies which registered during the year, three were industrial companies which had
disposed of their business assets and invested the proceeds in securities,
one was organized to provide a medium for the investment of American
funds in Israel, and one was an employees' securities company. The
two unit investment companies registered during the year were
organized for the purpose of operating periodic payment plans for the
purchase of securities of open-end investment companies.
REGISTRATION

OF CANADIAN INVESTMENT

COMPANIES

Under the terms of the Act, an investment company not incorporated within the United States may publicly offer its own securities in
the United States only by special authorization of the Commission,
where the Commission has found that "by reason of special circumstances or arrangements, it is both legally and practically feasible
effectively to enforce the provisions of" the Act with respect to such
company. At the beginning of the fiscal year, several applications
were pending upon behalf of investment companies incorporated
under the laws of Canada seeking authority to register under the Act
and to sell their securities in this country. Pursuant to Commission
direction, our staff held extended discussions with representatives of
the Canadian companies which had applied for registration and formulated conditions and arrangements designed to facilitate registration
by these companies, with adequate protection for the interests of
investors comparable to that afforded investors in American companies.

TWENTIETH

A....~J\lJAL REPORT

95

In order to establish definitive standards for all registrations by
Canadian companies, the Commission, after public notice and opportunity for comment by interested persons, adopted rule N-7D-l
under the Investment Company Act, which prescribes the conditions
and arrangements to be entered into by a management investment
company organized under the laws of Canada prior to the issuance of
an order under Section 7 (d) of the Act permitting the company to
register under the Act and to make an offering of its securities in the
United States. The rule is applicable only to Canadian management
investment companies, and the Commission announced that any conditions and arrangements proposed by investment companies organized under the laws of other foreign countries would be considered by
the Commission on a case-by-case basis in the light of the statutory
standards.
Rule K-7D-l provides, among other things, that in order to implement the statutory means of enforcement of the Investment Company
Act and to assure its effectiveness, the charter and by-laws of the
Canadian company must contain the substantive provisions of the
Act, so that the company in effect agrees that the provisions of the
Act may be enforced as a matter of contract right by shareholders
either in the United States or Canada. Under the rule, a majority
of the officers and directors are required to be citizens of the United
States, and all of such officers and directors must agree to comply
with the Act and consent to the enforcement of such agreements in a
similar manner. In order to effectuate the statutory objectives, the
rule also requires that the company maintain its assets in the United
States, and agree that in the event of noncompliance by the company
or its officers and directors with their agreements or the Commission's
order permitting registration, proceedings for liquidation and distribution of assets may be instituted. The rule also imposes duties and
obligations upon certain affiliated persons of Canadian investment
companies. It is the Commission's view that in substance the rule
will accord protection to investors equal to, although not necessarily
identical with, the protection afforded by the Investment Company
Act to investors in domestic companies.
Contemporaneously with the adoption of rule N-7D-l, the Commission issued two orders granting pending applications for registration of Canadian companies where the applicants had agreed to the
various undertakings prescribed by the rule. Shortly after the close
of the fiscal year, the Commission granted four more applications for
registration by Canadian companies. Each applicant undertook to
comply with all of the requirements of the new rule. As of September
1, 1954, four of the registered Canadian companies had made public

In keeping with the Commission's policy of encouraging the free
operation of business management consistent with the protection
of investors, in processing applications under the Investment Company Act, the endeavor is made so far as possible to resolve any
problems on an informal basis, by discussion and correspondence rather
than by formal hearing procedures. By the use of such techniques
it has been practicable to dispose of most applications without the
necessity of formal hearings. 1

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS
ACT OF 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires registration of
persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising others
with respect to securities. The Commission is empowered to deny
registration to or revoke the registration of any investment adviser
who, after notice and opportunity for hearing, is found by the Commission to have been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct
arising out of securities transactions or to have made false statements in his application for registration. The Act makes it unlawful
for investment advisers to engage in acts and practices which would
constitute fraud or deceit, requires investment advisers to disclose
the nature of their interest in transactions executed for their clients,
and prohibits profit-sharing arrangements and assignments of
investment advisory contracts without the client's consent.

LITIGATION

UNDER THE INVESTMENT

ADVISERS ACT OF 1940

During the fiscal year 1954 the Commission filed a complaint to
enjoin Ralph H. Seipel, a registered Investment adviser doing business
as Investors Surety Company, from further violations of Sections
206 (1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.3 The complaint charged the defendant with falsely representing, among other
things, that Investors Surety Company absolutely guaranteed against
loss in the stock market, that it was the only organization in the
world providing professional trading services for investments and at
the same time maintaining cash reserves to protect against any
possible loss, that it never handled either cash or securities belonging to
its many customers, that it was composed of professional traders in
securities listed on the N ew York Stock Exchange and had been such
for over 25 years, and that it maintained branch officesin the principal
cities and had a foreign exchange department to convert foreign
currency into dollars.

RELATED ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION
COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

At the beginning of the 1954 fiscal year there were pending in the
courts 13 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted by
the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices in
the sale of securities. During the year 19 additional proceedings were
instituted and 16 cases were disposed of, leaving 16 of such proceedings
pending at the end of the year. In addition the Commission participated in a large number of reorganization cases under Chapter X of
the Bankruptcy Act, in 9 proceedings in the district courts under
section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act; and in 10
miscellaneous actions, usually as amicus curiae, to advise the court of
its views regarding the construction of provisions of statutes administered by the Commission which were involved in private lawsuits.
The Commission also participated in 36 appeals. Of these, 10 came
before the courts on petitions for reviews of administrative orders; 10
arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the Commission had
taken an active part; 2 were appeals in actions brought by or against
the Commission; 8 were appeals from orders entered pursuant to
section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act; and 6 were
appeals in cases in which the Commission appeared as amicus curiae.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State Court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year, are
contained in the appendix tables.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during the
year are discussed in the sections of this report relating to the statutes
under which the litigation arose.
Criminal

Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General, who may
institute criminal proceedings. The Commission, largely through its
regional offices, investigates suspected violations and, in cases where
the facts appear to warrant criminal prosecution, prepares detailed
reports which after careful review by the General Counsel's office and
consideration by the Commission, are forwarded to the Attorney
General. Commission employees familiar with the case often assist
100

Al\TNUAL REPORT

101

the United States attorneys in its presentation to the grand jury, the
conduct of the trial, and the preparation of briefs on appeal. The
Commission also submits parole reports prepared by its investigators
relating to convicted offenders. Where an investigation discloses
violations of statutes other than those administered by the Commission, the Commission advises the appropriate federal or state agency.
Indictments were returned against 2,245 defendants in 525 cases
developed by the Commission prior to June 30, 1954.1 These figures
include 61 defendants in 20 cases in which indictments were returned
during the past fiscal year. At the close of the fiscal year, of the 481
cases disposed of as to one or more defendants, convictions had been
obtained in 418/ or 87 percent, against a total of 1,196 defendants.
Convictions were obtained against 25 defendants in 15 cases during
the past fiscal year." In addition, two defendants in two cases were
convicted of criminal contempt for violation of injunctive decrees
previously entered against them.'
In the single appellate case decided during the fiscal year judgments
of conviction were affirmed as to all 7 defendants who appealed. At
the close of the fiscal year 7 cases involving 8 defendants were pending
on appeal.
As in prior years, the criminal cases developed and prosecuted
during the fiscal year covered a wide variety of fraudulent activities.
They included fraud relating to mining and oil and gas ventures, the
operation of purported investment plans, the promotion of inventions
and new businesses and the manipulation of securities on a national
securities exchange, as well as fraudulent practices on the part of
securities brokers and dealers and their representatives. In a number
of fraud cases, the defendants were also charged with wilfully violating
the registration provisions of the Securities Act.
Convictions for the fraudulent sale of securities in connection with
oil and gas ventures were obtained in U. S. v. Hamilton (D. Mont.),
U. S. v. Vasen (N. D. TIl.), U. S. v. Frank (W. D. Okla.) and in U. S.
v. Henderson (W. D. Tenn.)." Henderson previously had been convicted on the same charge, violating the Mail Fraud Statute in connection with the sale of fractional undivided interests in oil and gas
rights, but the conviction was reversed upon appeal because of certain
trial errors.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In the Vasen case, which involved a well that reached a depth of
20,450 feet, stated to be the second deepest well in existence, it was
charged that as part of a scheme to defraud, the defendant made
false representations such as that the well was going through an
"Atlantic Ocean of oil," that geologists believed that the producing
formation extended completely across the State of Mississippi and
possibly up to Pennsylvania, and that the oil sands encountered
assured production of thousands of barrels of oil per day. Vasen was
sentenced to a prison term of 5 years to be followed by 5 years probation, and a fine of $25,000 was imposed. The Frank case included
charges of misrepresentation concerning a so-called "magnetic logger"
device which was held out to investors as assuring 100 percent accuracy in the location of oil pools. Frank was sentenced to a term of 18
months imprisonment. In the Hamilton case the defendant was
charged with making false representations with respect to his holdings
and his plans to drill for oil and gas. He falsely stated the monies
received from investors would be used to drill an oil well. Hamilton
was placed on probation for 5 years but the imposition of the sentence
was suspended on condition that full restitution was made to all
investors within a period of 1 year. In the Henderson case the defendant was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment and fined $1,000.
Convictions for the fraudulent selling of securities in mining ventures were obtained in U. S. v. Kendall (W. D. Tex.), U. S. v, Wickham et al. (D. Nev.), U. S. v. Oottrelle (D. Mont.) and U. S. v. Swift
(N. D. Calif.). The misrepresentations followed a common pattern.
The defendants claimed that the mines involved had high grade ore
which was being currently produced when in fact they were barren.
Cottrelle had been a fugitive for 10 years, the indictment against him
having been returned in 1943. He returned voluntarily from Canada
and was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment and a $2,000 fine. Swift
was charged with causing false and misleading statements regarding
a new "ore shute" which were published and caused the stock to rise
on the exchange on which it was listed. Swift was fined $5,000. The
defendants in the other cases were sentenced to terms varying from 2
to 3 years imprisonment.
The promotion of spurious inventions and new businesses continued, during the past fiscal year, to be the subject of abuses in the
sale of securities. In U. S. v. Owens et al. (S. D. Fla.) the defendants
set up dummy corporations and obtained money from their victims
by a variety of misrepresentations and false promises. In U. S. v.
Ross (S. D. Ala.) the indictment charged that the defendant made
false representations concerning the establishment and financing of a
tung oil plant through money obtained from investors and funds purportedly available from the defendant and the Reconstruction Finance

Corporation. However, the indictment charged, the defendant converted the money to his own use. In U. S. v. Klein (~. D. Ill.) the
defendant was charged with falsely representing that he was in a
position to purchase a sizable small loan company in Pennsylvania at
a price less than its actual worth and that the investors would receive
an annual return of 10 percent pending completion of the transaction
and 15 percent thereafter. Actually, the indictment charged, Klein
appropriated and converted a large part of the money to his own use.
Another finance company was involved in U. S. v. Palmer (D. Colo.).
There it was charged that defendant, in the sale of stock of the finance
company, falsely represented that the investors were insured by an
agency of the Federal government, that the company was audited
every 3 months by the State of Colorado, and that the company paid
6 percent dividends regardless of profit or loss. The case of U. S. v.
Oox (D. N. Mex.) involved the sale of securities by means of false
representations concerning the alleged returns which investors would
receive upon the purchase of an interest in a dry ice plant. In U. S.
v. Estep (N. D. Tex.) the defendant sold interests in a company manufacturing an alleged fuel-less self-energizing power unit and a machine
which would keep people alive forever. The defendants in these
various cases received sentences of up to 5 years in prison.
In U. S. v. Martin (D. N. Mex.) the defendant was convicted of
falsely representing to his customers that he had executed their orders
to buy securities, that he was holding securities purchased and paid
for by them, and that payments made to them represented dividends
which Martin had received on the stock he was holding for them. In
fact, the indictment charged, Martin had not executed customers'
orders but instead had appropriated and converted to his own use the
securities and money he obtained from them. The defendant was
sentenced to probation for two years and the sentence was suspended.
Following an extensive investigation by the Commission, indictments were returned against 13 individual and 2 corporate defendants
in the United States District Court at Detroit, Mich., charging
them with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act,
the mail fraud statute, and the broker-dealer registration provisions
of the Securities Exchange Act, in connection with a stock sale promotion conducted by long distance telephone and the mails from Montreal, Canada, which allegedly resulted in the defrauding of a large number of investors residing in some 40 States and the District of Columbia,
of over $300,000.6 It is charged in the indictments that defendants
used over 200 false and fraudulent representations relating to alleged
"rights" which investors had as shareholders to purchase additional shares at prices below the current market price, the purâ¢

ported market and market price for such securities, alleged discoveries
and developments which had taken place on properties owned by the
corporations, the listing of the securities involved on various Canadian
exchanges, guaranteed profits investors were supposed to make, and
numerous other similar matters. A conspiracy indictment was also
returned in connection with this "boiler room" operation against these
15 defendants and 1 other. One of the defendants was also indicted
for perjury committed during the investigation. Nine of the individual defendants who were in the United States have been arraigned.
COMPLAINTS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically
authorizes it to conduct investigations of possible violations. These
investigations are conducted primarily by the regional offices under
the general administrative supervision of the principal office.
Investigations by the Commission are classified as preliminary or
docketed. Preliminary investigations are initiated when information is received indicating a possible violation of one of the Acts and
are usually conducted informally by telephone inquiries, interviews
and a limited amount of correspondence. Frequently this limited
investigation will disclose that no violation has taken place or that
through a misunderstanding or ignorance of the law one of the statutes has been inadvertently violated. When an inadvertent violation has taken place, the investigation serves the purpose of informing
the violator and brings about a compliance with the law before any
serious damage or loss results to the investing public. However,
should a preliminary investigation reveal the likelihood of substantial violations or widespread public interest, a docketed investigation file is opened and a full-scale investigation undertaken.
The Commission by the various statutes it administers is authorized to issue subpoenas and administer oaths, and to delegate this
power to staff members. In a particular case, an officer designated
by the Commission may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance
of witnesses to testify under oath and may also require the production of books, records and other documents for examination. The
subpoena power is used only in specific instances and only after it
appears that the necessary evidence cannot be otherwise obtained.
This delegation of power by the Commission is made through the
issuance of an order limited to the persons designated therein as
officers and to the purposes of the particular investigation. During
the fiscal year, 36 such orders were issued.
After the investigation is completed, the regional office prepares
a report with the Regional Administrator's recommendation for the

TWENTIETH

A~l\UAL

REPORT

institution of appropriate action or for closing the investigation.
In all instances, these reports are first reviewed by the staff of the
principal officeand subsequently, if the situation warrants, presented
to the Commission for consideration. "Where appropriate, further
steps may be taken such as civil proceedings to enjoin violations,
reference of evidence to the Attorney General, where it appears that
criminal prosecution is warranted, or administrative proceedings
with respect to registered securities, broker-dealers and investment
advisers.
During the fiscal year, the Commission expanded the area of cooperation with state securities authorities by authorizing Regional
Administrators to refer to local authorities evidence obtained in
informal investigations indicating violations of state statutes. The.
object of this procedure is to turn over to the states those cases in
which it appears there is a clear violation of state law and the Regional
Administrator has reason to believe that the state authorities will
take appropriate action. It is believed that this program will afford
the public greater protection since the enforcement activities of the
Commission can be concentrated on those cases which cannot be
effectively handled by the states. The Commission also co-operates
with other Federal authorities by making available evidence of
violation of other Federal statutes.

VIOLATIONS

The Commission maintains a Section of Securities Violations for
assistance in the enforcement of the various statutes which it administers and to provide a further means of preventing fraud in the
purchase and sale of securities. This Section has developed files
which serve as a clearing house of information concerning persons who
have been charged with violations of various Federal and state
securities statutes. The specialized information in these files has
been kept current through the co-operation of the United States Post
Office Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and

106

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

probation officials, state securities commissions, Federal and state
prosecuting attorneys, police officers, Better Business Bureaus, and
members of the United States Chamber of Commerce. By the end
of the 1954 fiscal year, these records contained data concerning 59,625
persons against whom Federal or state action had been taken in connection with Securities Violations.
During the past year, additional items of information relating to
3,785 persons were added to the records of this Section, including information concerning 1,414 persons not previously identified therein.
Extensive use is made of this clearing house of information. During
the past year, the Section of Securities Violations received 2,937
letters or reports and sent 1,577 communications to co-operating
agencies .

â¢ ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION

IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The considerable quantity and variety of financial statements filed
with the Commission pursuant to the various statutes give rise to
many questions pertaining to accounting practices and procedures.
It has been the consistent policy of the Commission to insist that such
financial statements clearly and unequivocally present to the users
thereof, particularly investors and prospective investors, dependable
data upon which to make their financial decisions. To this end, accounting rules and regulations and changes therein considered necessary to obtain compliance with the applicable statutes are adopted
by the Commission after extensive study and research by the Office
of the Chief Accountant.
Such study and research usually involve correspondence and/or
consultations with persons and groups having an interest in the contemplated action, including among others the American Accounting
Association, American Institute of Accountants, Controllers Institute
of America, National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, economists, attorneys, investment advisers and analysts,
corporate officials, and other Federal agencies. Where the desirability therefor is indicated, public hearings are held.
The Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for
companies subject to the provisions of the Holding Company Act/ has
adopted rules under the Securities Exchange Act governing accounting and auditing of securities brokers and dealers, and has promulgated rules containing in a single, comprehensive regulation, known as
Regulation S-X,8 which govern the form and content of financial
statements filed in compliance with the various Acts. These regula, Uniform System of Accounts for Mutual Service Companies and subsunarv Service Companies (effective August I, 1936);Uniform Systems of Accounts for Public Utility Holdmg Oompanies (effective Jannar}' 1,1937; amended effective January I, 1943).
8 Adopted February 21,1940 (Aeeountmg Series Release No. 12); revised December 20,1950 (Accounting
Series Release No. 70).

tions are implemented by the Accounting Series releases, of which 77
have been issued, designed to make public from time to time opinions
on accounting principles for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in major accounting
questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for the
uniform systems of accounts, prescribed the accounting to be followed
only in certain basic respects. In the large area not covered by such
rules, the Commission's principal reliance for the protection of investors is on the determination and application of accounting principles
and standards which are recognized as sound and which have obtained
general acceptance. Most financial statements filed with the Commission are required to be certified by independent public accountants
or certified public accountants.
The 19th Annual Report of the Commission contained a statement
of the circumstances leading up to the adoption, during the current
fiscal year, of Rule 3-20 (d) of Regulation S-X, which sets forth the
disclosure required with respect to all stock option arrangements in
financial statements filed with the Commission."
Because of the divergence of views as to the appropriate manner
of accounting for so-called emergency facilities in financial statements
filed with the Commission, the Commission adopted the policy of
accepting financial statements wherein the portion of the cost of
properties covered by certificates of necessity is amortized over the
five-year statutory period as well as statements wherein the cost of
such facilities is depreciated over the probable useful life of the facilities but which give recognition to the resulting reduction in income
tax benefit after the close of the amortization period. Pursuant to
this policy, registrants in filing statements on either basis make adequate disclosures as to the method followed and the effect which
would have been produced if the alternative method had bepn
followed.
The Commission again had occasion during the fiscal year to
consider the problem raised by departures from cost in the handling
of depreciation, and denied a formal application to adopt a requirement that economic depreciation (based on replacement at current
prices) be reflected either in the accounts or by other appropriate
disclosures.
During the year, several problems arose in respect to foreign issuers
of securities. Foreign standards of accounting and financial reporting
differ in many respects from American standards, and vary from
country to country. In the few, but sizable, filings during the year
by foreign issuers, there have been reflected some departures from
what are considered by American standards to be generally accepted
accounting procedures. In each such instance comprehensive dis'Accountmg

closure of the circumstances and the effects upon the financial statements has been required.
During the fiscal year, the Commission disposed of a proceeding
under Rule II (e) of its Rules of Practice against certifying accountants
alleged to have failed to observe appropriate audit requirements as to
financial statements of a broker-dealer filed pursuant to the requirements of rule X-17 A-5 adopted under Section 17 (a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. After examining the record in the proceeding,
the Commission was of the opinion that while more thorough auditing
procedures might have resulted in the discovery of certain fictitious
commodity transactions, the record did not disclose a lack of integrity
or improper professional conduct within the meaning of Rule 11 (e),
and accordingly the proceedings against the accountants were dismissed. The Commission, in taking this action, noted that no
member of the public suffered any loss as a result of the transactions
involved."
OPINIONS

OF THE CO~E\IISSION

Findings and opinions are issued by the Commission in all cases
where the matter to be der-ided, whether substantive or procedural,
is of sufficient importance to warrant a formal expression of views.
The Office of Opinion Writing, a staff office which is directly responsible to the Commission, aids the Commission in the preparation of
findings and opinions in contested and other cases arising under
statutes administered by it. In accordance with the provisions of the
Administrative Procedure Act requiring a separation between quasiprosecutory functions and quasi-judicial functions, the personnel of
the Office of Opinion vVritmg is entirely independent of the divisions
engaged in the investigation and prosecution of cases. In some cases,
the interested operating division, with the consent of all parties,
participates in the drafting of opinions. During the fiscal year the
Commission issued findings and opinions in 81 matters. This figure
does not include numerous orders which, although of a dispositive
nature, were not accompanied by detailed findings Ora formal opinion.
With minor exceptions, all findings, opinions and orders are publicly
released and constitute a source of information for the bar and other
interested persons.
INTERNATIONAL

FINANCIAL

AND ECONOMIC

MATTERS

During the fiscal year registration statements covering $591,571,960
of securities issued by foreign issuers, government and private, were
effectively registered under the Securities Act. Of this amount
$95,430,960 represented offerings by Canadian private issuers, including one Canadian investment company, and $137,866,000 represented

offerings by Provinces and cities of Canada. Of the balance,
$354,000,000 represented Israeli offerings, including $350,000,000 by
the State of Israel and $4,000,000 by two private issuers. The total
was completed by a $4,275,000 offering of a Dutch private issuer.
The Commission acted as one of the hosts of missions from Germanv
and Mexico which came to the United States under the auspices of th-e
Foreign Operations Administration to make a study of the organizations, institutions, methods and regulations of the capital markets in
this country.
In September 1953 the Validation Board for German Dollar Bonds,
a joint German and American Board established in this country under
an Agreement dated February 27, 195:3 between the United States
Government and the Federal Republic of Germany, began registration
of West German dollar bonds for validation. There are 92 issues of
such bonds subject to validation, which is required by legislation
enacted by the German Government and is a necessary step before a
bondholder may participate in a settlement which may be offered
pursuant to the London Debt Agreement After the establishment of
validation procedures the Commission adopted rule X-15C2-3, governing the conditions under which W'est German securities could
again be traded in the "['niLed States markets, such trading having
been suspended since December 8, 1941.11 At the same time the Commission withdrew its request that brokers and dealers refrain from
effecting transactions in 'Vest German securities to the extent that
such trading is not prohibited under the provisions of rule X-15C2-3.
The preparation and adoption of this rule and the proposed re-entry
of the West German dollar bond issues into the markets of the United
States presented many problems which required frequent consultations between members of the Commission's staff, the Department of
State and the Validation Board for German Dollar Bonds. Many of
these problems will continue as settlement offers to American bondholders are forthcoming under the London Debt Agreement.
In connection with the resumption of trading in this country in
West German dollar bonds the Commission has been concerned with
obtaining recent information about the various issuers of these securities and had taken initial steps in November 1952 by requesting the
cooperation of the West German Government in securing such information. Information about the Federal Republic of Germany was
furnished in a circular dated October 6, 1953 relating to an exchange
offer made by that government to the holders of two classes of its old
dollar bonds and old dollar bonds of the Free State of Prussia and the
Conversion Office for German Foreign Debts. Since information
about other West German issuers had not been furnished, the Commission in November 1953, after consultation with the Department

of State, sent direct requests to 63 issuers of German dollar obligations,
including the issuers of the 92 bond issues subject to validation, and
again requested the assistance of the Government of the Federal
Republic in securing this information. As a result of these efforts,
37 German issuers have sent to the Commission copies of their published annual reports (in the German language), which are available
for public inspection at the Commission's Washington office,and where
sufficient copies have been received, are also available for public inspection at the Commission's regional offices in N ew York, Chicago
and San Francisco.
During the fiscal year the Department of State and the Commission
continued discussions of the proposed treaty relating to the validation
of Austrian dollar bonds. During this period the Commission publicly renewed its request that the securities industry refrain from
trading in Austrian securities until further notice after the establishment of validation procedures. In June 1954 the Commission,
after consultation with the Department of State, sent direct requests
to seven Austrian issuers of dollar bonds that they furnish information
which would be helpful to the American holders of such bonds. In
response to these requests, three Austrian issuers have sent the
Commission copies of their recent annual reports.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced that during the fiscal year it raised more portfolio capital
for international investment, and from investors in more countries,
than in any earlier period. It offered two issues of United States
bonds, two issues of Swiss franc bonds and one issue of Canadian
dollar bonds. In the distribution of these issues of bonds, the Bank
made available a prospectus giving information about the Bank's
structure and operation. It also filed with the Commission, pursuant
to Regulation BW adopted by the Commission under the amendment
to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, information comparable to
that which would be required if its securities had been registered
under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.
CONFIDENTIAL

The Commission is empowered under various of the Acts administered by it to grant upon application confidential treatment with respect to certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed
to the public in applications, reports, or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. In the exercise of such authority, under the
Securities Act, it has adopted ruIe 485 providing that information as
to material contracts, or portions thereof, filed as a part of a registration statement will be held confidential where it determines that
disclosure would impair the value of the contracts and is 'lot necessary

STATISTICS

A~D SPECIAL STliDIES

During the past fiscal year the Commission maintained its statistical series relating to the capital market, savings and investment.
These data which are used by the Congress, other Government agencies, investment and financial institutions are also made available to
the general public in the Commission's monthly Statistical Bulletin
or in press releases. The various series are described below.
CAPITAL MARKETS
All New Securities Offerings

A monthly series on new securities offerings, including corporate
and non-corporate securities, is published in the Statistical Bulletin
of the Commission. In addition, a quarterly series covering COl'POrate issues is published in press release form and contains an analysis
of the data.
The statistics show the volume and character of all new securities
offered for cash in the United States and differ in concept and coverage
from the statistics of registrations shown in other parts of this report.
The offerings series includes only securities actually offered for cash
sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers. The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues privately
placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration under the
Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and railroad securities.
The statistics on new offerings are given in tables 3 through 5 of the
appendix.
326394--55--9

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

New corporate securities offered for cash sale in the fiscal year
ended June 1954 amounted to $8.5 billion, comparing with $9.3
billion in the preceding fiscal year, which was the highest since 1929.
Proceeds from new issues to be used for new plant and equipment
expenditures totalled $5.6 billion, only $200 million less than in the
1953 fiscal year, reflecting a continuation at near-record levels of the
large-scale capital expansion of corporations. Funds raised in the
capital market for working capital purposes totalled $1.6 billion,
$400 million lower than in the preceding year. The balance of net
proceeds from new issues, amounting to $1.1 billion, was to be used
for repayment of outstanding securities, bank loans and other purposes. Issues of electric, gas and water companies were of considerable importance in the past fiscal year, aggregating $3.6 billion, and
accounting for 34 percent of all issues. Issues of manufacturing
companies, in contrast, amounted to only $1.8 billion, or 21 percent of
total issues, as compared to the preceding year when such issues
amounted to $3.2 billion and comprised 34 percent of all issues. The
distribution of issues among other industry groups for the current
year was as follows: financial and real estate (excluding investment
companies), 12 percent; communication, 11 percent; mining, 4 percent;
commercial and other, 4 percent; railroad, 3 percent; and other
transportation, 3 percent.
Of total corporate securities issued in the 1954 fiscal period, 63
percent were publicly offered and 37 percent privately placed. Pri-.
vate placements. which amounted to $3.1 billion, were $700 million
lower than in the 1953 period, primarily because of the smaller
volume of financing by manufacturing companies. Statistics on
private placements of corporate issues, classified by type of security
and industry of issuer, appear in appendix table 3, part 4, while comparisons of the volumes of public and private offerings are given in
appendix table 5.
Statistics on non-corporate securities sold for cash are also included
in appendix table 3. During the fiscal year ended June 1954, noncorporate flotations included $12.5 billion of U. S. Government securities, $6.7 billion of state and local issues, $200 million of Federal agency
securities and $400 million of foreign government and other issues.
Issues Registered

under

Securities

Act of 1933

Statistics of all securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933
are published in the Statistical Bulletin at quarterly intervals. Statistics covering data on the number and volume of registrations during
the past twenty years and more detailed information for the months
of the fiscal year 1954 are given in appendix tables 1 and 2.

Outstanding

Beginning this year quarterly figures on the flow of cash through
securities transactions between corporations and investors have been
published in the Statistical Bulletin. Previously, they had been compiled for internal use within the government. The data comprise the
only series in this field and are used in preparing estimates of saving in
the form of securities, in analysis of sources and uses of corporate
funds, moneyflows analysis, and estimates of changes in private debt.
A description of the scope and limitations of the series appears in the
Statistical Bulletin.
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1954, proceeds from new corporate
securities, net of retirements, amounted to $6.7 billion. This was a
billion dollars less than in the preceding fiscal year and reflected a
lower volume of new issues and a higher amount of repayments.
Retirements of securities in the fiscal year totaled $3.2 billion, $400
million more than in the preceding year chiefly due to an increase in
refunding activity in the final quarter of the period.
Investment

Companies

From 1942 through the first quarter of 1954 data were published
quarterly in the Statistical Bulletin for over 200 management investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940. The statistics included purchases and sales of their own securities, portfolio changes, and aggregates of securities investments and
assets, segregated by open-end and closed-end types. These statistics
were discontinued after the first quarter of 1954 due to the fact that
automatic quarterly reports from investment companies are no longer
required under the Commission's regulations, and also because similar
data are prepared by the National Association of Investment Companies. Net sales of these companies amounted to approximately
$400 million during the fiscal year ended June 1954.
STOCK MARKETS

Statistics are regularly compiled and published in the Statistical
Bulletin on the market value and volume of sales on registered and
exempted securities exchanges, round-lot stock transactions on the
New York exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, oddlot stock transactions on the N ew York exchanges, special offerings
and secondary distributions.
The indexes of stock market prices were continued during the 1954
fiscal year. These indexes are based upon the weekly closing market
prices of 265 common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
and are composed of seven major industry groups, 29 subordinate
groups, and a composite group. These data are published in the
Statistical Bulletin and are also released weekly. Figures on round-lot

114

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and odd-lot stock transactions are also included in the weekly releaseon stock market indexes.
SAVING STUDY

Estimates of the volume and composition of individuals' saving in
the United States are compiled and released at quarterly intervals.
The study shows the aggregate value of saving in each quarter and the
form in which the saving occurred, such as investment in securities,
expansion of bank deposits, increase in insurance and pension reserves,
etc.
A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the personal
saving estimates of the Department of Commerce (derived in connection with its national income series) is published annually in the
National Income Supplement of the Survey of Current Business.
The methods used in deriving the Commission's estimates of individuals' saving, together with a description of sources of data were
published recently.
The rate of individuals' saving in liquid form during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1954 was maintained at a high level, amounting to
$15.0 billion, and comparing with $15.5 billion in the 1953 fiscal year.
Individuals invested $4.2 billion in securities, added $8.2 billion to
their equity in insurance and Government pension reserves, such as
Social Security funds, increased their currency and bank deposits by
$5.4 billion, and increased their shareholdings in savings and loan
associations by $4.0 billion. During the same period, individuals
increased their mortgage debt by $6.5 billion and other consumer debt
by $300 million.
FINANCIAL
Working

POSITION

OF CORPORATIONS

Capital

Data are prepared and released at quarterly intervals on the working capital position of all United States corporations, excluding banks
and insurance companies. These releases show the principal components of current assets and liabilities and an abbreviated analysis
of the sources and uses of corporate funds. At the end of June 1954,
corporate net working capital position was estimated at an all-time
high of $94.1 billion, comparing with a previous peak at the end of
September 1953 of $93.3 billion. The data are used in measuring the
liquid position of corporations and the figures indicate that there has
been little change in liquidity since mid-1951, as measured by theratio of cash and government securities to current liabilities. At the
end of June 1954 this ratio stood at 54 percent. The highest point
of corporate liquidity was reached in 1949 when the ratio was 71
percent.

REPORT

Balance Sheet and Income Statements

A quarterly financial report for all United States manufacturing
concerns is prepared jointly by the Commission and the Federal Trade
Commission. This report, an outgrowth of the working capital
series, gives complete balance sheet data and an abbreviated income
account for all manufacturing companies. Data are classified by
industry and size of company.
PLA.~T AND EQUIPMENT EXPENDITURES OF U. S. BUSINESS

The Commission and the Department of Commerce jointly compile
and release, at quarterly intervals, data on the plant and equipment
expenditures of U. S. business. The series is used as an index of
future business activity and production, as well as capital market
activity. At the close of each quarter, actual capital expenditures for
that quarter are presented, and in addition, anticipated expenditures
for the next two quarters are given. A survey is also made at the
beginning of each year of the expansion plans of business during the
coming year.
During the fiscal year ended June 1954 expenditures for plant and
equipment by American concerns amounted to a record $27.9 billion,
exceeding the previous record figure in the 1953 fiscal year by $800
million. The higher total for the current fiscal year resulted from
peak expenditures during the closing months of 1953; in the first six
months of 1954 (the second half of the 1954 fiscal year) expenditures
were approximately two percent less than in the similar months of the
1953 fiscal year. According to plans at mid-1954, expenditures for
the full calendar year 1954will be about 6 percent less than in calendar
year 1953, and are expected to aggregate $26.7 billion, with most of
the decline attributed to lower expenditures of manufacturing and
railroad companies.

found unnecessary being abolished. Some of the organizational and
operating changes effected by the Commission in fiscal 1954 are
indicated below.
The position of Foreign Economic Adviser was abolished. Such
of his functions as are required by statute are now performed by the
Commission's regular divisions.
The Commission's Cleveland Regional Officebecame a branch office
of the Commission's Chicago Regional Office. Several positions,
including that of a Regional Administrator, were abolished.
The Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation was reorganized into four operating branches in lieu of the former five branches.
The Commission's Division of Trading and Exchanges was reorganized, two branches replacing the former four Branches. Thishas reduced the number of supervisory personnel, consolidated the
enforcement and interpretative activities of the Division in one
branch and concentrated in the second branch other activities such
as financial analysis, exchange registration and regulation, and stabilization. In addition, certain market surveillance work has been
transferred to the N ew York Regional Office. A number of positions,
including two Assistant Directorships were abolished.
