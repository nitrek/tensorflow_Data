listed as New York, New York with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink

2013. On August 19, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation
Finance to Gold Hills Mining Ltd. requesting compliance with its periodic filing
obligations, and Gold Hills Mining Ltd. received the delinquency letter on August 21,
2015, but failed to cure its delinquencies.

30, 2013. On August 18, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of
Corporation Finance to Medisafe 1 Technologies Corp. requesting compliance with its
periodic filing obligations, but Medisafe 1 Technologies Corp. did not receive the
delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of

place of business listed as Totowa, New Jersey with stock quoted on OTC Link under the

June 30, 2013. On August 19, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of
Corporation Finance to MDU Communications International, Inc. requesting compliance
with its periodic filing obligations, but MDU Communications International, Inc. did not
receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the
Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17 CFR
232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of

Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed companies is suspended for the
