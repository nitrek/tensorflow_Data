ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) instituted this proceeding with
an Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (Exchange Act), on June 23, 2016, and the hearing was scheduled to commence on July
18, 2016. The OIP alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has
repeatedly failed to file required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement is seeking to
revoke the registration of Respondents’ securities.
The OIP provides that each Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the
OIP on it. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). A Respondent that fails to file an Answer
within the time provided will be deemed to be in default, and the undersigned will enter an order
revoking the registration of its securities. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). To
allow time for service of the OIP1 and for Answers, the hearing will be postponed sine die, and a
prehearing conference will be held by telephone on August 26, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. EDT, if the
proceeding has not been resolved by then.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

Service of the OIP was not accomplished as to Elevate, Inc., and Logic Devices, Incorporated,
as the mailings to those entities were not “addressed to the most recent address shown on the
entity’s most recent filing with the Commission.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). The mailing to
Elevate was addressed to zip code 92763 and the mailing to Logic Devices was addressed to
Genvena Drive, but their most recent filings show zip code 92673 for Elevate and Geneva Drive
for Logic Devices.
