In the Matter of
ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
HUDSON CAPITAL PARTNERS CORPORATION

On January 13, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. A hearing is currently scheduled to begin on February 16, 2016.
On February 4, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a motion to convert the
hearing to a telephonic prehearing conference.
Based on the Division’s motion and
accompanying exhibit, it appears that a copy of the OIP was delivered by U.S. Postal Service
certified mail to the New York Secretary of State on January 19, 2016. But the Division
provides no explanation why this method of service was appropriate and no evidence of
Respondent’s status as a New York corporation. Even assuming that the New York Secretary of
State is an “agent authorized by . . . law” to receive such service under Rule of Practice
141(a)(2)(ii), the Division does not explain why service by mail (rather than by personal service)
on the Secretary of State is sufficient. 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii); see N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law
§ 306 (McKinney) (“Service of process on the secretary of state as agent of a domestic or
authorized foreign corporation shall be made by personally delivering to and leaving with the
secretary of state . . . duplicate copies of such process . . . .”). Therefore, the Division has not
established that service of the OIP has been made on Respondent in accordance with Rule of
Practice 141(a)(2)(ii).
By February 12, 2016, the Division shall file a declaration that addresses whether service
has been properly made or reattempted.
Additionally, I POSTPONE the hearing currently scheduled for February 16, 2016.
