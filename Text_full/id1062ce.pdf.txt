INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT

APPEARANCE:

David S. Frye for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Cameron Elliot, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registrations of the registered securities of Respondents
due to their failures to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On August 10, 2016, the Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP alleges that
Respondents each have a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g) and are delinquent in their periodic filings. Respondents were
served with the OIP by August 15, 2016, and their answers were due by August 29, 2016.
Ameralink, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4135, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3364 (ALJ Sept. 8,
2016). Following Respondents’ failures to timely file answers, I ordered them to show cause by
September 19, 2016, why the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default
due to their failures to file answers or otherwise defend this proceeding. Id. To date,
Respondents have failed to file answers, respond to the show cause order, or otherwise defend
this proceeding.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondents are in default for failing to file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of
Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.
Ameralink, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1133266, is a defaulted Nevada
corporation located in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended March 31, 2014, which reported a net loss of $6,437 for the prior three months.
As of August 5, 2016, the company’s common stock was not publicly quoted or traded.
Basin Industries, Inc., CIK No. 813309, is a suspended Oklahoma corporation located in
Gulfport, Mississippi, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended June 30, 1992, which reported a net loss of $115,924 for the prior six months. As of
August 5, 2016, the company’s common stock was not publicly quoted or traded.
Claire Coast Corporation, CIK No. 1342053, is a revoked Nevada corporation located in
Boca Raton, Florida, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended June 30, 2010, which reported a net loss of $43,181 for the period from the
company’s inception on September 1, 2005, through June 30, 2010. As of August 5, 2016, the
company’s common stock was not publicly quoted or traded.
Clinicorp, Inc. (n/k/a Trident Medical Concepts, Inc.), CIK No. 881808, is a void
Delaware corporation located in West Palm Beach, Florida, with a class of securities registered
with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its
periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form
10-Q for the period ended February 29, 1996. On November 18, 1998, Clinicorp filed a Chapter
11 petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida, which was
converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding on January 14, 1999, and was closed on May 24, 2005. As
of August 5, 2016, the company’s common stock was not publicly quoted or traded.
In addition to their repeated failures to timely file periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failures to maintain
valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive
such letters.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file
annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R.
§§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be
subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act
Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. See SEC v. McNulty, 137
F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978).
Respondents failed to timely file periodic reports. As a result, Respondents violated Exchange
Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
its registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because they violate a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file
periodic reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009
SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports
due over a two-year period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC
LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an
eighteen-month period considered recurrent). Respondents are also culpable because they failed
to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance or, through their
failures to maintain valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission
rules, did not receive such letters. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800,
2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted
even without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally,
Respondents have not answered the OIP or otherwise participated in the proceeding to address
3

whether they have made any efforts to remedy their past violations, and have made no assurances
against further violations.
Considering these delinquencies, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registrations of each class of Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrations of each class of registered securities of Respondents Ameralink, Inc., Basin
Industries, Inc., Claire Coast Corporation, and Clinicorp, Inc. (n/k/a Trident Medical Concepts,
Inc.), are hereby REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party
may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,
pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is
filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
Also pursuant to Rule 360, this initial decision will not become final until the Commission
enters an order of finality. 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(d). The Commission will enter an order of finality
unless a party files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the
Commission determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision as to a party. Id. If any
of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party. Id.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
