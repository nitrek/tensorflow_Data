DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS

6.
As discussed in more detail above, all of the Respondents are delinquent in their
periodic filings with the Commission, have repeatedly failed to meet their obligations to file
timely periodic reports, and failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of
Corporation Finance requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through
their failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission
rules, did not receive such letters.
7.
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers
of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports, even if the registration is voluntary under Section
12(g). Specifically, Exchange Act Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports, and
Exchange Act Rule 13a-13 requires issuers to file quarterly reports.

Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings

A.
Whether the allegations contained in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford the Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
and,
B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of each class of securities
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of the Respondents identified in Section II
hereof, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate
names of any Respondents.

the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and
before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110

If Respondents fail to file the directed Answers, or fail to appear at a hearing after being
duly notified, the Respondents, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3,
