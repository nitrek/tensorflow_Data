In the Matter of

NOTICE OF PROPOSED
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
AND OPPORTUNITY
FOR COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans,
17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the
Commission a proposed plan (“Plan”) for the distribution of monies placed into a Fair
Fund established in the above-captioned matter.
On November 20, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Making Findings and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 8A
of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(b), 21B, and 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Order”) as to Respondents Gregg C. Lorenzo
(“Lorenzo”) and Charles Vista, LLC (“Charles Vista”) (collectively, “Respondents”)
(Securities Act Rel. No. 9480 (November 20, 2013)). The Order found that
Respondents made fraudulent misrepresentations to several customers of Charles
Vista, a broker-dealer controlled by Lorenzo, to induce them to invest in convertible
debentures issued by a start-up waste management company, Waste2Energy
Holdings, Inc. (“W2E”). The Order further found that Charles Vista had a
considerable financial interest in the debentures offering and was the exclusive
placement agent for the issuance of 12% W2E debentures. The debentures were
convertible to W2E stock, which is a penny stock. Additionally, the Order found that
W2E’s financial situation was precarious and W2E’s securities were extremely
speculative because, among other reasons, the company had millions of dollars of
debt that was senior to the debt W2E was issuing through the debentures offering.
Finally, the Order found that after Respondents knowingly or recklessly made
fraudulent misrepresentations to several Charles Vista customers, these customers
invested in W2E debentures.
In the Order, Lorenzo and Charles Vista were jointly ordered to pay disgorgement
of $130,000 and prejudgment interest of $20,000. In addition, Lorenzo was ordered to
pay a civil penalty of $375,000 and Charles Vista was ordered to pay a civil penalty of
$4,350,000. In accordance with the Order, Lorenzo has paid $130,000 in

disgorgement, $20,000 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $375,000.
Charles Vista has not made any payments to date. Pursuant to the Order, a Fair Fund
was created under Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.
The Fair Fund is comprised of the disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties paid
and to be paid by Respondents for distribution to affected customers of Charles Vista
who suffered harm by virtue of the Respondents’ fraudulent misrepresentations
(collectively, “Eligible Customers”).

THE DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Fair Fund is comprised of the disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and
civil penalties paid and to be paid by the Respondents. The “Net Fair Fund” is the
Fair Fund, less any reserve for federal, state, or local taxes, fees or other expenses of
administering the Plan. To date, Lorenzo has paid $130,000 in disgorgement, $20,000
in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $375,000. Charles Vista has not made
any payments to date. Any outstanding payments received after approval of the Plan
will be added to the Fair Fund and distributed in accordance with the Plan. The Plan
proposes to distribute the Fair Fund to affected customers of Charles Vista who
suffered harm by virtue of the conduct described in the Order and as calculated per
the methodology set forth in the Plan.
The Plan provides for Eligible Customers to receive monies from the Fair
Fund that represents their proportionate share of the Net Fair Fund. The Eligible
Customers will not be required to make claims or submit documentation to establish
their eligibility. The Plan provides that on the basis of information obtained by the
Commission staff through review and analysis of applicable records, the Fund
2

Administrator will identify the Eligible Customers. Within sixty (60) days of the
Commission’s approval of the Plan, the Fund Administrator will send each Eligible
Customer a notice regarding the Commission’s approval of the Plan and, including as
appropriate, a statement characterizing the distribution, a link to the Plan posted on
the Commission’s website and instructions for requesting a copy of the Plan, a Harm
Amount 1 calculation and a preliminary calculation of the Eligible Customer’s
distribution check amount (i.e., Fair Fund Payment), a description of the tax
information reporting and other related tax matters, the procedure for the distribution
as set forth in the Plan, and the name of the Fund Administrator to contact with
questions regarding the distribution (the “Plan Notice”). The Fund Administrator will
coordinate with the appointed Tax Administrator to request information from each
Eligible Customer that is needed to accomplish the distribution in accordance with
applicable tax requirements relating to the Fair Fund.
The Plan also provides procedures for Eligible Customers to dispute the
amounts received. Disputes will be limited to calculations of an Eligible Customers’
Harm Amount. Should an Eligible Customer wish to dispute the amount received, an
Eligible Customer must submit a written communication to the Fund Administrator.
The Fund Administrator must receive the written communication detailing the dispute
along with any supporting documentation within thirty (30) days of the date that an
Eligible Customer’s disbursement is made. The Fund Administrator will investigate
the dispute, and such investigation will include a review of the written dispute as well
as any supporting documentation. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written
dispute, the Fund Administrator will notify the Eligible Customer of her resolution of
the dispute, which shall be final.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
