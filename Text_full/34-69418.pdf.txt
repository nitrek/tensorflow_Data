In the Matter of

ORDER GRANTING
EXTENSTION OF TIME
TO SUBMIT PROPOSED
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time,
until June 10, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) in the abovecaptioned matter, under Rule 1101(a) of the Commission Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans.
On June 6, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”)
entered an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings
Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 15(b)(4) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”).
(Securities Act Rel. No. 9329, June 6, 2012). The Order required OppenheimerFunds,
Inc. to pay $9,879,706 in disgorgement, $1,487,190 in prejudgment interest, and
$24,000,000 in civil penalty into a Fair Fund and required the appointment of a Fund

Administrator to develop and administer the Plan in accordance with the Commission
Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
On March 14, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Appointing Fund
Administrator and Approving Fund Administrator Bond (Exchange Act Rel. No.
69138, March 14, 2013). After discussions with the Fund Administrator, the Division
has determined that additional time is needed to submit the proposed Plan.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
Division’s request for an extension of time until June 10, 2013 to submit a proposed
Plan is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
