MEMORANDUM
TO:

Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee (EMSAC)

FROM:

EMSAC Regulation NMS Subcommittee

DATE:

April 19, 2016

SUBJECT:

Framework for Potential Access Fee Pilot

_________________________________________________________________________________
Purpose
To both construct a framework and generate data for a pilot program to reduce the access fee cap
(and corresponding liquidity rebates), and measure the commensurate impact on both market
quality and marketplace behavior. Specifically:
• Measuring the impact of lower access fees on liquidly provisioning - bid/ask spreads,
market depth, order routing behaviors, ratio of hidden liquidity vs. displayed liquidity on
the exchanges, quoting behavior, average time before getting a fill
• Measuring the impact of lower access fees on liquidity taking - ratio of on vs. off
exchange trading, order routing behaviors, price impact, slippage/realized spread, trade
volume

Justification for Why a Pilot Should be Conducted
• “Maker-taker” is one of the more debated aspects of current market structure. The
Regulation NMS adopting release acknowledged that “[p]erhaps more than any other
single issue, the proposed limitation on access fees splintered the commenters.” 1
• Regulation NMS Rule 610 limited the fees that any trading center can charge (or can
allow to be charged) for accessing its protected quotations to no more than $0.003 per
share. 2
• Given the complex ecosystem of our marketplace, definitive conclusions on access fee
modifications are difficult to draw without an actual implementation. In addition, market
characteristics, such as effective spreads, have declined since the cap was set.
• Limited experiments, such as the recent Nasdaq pilot, have shown that individual market
experiments do not yield conclusive results about the potential impact of market-wide
policy reform on access fees.
• The access fee cap of $0.003 effectively sets a ceiling for rebates. In the nine years since
the cap went into effect, there are and have been multiple exchange pricing models along
the spectrum up to the access fee cap, including inverted exchanges where rebates are
paid to those accessing quotes. However, the largest exchanges in terms of volume are
those that charge access fees at or near the cap and, hence, pay the highest rebates to
attract displayed liquidity.
• A pilot would study, and hopefully help to answer, the following questions:
o The relationship among access fees, liquidity provision and market quality;

o The relationship between access fees, rebates, and order routing practices;
o The potential impact of access fee dynamics on the price discovery process.
Significant Aspects of the Pilot
1. Access fee caps (dispersed to be able to draw meaningful conclusions) in several pilot
buckets encompassing all quotations covered under SEC Rule 610(c):
a. Bucket 1 - Control bucket
b. Bucket 2 - $.0020 access fee cap
c. Bucket 3 - $.0010 access fee cap
d. Bucket 4 - $.0002 access fee cap
i. The subcommittee intentionally selected $.0002 as the rate in Bucket 4 in
order to create a bucket where any rebate should result in a de minimis
economic incentive.
ii. The subcommittee also discussed, but could not reach consensus on, two
alternatives for this bucket: (a) prohibiting rebates (in addition to applying
the access fee cap); and (b) applying the access fee cap to inverted venues.
1. Given that this is also an area of significant industry debate, we
would encourage the SEC to consider including these specific
questions as part of the public comment process (should the pilot
be proposed).
2. The subcommittee would additionally advocate that if rebates are
prohibited within Bucket 4, the $.0002 cap could be increased to
$.0005 in order to provide additional pricing flexibility to
compensate for the loss of rebates.
3. Payment for order flow is not meant to be explicitly covered by
this provision.
4. If the pilot does not prohibit rebates and/or does not apply to
inverted venues, then we would suggest additional monitoring to
ensure that marketplace behavior does not evolve in a way that
potentially negates the output of the pilot, e.g.:
a. Monitoring for material order flow migration to inverted
venues (or ATSs – see Point 2. below);
b. Potentially institute a moratorium on new inverted pricing
schemes.
2. While Rule 610 does not apply to nondisplayed liquidity on Exchanges, and current
industry fee schedules do not distinguish between displayed and nondisplayed liquidity,
the subcommittee is concerned that the lower access fee caps could create a (new)
incentive for higher rebates on nondisplayed Exchange liquidity. As such, we think the
pilot should institute the same access fee caps for both displayed and nondisplayed
Exchange liquidity.
a. Similarly, while the subcommittee is sensitive to not inadvertently creating an
unlevel playing field for exchanges vs. ATSs by capping access fees on
exchanges, we are also sensitive to the fact that applying Rule 610(c) to ATSs for
the first time may present a significant regulatory obstacle.

i. However, assuming a proposal moves forward, we would encourage the
SEC to specifically ask through the public comment process whether the
access fee limits should additionally apply to ATSs.
3. One- to two-year pilot program (long enough to eliminate potential gaming)
4. Random sample of [x] stocks with a market capitalization >$3 billion.
a. Access fees are more meaningful in larger-capitalization stocks; in addition this
level will limit overlap with the “tick pilot” that is currently in development.
5. We may want to build in specific criteria to terminate the program early should there be
significant deterioration in any of the measurement criteria.
a. For further exploration
Measurement criteria:
• Quoted Spreads
• Effective Spreads (potentially Realized Spreads also)
• Displayed liquidity – changes at the inside, depth at 3, 5, 10 cents beyond the NBBO
• Volatility – stock-level changes; number of price changes at the NBBO
• Hidden liquidity – off-exchange market share; mid-point exchange executions and
exchange dark liquidity
• Changes in trading volume
• Behavioral routing changes as evidenced by:
o Market share shifts among trading venues
o On- vs. off-exchange trading levels
o TRF vs. internalization levels
• Changes in the levels of Price improvement in the marketplace
• Percentage of time market locked/crossed
• Slippage and price impact
• Significant behavioral changes in pricing from ATSs and/or Exchange reserve quantities
Other Considerations
• Trade-At - we understand that some industry participants will push that an access fee
pilot should include a “trade-at” provision. However we do not agree for the following
reasons:
o The access fee pilot is being proposed to determine, in part, if a trade-at provision
is needed. Many in the market believe that a motivation for ATS activity (not
wholesaler activity) is economic, i.e., take fees are too high.
o The purpose of this pilot is to generate data to see the impact on market quality
when the cap is changed. It is the subcommittee's opinion that, while many issues
are intertwined, trade-at would address a different market structure issue. In
addition, the likely shift of flows as a result of trade-at would both make the pilot
more complex and impact effective measurement of the access fee change.
o We believe an access fee pilot is relatively simple to implement and conduct, and
should be kept that way without introducing significant additional complications.
o The tick pilot will yield some trade-at results that can be further studied; thus
duplication is not warranted.

Retail
o We are sensitive to unintended negative consequences on retail investors;
therefore we recommend including the ability to stop the pilot should any
significant unexpected impacts occur.
Disclosure
o Our understanding is that there is an SEC work-stream being undertaken
regarding disclosure and routing. If timing of this potentially precedes the pilot, it
would be helpful to understand the nature of such disclosure changes and whether
there could be significant interactions with the access pilot that would affect
behavior and therefore, need to be reflected in the design of the access fee pilot.
o Additional avenues for potential disclosure by market centers would include: (1)
the priority of their matching engines for the interaction of display, reserve,
midpoint, penny increment and sub-penny increment discretionary orders and
hidden orders; (2) reserve replenishment – operationally how do they do it – i.e.
do they check the quote for 610(d) prior to re-display?

Open Items
• Selection of the optimal number of pilot stocks (and ETFs) and the possible use of
stratified random sampling based on characteristics such as market cap, share price, and
trading volume
• We believe no special considerations arise with respect to Options markets, but this
warrants further consideration and confirmation.
