INITIAL DECISION MAKING FINDINGS
AND REVOKING REGISTRATION
BY DEFAULT
May 10, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of Respondent
Numida, Inc.1 The revocation is based on Respondent’s repeated failure to file required periodic
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I. BACKGROUND
The Commission initiated this proceeding on April 6, 2016, with an Order Instituting
Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).
The OIP alleges that Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and that it has repeatedly failed to file
with the Commission annual and quarterly reports in compliance with the Exchange Act. The OIP
provides that Respondent’s Answer to the OIP is due within ten days of service of the OIP on it. See
OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). It was served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. §
201.141(a)(2)(ii) on April 12, 2016.2 It did not file an Answer and was ordered to show cause why
it should not be deemed to be in default and the registration of its securities revoked. Expleo Sols.,
Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3810, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1531 (A.L.J. Apr. 26, 2015). To

Expleo Solutions, Inc., remains in the proceeding. Its Form 15 Certification and Notice of
Termination of Registration, which was filed on April 12, 2016, will become effective 90 days after
that date.

Respondent was served with the OIP by USPS Express Mail attempted delivery at “the most
recent address shown on [its] most recent filing with the Commission.” 17 C.F.R. §
201.141(a)(2)(ii).

date, it has neither filed an Answer to the OIP nor responded to the order to show cause. Thus,
Respondent has failed to answer or otherwise to defend the proceeding within the meaning of 17
C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2). Accordingly, Respondent is in default, and the undersigned finds that the
allegations in the OIP are true as to it. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f). Official notice
has been taken of the Commission’s public official records concerning Respondent, pursuant to 17
C.F.R. § 201.323.
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
Numida, Inc. (CIK No. 1257498),3 is a void Delaware corporation located in Lincoln,
Nebraska, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). Numida, Inc., is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not
filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB4 for the period ended June 30, 2004, which
reported a net loss of $1,750 from the company’s July 22, 2003, inception through June 30, 2004.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
By failing to file required annual and quarterly reports, Respondent violated Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
IV. SANCTION
Revocation of the registration of the registered securities of Respondent will serve the public
interest and the protection of investors, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act. Revocation
will help ensure that the corporate shell is not later put to an illicit use involving publicly traded
securities manipulated to the detriment of market participants. Further, revocation accords with
Commission sanction considerations set forth in Gateway International Holdings, Inc., Exchange
Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006) (citing Steadman v.
SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1139-40 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981)), and with
the sanctions imposed in similar cases in which corporations violated Exchange Act Section 13(a)
by failing to file required annual and quarterly reports. See Cobalis Corp., Exchange Act Release

in use. See Smaller Reporting Company Regulatory Relief and Simplification, 73 Fed. Reg. 934

egregious, and deprived the investing public of current and accurate financial information on which
to make informed decisions.
Failure to file periodic reports violates a crucial provision of the Exchange Act. The
purpose of the periodic reporting requirements is to publicly disclose current, accurate financial
information about an issuer so that investors may make informed decisions:
The reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is the primary
tool which Congress has fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent,
careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the sale of stock and securities.
Congress has extended the reporting requirements even to companies which are
“relatively unknown and insubstantial.”

2004). The Commission has warned that “many publicly traded companies that fail to file on a
timely basis are ‘shell companies’ and, as such, attractive vehicles for fraudulent stock manipulation
schemes.” e-Smart Techs., Inc., 2004 SEC LEXIS 2361, at *9 n.14.
