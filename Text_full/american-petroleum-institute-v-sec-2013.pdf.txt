The ruling under review
On August 22, 2012, the Commission adopted the rule that petitioners

challenge here in Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers,
Securities Exchange Act Release 34-67717, which was published in the Federal
Register at 77 FR 56,365 (Sept. 12, 2012).

Related cases
Petitioners have filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of

Columbia relating to the same claims. See Am. Petroleum Inst. v. SEC, No. 121668 (D.D.C. filed Oct. 10, 2012). That case is stayed pending a determination by
this Court as to whether it possesses original jurisdiction over this petition for

A.

B.

Exchange Act Section 13(q) requires issuers to disclose
payments made to foreign governments for the commercial
development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. ........................................ 5
1.

The “resource curse” and the potential transparency
remedy .........................................................................................6

2.

The Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative was
established in 2002 as a voluntary disclosure regime to
address the resource curse. .......................................................... 8

3.

Congress concluded after several years of experience
with EITI’s voluntary regime that a mandatory
disclosure requirement was necessary. .....................................10

4.

In contrast to EITI, Section 13(q) requires mandatory
public disclosure of detailed information about
resource extraction payments to governments. .........................12

5.

In enacting Section 13(q), Congress established “a
new international standard” for mandatory public
disclosure of payment information. ..........................................15

The rulemaking process ......................................................................16

1.

The Commission afforded members of the public
an extensive opportunity to provide comments,
including data and economic analysis. .....................................16

2.

The Commission declined to make certain changes
that several industry commentators sought in the
final rules because those changes were not
consistent with either Section 13(q)’s text or
transparency goals. ....................................................................17

3.

a.

The Commission determined that Section 13(q)
requires public disclosure of each issuer’s
individual payment information. ....................................17

b.

To afford issuers flexibility in applying
the statutory term “project” to different business
contexts, the Commission agreed with a major
industry association and did not adopt a rule
defining the term. ............................................................19

c.

The Commission determined that exempting
issuers from mandatory disclosure if such
disclosure is prohibited by a host country’s
laws would be inconsistent with Section 13(q). ............. 20

The Commission considered the economic
effects of Section 13(q) and Rule 13q-1,
including the potential costs and benefits. ................................21
a.

The Commission qualitatively assessed the
costs and benefits of Section 13(q) and
Rule 13q-1. .....................................................................22

Based on the data available to it, the
Commission undertook a quantitative
assessment of the potential direct compliance
costs and potential losses that extraction issuers
may experience if a host country’s laws bar
payment disclosure. ........................................................22

c.

The Commission explained that the disclosure
requirement’s potential benefits from enhanced
governmental accountability in host countries
and other potential benefits could not be
quantified. .......................................................................23

BRIEF OF RESPONDENT
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
________________________________________________
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
In July 2010, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress adopted a bi-partisan
amendment that establishes “a new international transparency standard” 1 for

1

156 Cong. Rec. S3817 (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Dodd).

“public disclosure” 2 of payments to governments for the commercial development
of oil, natural gas, or minerals. Codified as Section 13(q) of the Exchange Act, 15
U.S.C. § 78m(q), this provision directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to
issue final rules that require each resource extraction issuer to include detailed
payment information in an annual report.
A principal Congressional objective underlying Section 13(q) is to “help
empower citizens to hold their governments to account for the decisions made by
their governments in the management of valuable oil, gas, and mineral resources
and revenues.”3 To this end, Congress intended for Section 13(q)’s mandatory
disclosures to complement existing voluntary transparency efforts that “too many
countries and too many companies” either had not joined or would not. 4 As a
principal Congressional sponsor explained, the United States “cannot force foreign
governments to treat their citizens as we would hope, but this amendment would
make it much more difficult” for these governments “to hide the truth.” 5
On August 22, 2012, the Commission promulgated Rule 13q-1, 17 C.F.R. §
240.13q-1, and an amendment to Form SD to implement Section 13(q)’s

mandatory public disclosure requirement. See Disclosure of Payments by
Resource Extraction Issuers, Release No. 34-67717, August 22, 2012, published at
77 FR 56,365 (September 12, 2012). Petitioners, ultimately unhappy with
Congress’s determination to compel the public disclosure of the payment
information, now advance a series of meritless challenges.
Contrary to petitioners’ argument that the Commission acted arbitrarily and
capriciously by promulgating a rule without first determining whether Congress’s
sought-after transparency and accountability benefits would in fact materialize, the
Commission rightly declined to second-guess the wisdom of Congress’s policy
determination. Moreover, in conducting its economic analysis, the Commission—
which was generally dependent on industry commentators for empirical data—
acted appropriately when it used the little data that they provided to quantitatively
assess (and generally confirm) their claims about the potential costs of Rule 13q-1.
Further, the Commission properly rejected several proposals that petitioners
advanced to weaken the mandatory disclosure requirement. In each instance, the
Commission offered a reasoned basis for why it was not adopting the proposed
change. For example, the Commission rejected petitioners’ suggestion that they be
permitted to submit the required payment information confidentially, with the
Commission then aggregating all of the issuers’ information together on a “per
country basis,” explaining that Section 13(q)’s text, structure, and purpose
3

demonstrate that Congress intended for public disclosure of each issuer’s
individual information.
Lacking meritorious APA arguments, petitioners attempt an eleventh-hour
shift in strategy: they argue for the first time that the rule and the statute
mandating it violate the First Amendment—an unprecedented attack on a
disclosure requirement involving purely factual, non-ideological information that
does not implicate any significant First Amendment interests. Tellingly,
petitioners ignore both that regulated entities are subject to innumerable
comparable federal, state, and local public reporting requirements and that their
novel theory could have wide-ranging and potentially devastating implications for
these important government programs.
JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT
Section 25(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78y(a), which authorizes court
of appeals review of “orders,” gives this Court, rather than a district court,
jurisdiction over this petition for review. See Inv. Co. Inst. v. Bd. of Governors of

1.

Did the Commission satisfy this Court’s requirement that it consider

as best it can Rule 13q-1’s potential economic effects by quantifying potential
costs where possible and otherwise qualitatively assessing the potential effects;
4

analyzing and considering commentators’ cost estimates; and identifying and
discussing uncertainties or limitations underlying the estimates of benefits and
costs?
2.

Did the Commission act reasonably when it declined to adopt three

rule modifications suggested by petitioners where the Commission either (i)
explained that the proposed alternative was inconsistent with Section 13(q) or (ii)
advanced reasoned policy considerations for rejecting the proposal?
3.

Have petitioners waived their First Amendment challenge to Rule

13q-1 because neither they nor any other commentator raised it during the
rulemaking? In any event, are the required factual, non-ideological disclosures
“compelled speech” in violation of the First Amendment?

COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE
A.

Exchange Act Section 13(q) requires issuers to disclose payments
made to foreign governments for the commercial development of
oil, natural gas, or minerals.

In July 2010, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress enacted new
Exchange Act Section 13(q), also known as the Cardin-Lugar Amendment.
Section 13(q) is primarily an effort by Congress to “help empower[] citizens” of
5

resource-rich countries through increased transparency “to hold their governments
to account for the decisions involving the management of valuable oil, gas, and
mineral resources and revenues.”6 156 Cong. Rec. S3816 (May 17, 2010) (Sen.
Lugar). Specifically, it imposes a new mandatory disclosure requirement on
resource extraction issuers with respect to payments they make to governments for
the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals.
1.

The “resource curse” and the potential transparency
remedy

As the legislative history makes clear, Section 13(q) was specifically crafted
by Congress in an effort to address the “resource curse,” the phenomenon whereby
“oil, gas reserves, and minerals frequently can be a bane, not a blessing, for poor
countries, leading to corruption, wasteful spending, military adventurism, and
instability. Too often, oil money intended for a nation’s poor ends up lining the
pockets of the rich or is squandered on showcase projects instead of productive
investments.” Id. at S3816 (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Lugar). See also id. at S3976
(May 19, 2010) (Sen. Feingold) (“In far too many countries, natural resource
wealth has fueled corruption and conflict rather than growth and development.”).
The result is that many of the world’s “most wealthy mineral countries are the
6

The legislative history also indicates that Congress intended for the Section
13(q) disclosures to serve as an informational tool for investors. In adopting Rule
13q-1, the Commission acknowledged that some investors may find the disclosures
beneficial. 77 FR 56,397/3, 56,398/2-3, 56,399/1.
6

poorest countries” in terms of their citizens’ quality of life. Id. at S5872 (July 15,
2010) (Sen. Cardin). A contributing factor in many of these countries is that
“governance and accountability systems are rudimentary, at best,” and “corruption,
secrecy and a lack of transparency regarding public finance are pervasive.” Id. at
S3817 (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Dodd).
The resource curse in poor countries also has detrimental effects on the
United States. For example, it “exacerbates global poverty which can be a seedbed
for terrorism, it empowers autocrats and dictators, and it can crimp world
petroleum supplies by breeding instability.” Id. at S3816 (May 17, 2010) (Sen.
Lugar).
Although there is “no simple cure for the resource curse,” in recent years
there has been an increased focus on the role that improved payment transparency
may play in helping to combat it. STAFF OF S. COMM. ON FOREIGN RELATIONS,
110TH CONG., THE PETROLEUM AND POVERTY PARADOX, at 11, 12 (Oct. 2008)
(hereinafter “SENATE RESOURCE CURSE REPORT”).7 “By giving the citizens the
information about how payments are made to their country, they have a much
better chance to hold their government officials accountable.” 156 Cong. Rec.

7

Section 13(q) “builds on the findings” of this report, which among other
things includes case studies of countries suffering from the resource curse. 156
Cong. Rec. S3816 (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Lugar); id. at S3817 (May 17, 2010) (Sen.
Dodd). The full 125-page report is available at: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/

S5872 (July 15, 2010) (Sen. Cardin). This may in turn help them “ensure that their
country’s natural resource wealth is used wisely for the benefit of the entire nation
and for future generations.” Id. at S5873 (July 15, 2010) (Sen. Cardin). See also
77 FR 56,366/1 (“A primary goal of such transparency is to help empower citizens
of those resource-rich countries to hold their governments accountable for the
wealth generated by those resources.”).
Further, to the extent that increased transparency helps combat the resource
curse, this may “benefit Americans at home.” 156 Cong. Rec. S3816 (May 17,
2010) (Sen. Lugar). Improved governance “will improve investment climates for
our companies abroad, it will increase the reliability of commodity supplies upon
which businesses and people in the United States rely, and it will promote greater
energy security.” Id. (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Lugar).
2.

The Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative was
established in 2002 as a voluntary disclosure regime to
address the resource curse.8

In 2002, an international coalition that included various foreign
governments, international organizations, and resource extraction issuers
established the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to help combat the
resource curse. EITI, which seeks to foster and improve transparency and
accountability in countries rich in oil, natural gas, or minerals, established a
8

The discussion in this section is based on the description of EITI in the
adopting release. See 77 FR 56,366/2-3 n.14, 56,367/3 n.27.
8

framework for the reconciliation of company payments and government revenues
from these natural resources.
The EITI framework includes several critical features:
• Countries volunteer to comply with EITI’s disclosure regime. To
obtain EITI compliance, a country must, among other
requirements, develop a reporting template that establishes what
payment information will be provided by the governments and
companies operating in that country, including the degree of
aggregation of data.
• To seek “EITI compliant” status, countries must also complete a
reconciliation process in which company payments are matched
with government revenues by an independent administrator. As
part of this process, companies and the government generally each
submit payment information confidentially to the administrator.
• The administrator then reconciles the information that the
companies and the government provided it and produces a public
report. The information disclosed in the report is determined by
each country’s particular EITI work plan and varies widely among
countries.
At the time the Commission promulgated Rule 13q-1, only fourteen
countries had achieved EITI-compliant status.

9

3.

Congress concluded after several years of experience with
EITI’s voluntary regime that a mandatory disclosure
requirement was necessary.

By 2008, Congress became aware that a mandatory disclosure regime was
needed to complement the voluntary EITI regime to achieve significant
international gains in payment transparency. 9 As explained in the 2008 Senate
Resource Curse Report:
United States and multilateral efforts to promote extractive industries
transparency are intended to work within the bounds of the political
will and technical capacity of the resource-rich countries. With their
revenue windfall, some of these nations are increasingly intransigent
in resisting outside pressure. This has led some to urge that the U.S.
should take steps domestically to promote transparency overseas,
much as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was U.S. domestic
legislation to thwart corruption abroad. One such proposal is to
mandate revenue reporting for companies listed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and working in extractives abroad.
SENATE RESOURCE CURSE REPORT at 20. This report’s findings served as the basis
for Section 13(q). See supra note 7.
Similarly, in 2009, when Senator Lugar first introduced in the Senate the
provision that ultimately became Section 13(q), he explained that it was an

9

See, e.g., Transparency of Extractive Industries: High Stakes for ResourceRich Countries, Citizens, and International Business, Hearing before the
Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives (No. 110-75)
(Oct. 25, 2007) at 7 (testimony of Ian Gary) (“EITI may make progress in some
countries where political will to tackle the problem is strong and lasting, and
requires the active involvement of civil society. But the initiative is weakened by
its voluntary nature and will not capture many countries where problems are most
severe.”).
10

important further step in international transparency because it would “allow people
to have information about the funds sent to their governments in non-EITI
implementing countries.” 155 Cong. Rec. S9746 (Sept. 23, 2009) (Sen. Lugar).
The distinct role of Section 13(q) in achieving the disclosure of payments to
“intransigent” governments was again emphasized during the floor debate on
Dodd-Frank:
We currently have a voluntary international standard for promoting
transparency. A number of countries and companies have joined
[EITI], an excellent initiative that has made tremendous strides in
changing the cultural secrecy that surrounds extractive industries. But
too many countries and too many companies remain outside this
voluntary system.
156 Cong. Rec. S3815 (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Cardin). See also id. S3818 (May 17,
2010) (Sen. Dodd) (stating that “broad new requirements for greater disclosure by
resource extractive companies operating around the world[] would be an important
step” to complement EITI’s “voluntary program”).

11

4.

In contrast to EITI, Section 13(q) requires mandatory
public disclosure of detailed information about resource
extraction payments to governments.

Section 13(q), unlike EITI, imposes a mandatory disclosure requirement on
resource extraction issuers for payments relating to the “commercial development
of oil, natural gas, or minerals.” 10 Specifically, Section 13(q) directs the
Commission to
issue final rules that require each resource extraction issuer to include
in an annual report of the resource extraction issuer information
relating to any payment made by the resource extraction issuer, a
subsidiary of the resource extraction issuer, or an entity under the
control of the resource extraction issuer to a foreign government or
the Federal Government for the commercial development of oil,
natural gas, or minerals[.]
This disclosure requirement relates to any payment that is:
• “made to further the commercial development of oil, natural gas,
or minerals; and
• not de minimis; and
• includes taxes, royalties, fees (including license fees), production
entitlements, bonuses, and other material benefits, that the
Commission, consistent with the guidelines of [EITI] (to the extent
practicable), determines are part of the commonly recognized
revenue stream for the commercial development of oil, natural gas,
or minerals[.]”

10

Section 13(q) defines a resource extraction issuer as an issuer of securities
that “(i) is required to file an annual report with the Commission” and that “(ii)
engages in the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals.”
12

Section 13(q) identifies two categories of payment disclosures that resource
extraction issuers must provide:
(1)

“the type and total amount of [payments] made for each project
of the resource extraction issuer relating to the commercial
development of oil, natural gas, or minerals” (i.e., project-level
disclosures); and

(2)

“the type and total amount of such payments made to each
government” (i.e., government-level disclosures). Governmentlevel disclosures involving payments to foreign governments
require an issuer to classify the payments according to which
“department, agency, or instrumentality of a foreign
government, or a company owned by a foreign government,”
received it.

Further, Section 13(q) provides that the Commission’s rules “shall require
that the information included in the annual report of a resource extraction issuer be
submitted in an interactive data format.” Section 13(q) also requires that the
payment information be electronically identifiable by:
• “the total amounts of the payments, by category;”
• “the currency used to make the payments;”
• “the business segment of the resource extraction issuer that made
the payments;”
• “the government that received the payments, and the country in
which the government is located;” and
• “the project of the resource extraction issuer to which the payments
relate[.]”

13

As the Commission has previously explained, disclosing information in such an
interactive data format can allow investors and other members of the public to
electronically search, retrieve and use the information in documents filed with the
Commission. Adopting Release, Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting,
Release No. 39-2461, Jan. 30, 2009, published at 74 FR 6776, 6777/2 (Feb. 10,
2009).
Section 13(q) also requires that the issuers’ disclosures be made public, see
infra Part II(A), and that, “to the extent practicable,” the Commission shall make
publicly available a compilation that, at a minimum, includes each issuer’s
individual project-level and government-level disclosures.

14

5.

In enacting Section 13(q), Congress established “a new
international standard” for mandatory public disclosure of
payment information.

In enacting Section 13(q), Congress intended to make the United States the
global “leader in creating a new standard for revenue transparency in the extractive
industries.” 156 Cong. Rec. S5873 (July 15, 2010) (Sen. Cardin). 11 The Senate
floor discussions on the Section 13(q) amendment confirm this:
• “[W]e are creating a new standard of transparency that will apply to the
world’s extractive industries ….” (Id. at S3815 (May 17, 2010) (Sen.
Cardin));
• The amendment will establish “a historic transparency standard that will
pierce the veil of secrecy that fosters so much corruption and instability
in resource-rich countries ….” (Id. (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Cardin)); and
• “[T]he Lugar-Cardin Amendment[] is a first step toward addressing [the
resource curse] by setting a new international standard for disclosure.”
(Id. at S3817-18 (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Dodd)).
The legislative record also confirms that the Section 13(q) disclosures were to
be made publicly available:
• “This [amendment] will require public disclosure of those payments.”
(Id. at S5872 (July 15, 2010) (Sen. Cardin)); and
• “This amendment would require companies listed on U.S. stock
exchanges to disclose in their SEC filings extractive payments made to

General Assembly (Sept. 22, 2010) (“So we are leading a global effort to combat
corruption, which in many places is the single greatest barrier to prosperity, and
which is a profound violation of human rights. That’s why we now require oil, gas
and mining companies that raise capital in the United States to disclose all
payments they make to foreign governments.”).

foreign governments for oil, gas, and mining. This information would
then be made public, empowering citizens in resource-rich countries in
their efforts to combat corruption and hold their governments
accountable.” (Id. at S3976 (May 19, 2010) (Sen. Feingold)).12
B.

The rulemaking process
1.

The Commission afforded members of the public an
extensive opportunity to provide comments, including data
and economic analysis.

Following the enactment of Section 13(q), the Commission invited
interested members of the public to submit pre-proposal comment letters. After
considering these, the Commission proposed the rules under review here on
December 15, 2010. JA1. The Commission initially provided a 45-day comment
period, but subsequently extended that period for an additional 30 days to allow the
public additional time to comment on the proposed rules, to respond to other
comment letters, and to provide data. Extension of Comment Period, Release No.
34-63795, January 28, 2011, published at 76 FR 6111 (February 3, 2011). After
the close of the formal comment period, the Commission continued to receive
comment letters. All of these letters, including those received after the formal
12

See also, e.g., 156 Cong. Rec. H5199 (June 29, 2010) (Joint Explanatory
Statement of the Committee of Conference) (the amendment “requires public
disclosure to the SEC of any payment relating to the commercial development of
oil, natural gas, and minerals”) (emphasis added); id. at S3649 (May 12, 2010)
(proposed “sense of Congress” accompanying amendment that became Section
13(q)) (encouraging the President to “work with foreign governments” to establish
their own “domestic requirements that companies under [their jurisdiction] publicly
disclose any payments made to a government” for resource extraction) (emphasis
added).
16

comment period, were considered by the Commission in formulating the final
rules.
The Commission received approximately 150 unique comment letters on the
proposal. 77 FR 56,367/2. Many commentators, including petitioner API, wrote
multiple letters commenting not just on the proposal, but on arguments that other
commentators made. Generally speaking, commentators agreed that greater
transparency and accountability with respect to resource extraction payments is
important to help overcome the resource curse. Id. The commentators sharply
disagreed, however, over how Section 13(q) should be interpreted and
implemented to best achieve this result.
2.

The Commission declined to make certain changes that
several industry commentators sought in the final rules
because those changes were not consistent with either
Section 13(q)’s text or transparency goals.
a.

The Commission determined that Section 13(q)
requires public disclosure of each issuer’s individual
payment information.

Some industry commentators recommended that the Commission allow
resource extraction issuers to make their own individual government-level and
project-level disclosures to the Commission on a confidential basis, with the
Commission then using that individualized information to create an anonymized
“compilation” that would aggregate the information of all the issuers together on a
“per-country or similarly high-level basis”; only the anonymized compilation
17

would be made publicly available. 77 FR 56,390/1.
The Commission rejected this approach, explaining that Section 13(q)
requires public disclosure of each issuer’s individual payment information. Id. at
56,391/1-2. The adopting release identifies a number of considerations supporting
this conclusion:
 Existing Exchange Act disclosure provisions require issuers
to publicly file annual, quarterly and current reports;
 Section 13(q)(3)(B)—which follows the provision that
directs the Commission “to the extent practicable” to make
available online a “compilation of the information” the
resource extraction issuers are required to submit—makes
clear that, at a minimum, any public compilation must
include each issuer’s individual government-level and
project-level disclosures; and
 Section 13(q)(2) requires that the disclosures be submitted in
an interactive data format, which suggests that Congress
intended the information to be provided in a format that
allows users to easily extract information most relevant to
them.
Id. The Commission also explained that Section 13(q)’s transparency goal
provides support for the conclusion that Congress intended for the issuers’
individual disclosures to be made publicly available. Id.

18

b.

To afford issuers flexibility in applying the statutory
term “project” to different business contexts, the
Commission agreed with a major industry association
and did not adopt a rule defining the term.

As stated above, Section 13(q) requires resource extraction issuers to make
project-level disclosures of payments; but Section 13(q) neither defines “project”
nor requires the Commission to do so. Commentators differed on whether the
Commission should define “project” and, if so, how. For example, one major
industry organization expressed the view that the Commission should leave
“project” undefined to allow businesses flexibility, while certain other industry
commentators recommended various broad definitions. 77 FR 56,383/3-56,384/3.
The adopting release explains that the Commission determined not to define
“project” to afford issuers flexibility in applying the term to different business
contexts. Id. at 56,385/2. The adopting release further explains that, although the
term “is used within the extractive industry in a variety of contexts” and thus
“there does not appear to be a single agreed-upon application” to support a onesize-fits-all definition, individual issuer’s Exchange Act reports and other public
statements demonstrate that they understand in any particular context what
constitutes their own “projects.” Id.
The Commission provided guidance about the meaning of “project,”
however, explaining that issuers can generally look to the underlying contractual
arrangements with a government to determine the term’s application in any given
19

context. Id. at 56,385/2, 56,406/1. As the adopting release states, “[t]he contract
defines the relationship and payment flows between the resource extraction issuer
and the government, and therefore, we believe it generally provides a basis for
determining the payments, and required payment disclosure, that would be
associated with a particular ‘project.’” Id. at 56,385/2-3, 56,406/1.
c.

The Commission determined that exempting issuers
from mandatory disclosure if such disclosure is
prohibited by a host country’s laws would be
inconsistent with Section 13(q).

Some industry commentators recommended that the Commission grant
exemptions if disclosure is prohibited by the host country’s law. 77 FR 56,370/23. They asserted that, without such an exemption, resource extraction issuers
might be foreclosed from bidding on future contracts in these countries and might
also be required to sell existing projects located there, causing significant losses
and impacting their competitive position. Id.
The Commission determined not to adopt such an exemption, however. As
the adopting release explains, an exemption in these situations would be
inconsistent with Section 13(q) and would undermine Congress’s intent to promote
international transparency. Id. at 56,413/1. For example, such an exemption
“could undermine the statute by encouraging countries to adopt laws, or interpret
existing laws, [to] specifically prohibit[] the disclosure required under the final
rules.” Id. at 56,372/3-56,373/1. Further, the adopting release explains that an
20

exemption may not be necessary because: (i) it is unclear from the record before
the Commission that any host country’s laws in fact prohibit the payment
disclosure; (ii) reporting companies may be able to seek authorization from the
host country in order to make the disclosures; and (iii) the widening global
influence of other international transparency initiatives may discourage countries
from adopting new prohibitions. Id. at 56,413/1-2.
3.

The Commission considered the economic effects of Section
13(q) and Rule 13q-1, including the potential costs and
benefits.

In the proposing release, the Commission requested that commentators
“provide empirical data” on the proposed rule’s potential economic effects because
the Commission generally lacked access to such data. JA21/3. Industry
commentators responded by asserting that the rules would have several adverse
economic effects, including significant direct compliance costs. See, e.g., JA165
(API: rules could “place U.S. filers at a competitive disadvantage”); JA166 (API:
“could harm investors, reduce competition, and impair efficiency”). But they
generally did not provide data or other quantitative analysis to support their claims.
77 FR 56,399/2-3.
Nonetheless, pursuant to this Court’s instruction that the Commission
determine as best it can the economic implications of the rules it promulgates, the

21

adopting release assesses Section 13(q) and Rule 13q-1’s potential effects on
competition, efficiency, and capital formation. 77 FR 56,397/1-56,413/2.
a.

The Commission qualitatively assessed the costs and
benefits of Section 13(q) and Rule 13q-1.

The Commission engaged in a qualitative assessment that comprehensively
considered the rule’s potential economic effects, as well as its potential costs and
benefits. Id. at 56,398/2-56,408/1. This analysis discussed the economic effects of
both the mandatory public disclosure requirement and various specific
discretionary choices that the Commission made. Id.
b.

Based on the data available to it, the Commission
undertook a quantitative assessment of the potential
direct compliance costs and potential losses that
extraction issuers may experience if a host country’s
laws bar payment disclosure.

In addition, where possible, the Commission sought to quantitatively assess
the potential economic effects. Id. at 56,408/1-56,413/2. See also id. at 56,403/3
(explaining that the Commission was “unable to quantify the impact” of certain
key discretionary choices because “reliable, empirical evidence regarding the
effects is not readily available to the Commission”).
Relying on firm-specific data for five firms supplied by industry
commentators, the Commission engaged in a quantitative analysis of issuers’
potential compliance costs to assess the industry commentators’ general claims
about the potential industry-wide costs. Id. at 56,408/1-56,413/2. Further,
22

although commentators generally did not provide the Commission with any data
concerning the potential costs associated with projects in host countries where
disclosure may be prohibited, the Commission used data from public annual filings
of potential affected issuers to assess industry commentators’ general claims about
the potential industry-wide losses. Id. at 56,411/1-3.
c.

The Commission explained that the disclosure
requirement’s potential benefits from enhanced
governmental accountability in host countries and
other potential benefits could not be quantified.

As stated in the adopting release, “Congress’ goal of enhanced government
accountability through Section 13(q) is intended to result in social benefits that
cannot be readily quantified with any precision.” Id. at 56,408/1. Moreover,
“[u]nlike many of the Commission’s rulemakings,” the benefits sought here are not
“ones that will necessarily generate measurable, direct economic benefits to
investors or issuers.” Id. at 56,403/2, 56,408/1; see also id. at 56,398/2.
The Commission’s conclusion is consistent with the apparent Congressional
awareness that Section 13(q)’s potential transparency benefits could not be
quantified. Specifically, the 2008 Senate Resource Curse Report, which set forth
the findings on which Section 13(q) was based, found that although there are
“many encouraging anecdotes on the benefits of improved transparency,” “there is
not yet a compelling body of evidence to prove the case that improved
transparency will bring improved governance and economic development.”

STANDARD OF REVIEW
In reviewing an agency’s interpretation of a statute that it is required to
implement, this Court will engage in a de novo review “using traditional tools of
statutory interpretation—text, structure, purpose, and legislative history”—to
determine if the statute has an unambiguous meaning. Pharm. Research & Mfrs.
of Am. v. Thompson, 251 F.3d 219, 224 (D.C. Cir. 2001). “This Court also reviews
de novo a ‘constitutional challenge to a statute.’” Am. Bus. Ass’n v. Rogoff, 649
F.3d 734, 737 (D.C. Cir. 2011).
In addition, “[t]o survive arbitrary and capricious review, an agency action
must be the product of reasoned decisionmaking.” Fox v. Clinton, 684 F.3d 67,
74-75 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Under this standard, this Court will affirm the agency’s
action if it is the result of a “logical and rational” process, Allentown Mack Sales &
Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998), in which the agency “examine[d]
the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action[s],”
Portland Cement Ass’n v. EPA, 665 F.3d 177, 187 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (internal
quotation marks omitted). This review is “fundamentally deferential.” Ass’n of

Private Sector Colleges & Universities v. Duncan, 681 F.3d 427, 441 (D.C. Cir.
2012).
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
I.

Petitioners have not shown that the Commission failed to assess the

rule’s economic implications as best it could, nor have they shown that their
quibbles with the economic analysis constitute prejudicial error that violates the
APA. Further, the Commission was not required to re-propose the rule with its
costs estimates because, among other reasons, the Commission used a common
method of extrapolating from firm-specific to industry-wide estimates, and
petitioners could have submitted data concerning costs when they had the
opportunity during the rulemaking.
II.

The Commission did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in rejecting the

three rule modifications that petitioners sought. First, Section 13(q)
unambiguously requires public disclosure of the payment information that issuers
submit. Second, the Commission reasonably determined that providing an
exemption if a host country’s law bars disclosure would be inconsistent with the
Congressional purpose to compel payment disclosure as to those countries that
refuse to do so voluntarily. Lastly, the Commission did not abuse its discretion in
declining to adopt a one-size-fits-all definition for the statutory term “project” in

25

order to provide issuers flexibility to apply the term to their various business
contexts.
III.

Petitioners’ First Amendment challenge to Rule 13q-1 is waived

because neither they nor any other commentator raised it during the rulemaking;
petitioners’ First Amendment challenge is therefore limited to Section 13(q). But
even that challenge fails because the mandatory disclosure of purely factual, nonideological information here is not “compelled speech” in violation of the First
Amendment.

Petitioners have not demonstrated that the Commission acted
arbitrarily or capriciously in assessing Rule 13q-1’s economic
implications.
When engaged in rulemaking under the Exchange Act, the Commission is

required to “consider whether the [rule] will promote efficiency, competition, and
capital formation.” 15 U.S.C. 78c(f). To satisfy this requirement, the Commission
must “determine as best it can the economic implications of the rule.” Business
Roundtable v. SEC, 647 F.3d 1144, 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Chamber of
Commerce v. SEC, 412 F.3d 133, 143 (D.C. Cir. 2005) [Chamber I]) (emphasis
added). Contrary to petitioners’ contention, the Commission met that standard
here: the adopting release considers the rule’s potential economic effects by
quantifying costs where possible and otherwise providing qualitative analysis; to
26

the limited extent that commentators provided cost estimates, the release analyzes
those estimates; and the release discusses uncertainties underlying the estimates of
benefits and costs.
A.

The Commission reasonably assessed benefits.

Petitioners incorrectly contend that the Commission erred in assessing Rule
13q-1’s benefits both by not relying on an empirical analysis (at 41) and by being
“indeterminate” about the “Rule’s effectiveness in achieving [Congress’s] goal” of
helping promote accountability through transparency (at 40).
As the Supreme Court has admonished, “[i]t is one thing to set aside agency
action under the [APA] because of failure to adduce empirical data that can readily
be obtained. It is something else to insist upon obtaining the unobtainable.” FCC
v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 519 (2009) (internal citation
omitted). Empirical evidence regarding the social benefits that may result from the
transparency and “enhanced government accountability” that Congress intended
when it enacted Section 13(q) (77 FR 56,408/1) was not obtainable. For that
reason, as the Commission explained, these social benefits “cannot be readily
quantified with any precision.” Id.; see also id. at 56,398/2 (explaining that these
social benefits “do not appear to be ones that will necessarily generate measurable,
direct economic benefits to investors or issuers”).

27

Petitioners have not demonstrated that the Commission acted unreasonably
in concluding that it could not quantify the social benefits that may result. “There
are some propositions for which scant empirical evidence can be marshaled,” Fox
Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 519, and in such instances “the agency is well
within its discretion to regulate on the basis of available information,”
ConocoPhillips Co. v. EPA, 612 F.3d 822, 841 (5th Cir. 2010). See also Chamber
I, 412 F.3d at 142 (“an agency need not—indeed cannot—base its every action
upon empirical data”). Indeed, the soundness of the Commission’s conclusion is
buttressed by both the Senate Resource Curse Report, see supra pp. 23-24, which
also found that there is not yet empirical evidence demonstrating the benefits of
payment transparency, and the fact that petitioners and other commentators did not
offer either empirical data or a methodology for quantifying benefits, cf. Duncan,
681 F.3d at 448 (rejecting challenge to a rule where the petitioner pointed to no
study or empirical data that the agency ignored).
Petitioners fare no better in their related argument (at 40) that the
Commission erred by not definitively concluding that payment transparency would
achieve Congress’s ultimate goal of greater accountability in resource-rich
countries. The absence of an express Commission determination surely caused no
prejudice. Neither the petitioners nor any other commentator disputed during the
rulemaking the potential benefits that enhanced transparency can have on
28

government accountability in resource-rich countries. Indeed, the voluntary
participation of many of petitioners’ members in EITI demonstrates that they
themselves believe that payment transparency can contribute to better governance,
helping to yield the very social benefits that Congress sought.
But in any event, where, as here, Congress makes a legislative determination
that a particular regulatory approach is necessary to address a public policy issue
and directs an agency to implement that specific regulatory approach, the agency’s
responsibility is to faithfully execute Congress’s mandate. In the context of
Section 13(q)’s specific mandate, the Commission’s responsibility was not, as
petitioners suggest, to revisit Congress’s judgment about the wisdom of payment
transparency, but to promulgate a rule that faithfully and effectively implements
the new transparency requirement that Congress enacted. In assessing the benefits,
therefore, it was both appropriate and sufficient for the Commission to focus—as it
did13— on determining the extent to which Rule 13q-1 “contribut[es] toward
speeding achievement of [the] congressional mandate.” Charter Commc’ns, Inc. v.

13

See, e.g., 77 FR 56,405/1 (“should help promote comparability and support
international transparency promotion efforts”); id. at 56,405/1 (“should help further
the goal of supporting international transparency promotion efforts and enhance
the effectiveness of the disclosure”).
29

FCC, 460 F.3d 31, 42 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (discussing Consumer Elec. Ass’n v. FCC,
347 F.3d 291, 303 (D.C. Cir. 2003)).14
Similarly, because Congress itself made the specific determination that
transparency is a necessary means to help promote governmental accountability,
Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78w(a)(2), cannot be read to
authorize the Commission either to second-guess the wisdom of Congress’s policy
determination or to adopt petitioners’ proposed changes, see infra Part II, where
doing so would contravene Section 13(q)’s text, structure, or purpose. See, e.g., 77
FR 56,402/3-56,403/1 (“[W]e believe the competitive burdens arising from the
need to make the required disclosures under the final rules are necessary by the
terms of, and in furtherance of the purposes of, Section 13(q).”). Neither the
general requirement to consider efficiency, competition, and capital formation, nor
the general requirement to ensure that Commission rules do not unnecessarily or
inappropriately burden competition, permits the Commission to ignore Congress’s
specific policy judgments and statutory directives.

14

Section 13(q)’s specific Congressional mandate distinguishes this case from
API v. OSHA, 581 F.2d 493, 501 (5th Cir. 1978), which petitioners cite (at 41).
There, OSHA was operating under general statutory authority that empowered it to
adopt regulations “reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful
employment and places of employment.” Id. at 500-02. Because Congress had not
made any specific determinations about what regulatory options should be adopted,
OSHA necessarily needed to demonstrate that any particular initiative would
achieve the benefits that Congress broadly empowered OSHA to pursue.
30

B.

The Commission reasonably assessed costs.

Throughout this rulemaking, the Commission has confronted the reality that
relevant data regarding costs was held by affected issuers and the Commission had
a limited basis to test industry’s estimates of such costs. Although the Commission
expressly asked commentators to provide empirical data (id.), they provided very
little. Nonetheless, the Commission used the limited data that commentators
provided, supplemented by data from issuers’ public filings and a commonly used
publicly available database (Compustat®), to allow, to the extent possible, a fuller
consideration of the rule’s potential economic effects in order to assess industry
commentators’ claims about the potential industry-wide costs. See, e.g., 77 FR
56,408/1-2 n.616, 56,511/1-3. Cf. Consumer Electronic Assoc. v. FCC, 347 F.3d
291, 302 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (suggesting agency should engage in an “independent
assessment” of commentators’ estimates if possible).
Generally speaking, the critical result from the Commission’s empirical
estimates—which petitioners largely ignore—was that, using the limited data
available to it, the Commission confirmed the industry commentators’ own cost
projections.
1.

The Commission estimated the potential direct compliance
costs.

Following this Court’s directive to do what it can to assess likely costs, the
Commission used the only direct compliance-cost data that commentators
31

provided—two firm-specific estimates of initial costs and three firm-specific
estimates of on-going costs. 77 FR 56,408/2, 56,410/1-2. To obtain a general
sense of the potential industry-wide costs, the Commission used this data to
extrapolate initial and ongoing total industry-wide compliance costs to assess
petitioner API’s claim that such costs could potentially total hundreds of millions
of dollars. See id. at 56,408/1-56,413/2 & n.621; see also id. n.532.
Significantly, the Commission’s estimates of direct compliance costs were
largely in line with petitioner API’s projections—a fact that petitioners ignore.
See, e.g., 77 FR 56,410/1 (“This estimate is consistent with two commentators’
qualitative estimates of initial implementation costs.”); see also, e.g., id. at
56,411/3. Since the Commission confirmed and essentially accepted petitioners’
cost estimates, their more specific challenges to particular components of the
Commission’s cost analysis fall far short of meeting their “high” burden to show
prejudicial error. Nat’l Assoc. of Home Builders v. EPA, 682 F.3d 1032, 1040
(D.C. Cir. 2012) (“[I]n view of the complex nature of economic analysis typical in
the regulation promulgation process, [petitioners’] burden to show error is high.”).
See also State of Oregon v. Watt, 712 F.2d 584, 605 & n.105 (D.C. Cir. 1983)
(concluding that any error with agency’s cost-benefit analysis was not sufficient to
warrant remand where agency used the analysis “only for generalized conclusions”

32

such as assessing “order of magnitude approximation” and not “for making narrow
distinctions” between potential regulatory alternatives).
In any event, contrary to petitioners’ contention (at 42-43), the
Commission’s assumption for purposes of assessing initial compliance costs that
these costs vary based on an issuer’s size (77 FR 56,410/1) did not render that
assessment arbitrary or capricious. First, petitioner API actually told the
Commission that the compliance efforts will vary based on issuers’ size, and so
petitioners cannot now claim prejudicial error. JA169 (“the relative level of effort
to meet the requirements will be roughly proportional to company size”). Second,
the Commission expressly acknowledged uncertainty about this assumption and
stated that there may be “substantial fixed costs to compliance that are
underestimated.” 77 FR 56,410/1. Third, because of this and two other potential
limitations to the accuracy of its estimate, the Commission concluded “that the
total initial compliance costs for all issuers are likely to be near the upper bound of
approximately $1 billion,” id., which of course was in line with petitioner API’s
assessment of “hundreds of millions of dollars,” id. n.621 (quoting JA211 (API)
and JA46 (ExxonMobil)).
Petitioners also erroneously contend (at 42) that the Commission “made
sharply different assumptions about the total assets owned” by extraction issuers in
method 1 (which estimates industry-wide compliance costs based on estimate of an
33

average issuer’s compliance costs) and method 2 (which estimates industry-wide
compliance costs based on estimates of the average small and average large
issuers’ compliance costs). But the Commission did not make “different
assumptions” about total issuer assets; rather, as the adopting release explains, both
methods relied on data from Compustat®, id. at 56,408/2 n.616, a comprehensive
database routinely used by the Commission and others in empirical assessments
involving public companies.15 See, e.g., Lynn M. LoPucki & Joseph W. Doherty,
Bankruptcy Fire Sales, 106 MICH. L. REV. 1, 21-22 n.96 (2007). And in any event,
petitioners have not demonstrated any prejudicial error, which would of course be
particularly difficult for them to do because the Commission’s estimates of initial
compliance costs were in the same range as those petitioner API claimed during
the rulemaking.

15

Petitioners base their mistaken contention that the Commission made
different assumptions about total issuer assets on the fact that the average large and
small issuer compliance costs from method 2, when weighted by the respective
percentages of large issuers (37%) and small issuers (63%), do not sum to the
average issuer compliance cost from method 1. Br. 21, n.2. The disparity in the
two figures results from two characteristics of the Compustat® data set. First, the
Compustat ® database does not contain data for all small issuers; the percentage of
small and large extraction issuers in the Compustat® data set is 48% and 52%,
respectively—not the 63% and 37% actual market breakdown of large and small
extraction issuers reflected in Commission’s EDGAR filings. Second, because
Compustat® lacks end-of-the-fiscal-year stock prices for some issuers, they could
not be classified as either large or small issuers and were excluded from the
method 2 calculation. As noted above, this database is commonly used and thus
these data set characteristics are well understood and do not affect the validity of
the Commission’s analytical approach.
34

2.

The Commission assessed the potential costs should foreign
countries bar disclosure.

Petitioners erroneously claim that the Commission prejudicially
underestimated the potential costs from not exempting issuers from disclosing
payments to countries with laws that may preclude such disclosure. As the
adopting release explains, the Commission relied on publicly available information
in affected issuers’ annual filings—the only data available to it because although
industry commentators claimed they would suffer billions of dollars in costs
without an exemption, they failed to substantiate the claim with any data or
analysis. The Commission explained that it lacked sufficient data to conduct an
industry-wide assessment of “the total amount of capital that may be lost” because
“most filings did not provide detailed information on the extent of [issuers’]
operations” in the four countries that petitioners claimed prohibit disclosure. 77
FR 56,411/2.
The Commission nonetheless estimated the potential individual costs to
three issuers (see id. at 56,411/2-56,412/2) and relied on those estimates to
conclude that the commentators’ concerns that these four host country laws could
add billions of dollars in costs, and “hence have a significant impact on their
profitability and competitive position, appear warranted.” Id. at 56,412/1; see also
id. at 56,413/1 (“the results of our analysis concur with commentators”). Thus,
the Commission did precisely what Chamber I instructs—after concluding that it
35

could not assess the total industry-wide costs, the Commission relied on cost
estimates for individual issuers to understand the rule’s economic implications.
412 F.3d at 144. But the Commission did even more: it identified a number of
additional considerations that could increase the rule’s costs, which further
undercuts petitioners’ claim that the Commission somehow failed to do all it could
to understand the rule’s potential economic effects. See 77 FR 56,412/1-56,413/1
(setting forth additional considerations that may increase the rule’s costs); see also
id. at 56,413/1 (“Unfortunately, we do not have enough data to quantify more
precisely the potential losses of firms under those various circumstances.”).
3.

Lacking empirical data, the Commission engaged in a
qualitative assessment of other potential costs.

Having received no empirical data on other potential economic effects, the
Commission was unable to quantitatively assess them. See, e.g., 77 FR 56,402/1
(“In addition to direct compliance costs, we expect that the statute could result in
significant economic effects.”); id. at 56,402/1-2 (discussing potential competitive
harms). But contrary to petitioners’ claim (at 44), the Commission did not
underestimate the total costs even though it could not quantify these other potential
costs. As the adopting release makes clear, the Commission engaged in a
comprehensive qualitative assessment of the rule’s economic effects and included
within that discussion a consideration of the total overall costs that might result,

36

including those costs that the Commission could not quantify.16 See Chamber I,
412 F.3d at 142 (explaining that a general qualitative analysis is appropriate where
empirical data is lacking).
C.

The Commission was not required to re-propose the rule.

Contrary to petitioners’ contention (at 45-46), the Commission correctly
determined that it was unnecessary to re-notice the rule with its cost estimates
because interested parties had been given an ample opportunity to “review the
proposed rules, as well as the comment letters, and to provide views on the
proposal, other comment letters, and data.” 77 FR 56,397/2. This was the correct
course for several reasons.
First, because its analysis relied almost entirely on data provided by public
commentators, the Commission complied with the requirement that “the most
critical factual material” supporting its position be made public. Ass’n of Data
Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 745 F.2d
677, 684 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (cited in Chamber of Commerce v. SEC, 443 F.3d 890,
900 (D.C. Cir. 2006) [Chamber II]). Indeed, the Commission accepted industry
commentators’ estimates of costs as correct after making its own assessment, so

16

Petitioners ignore the Commission’s qualitative assessment of Rule 13q-1’s
potential economic effects that is set forth in Parts B and C of the adopting
release’s economic analysis, 77 FR at 56,398/2-56,408/1, including the rule’s
potential effects on, among other things, competition.
37

petitioners appear now to be attacking their own estimates as too low. 17 And
because the Commission generally used its industry-wide extrapolations to assess
commentators’ estimates, the Commission’s extrapolations were at most nonprejudicial “supplementary evidence.” Chamber II, 443 F.3d at 900.
Second, the extrapolations done by the Commission are quite unlike the
undisclosed cost-benefit analysis in Owner-Operator Indep. Drivers Ass’n v. Fed.
Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 494 F.3d 188, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2007), as the
Commission used the “common method” of extrapolating from firm-specific to
industry-wide estimates in the absence of other available measurements, see, e.g.,
Mona V. Makhija et al., Measuring Globalization of Industries Using a National
Industry Approach: Empirical Evidence Across Five Countries and Over Time, 28
J. OF INT’L BUS. STUDIES 679, 681 (1997) (explaining that extrapolation from data
concerning one or more prominent firms is a “common method” of making
economic measurements when other measures are unavailable).
Third, petitioners have not established prejudice. See Owner-Operator, 494
F.3d at 201-02. The Commission accepted the highest cost estimates provided by
petitioner API and other industry commentators, but still adopted the rule because

17

Petitioners’ objection (at 45) to the Commission’s reference to a study on the
effect of “fire sales” on airplane sales prices is both misguided and puzzling
because: the study was used merely to “check or confirm[]” the conclusions
reached based on the public data, Chamber II, 443 F.3d at 900, and it supported
petitioners’ view that forced asset sales can lead to lower sales prices.
38

it believed that the three proposals petitioners argued would reduce costs (see infra
Part II) “would be inconsistent with Section 13(q) and would undermine Congress’
intent to promote international transparency efforts.” 77 FR 56,402/3; see also id.
56,398/2; 56,400/1-3; 56,402/3-56,403/1. Petitioners have identified no new
evidence or critique of the Commission’s methodology that would lead to revised
cost estimates of an order of magnitude sufficient to change the Commission’s
conclusion as to petitioners’ three proposals.
Finally, as this Court has made clear, a petitioner may not “withhold
relevant data and blindside the agency on appeal.” Chamber II, 443 F.3d at 904.
Petitioners were in a position to submit any additional available data concerning
costs or methodology during the rulemaking but chose not to do so. They should
not now be allowed to prevail in this Court simply because the Commission was
unable to consider data or methodology that they failed to suggest when they had
the opportunity.
II.

The Commission did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in declining to
adopt three proposals that petitioners advanced.
A.

The Commission correctly determined that confidential
submission of the payment information would be inconsistent with
Section 13(q).

The Commission properly determined based on the statutory text and other
indicia of Congressional intent that Section 13(q) requires the public disclosure of
the issuers’ payment information. See, e.g., Thompson, 251 F.3d at 224 (D.C. Cir.)
39

(courts “us[e] traditional tools of statutory interpretation—text, structure, purpose,
and legislative history”—at Chevron step one).
The Exchange Act is fundamentally a public disclosure statute. See
generally Schreiber v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 472 U.S. 1, 12 (1985) (“the core
mechanism” is “sweeping disclosure requirements” that allow “shareholder
choice”); Longman v. Food Lion, Inc., 197 F.3d 675, 682 (4th Cir. 1999)
(embodies a “philosophy of public disclosure”); Franklin v. Kaypro Corp., 884
F.2d 1222, 1227 (9th Cir. 1987) (“forc[es] public disclosure of facts”).
Accordingly, the reports that public companies are required to submit under the
Act—such as the annual report on Form 10-K giving a comprehensive description
of a public company’s performance—have always been made public. By adding a
new disclosure requirement to the Act, and doing so for the undisputed purpose of
fostering increased transparency and public awareness, there is thus a strong
presumption that Congress intended for the disclosed information to be made
public.
Petitioners seek to overcome this presumption by relying on Section
13(q)(3), which provides:

40

(3) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION—
(A)

IN GENERAL—To the extent practicable, the Commission
shall make available online, to the public, a compilation
of the information required to be submitted [by issuers
under Section 13(q)(2)(A)].

(B)

OTHER INFORMATION—Nothing in this paragraph shall
require the Commission to make available online
information other than the information required to be
submitted under the rules issued under paragraph (2)(A).

They contend that Section 13(q) contemplates a “two-step process for disclosure of
information” under which issuers first “provide an ‘annual report’ confidentially to
the Commission, and the Commission then make[s] publicly available—‘to the
extent practicable’—an aggregated ‘compilation of the companies’ payment
information.” Br. 47-48. Petitioners are wrong.
First, Section 13(q) does not contemplate that the compilation should be a
substitute for the public disclosure of the issuers’ annual reports. This is apparent
because—in contrast to the “annual” reporting requirement for issuers—the statute
provides that the Commission is obligated to publish a compilation only “to the
extent practicable” and imposes no timeframe on the Commission for producing or
subsequently updating the compilation. Indeed, if petitioners’ reading were correct
and the Commission were to determine that it is impracticable to publish a
compilation, none of the payment information would be disclosed—plainly an

41

absurd result. This demonstrates that Congress must have intended public
disclosure of each issuer’s individual report. 18
Second, even when it is practicable to publish a compilation, Section
13(q)(3) makes it clear that petitioners’ proposed country-by-country
“aggregation” of issuers’ payment information is neither required nor an available
substitute for the issuer-by-issuer disclosure of project-level and government-level
payment information. Section 13(q)(3)(B) expressly provides that the Commission
need include in the compilation nothing “other than the information required to be
submitted” by issuers—i.e., the issuer-by-issuer project-level and government-level
disclosures. That information serves as the minimum information that the
Commission must include in any public compilation. Moreover, because the
“aggregation” of the issuers’ information that petitioners propose would produce a
18

To further support their contention that Congress intended the compilation
as a substitute for disclosure of the annual reports containing the payment
information, petitioners rely on two other legislative provisions—newly added
Section 13(p) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78m(p), which requires issuers to
make certain disclosures concerning whether minerals from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo are used in their products, and a 2008 bill entitled
“Extractive Industries Transparency Disclosure Act” (H.R. 6066) that, although
not enacted, closely resembles Section 13(q). Neither provision supports
petitioners’ position. Like Section 13(q), both legislative provisions require public
disclosure of information through filings with the Commission and then separately
provide supplemental mechanisms for making the disclosures publicly accessible.
Compare Exchange Act § 13(p)(1)(E) (requiring issuers to provide information on
their “Internet website”), and EITDA § 3(c) (requiring Commission to “provide
that the information filed by all issuers … in a compiled format” on the “website of
the Commission”).
42

new, anonymized set of data that is “other information” than issuers “are required
to submit,” Section 13(q)(3)(B) makes plain that it is not the type of information
that the Commission is required to include in the “compilation.” 19
The Commission’s reading is bolstered by the structure of Section 13(q) as a
whole. Section 13(q) requires issuers to file reports with the Commission
disclosing detailed payment information (e.g., the currency used to make the
payments and the business segment of the issuer that made the payment, both
electronically tagged). Yet unlike EITI—which expressly assigns a third-party
administrator the role of reconciling payment information received from both the
government and the extraction companies, and then providing a public report—the
only significant responsibility that Section 13(q) assigns to the Commission is to
ensure that the issuers’ payment information is provided to the public. If

19

For the same reason, Section 13(q)(3)(B) reveals that when Congress
referred to a “compilation of information,” it was not referring to the “aggregating”
of that information into new, less detailed information. Just as a compilation of
judicial opinions means the pulling together of various discrete opinions into one
book, with each decision retaining its independent character within the
compilation, “compilation of information” as used in Section 13(q) means pulling
together in one place the actual issuer-by-issuer project-level and government-level
information. Additional support for this conclusion is found in the 2008 EITDA
bill, see supra note 18, which under a subheading identical to that in Section
13(q)(3)—i.e., “Public Availability of Information”—provides that the issuers’
payment information must “be compiled so that it is accessible by the public
directly, and in a compiled format, from the website of the Commission without
separately accessing on the EDGAR system the annual reports of each issuer filing
such information.” EITDA § 3(c) (emphases added).
43

petitioners were correct that an anonymized per-country aggregation were
sufficient here, Congress would not have drafted Section 13(q) to demand that
issuers disclose, or the Commission receive, so much extraneous, detailed
information.20 The only logical explanation is that petitioners are incorrect:
Congress intended for each issuer’s disclosed detailed payment information to be
made publicly available.
Moreover, the legislative history confirms that Congress intended that the
payment information would be disclosed on an issuer-by-issuer basis—not the
anonymized approach that petitioners requested. This is apparent because the
Congressional sponsors spoke repeatedly about investors having information about
their companies’ payments, and such information would be relevant to investors
only if it were disclosed on an issuer-by-issuer basis. See, e.g., 156 Cong. Rec.
S3815 (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Cardin) (“Investors need to know the full extent of a
company’s exposure”); id. at S3816 (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Lugar) (“would
empower investors to have a more complete view of the value of their holdings”);
see also id. at S5872 (July 15, 2010) (Sen. Cardin) (“will require public disclosure
20

As the Commission stated in the final release, even if the annual reports are
not publicly disclosed, some of this detailed information could potentially be made
available to the public pursuant to FOIA. 77 FR 56401/2 & n.562. Although
petitioners challenge that assertion, the case law is clear that the application of the
confidentially exemption for FOIA is determined on a case-by-case basis. See,
e.g., Ctr. for Auto Safety v. NHTSA, 244 F.3d 144, 147-48 (D.C. Cir. 2001)
(describing fact-based inquiry).
44

of those payments”). Significantly, petitioners have not identified any statements
in the legislative record to support their contrary interpretation. See generally
Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 396 n.23 (1991) (“Congress’ silence in this
regard can be likened to the dog that did not bark.”).
Finally, requiring disclosure of the detailed payment information is also
consistent with the Congressional intent to create a new historic transparency
standard that empowers citizens around the world to hold their governments,
including their sub-national governments, accountable for resource extraction
revenues. Indeed, the EITI Board now agrees that the aggregated data reporting
that petitioners seek is inadequate: it determined in October 2012 to require at
least disaggregation by company and by payment type in each EITI country, and
will consider a project-level disaggregation requirement in early 2013. 21
B.

The Commission properly declined to create an exemption where
payment disclosure is barred by a foreign government.

As previously discussed, see supra pp. 10-16, a principal Congressional
objective underlying the enactment of Section 13(q) was to bring about a new
international standard of public disclosure of resource-extraction payments,

particularly as to those “intransigent” foreign governments that were resisting
pressure to voluntarily implement EITI. Necessarily included among those
intransigent governments are any that may have taken the extraordinary step of
actually prohibiting disclosure through laws, decrees, or other means. Particularly
as to these transparency-averse countries, Section 13(q) makes it the public policy
of the United States to compel disclosure of payments by requiring the issuers to
disclose payment information. As Senator Lugar explained, “We cannot force
foreign governments to treat their citizens as we would hope, but this amendment
would make it much more difficult to hide the truth.” 156 Cong. Rec. S3816 (May
17, 2010).
Given this Congressional desire, the Commission reasonably determined not
to grant an exemption where foreign laws may attempt to prohibit the Section
13(q) disclosures. The Commission has “considerable regulatory discretion in this
area,” Schiller v. Tower Semiconductor Ltd., 449 F.3d 286, 296 (2d Cir. 2006), and
may choose to exercise its exemptive authority where “not inconsistent with the
public interest or the protection of investors.” Exchange Act § 12(h), 15 U.S.C.
§ 78l(h). Here, the Commission determined that an exemption involving the most
intransigent countries—i.e., those whose laws may expressly bar disclosure—
would be inconsistent with the Congressionally identified public interest in
promoting transparency in all countries. 77 FR 56,372/3-56,373/1, 56,413/1.
46

While this reasoned decision was within the Commission’s discretion,
petitioners nonetheless make several misguided arguments to demonstrate
otherwise. First, they erroneously suggest that the Commission was obliged to
grant the exemption pursuant to the Charming Betsy doctrine, which is a
“presumption that Congress typically does not intend its laws to conflict with the
law of nations.” United States v. Weingarten, 632 F.3d 60, 67 (2d Cir. 2011).
Neither the Charming Betsy presumption nor international comity considerations
have any place here, however, as a principal Congressional purpose underlying
Section 13(q) was to require the public disclosure of information that other
countries are refusing to disclose voluntarily. Cf. United States v. Yunis, 924 F.2d
1086, 1091 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (international-law concerns are irrelevant when “the
statute in question reflects an unmistakable congressional intent” to effectuate the
foreign policy that allegedly implicates those concerns).
Second, petitioners contend that, given the potential costs that might result
without such an exemption, the Commission was required to conduct an extensive
analysis to verify that Congress’s transparency and accountability objectives would
actually be achievable in any countries that may prohibit the Section 13(q)
disclosures if the relevant payment information were publicly available. 22 As

22

Petitioners also mischaracterize the Commission’s cost analysis (at 57),
which merely evaluated the potential loss if issuers terminate all activities in those
47

discussed in Part I(A), supra, this view erroneously supposes that the Commission
must assess the validity and wisdom of specific Congressional policy mandates
before the Commission can execute them. Cf. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at
519 (“Congress has made the determination that indecent material is harmful to
children, and has left enforcement of the ban to the Commission. If enforcement
had to be supported by empirical data, the ban would effectively be a nullity.”).
Third, petitioners claim that in denying exemptive relief here the
Commission ignored previous situations where it has granted exemptions for
disclosures that were barred by foreign law. Br. 55-56. Significantly, none of
those situations involved legislation expressly enacted to circumvent an
intransigent foreign government’s desire to avoid the disclosure. In light of this
significant difference, the Commission was not required to address the previous
situations where it has granted exemptions based on foreign law. U.S. Dep’t of
Homeland Sec. v. FLRA, 647 F.3d 359, 364 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (explaining that an
agency is “not required to canvas the field to explain why inapplicable cases or
doctrines do not apply. Our precedents do not require agencies to explain why
apples are not oranges.”).
Fourth, petitioners erroneously contend that the Commission ignored an

countries. 77 FR 56411/1-2, 56,413/1 & n.632. As the Commission recognized, it
is unclear that denying an exemption will actually have that consequence. Id.
48

alternative that would exempt only countries that currently bar disclosure. As the
adopting release demonstrates, the Commission was concerned that regimes could
take advantage of such a grandfather exemption by “interpret[ing] existing laws,”
to bar disclosure. 77 FR 56373/1. But in any event, petitioner API opposed such a
grandfather exemption during the rulemaking, so petitioners cannot now claim
prejudicial error.23
Lastly, petitioners assert that the Commission contradicted itself by
recognizing that existing international transparency efforts may discourage the
spread of anti-disclosure laws while also reasoning that granting the exemption at
issue here could encourage more countries to adopt such laws. But it is hardly
contradictory or illogical to point out that a growing international transparency
trend could be hampered were the United States to weaken its own transparency
law by accommodating those intransigent countries that may seek to bar such
disclosures. 24

23

See JA194-95 (API: “Incorporation of an exception that is tied to
prohibitions that were in place prior to enactment of the Act could also result in
uneven harm, with some issuers impacted and others not.”).
24

Although petitioners make passing reference to exempting disclosures
prohibited “by the terms of foreign commercial contracts” (at 54), they make no
argument specifically on this point and thus have waived it. City of Waukesha v.
EPA, 320 F.3d 228, 250 n.22 (D.C. Cir. 2003). In any event, the Commission’s
basis for rejecting such an exemption, which is set forth in the adopting release, see
77 FR 56,373/1, was entirely rational.
49

C.

The Commission did not abuse its discretion in determining to
provide interpretative guidance for the statutory term “project”
rather than formally defining it.

Contrary to petitioners’ contention, the Commission did not abuse its
discretion in determining not to provide a formal definition of the statutory term
“project”—which is used in connection with the project-level reporting
requirement.
As the adopting release demonstrates, the Commission’s determination was
“the product of reasoned decisionmaking.” Fox, 684 F.3d at 74-75. After
considering a variety of commentator proposals for defining the statutory term, the
Commission concluded that “‘project’ is used within the extractive industry in a
variety of contexts” and thus “there does not appear to be a single agreed-upon
application in the industry.” 77 FR 56,385/2 (emphasis added). Because of the
absence of an obvious one-size-fits-all definition, the Commission determined that
it would be preferable not to formally define the term in order to “giv[e] issuers
flexibility in applying the term to different business contexts depending on factors
such as the particular industry or business in which the issuer operates, or the
issuer’s size.” Id.; see also id. at 56,406/1. Further, the Commission observed that
issuers appear to understand what constitutes “their own project[]” in any given
context:

50

While there does not appear to be a single agreed-upon application in
the industry, we note that individual issuers routinely provide
disclosure about their own projects in their Exchange Act reports and
other public statements, and as such, we believe ‘project’ is a
commonly used term whose meaning is generally understood by
resource extraction issuers and investors.
Id. at 56,385/2 (emphases added); see also id. at 56,406/1.
To help mitigate the potential for “[i]nconsistent disclosure” that might
result from the absence of a formal definition (77 FR 56,406/2), however, the
Commission offered “guidance” to issuers in applying the term in any particular
context, suggesting that they look to their “contractual arrangements with
governments”:
[W]e note that resource extraction issuers routinely enter into
contractual arrangements with governments for the purpose of
commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. The contract
defines the relationship and payment flows between the resource
extraction issuer and the government, and therefore, we believe it
generally provides a basis for determining the payments, and required
payment disclosure, that would be associated with a particular
“project.”
(Id. at 56,385/2-3 (footnote omitted); see also id. at 56,406/1). 25
Notwithstanding this reasoned approach, petitioners raise several arguments
seeking to support their erroneous claim that the Commission acted arbitrarily and
capriciously. First, petitioners contend that the Commission contradicted itself

25

Petitioners’ opening brief does not mention—much less challenge—this
interpretive guidance and, thus, petitioners have waived any such challenge.
51

when it said that the “meaning” of “project” is “generally understood by resource
extraction issuers and investors” while also saying that there “does not appear to be
a single agreed-upon application in the industry.” Id. at 56,385/2, 56,406/1. Yet
there is no contradiction: the Commission simply explained that issuers are
already familiar with the contours of “their own projects” and thus understand how
to apply the term in a given context, even though the term is used “in a variety of
contexts” that no “single” definition would capture. 26 Indeed, petitioner API made
this same point in a comment letter. JA185-86 (“The term ‘project’ is used by
companies to describe a variety of different activities, depending on the context,
and there is no standard, agreed-upon definition.”).
Second, petitioners erroneously argue that, by leaving the term undefined,
the Commission shirked a statutory responsibility and promulgated a vague
regulation. In making this argument, petitioners ignore that:
(i)

Congress did not direct the Commission to define “project,”
and the decision whether to define that or any other such term
in the statute was thus left to the Commission’s full discretion.
See, e.g., Hercules Inc. v. EPA, 938 F.2d 276, 282-83 (D.C. Cir.
1991) (agencies are not required “to define all terms contained
in the statute” and have “discretion in declining to provide any

26

For the same reason, there is no contradiction between the Commission
determining that issuers generally understand the meaning of “project” and
concluding that a formal definition would limit their “‘flexibility’ to adapt the term
to different contexts.” Br. 60. It was entirely logical for the Commission to reason
that issuers understand the term’s meaning in their specific application, but that a
formal definition would be less flexible and effective than interpretive guidance.
52

definition of [a] term” unless the statute directs otherwise); 27
and
(ii)

the Commission provided guidance that, in applying the term
“project” in any specific instance, the activities and payment
flows occurring under the relevant government contract would
provide a basis for an issuer to determine its project.

Finally, petitioners erroneously contend that the Commission improperly
rejected their proposal to define “project” as all resource extraction activities
“carried out within a particular geologic basin or province.” Br. 60. As the
Commission explained, such a one-size-fits-all definition runs contrary to Section
13(q)’s emphasis on country-specific reporting because geological basins
frequently run through multiple countries. 77 FR 56,406/2. This was not an
arbitrary or capricious explanation.28

27

Compare 15 U.S.C. 78m(q)(1)(A) (“as determined by the Commission” at
the end of the definition for “commercial development of oil, natural gas, or
minerals”); id. 78m(q)(1)(B) (same for “foreign government”); id. 78m(q)(1)(C)(ii)
(directing the Commission to determine the components of the “payment”
definition that “are part of the commonly recognized revenue stream”).

28

Petitioners confuse the project- and government-level reporting required by
Section 13(q)(2)(A) with “reporting by both project and country.” Br. 61
(emphasis added). Reporting payments to “each government” requires more
granular disclosure than simply providing country-level disclosure as petitioners
seem to claim: it involves distinguishing payments by the recipient governmental
department or entity, or sub-national government, within each country.
53

III.

Petitioners’ First Amendment challenge lacks merit.
A.

Petitioners waived any claim that Rule 13q-1 violates the First
Amendment.

Petitioners’ First Amendment challenge to Rule 13q-1—including
petitioners’ claim that the rule is not narrowly tailored to survive strict scrutiny (at
34-35)—is waived because neither petitioners nor any other commentator raised
any First Amendment arguments during the rulemaking. See, e.g., Nat’l Multi
Hous. Council v. EPA, 292 F.3d 232, 233 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (refusing to
consider a Fourteenth Amendment equal protection challenge to agency’s
interpretation of statutory term that was not raised during the rulemaking).
Petitioners’ First Amendment challenge is therefore limited to Section 13(q). 29
B.

Section 13(q) does not implicate the First Amendment and, in any
event, survives scrutiny under any standard of review.

Section 13(q) requires entities that are already obligated to make extensive
public disclosures to also disclose payments made to governments for the
commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. Such mandatory
disclosures of purely factual information have never been understood to compel
“speech” in violation of the First Amendment. Like the “[i]nnumerable federal and
state regulatory programs [that] require” factual, non-ideological disclosures, Nat’l

29

The arguments set forth in Part III(B) nonetheless confirm that Rule 13q-1
does not violate the First Amendment.
54

Elec. Mfrs. Ass’n. v. Sorrell, 272 F.3d 104, 116 (2d Cir. 2001), Section 13(q) does
not in any way restrict or otherwise infringe upon First Amendment rights.
Regulated entities like those subject to Section 13(q)’s disclosure
requirement are subject to innumerable federal, state, and local reporting
requirements, and the information collected is frequently made available to the
public. The Commission, for example, requires public companies to disclose in
publicly available annual, periodic, and current reports a wide range of
information, 17 C.F.R. § 249.310, .308a, .308, such as information about their
business and property, financial condition, management, executive compensation,
and security ownership, see id. § 229.30 As further examples:
• the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation makes publicly
available the annual reports that bank depository institutions are
required to file on their management, operations, and financial
condition, 12 U.S.C. § 1831m(a)(3);
• the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau requires depository
banks to make publicly available extensive information on
mortgage loans which were originated or purchased by that
bank during each fiscal year, 12 U.S.C. § 2803;
• the Environmental Protection Agency makes publicly available
numerous disclosures that regulated entities are required to file
regarding the impact of their activities on the environment, see,
30

Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 758, n.5
(1985) (“This Court has recognized that certain kinds of speech are less central to
the interests of the First Amendment than others,” including “the exchange of
information about securities”) (citing Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S.
447, 456 (1978)).
55

e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 300j-4(g)(5); 11022(e)(3), 11023(h),
11044(a);
• the Department of Defense, the General Service
Administration, and NASA make publicly available
information that government contractors are required to selfreport regarding criminal, civil, and administrative liability in
connection with federal contracts, see Federal Acquisition
Circular 2005-49 (Jan. 19, 2011), published at 76 FR 4188-01
(Jan. 24, 2011); and
• the State Department is currently considering a proposal to
require U.S. companies to publicly disclose their investment
activities in Burma, including payments to each Burmese
government entity, see Reporting Requirements on Responsible
Investment in Burma, July 31, 2012, published at 77 FR 46,786
(Aug. 6, 2012).
No court (to our knowledge) has ever held that such factual, non-ideological
reporting and disclosure requirements “compel speech” in violation of the First
Amendment, and at least some courts have expressly rejected the “wide-ranging
implications” of such arguments for these and other government programs that
require public disclosure.31

31

The Second Circuit’s decision in Sorrell involved a disclosure requirement
different from Section 13(q)’s because the Vermont law in that case directly
regulated commercial speech. Yet, in upholding the regulation requiring
manufacturers of products containing mercury to include a warning label on those
products, the Second Circuit offered an observation that is equally relevant here: it
is “neither wise nor constitutionally required” to “expose these long-established
[reporting] programs to searching scrutiny by unelected courts.” Sorrell, 272 F.3d
at 116.
56

Nevertheless, petitioners contend that even if this Court rejects their
arguments under the APA, it should take the unprecedented step of invalidating
Section 13(q) because, they claim, that provision imposes a content-based
regulation of speech subject to strict scrutiny. See Br. at 31, n.16. Petitioners’
effort to constitutionalize their challenge does not advance their argument. They
cite no case in which any court has ever applied such an exacting standard to laws
requiring the disclosure of purely factual, non-ideological information. Instead,
petitioners rely on compelled speech cases that undermine their own argument for
strict scrutiny.
The unifying feature in “compelled speech” cases is that the First
Amendment requires heightened scrutiny only where the government requires
speakers (i) to endorse (or subsidize) a specific message;32 (ii) to alter the content

32

The disclosures of commercial payment information required by Section
13(q) are a “far cry” from the types of government-endorsed messages that have
warranted strict scrutiny. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional
Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 62 (2006); see, e.g., Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705
(1977) (applying strict scrutiny to a state’s requirement that motorists display the
state motto—“Live Free or Die”—on their license plates); Speiser v. Randall, 357
U.S. 513, 518-19 (1958) (applying heightened scrutiny to a requirement that
veterans, as a condition of receiving property tax exemption, declare that they do
not advocate the forcible overthrow of government).
57

of their own message; 33 or (iii) to suffer an infringement of their rights to
association or belief.34
In marked contrast, Section 13(q) requires disclosures by regulated entities
of accurate, factual information regarding payments made in furtherance of their
business activities. It does not require anyone to express a view or otherwise
endorse a message with which he or she disagrees,35 or to alter the content of his or

33

See, e.g., Riley v. Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 795
(1988) (applying strict scrutiny to a requirement that, as part of a solicitation,
professional fundraisers disclose to potential donors the percentage of charitable
contributions collected during the previous twelve months actually turned over to
charity; explaining that “[m]andating speech that a speaker would not otherwise
make,” even factual information, “necessarily alters the content of the [protected]
speech”); see also, e.g., Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, 650-51 (1985) (applying heightened rational basis
review to a government requirement that compelled factual disclosures in
advertisements to prevent consumer deception); SEC v. Wall Street Publ’g Inst.,
851 F.2d 365, 373 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (same) (applying First Amendment scrutiny to
a securities law disclosure requirement in the context of magazine articles).

34

See, e.g., John Doe No. 1 v. Reed, 130 S.Ct. 2811, 2818 (2010) (applying
intermediate scrutiny to a public disclosure requirement for the names on a petition
seeking a referendum)); id. at 2839 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (arguing that strict
scrutiny should apply because disclosure of the names of signatories on the petition
threatens signatories’ privacy interests in their political associations); Gibson v. Fl.
Legislative Investigation Committee, 372 U.S. 539, 557 (1963) (applying
heightened scrutiny to an attempt to require the disclosure of the identity and
members of, and contributors to, the local and state NAACP organization); Bates v.
City of Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516 (1960) (same).

35

Cf. Environmental Defense Ctr. v. EPA, 344 F.3d 832, 849 (9th Cir. 2003)
(“The State may not constitutionally require an individual to disseminate an
ideological message, but requiring a provider of storm sewers that discharge into
national waters to educate the public about the impacts of stormwater discharge on
58

her own message.36 Nor does it threaten to chill issuers’ First Amendment rights
of association or belief. 37
Nor does Section 13(q) impose regulation on commercial speech by
requiring warnings or disclosures in a seller’s advertising as was the case in the
provisions at issue in cases such as Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of
the Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626 (1985), and Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz
v. United States, 130 S.Ct. 1324 (2010). Yet, even when the government does
regulate commercial speech in this manner, the Supreme Court and this Court have
emphasized that accurate, factual disclosure requirements do not prohibit speech
and therefore are not subject even to intermediate scrutiny, much less to the strict
water bodies and to inform affected parties, including the public, about the hazards
of improper waste disposal falls short of compelling such speech.”) (internal
citation omitted).
36

Significantly, issuers are not required to disclose the payment information
either as part of, or as a condition of, other communications that they desire to
make. Section 13(q) and Rule 13q-1 provide for information to be filed on Form
SD with the Commission and thereby disseminated to the public through the
Commission’s EDGAR filing system. The Supreme Court has previously
indicated that this format of public distribution of factual information satisfies First
Amendment scrutiny. See Riley, 487 U.S. at 800 (explaining that if the state had
instead “publish[ed] the detailed financial disclosure forms it requires professional
fundraisers to file,” then “[t]his procedure would communicate the desired
information to the public without burdening a speaker with unwanted speech
during the course of a solicitation,” thereby avoiding the First Amendment
difficulties).

37

At most, the disclosures may result in some lost commercial opportunities,
but this surely is not the type of associational interest that the First Amendment
protects.
59

scrutiny advocated by petitioners here. See, e.g., Zauderer, 471 U.S. at 650 (noting
that disclosure requirements do not prevent sellers “from conveying information to
the public” but instead merely require sellers to provide “more information than
they might otherwise be inclined to present”); Milavetz, 130 S. Ct. at 1340
(disclosure requirements do not prevent sellers “from conveying any additional
information”); Spirit Airlines, Inc. v. Dep’t of Transp., 687 F.3d 403, 414 (D.C.
Cir. 2012) (noting that rule requiring the most prominent cost figure in airline
advertisements be the final airfare “does not prohibit airlines from saying
anything”).
That the mandated disclosures serve a transparency goal and contribute to
the overall fund of public knowledge does not undermine the conclusion that
Section 13(q) does not violate the First Amendment. Many government disclosure
requirements are similarly aimed at promoting private sector and governmental
accountability, but that has never been thought to undermine the constitutional
validity of these common-sense public policies.
In any event, Section 13(q) survives review under any standard. The
disclosure requirement serves the substantial and compelling governmental interest
of enhancing resource extraction transparency through the public disclosure of
payment information, thereby helping to reduce global poverty, promote better
governance, and advance U.S. energy and anti-terrorism interests. See 156 Cong.
60

Rec. 3816 (May 17, 2010) (Sen. Lugar) (explaining that extractive industry
transparency improves investment climates for U.S. companies abroad, increases
the reliability of commodity supplies, and promotes greater energy security). And
Congress’s judgment that Section 13(q) is necessary to promote these
governmental interests is entitled to deference. See, e.g., Citizens for Peace in
Space v. City of Colorado Springs, 477 F.3d 1212, 1221-22 (10th Cir. 2007)
(“Courts have historically given special deference to other branches in matters
relating to foreign affairs, international relations, and national security; even when
constitutional rights are invoked by a plaintiff.”).
Petitioners erroneously assert (at 34) that Section 13(q)’s objectives are
“insufficiently compelling” because “the Commission made no finding that the
required disclosures would actually benefit foreign citizens by increasing the
accountability of their governments.” This Court has already rejected a variation
on this argument, which at base rests on the false assumption that Congress may
require disclosures to promote transparency and accountability only after
undertaking an empirical analysis. See, e.g., Nat’l Ass’n of Manufacturers v.
Taylor, 582 F.3d 1, 15-16 (D.C. Cir. 2009). As this Court explained in Taylor
when upholding a law that required lobbyists to make various disclosures about
their clients’ identity:
At bottom, this is not a case … where Congress’ justification for a
statute rested on ‘economic’ analysis that was susceptible to empirical
61

evidence. What we have instead is simply a claim that good
government requires greater transparency. This is a value judgment
based on the common sense of [members of Congress] ….
Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Similarly, although the social
benefits that Section 13(q) seeks to achieve are not empirically provable, see supra
Part I(A), that “is not a sufficient reason to find that statute unconstitutional.”
Taylor, 582 F.3d at 16 (quoting Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 62
(1973)). Indeed, the voluntary participation of many of petitioners’ members in
EITI demonstrates that even they recognize both that there is a problem in these
resource-rich countries and that transparency is a mechanism for addressing it.
Lastly, petitioners erroneously claim (at 36-37) that Section 13(q) is not
narrowly tailored because there “are a range of other means the government
ordinarily deploys” to promote transparency and good governance “including
diplomacy, foreign aid, and support for NGOs,” as well as EITI. Petitioners ignore
that Congress, which was plainly aware of each of these “other means” when it
enacted Section 13(q), decided that mandatory disclosure was needed not as an
alternative to these existing efforts, but as a necessary complement to them. See,
e.g., Exchange Act Section 13(q)(2)(E) (“shall support the commitment of the
Federal Government to international transparency promotion”); JA536 (letter from
U.S. Agency for International Development: “Vigorous implementation of Section
[13(q)] could contribute to the efficient and effective use of U.S. development
62

dollars and complement U.S. development strategies ….”). And Secretary of State
Clinton has publicly declared just how important the Section 13(q) disclosures will
be to U.S. foreign policy efforts: “[W]e do think [the Cardin-Lugar Amendment]
will have a very profound effect on our ability to try to help manage some of the
worst practices that we see in the extractive industry and in the relationships with
governments at local and national levels around the world.” 38 These foreign policy
assessments of Section 13(q)’s importance deserve deference.

Because all of petitioners’ challenges fail for the reasons discussed above,
their request for vacatur must be denied. In any event, the appropriate remedy is
assessed on a case-by-case basis. See Allied-Signal, Inc. v. NRC, 988 F.2d 146,
