In the Matter of
DC BRANDS
INTERNATIONAL INC.,

ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS AND NOTICE OF HEARING
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(j) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby
are, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”),
against DC Brands International Inc. (“DC Brands” or “Respondent”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A. RESPONDENT
1. DC Brands International Inc. (CIK 0001393463) (ticker symbol “HRDN”) is a
Colorado corporation, headquartered in Denver, Colorado. Its corporate status according to the
Colorado Secretary of State is delinquent. Although it has frequently changed its business focus,
DC Brands was most recently purportedly in the marijuana services industry. At all relevant times,
the common stock of DC Brands was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of
the Exchange Act and quoted on OTC Link, operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc.
B. DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS
2. Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers
with classes of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the
Commission current and accurate information in periodic reports. Specifically, Rule 13a-1
requires issuers to file annual reports and Rule 13a-13 requires issuers to file quarterly reports.

3. DC Brands filed its last annual report on Form 10-K on April 15, 2014 and its last
quarterly report on Form10-Q on August 19, 2014. On November 20, 2014, DC Brands filed a
Form 8-K that disclosed that on November 19, 2014, DC Brands and its subsidiary DC Brands
Green Investors LLC had “ceased operations.” DC Brands is now over a year delinquent it its
required periodic filings. Specifically, it has failed to file the following required periodic filings:


for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 (due November 15, 2014)
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (due March 31, 2015)
for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 (due May 15, 2015)
for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 (due August 15, 2015)
for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 (due November 15, 2015).

4. As a result of the foregoing, DC Brands has failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems
it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings
be instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations contained in Section II are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and,
B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of, each class of securities
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of DC Brands identified in Section II
hereof, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate
name of Respondent.
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the
questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and
before an Administrative Law Judge to be designed by further order as provided by Rule 110 of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule
220(b) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220].
If Respondent fails to file the directed Answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being
duly notified, the Respondent, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and
any new corporate name of the Respondent, may be deemed in default and the proceedings may
be determined against it upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be

2

deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the Commission’s
Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310].
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified,
registered or Express mail, or by other means permitted by Commission’s Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2)
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2)].
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except
as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule
making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not
deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final
Commission action.
By the Commission.
