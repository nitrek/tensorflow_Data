ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-15764
In the Matter of
ORDER
GARY L. MCDUFF
The hearing in this proceeding is currently scheduled for June 15 through June 16, 2016,
at FCI Beaumont, where Respondent Gary L. McDuff is currently incarcerated. Gary L. McDuff,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3787, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1405 (ALJ Apr. 18, 2016).
On June 3, 2016, this office received a letter, written in Spanish and addressed to me,
followed by twenty-seven pages of signatures. McDuffâ€™s name appears several times in the
letter. Because the document is untranslated, I am unable to consider it. My office has
forwarded a copy to the Division of Enforcement and the Office of the Secretary. If Respondent
wishes for me to consider this document, he should have a translation provided to the Office of
the Secretary and the Division, with a courtesy copy sent to me.
