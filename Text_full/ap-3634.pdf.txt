In the Matter of
STAY ORDER
JASON BO-ALAN BECKMAN

On February 22, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a motion to stay this
proceeding. The Division represents that the parties have agreed in principle to a settlement of
this proceeding on all major terms and that it has mailed to Respondent a proposed settlement
offer. The Division further represents that although a joint motion was not filed by the parties
due to Respondent’s incarcerated status, both parties request the stay and Respondent consents to
its motion.
I construe the motion as a joint motion to stay within the meaning of Rule of Practice
161(c)(2). The motion is GRANTED and this proceeding is STAYED, subject to compliance
with that rule, requiring that this office be notified promptly if any of the requirements of the rule
are not met. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(c)(2).
In light of the stay, the hearing scheduled for March 7, 2016, is CANCELED.
