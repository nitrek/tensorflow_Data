INITIAL DECISION MAKING FINDINGS AND
IMPOSING SANCTIONS BY DEFAULT
February 18, 2015

APPEARANCES:

Martin Healey for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision (ID) concludes that Albert Reda (Reda) violated the antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws. The ID orders him to cease and desist from further
violations and imposes penny stock and officer and director bars.
I. BACKGROUND
The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) instituted this proceeding with
an Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on September 22, 2014, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and
21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The OIP alleges that Reda
willfully violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a) thereunder through his
activities in the purchase and sale of securities that involved a fraudulent scheme in which
insiders of publicly-traded penny stock companies paid secret kickbacks to a purported corrupt
hedge fund manager.
Reda was served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(i) on
November 7, 2014. To date, he has failed to file an Answer to the OIP, due twenty days after he
was served. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Additionally, he did not appear at a
prehearing conference of which he had been notified. The Division of Enforcement (Division)
filed a Motion for Default on January 23, 2015, and Reda was ordered to show cause, by
February 13, 2015, why the sanctions requested by the Division should not be imposed. Albert
Reda, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2251, 2015 SEC LEXIS 269 (A.L.J. Jan. 23, 2015). He
did not respond. Accordingly, Reda has failed to answer, to appear at a prehearing conference of
which he had been notified, or otherwise to defend the proceeding within the meaning of 17
C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2). See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f). Accordingly, he

is in default, and the undersigned finds that the allegations in the OIP are true as to him. See OIP
at 4; 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a).
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
Reda was convicted after a jury trial in 2013 of mail and wire fraud, in violation of 18
U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, in United States v. Reda, 1:11-cr-10416 (D. Mass. Mar. 11, 2014).1 He
was sentenced to twenty-six months of imprisonment, followed by one year of supervised
release, fined $6,000, and ordered to forfeit $16,000 in proceeds traceable to his violations. Id.,
ECF Nos. 208, 208-1. The events at issue in United States v. Reda and the instant proceeding
arose from a fraudulent scheme in which insiders of publicly-traded penny stock companies paid
secret kickbacks to a purported corrupt hedge fund manager, who was actually an undercover
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, in exchange for the agent’s purchase of restricted
stock of penny stock companies on behalf of his purported (and nonexistent) hedge fund.
Reda, age 67, a California resident, was Treasurer of 1st Global Financial, Inc. (1st
Global) and a member of its Board of Directors. From June 30 through July 6, 2011, Reda
participated in an offering of the stock of 1st Global, which is a penny stock. During that time
Reda met with the FBI agent, who told Reda that he was prepared to invest up to $5 million of
the hedge fund’s money in a series of tranches, with 50% being kicked back to the FBI agent.
They agreed to disguise the kickbacks as payments for bogus consulting services purportedly
provided by a consulting company controlled by the agent. Reda sent the agent documents
related to the kickback transaction and consulting agreement. Then, in accordance with wiring
instructions provided by Reda, $32,000 was sent by interstate wire transfer from the purported
hedge fund’s purported account to a 1st Global bank account. Then, Reda caused a stock
certificate representing the hedge fund’s purchase of 1st Global shares to be sent to the FBI agent
and caused $16,000 to be sent by interstate wire transfer from a 1st Global bank account to an
account in the name of the agent’s purported consulting company.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
The OIP charges that Reda willfully violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule
10b-5(a) thereunder. As discussed below, it is concluded that these charges were proved.
A. Antifraud Provisions
Exchange Act Section 10(b) makes it unlawful to “use or employ, in connection with the
purchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in
contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe.” Rule 10b-5(a)
makes it unlawful, by jurisdictional means, to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.
As described in the Findings of Fact, Reda was involved in the sale of 1st Global stock,
which is a security. Further, as shown by his conviction for mail and wire fraud, he was
involved in a “scheme, or artifice to defraud.” “The elements of wire fraud, as prescribed under
1

Official notice, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323, is taken of the docket report and the court’s
orders in United States v. Reda.
2

18 U.S.C. § 1343 are as follows: (1) a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) use of interstate wire
communications in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) intent to deprive a victim of money or
property.” United States v. Prince, 214 F.3d 740, 747-48 (6th Cir. 2000) (internal footnotes
omitted). Accordingly, Reda violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a).
IV. SANCTIONS
As the Division requests, a cease-and-desist order, a penny stock bar, and an officer and
director bar will be ordered.
A. Sanction Considerations
In determining sanctions, the Commission considers such factors as:
the egregiousness of the defendant’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant’s
assurances against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful
nature of his conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant’s occupation will
present opportunities for future violations.
Steadman, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334 n.29
(5th Cir. 1978)). The Commission also considers the age of the violation and the degree of harm
to investors and the marketplace resulting from the violation. Marshall E. Melton, Exchange Act
Release No. 48228, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *4-5 (July 25, 2003). Additionally, the
Commission considers the extent to which the sanction will have a deterrent effect. Schield
Mgmt. Co., Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS 195, at *35-36 & n.46 (Jan. 31,
2006). As the Commission has often emphasized, the public interest determination extends to
the public-at-large, the welfare of investors as a class, and standards of conduct in the securities
business generally. See Christopher A. Lowry, Investment Company Act of 1940, Release No.
2052, 2002 SEC LEXIS 2346, at *20 (Aug. 30, 2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003);
Arthur Lipper Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 11773, 1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at *52 (Oct. 24,
1975). The amount of a sanction depends on the facts of each case and the value of the sanction
in preventing a recurrence. See Berko v. SEC, 316 F.2d 137, 141 (2d Cir. 1963); Leo Glassman,
Exchange Act Release No. 11929, 1975 SEC LEXIS 111, at *7 (Dec. 16, 1975).
B. Sanctions
1. Cease and Desist
Exchange Act Section 21C(a) authorizes the Commission to issue a cease-and-desist
order against a person who “is violating, has violated, or is about to violate” any provision of the
Exchange Act or rules thereunder. Whether there is a reasonable likelihood of such violations in
the future must be considered. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, Exchange Act Release No. 43862,
2001 SEC LEXIS 98, at *101 (Jan. 19, 2001). Such a showing is “significantly less than that
required for an injunction.” Id. at 114. In determining whether a cease-and-desist order is
appropriate, the Commission considers the Steadman factors quoted above, as well as the

3

recency of the violation, the degree of harm to investors or the marketplace, and the combination
of sanctions against the respondent. See WHX Corp. v. SEC, 362 F.3d 854, 859-61 (D.C. Cir.
2004); KPMG Peat Marwick, 2001 SEC LEXIS 98, at *116.
Reda’s conduct was egregious and had a high degree of scienter as shown by his
conviction for mail and wire fraud. The record contains no assurances against future violations
or recognition of the wrongful nature of the conduct. The violations were relatively recent, in
2011. Harm to the marketplace is evident from the dishonest nature of Reda’s misconduct. In
light of these considerations, a cease-and-desist order is appropriate.
2. Penny Stock Bar
Combined with other sanctions ordered, a penny stock bar is in the public interest and an
appropriate deterrent. The violations involved a penny stock, and the same reasons that support
a cease-and-desist order support a penny stock bar. Reda’s conviction for mail and wire fraud
provides a separate basis in itself for a penny stock bar. Reda has been convicted “within 10
years of the commencement of [this proceeding]” of a felony that “involves the violation of
section . . . 1341 . . . or 1343 . . . of title 18, United States Code” within the meaning of Sections
15(b)(4)(B)(iv) and 15(b)(6)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act.
3. Officer and Director Bar
Exchange Act Section 21C(f) authorizes a bar against a respondent who has violated
Exchange Act Section 10(b) from acting as an officer or director of any issuer with a class of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 or that is required to file reports
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(d), “if the conduct of that person demonstrates unfitness to
serve as an officer or director of any such issuer.” In line with the reasoning in Joseph P. Doxey,
Initial Decision Release No. 598, 2014 SEC LEXIS 1668, at *74-78 (A.L.J. May 15, 2014), the
so-called Patel factors2 will be considered in addition to the Steadman factors in evaluating the
appropriateness of this sanction.
As discussed above, Reda violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) while acting with scienter
and awareness of the deceptive and manipulative nature of his conduct. As an officer and
director of 1st Global, Reda was at the center of the fraud. Without an officer and director bar,
Reda would be free to assume officer and director roles in the future. Thus, it is appropriate and
in the public interest to impose a permanent officer and director bar against Reda. He will be
barred from acting as an officer or director of any issuer with a class of securities registered
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 or that is required to file reports pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 15(d).

2

The Patel factors are: (1) the egregiousness of the underlying securities law violation; (2)
recidivism; (3) the defendant’s role or position in the fraud; (4) degree of scienter; (5) the
defendant’s economic stake in the violation; and (6) the likelihood of recurrence. SEC v.
Bankosky, 716 F.3d 45, 48 (2d Cir. 2013); SEC v. Patel, 61 F.3d 137, 141 (2d Cir. 1995).
