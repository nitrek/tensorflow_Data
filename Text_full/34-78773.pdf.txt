ORDER GRANTING EXTENSION
OF TIME AND TO EXCEED
LENGTH LIMITATION FOR
REPLY BRIEF

for Review of Actions Taken by
Self-Regulatory Organizations

On August 16, 2016, the Commission issued an Order Granting Petition for Review and
Scheduling Briefs, in which the Commission ordered, pursuant to Rule of Practice 450(a), that a
brief in support of the petition for review shall be filed by September 15, 2016, briefs in opposition
shall be filed by October 17, 2016, and any reply brief shall be filed by October 31, 2016. On
August 31, 2016, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) filed a motion
to extend the briefing schedule and word limits, joined in part by NYSE Arca and NASDAQ (the
Exchanges). The Exchanges consent to SIFMA’s proposed briefing schedule and the 3,000-word
enlargement of the word limit for SIFMA’s reply brief, but oppose SIFMA’s request for additional
words in its opening brief.
The briefing schedule noted that pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 161,1
extensions of time are disfavored. Rule 450(c) provides that motions to file briefs in excess of the
Rule’s limitations are also disfavored.2 It appears appropriate, however, to grant SIFMA’s
request in part and deny it in part as set forth below.

Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, that SIFMA’s brief in support of the petition for review be
filed by September 22, 2016 and total no more than 14,000 words, the Exchanges’ briefs in
opposition be filed by November 7, 2016 and total no more than 14,000 words each, and SIFMA’s
reply brief be filed by December 7, 2016 and total no more than 10,000 words.
For the Commission, by the Office of the Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Deputy Secretary
