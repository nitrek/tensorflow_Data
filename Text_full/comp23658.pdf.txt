COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION
1.

The Commission brings this action against Craig V. Sizer and Miguel Mesa

(collectively “Defendants”) for violating the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions
of the federal securities laws and thereby defrauding at least 600 investors nationwide out of
approximately $20 million.
2.

Beginning at least as early as 2009 and until August 2015, Defendant Sizer hired

Mesa to operate boiler-rooms in South Florida and Southern California to sell shares of
Sanomedics, Inc. (“Sanomedics”) and Fun Cool Free, Inc. (“Fun Cool Free”) (collectively “the
Companies”). Sizer provided Mesa with pitch points for the boiler-room sales agents containing
materially misleading statements regarding the Defendants’ use of investor proceeds, which
Mesa used to draft materially misleading boiler-room sales scripts. Mesa hired and oversaw
boiler room sales agents who used the sales scripts to cold-call and fraudulently convince
investors to purchase shares of the Companies’ stock.

Case 1:16-cv-24106-JAL Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/26/2016 Page 2 of 14

3.

Sizer, directly and through Mesa’s boiler room sales agents, and Mesa, through

his boiler room sales agents, made material misrepresentations and omissions to investors in the
Companies’ stock regarding the payment of commissions to the sales agents. At Sizer and
Mesa’s instructions, sales agents falsely told investors that no commissions or fees would be
charged or paid for their purchase of Sanomedics and Fun Cool Free stock. Contrary to the
representations made to investors and with Sizer’s agreement, Mesa used investor funds to pay
commissions of between 15% and 20% to the sales agents. At times, Sizer also solicited
investors directly by telephone and sold shares of the Companies’ stock to investors using these
misrepresentations and omissions.
4.

Mesa also took active steps to conceal the boiler room operation by directing sales

agents to falsely represent that they were employees of Sanomedics or Fun Cool Free.
5.

Sizer, directly and through Mesa’s boiler room sales agents, and Mesa, through

his boiler room sales agents, also made material misrepresentations and omissions to prospective
investors regarding the use of the funds provided by the investors. Sizer and Mesa directed the
sales agents to represent that the funds would be invested in the Companies, including research
and development for Sanomedics and the acquisition of another company for Fun Cool Free.
Instead, Sizer and Mesa misappropriated approximately 90% of the investor proceeds they
raised.
6.

Defendant Sizer used at least $3 million of misappropriated investor proceeds for

his own personal benefit, including paying for personal expenses such as credit cards, residential
renovations, luxury automobiles, and mortgage payments, and through ATM withdrawals and
checks written to himself and others. Defendant Mesa used his share of the misappropriated

2

Case 1:16-cv-24106-JAL Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/26/2016 Page 3 of 14

investor funds to finance the boiler room operation, pay commissions to his boiler-room sales
agents, and for his own use and personal benefit.
7.

Moreover, because Defendant Mesa was not registered with the Commission as a

broker or dealer, he acted as an unregistered broker in violation of the registration requirements
of the federal securities laws when he offered and sold shares of the Companies’ stock to
investors. Defendant Sizer aided and abetted Defendant Mesa in acting as an unregistered broker
by hiring Mesa to operate the boiler room knowing that (1) Mesa was not registered with the
Commission as a broker or dealer, and (2) that Mesa would hire and direct the boiler-room sales
agents to offer and sell shares of the Companies’ stock and pay them commissions.
8.

Through their fraudulent conduct, the Defendants received millions of dollars of

investor proceeds by violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5
thereunder. In addition, Defendant Mesa violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and
Defendant Sizer aided and abetted Defendant Mesa’s violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange
Act. Unless restrained and enjoined, the Defendants are reasonably likely to engage in future
violations of the federal securities laws.
THE DEFENDANTS
9.

Sizer, age 48, a resident of Aventura, Florida, was the co-founder and former

Chief Executive Officer of Sanomedics and the former president and chairman of Fun Cool Free.
Sizer was a registered representative formerly associated with the broker-dealers Investors

10.

Mesa, age 56, a resident of Miami Lakes, Florida, hired unregistered sales agents

to offer and sell to investors the securities of Sanomedics and Fun Cool Free. In 2004 and 2006,
the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) charged Mesa in separate civil
injunctive actions alleging antifraud violations involving trading in futures contracts and options.
See, CFTC v. Brickell Key Financial, LLC, et. al., Case No. 04-22549-CIV-PAS (S.D.FL. 2004);
and CFTC v. First International Group, Inc., Case No. 06-20979-CIV-AJ (S.D.FL. 2006). Final
judgments in those two cases were entered against Mesa enjoining him from future violation of
laws related to commodities futures transactions and he was permanently barred from the
commodities industry. Mesa is not, and was not at the time of the conduct described herein,
registered with the Commission as a broker or dealer or associated with one.
BACKGROUND OF THE COMPANIES
A. Sanomedics
11.

Sanomedics, f/k/a “Sanomedics International Holdings, Inc.,” is a Delaware

corporation with its principal place of business in Miami, Florida. It is purportedly in the
business of developing and selling non-contact infrared thermometers. It became a publicly
traded company in July 2009 through a reverse merger with a public shell company. It has been
an SEC-reporting company since October 27, 2010 and is quoted on OTC Link, which is
operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., under the symbol “SIMH.”

Sizer was a founder of

Sanomedics in 2009 and served as its Chief Executive Officer and director until in or about
August 2012. Sanomedics’ stock is a “penny stock” as defined by the Exchange Act. At all
times relevant to this action, the stock’s shares traded at less than one dollar per share. During
the same time period, Sanomedics’ stock did not meet any of the exceptions to penny stock
classification pursuant to Exchange Act Section 3(a)(51), 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(51), and Rule 3a51-

4

Case 1:16-cv-24106-JAL Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/26/2016 Page 5 of 14

1, 17 C.F.R. § 240.3a51-1. For example Sanomedics’ stock: (a) did not trade on a national
securities exchange; (b) was not an “NMS stock,” as defined in 17 C.F.R. § 242.600(b)(47); (c)
did not have tangible assets (i.e., total assets less intangible assets and liabilities) in excess of
$5,000,000; and (d) did not have average revenue of approximately $6,000,000 for the last three
years. See Exchange Act, Rule 3a51-1(g).
B. Fun Cool Free
12.

Fun Cool Free was incorporated in Delaware on or about November 7, 2014. Fun

Cool Free has its principal place of business in Miami, Florida. It is purportedly a distributor of
software applications (“apps”). Sizer was the president and a director of Fun Cool Free until
August 2015.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
13.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and

22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a)], and Sections 21(d), 21(e),
and 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa(a)].
14.

This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants and venue is proper in

the Southern District of Florida because many of the acts and transactions constituting the
violations alleged in this complaint occurred in this District. Moreover, Defendants reside in the
Southern District of Florida and Sanomedics and Fun Cool Free had their principal offices in this
District.
15.

In connection with the conduct alleged in the complaint, Defendants, directly or

indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce or the mails.

THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME
A.

The Fraudulent Offer and Sale of Sanomedics Stock

16.

Beginning in 2009, Sizer acquired and gained control over a substantial number

of shares of Sanomedics stock. In 2009, Mesa operated unregistered boiler rooms in South
Florida and Southern California. Sizer engaged Mesa and Mesa’s boiler room operation to
market and sell restricted shares of Sanomedics stock to the public. At the time, Sizer knew that
Mesa was not registered with the Commission as a broker or dealer.
17.

Beginning in 2009 and continuing until approximately mid-2014, Mesa

supervised his boiler room sales agents as they solicited prospective investors, many of whom
were elderly and unsophisticated, through cold calling, thereby raising approximately $18
million from the sale of restricted common shares of Sanomedics stock. Sizer provided Mesa
pitch points to be used to sell the shares of stock, including a representation that no commissions
would be paid on the purchase of Sanomedics stock.
18.

Mesa employed at least seven sales agents, purchased lists of contact information

for prospective investors, and told the sales agents that they did not need to be licensed to sell the
stock.

Mesa drafted sales scripts containing material misrepresentations and omissions,

including misrepresenting that the sales agents were not paid commissions, and provided the
sales scripts to the sales agents. Mesa instructed sales agents to tell investors that their money
would be used by the company for research and development. At times, Mesa monitored the
sales agents’ calls as they solicited prospective investors and directed them as to what to tell
prospective investors.
19.

Acting on Mesa’s instructions, the sales agents offered and sold investors shares

of restricted Sanomedics stock at prices set by Sizer and Mesa that ranged from $0.05 - $2.50 per

6

Case 1:16-cv-24106-JAL Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/26/2016 Page 7 of 14

share. The sales agents used high pressure sales tactics and promised lucrative profits. For
example, sales agents told investors that a limited number of shares of stock were available at a
discount from the market price, guaranteeing them a considerable profit.
20.

Sizer and Mesa agreed that Mesa would instruct the sales agents to tell investors

that there was no commission paid to the sales agents, when in fact, Mesa used between 15-20%
of the investor funds to pay such commissions.

Sales agents, knowing they were paid

commissions, either misrepresented to investors that there were no fees or commissions paid
for the purchase of the Sanomedics stock or failed to disclose the commissions to investors. In
order to conceal and further the fraud, the sales agents used false names with investors and
falsely told investors that they were employees of Sanomedics. At times, sales agents falsely
told investors that they were paid in shares of Sanomedics stock.
21.

Sizer also personally spoke with some investors.

Sizer marketed and sold

Sanomedics stock to investors by making some of the same misrepresentations made by the
boiler room sales agents. Sizer and the sales agents falsely touted Sanomedics as a profitable
investment that was raising investor funds to develop and grow its non-contact thermometer
business. Sizer also told investors that he was a large investor and co-founder of Sanomedics
and falsely reassured them that Sanomedics was a good value and would likely rise in price.
22.

Sizer, Mesa, and the sales agents raised approximately $18 million selling shares

of Sanomedics to more than 600 investors nationwide. Sizer and Mesa split the approximate $18
million, and Mesa paid 15-20% of the funds he misappropriated to the sales agents as
commissions. Sizer was aware and agreed to the payment of commissions to the sales agents.

B.

The Fraudulent Offer and Sale of Fun Cool Free Stock

23.

By mid-2014, Sanomedics’ public share price had declined significantly making

it difficult to continue the fraudulent offer and sale of its shares, so Sizer procured Fun Cool Free
as another vehicle to continue the fraud scheme. Sizer again engaged Mesa and his unregistered
boiler rooms to solicit investors to purchase shares of Fun Cool Free stock. As before, Mesa’s
sales agents used high pressure sales tactics to offer and sell Fun Cool Free stock emphasizing
that investors needed to act immediately or risk missing a lucrative opportunity.

And, as with

Sanomedics, Sizer and the sales agents materially misrepresented to investors that Fun Cool Free
investor proceeds would not be used to pay sales commissions.
24.

Sizer, Mesa and their sales agents raised approximately $1.4 million through the

sale of Fun Cool Free shares to nearly 70 investors nationwide. Sizer and Mesa split the
approximate $1.4 million, and Mesa paid 15-20% of the funds he misappropriated to the sales
agents as commissions. Sizer was aware and agreed to the payment of commissions to the sales
agents.
