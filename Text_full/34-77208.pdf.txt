the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR 201.1101(a).

Respondent misappropriated $1,000,000 in investor funds raised for Premiere Power,
LLC (“Premiere”).
The Order required Respondent to pay disgorgement of $1,000,000,
prejudgment interest of $164,000 and civil penalties of $250,000 to the Commission to
be made in equal installments of $353,500 according to the following schedule: (1)

In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that it requires
additional time to develop the proposed plan of distribution.

Division’s request for an extension of time until May 30, 2016 to submit a proposed
Plan of Distribution is granted.
