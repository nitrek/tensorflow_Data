ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On June 15, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. To date, no Respondent except for Advanced Life Sciences Holdings, Inc., has filed an
answer to the OIP. I scheduled a prehearing conference for July 20, 2016, and ordered
respondents Anoteros, Inc., Emperial Americas, Inc., Nord Resources Corporation, and UNR
Holdings, Inc., to show cause by July 18, 2016, why this proceeding should not be determined
against them due to their failures to file answers or otherwise defend this proceeding. Advanced
Life Scis. Holdings, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3965, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2350 (ALJ
July 6, 2016). To date, none of those respondents has responded to my show cause order.
At today’s prehearing conference, the Division of Enforcement and Respondent
Advanced Life appeared. As discussed during the conference, I ORDER that: the Division’s
motion for summary disposition is due August 10, 2016; Advanced Life’s opposition is due
August 31, 2016; and the Division’s reply is due September 12, 2016. In addition to the required
filing with the Office of the Secretary, an electronic courtesy copy of each filing should be
emailed to alj@sec.gov in PDF text-searchable format. Any exhibits should be sent as separate
attachments, not a combined PDF.
