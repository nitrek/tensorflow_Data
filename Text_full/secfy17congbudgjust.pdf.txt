AGENCY AND MISSION INFORMATION

Executive Summary
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the
agency) is pleased to submit its budget request for Fiscal Year
(FY) 2017. The SEC is requesting $1.781 billion in support
of 5,196 positions and 4,870 full time equivalents (FTE) for
FY 2017. This requested budget level is essential to support
the agency’s mission to protect investors, maintain fair,
orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.
In recent years, the SEC has made substantial progress in
strengthening its operations and programs. The agency has
proposed or adopted nearly all of the mandatory rulemakings
required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), in addition to advancing
other key rules in mission critical areas that protect investors
and our markets. These efforts have included final rules
addressing over-the-counter derivatives; new means for
small businesses to access capital (including rules to update
Regulation A and permit securities-based crowdfunding
offerings); executive compensation disclosures; and the
removal of references to credit ratings from SEC rules.
In addition to implementing congressionally mandated rules,
the SEC has also advanced other important policy objectives,
including rules to enhance oversight of high-frequency traders
and the agency’s supervision of investment advisers and
mutual funds, including reforms to money market mutual
funds; as well as adopting requirements for comprehensive
new controls at critical market participants to strengthen key
technological systems.
Beyond the rulemakings, the SEC has intensified its review of
equity and fixed income market structure issues, undertaken
a disclosure effectiveness initiative seeking ways to improve
the public company disclosure regime for investors and
companies, and continued to act aggressively to hold
securities law violators accountable. Broad, systemic
enhancements in the SEC’s National Examination Program
(NEP) – including increased recruitment of industry experts,
the augmentation of data analytics capacities, and enhanced
training programs – have led to a more effective, efficient
program. The agency also is increasingly harnessing
technology to better identify risks, uncover frauds, sift
through large volumes of data, inform policymaking, and
streamline operations, while at the same time improving

internal collaboration and recruiting more staff with
specialized expertise and experience.
While these and other critical improvements have been
made, challenges remain in the agency’s efforts to address
the growing size and complexities of the securities markets
and fulfill the SEC’s broad mandates and responsibilities.
Currently the SEC is charged with overseeing over 26,000
market participants, including nearly 12,000 investment
advisers, nearly 11,000 mutual funds and exchange
traded funds, over 4,000 broker-dealers, and over 400
transfer agents. The agency also oversees 18 national
securities exchanges, 10 credit rating agencies, and six
active registered clearing agencies, as well as the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SIPC), and the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB). In addition, the SEC is responsible for
selectively reviewing the disclosures and financial statements
of over 9,100 reporting companies.
Beyond this, in recent years the SEC’s responsibilities have
dramatically increased, with new or expanded jurisdiction
over securities-based derivatives, hedge fund and other
private fund advisers, credit rating agencies, municipal
advisors, and clearing agencies, as well as a requirement
to implement and oversee a new regime for crowdfunding
offerings, among other responsibilities. As the size and
complexity of the entities in the SEC’s jurisdiction grows,
so too has the size and complexity of the markets and
entities the SEC regulates. From 2001 to 2015, assets
under management of SEC-registered advisers increased
approximately 210 percent from $21.5 trillion to approximately
$66.8 trillion, and assets under management of mutual funds
grew by almost 125 percent from $7 trillion to over $15 trillion.
Trading volume in the equity markets for 2015 was in excess
of $70 trillion compared to over $55 trillion in 2009.
The SEC appreciates the confidence that Congress and the
President have placed in it in recent appropriation cycles,
with enacted budgets that are permitting the SEC to begin
to address longstanding resource challenges. In light of the
continuing growth in the industry and the enormity of the

AGENCY AND MISSION INFORMATION

responsibilities now placed on the agency, however, additional
funding is critical. The SEC must be able to keep pace with
the always expanding complexity of the entities, markets, and
industries it regulates when the integrity of our markets and
Americans’ savings for college, retirement, and other financial
goals are at stake. In assessing the appropriate budget for
the SEC, it is critical that the SEC’s funding is deficit-neutral,
which means that any amount appropriated to the agency will
be offset by modest transaction fees and therefore will not
impact the deficit or the funding available for other agencies.
As described in more detail below, this budget request
seeks to:
•	 Increase examination coverage of investment advisers
and other key entities who interact with retail and
institutional investors;
•	 Further leverage cutting-edge technology to permit the
SEC to better keep pace with the entities and markets
we regulate;
•	 Protect investors by expanding our enforcement
program’s investigative capabilities and strengthen
our ability to litigate against wrongdoers;
•	 Further bolster the SEC’s economic and risk analysis
functions; and
•	 Hire experts capable of permitting the agency to fulfill
its expanded rulemaking and oversight responsibilities.

Expanding Oversight of Investment Advisers
and Strengthening Compliance
The need for significant additional resources to permit the
agency to increase its examination coverage of registered
investment advisers and investment companies cannot be
overstated. Increasing this examination coverage is vital
to the SEC’s ability to protect investors and the nation’s
securities markets.
The largest increase in entities registered with the SEC has
occurred among investment advisers: a decade ago, there
were approximately 9,000 investment advisers managing
$28 trillion in assets, while the current projection is that these
figures will grow to 12,500 investment advisers managing
more than $70 trillion in assets by FY 2017. Beyond an
increase in the number of advisers and assets under
management, additional challenges to examination staff are

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

posed by the increased use of new and complex products by
both investment advisers and broker-dealers, an increasing
use of technology in operations that facilitate activities such
as high-frequency and algorithmic trading, and the growth
of complex “families” of financial services companies with
integrated operations that include both broker-dealer and
investment adviser affiliates.
In FY 2015, SEC staff, through risk-targeted exams, examined
approximately 10 percent of registered investment advisers;
these firms manage more than 30 percent of the assets under
management of currently registered advisers. The program
also continued its emphasis on the roughly 40 percent of all
registered investment advisers that have never been examined
through the continuation of the NEP’s never before examined
adviser initiative started in 2014. Significant additional
resources are critical to improve the examination coverage
of this important industry. Under the FY 2017 request, a top
priority will be to hire 127 additional examiners, primarily to
conduct additional examinations of investment advisers.
The NEP also would add positions to improve oversight and
examination functions related to broker-dealers, clearing
agencies, transfer agents, self-regulatory organizations
(SROs), swap data repositories, municipal advisors, and
crowdfunding portals, among others.

Continue to Leverage Technology
The SEC has made substantial progress in modernizing its
technology systems, streamlining operations, increasing
our use of data analytics, and increasing the effectiveness
of its programs. The SEC’s FY 2017 budget request, which
includes full use of the Reserve Fund, seeks to build on
this progress by supporting a number of key information
technology (IT) initiatives, including:
•	 Expanding data analytic tools that assist in the integration
and analysis of huge volumes of financial market data,
employing algorithms and quantitative models that
can lead to earlier detection of fraud or suspicious
behavior and ultimately enabling the agency to allocate
its resources more effectively.
•	 Increasing investments in Information Security, to address
as a top priority – the ability to monitor and avoid
advanced persistent threats. The SEC’s IT security
program plans to focus its efforts on improved risk
management and monitoring and continuing to invest

•

AGENCY AND MISSION INFORMATION

in modernizing and securing the SEC’s infrastructure
to enhance workflow and document management,
the SEC’s electronic discovery program, operational
resiliency, and internal communications to staff.
•	 Redesigning the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and
Retrieval (EDGAR) system, an ongoing, multi-year effort
to simplify the financial reporting process to promote
automation and reduce filer burden. With a more
modern EDGAR, both the investing public and SEC staff
will benefit from having improved access to better data.
•	 Improving examinations through risk assessment and
surveillance tools that will help staff monitor for trends
and emerging fraud risks, as well as improving the
efficiency of the examination program so it can cover
higher risk areas with its resources.
•	 Enhancing the Tips, Complaints, and Referral system (TCR) to
bolster its flexibility, configurability, and adaptability. TCR
investments will provide more flexible and comprehensive
intake, triage, resolution tracking, searching, and
reporting functionalities, with full auditing capabilities.
•	 Improving enforcement investigation and litigation tracking
to better handle the substantial volume of materials
produced during investigations and litigation. Among
other initiatives, the SEC needs to build a capacity to
electronically transmit data for tracking and loading
(versus the current practice of receiving content via the
mail); implement a document management system for
Enforcement’s internal case files; and revamp the tools
used to collect trading data from market participants.
•	 Further modernize SEC.gov to make one of the most
widely used Federal Government websites more
flexible, informative, easier to navigate, and secure
for investors, public companies, registrants and the
general public.

managers, business analysts, and technical resources who
will improve technology and data management support
for the SEC’s business areas. In addition, the positions
will enhance information security through monitoring, and
drive further improvements in IT equipment management
and reporting.

Bolster Enforcement
It is vital to the SEC’s mission to bring timely, high-quality
enforcement actions when violations of the Federal securities
laws are identified. In FY 2015, the SEC brought a record
number of enforcement actions against those who defrauded
investors and violated the law – including multiple first of their
kind actions – and obtained order for monetary remedies
exceeding $4 billion. Despite these strong efforts, the agency
must continue to expand its enforcement function to keep
pace with the growing size and complexity of the nation’s
markets and to swiftly and aggressively address misconduct.
For FY 2017, the SEC is requesting 52 additional positions
for the Enforcement Division. The Division will use the
additional requested positions to support its three core
functions: intelligence analysis, investigation, and litigation.
Specifically, these additional resources will support the
Enforcement program’s current and future initiatives by,
among other things:
•	 increasing the experienced forensic accountants,
attorneys, industry experts, and information technology
and support staff needed to promptly detect, prioritize,
and investigate areas appropriate for enhanced
enforcement efforts;
•	 adding experienced trial attorneys to prosecute the
growing number of highly-complex enforcement
actions;

•	 Invest in further business process automation and
improvement, to build workflow applications that will
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency
in serving the public.

•	 enhancing Enforcement’s data analytics expertise to
assist in the implementation of data intensive projects,
state-of-the-art investigative tools (such as eDiscovery
and knowledge management), and improved forensic
capabilities; and

In addition to these planned investments, the FY 2017
request includes eight new positions for Office of Information
Technology (OIT) to better execute these and other
technology initiatives. These staff would serve as project

•	 bolstering staffing for intelligence functions, including
the collection, analysis, triage, referral, monitoring, and
follow-through on the thousands of tips, complaints
and referrals (TCRs) received each year.

AGENCY AND MISSION INFORMATION

With respect to the latter two points, analysis of large
datasets, including SEC filings and trading data in equities,
options, municipal bonds, and other securities, helps to
limit investor harm by increasing the chances of detecting
misconduct earlier. The SEC’s Enforcement program expects
the improved data analysis capabilities derived from the
agency’s investments in IT will yield additional case leads
in FY 2017. As a result, the Enforcement program would
dedicate 10 of the requested positions to further develop
its data analytic function, increasing the number of staff
responsible for reviewing and triaging incoming TCRs and
bolstering the number of staff to whom TCRs are sent for
further investigation.
The Enforcement program also requires increased staffing
to promptly detect complex frauds and other difficult-todetect misconduct, whether it occurs at hedge funds,
broker-dealers, or “boiler rooms”; respond to misconduct
in the changing equity markets relating to algorithmic trading
and “dark pools”; address large-scale insider trading and
stock manipulation; and keep pace with a rapidly evolving
industry. As a result, 30 of the new positions the Enforcement
Division is seeking in FY 2017 would be to reinforce its
investigative functions. These new positions will help the
Division continue progress on existing investigations and
handle its increasing case load, while quickly investigating
and bringing emergency actions as necessary in matters
where investors’ money may dissipate if immediate action
is not taken.
Finally, 12 of the new positions the Division is requesting in
FY 2017 would reinforce its litigation operations nationwide.
This increased allocation will enable the SEC to handle the
higher proportion of enforcement actions that are being
filed as contested matters as well as to follow through on its
commitment to litigate any case where it believes admissions
of wrongdoing are appropriate.

Focus on Economic and Risk Analysis
to Support Rulemaking and Oversight
The SEC remains committed to strengthening the economic
and risk analysis functions of its Division of Economic and
Risk Analysis (DERA) and for FY 2017 plans to add six new
positions to DERA. This additional growth would continue

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

to deepen the Division’s expertise in support of rulemaking
initiatives affecting the capital markets as well as efforts to
detect violations of the securities laws.
These DERA positions would focus on areas including
Exchange Traded Funds, microcap stocks, the derivatives
markets, Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS),
Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS), and
Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO), among other critical
asset classes that the agency is required to monitor as
part of the recently adopted credit risk retention rules.
These positions would work with colleagues across the
SEC to proactively monitor these markets from a systemic
perspective, as well as develop analytical tools to assist the
Division of Enforcement in analyzing and identifying potential
illicit activity in these areas.

Meet Expanded Rulemaking and
Oversight Responsibilities
The agency also is requesting seven additional positions
in FY 2017 for its Division of Trading and Markets (TM).
In FY 2017, the Division plans to use the additional positions
requested to undertake new market-related responsibilities
resulting from ongoing or recently completed rulemakings,
as well as continuing to improve the agency’s market
supervision. Three of these positions would help the Division
implement its new or enhanced responsibilities to oversee
clearing agencies and swap data repositories. The other four
would help improve the SEC’s analytics and reporting on
broker-dealers’ finances, internal controls, risk management
practices; process rule proposals from a growing number
of self-regulatory organizations; and provide interpretive
guidance related to the derivatives markets.
The SEC also is requesting seven new positions for the
Division of Investment Management to implement key policy
objectives. Of these seven positions, three personnel would
conduct ongoing data analysis, including new data that
would be submitted to the SEC as part of the investment
company reporting modernization initiative. An additional
three positions would monitor issues related to asset
management risks, including related to liquidity, derivatives,
stress testing and transition planning rulemaking initiatives, as
well as provide interpretive advice and respond to exemptive
applications requests.

AGENCY AND MISSION INFORMATION

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

History and Purpose
During the peak of the Depression, Congress passed the
Securities Act of 19331 (Securities Act). This law, along
with the Securities Exchange Act of 19342 (Exchange Act),
which created the SEC, was designed to restore investor
confidence in our capital markets by providing investors
and the markets with more reliable information and clear
rules of honest dealing. The main purposes of these laws
were to ensure that:
•	 Companies publicly offering securities for investment
dollars must tell the public the truth about their
businesses, the securities they are selling, and the
risks involved in investing.
•	 People who sell and trade securities – brokers,
dealers and exchanges – must treat investors fairly
and honestly, putting investors’ interests first.
The SEC is responsible for overseeing the nation’s securities
markets and the primary participants, including brokerdealers, investment companies, investment advisers,
clearing agencies, transfer agents, credit rating agencies,
and securities exchanges, as well as organizations such
as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA),
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), and Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Under the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act3 (Dodd-Frank Act), the agency’s jurisdiction was
expanded to include certain participants in the derivatives
markets, private fund advisers, and municipal advisors,
among other changes.

1 	Securities
2	

The SEC consists of five presidentially appointed
Commissioners, with staggered five-year terms. One of them
is designated by the President as Chair of the Commission,
who is responsible for the executive and administrative
functions of the Commission. President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt appointed Joseph P. Kennedy to serve as the
first Chairman of the SEC.
By law, no more than three of the Commissioners may
belong to the same political party. The Commission convenes
regularly at meetings that are open to the public and the news
media unless the discussion pertains to confidential subjects,
such as whether to begin an enforcement investigation.
Each year, the SEC brings hundreds of civil enforcement
actions against individuals and companies for violation of
securities laws. Examples of infractions include insider
trading, accounting fraud, and providing false or misleading
information about securities or the companies that issue
them. One of the major sources of information that the SEC
relies on to bring enforcement action is investors themselves
– another reason that educated and careful investors are
critical to the functioning of efficient markets. To help
inform investors, the SEC offers the public a wealth of
educational information on its website at www.investor.gov,
as well as an online database of disclosure documents at
www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html
that public companies and other market participants are
required to file with the SEC.

FY 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

A Reader’s Guide to the SEC’s Performance Information
The following chapters comprise the agency’s FY 2015
Annual Performance Report (APR) and FY 2017 Annual
Performance Plan (APP), which explains how the SEC uses
resources to achieve each of its four strategic goals. These
Strategic Goals, Strategic Objectives, and Performance Goals
and Indicators were developed as part of the Strategic Plan
process for FY 2014-2018. The process followed by SEC
in verifying and validating the accuracy of all performance
data is described in Appendix B.
The following outlines a brief description of each of the major
components of the performance section:
Strategic Goal Summary: Each strategic goal section
opens by reviewing the purpose of the goal, followed by
information identifying the resources allocated toward
achieving the goal.

Strategic Objective: This section provides a description of
the SEC’s strategic objectives that gauge the agency’s
performance within each strategic goal.
FY 2015 Performance Achievements: A brief summary that
spotlights the year’s performance achievements, including
resource data and an overall discussion of performance.
Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017): A brief discussion of how
the SEC plans to use resources requested in FY 2017 to
achieve the strategic goal.
Performance Goals and Indicators: Each strategic goal
section includes a presentation of performance goals and
performance indicators by objective, comparing planned and
actual performance levels for FY 2015. Four years of historical
data is provided for performance goals and performance
indicators where available.

FY 2015 APR and FY 2017 APP
The SEC focuses its resources on (1) establishing and
maintaining an effective regulatory environment, (2) fostering
and enforcing compliance with the Federal securities laws,
(3) facilitating access to the information investors need to
make informed investment decisions, and (4) enhancing
the agency’s performance through effective alignment and
management of human, information, and financial capital.
In FY 2015, total SEC obligations were $1.479 billion1 in
support of 4,301 total full-time equivalents (FTE). Of 53 total
performance targets, the agency met or exceeded 46 and
did not meet seven.
The budget request for FY 2017 totals $1.781 billion, an
increase of about $98 million (six percent) over the agency’s
FY 2016 funding level of $1.683 billion. The FY 2017
budget funds 4,870 FTE, an increase of about 249 FTE
(five percent) over the FY 2016 level, and increases the
number of positions by 250 to a total of 5,196.

1	

PAGE

The additional resources requested for FY 2017 would
bolster the SEC’s efforts to achieve each of its four strategic
goals, and improve the agency’s ability to oversee the new
markets and market participants that have been added to
the SEC’s jurisdiction. The agency is aware that increasing
staffing in the program areas requires a commensurate
increase in staff and funding for support offices. The
requested funding will provide necessary resources for
attracting and retaining a diverse and talented workforce,
administering programs to enhance employee engagement
and leadership development, and leveraging information
technology that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of agency programs.
To complement the FY 2015 APR, the agency also presents
its FY 2015 budget by program. Each program chapter
provides detailed information on program priorities, initiatives,
and workload figures for the relevant divisions and offices.

This figure excludes use of budget authority to liquidate prior obligations for deficient leases.

FY 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

Performance Summary by Strategic Goal and Strategic Objective
Strategic Goal 1: Establish and Maintain an Effective Regulatory Environment
The Commission’s responsibility is to put the Federal
securities laws into action by establishing and maintaining
a regulatory environment that fulfills and sustains the
agency’s mission. In general, rulemaking and policies
are designed to improve disclosure, facilitate the flow of
important information to investors and the public, promote
capital formation, improve governance, promote high-quality
accounting standards, enhance the accountability of financial
intermediaries and other market participants, and strengthen
the structure of the trading markets, among other goals.
The Commission aims to promulgate rules that are clearly
written, easily understood, and tailored toward specific
ends. In addition, the agency recognizes that regular reviews
of Commission regulations and rulemaking processes
are necessary to confirm that intended results are being
achieved. When properly crafted, these rules serve to further
the agency’s mission and allow for accurate and reliable
information to be made available to investors.
In FY 2015, approximately $151.7 million and 463 fulltime equivalents (FTEs) were directed at achieving results
in Goal 1. Of 10 performance targets, the agency met or
exceeded eight and did not meet two. During FY 2017,
the SEC plans to pursue a vigorous investor-focused
rulemaking agenda that will help protect investors and
ensure that markets operate fairly. Under the Dodd-Frank
Act the agency will continue to implement a more effective
regulatory structure. In FY 2017, the agency is requesting
a total of $167.6 million and 488 FTEs toward achieving
results in establishing an effective regulatory environment.

Strategic Objective 1.1: The SEC establishes and
maintains a regulatory environment that promotes highquality disclosure, financial reporting, and governance,
and prevents abusive practices by registrants, financial
intermediaries, and other market participants.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Division of Trading and Markets;
Director, Division of Corporation Finance; Director, Division
of Investment Management

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
The SEC has proposed or adopted nearly all of the
mandatory rulemakings required by the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank
Act) and the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS
Act), in addition to advancing other key rules in mission
critical areas that protect investors and our markets. These
efforts have included final rules addressing over-the-counter
derivatives; new means for small businesses to access capital
(including rules to update Regulation A and permit securitiesbased crowdfunding offerings); executive compensation
disclosures; and the removal of references to credit ratings
from our rules. In addition to implementing congressionally
mandated rules, the SEC has also advanced other important
policy objectives, including rules to enhance oversight of
high-frequency traders and the supervision of investment
advisers and mutual funds, including reforms to money
market mutual funds; as well as adopting requirements for
comprehensive new controls at critical market participants
to strengthen key technological systems.

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
The Division of Trading and Markets (TM) is responsible
for more than 30 separate rulemaking initiatives under the
Dodd-Frank Act. Many of these rulemakings are the first
step in new ongoing supervisory and regulatory functions for
the Division that will extend into FY 2017. These initiatives
and functions include:
•	 Registration and regulation of security-based swap
data repositories (SDRs), security-based swap dealers
(SBSDs), major security-based swap participant
(MSBSPs), and swap execution facilities;
•	 Regulatory reporting and public dissemination of
security-based swap data;
•	 Mandatory clearing of security-based swaps;
•	 Application of security-based swap rules to cross-border
activities and persons engaged in those activities;

  23

PAGE

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

•

FY 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

•	 Expanded regulation and supervision of clearing
agencies; and
•	 Ongoing implementation of final rules restricting certain
proprietary trading activities of broker-dealers under
the Volcker Rule, including interagency coordination
of interpretations, examinations, and enforcement of
the rules.

In FY 2017, the Division of Investment Management (IM)
expects to continue to focus considerable attention on a set
of initiatives to enhance investment management industry
resilience to portfolio composition risk and operational risk.
The initiatives are designed to:
•	 Improve the data and other information used by the
Commission to understand the risks of the asset
management industry and develop appropriate
regulatory responses.

In FY 2017, the Division of Corporation Finance (CF) will assist
the Commission in finalizing the study of the Commission’s
disclosure rules required by the Fixing America’s Surface
Transportation (FAST) Act and in developing recommendations
arising out of that study for new or revised rules. In FY 2017,
CF will also provide assistance and interpretive guidance to
small businesses and other market participants related to
the Commission’s 2015 rules that allow for expanded access
to capital through crowdfunding and under Regulation A.

•	 Ensure that registered funds enhance their fund-level
controls so they are able to identify and address risks
related to their liquidity and use of derivatives.
•	 Ensure that firms have a plan for transitioning their
clients’ assets when circumstances warrant.
•	 Implement new requirements for annual stress testing
by large investment advisers and large funds.

Strategic Objective 1.2: The SEC promotes capital
markets that operate in a fair, efficient, transparent,
and competitive manner, fostering capital formation
and innovation.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Division of Trading and Markets
Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
SEC’s rulemaking agenda prioritizes investor protection,
market stability, and capital formation. Through rulemaking
and other initiatives, the agency works to assure that
investors have fair access to securities markets and that
their orders are handled in an efficient and transparent
manner from order to settlement.

PAGE

  24

Additionally, the SEC oversees self-regulatory organizations
(SRO) to ensure that securities markets operate in a fair,
efficient and orderly manner; that they are competitive; and
that they promote capital formation. The SEC has authority
over the rulemaking and other activities of SROs, which
include national securities exchanges, the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and clearing agencies. The
SEC, in approving SRO rules, must determine that these
rules are constructed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade, and
foster cooperation in the clearing and settling of trades, and
that they do not impose an unnecessary or inappropriate
burden on competition (Performance Goal 1.2.1).

FY 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the SEC must sustain and enhance its
existing supervision of securities markets, securities
market infrastructure, securities intermediaries, and other
market participants. In FY 2017, the Division of Trading and
Markets (TM) will face growing demands in its supervision
of critical securities market infrastructure, with respect to
both the implementation of new Dodd-Frank Act-related
responsibilities and the expansion of its existing oversight
program. The Division will expand its oversight of existing

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

clearing agencies, particularly those that are designated as
systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight
Council (FSOC), and will continue to review their rule filings
on an ongoing basis. As with exchanges, many clearing
agency rule changes filed with the SEC must be handled on
a significantly expedited basis under the Dodd-Frank Act.
Additionally, TM will need to focus on significant industry
initiatives to reform clearing agency practices with respect
to disclosure of risk management information, tri-party
securities lending activities, and the duration of the standard
securities settlement cycle, among other matters.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 1.2.1
Time to complete SEC review of SRO rules that are subject to SEC approval
Description: The SEC reviews SRO rule proposals for consistency with the Exchange Act standards of investor protection, fair and orderly
operation of the markets and market structure, as well as other statutory requirements. This metric gauges the timeliness of those reviews.

Target: Not Met
Analysis: During FY 2015, the SEC approved or disapproved 211 SRO rule changes filed pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act.
Of the 211 filings, 63 percent were approved or disapproved within the 45 day standard for publication, which falls below the 70 percent
target established. The remaining SRO rule changes all met other statutory deadlines past the 45th day.
Plan for Improving Program Performance: The adoption of Dodd-Frank in July 2010 required the SEC to approve or disapprove within certain
statutory time frames from the date of publication of a rule change. The staff must publish within 15 days from when the filing is received,
otherwise the publication date reverts to the day the SRO publishes the filing on their website, (i.e., within two days of filing with the SEC).
Once a rule filing is published for comment, the SEC must complete a review within 45 days, or within longer periods of time as noted in the
statute. Of the 211 SRO rule changes subject to the Dodd-Frank standards, 132 filings were subsequently approved or disapproved within
45 days of publication. The remaining 79 filings were approved or disapproved within the other statutory benchmarks, (i.e., within 90 days,
within 180 days, within 240 days). The SEC met the statutory standards set by Dodd-Frank 100 percent of the time. The SEC will evaluate
in FY 2016 whether to adjust this target to the Dodd-Frank standards, which represent a better measure of program performance.

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
In FY 2015, the SEC continued to pursue an investorfocused rulemaking agenda. The Commission’s rulemaking
has been supported by detailed economic analysis provided
by the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA).
DERA has provided guidance that outlines a road map for
the rulemaking divisions and offices, listing concepts that
the analysis should cover and helping ensure that economic

entities, public companies, and other outside parties.
In FY 2015, the Divisions of Corporation Finance (CF)
and Investment Management (IM) met or exceeded their
response rate targets for Performance Goal 1.3.1.

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the SEC plans to continue to devote staff
resources to rulemaking and interpretive guidance, including
preparing remaining rules to implement the Dodd-Frank
Act and JOBS Act, considering the impact of SEC rules
and regulations on small business capital formation, and
continuing efforts to modernize and simplify disclosure
requirements. TM, IM and CF remain committed to

taken if the individual or market participant engages in a specified activity. The staff also reviews applications for exemptions from the securities
laws. Written responses to such requests for guidance, when provided, generally are publicly available, as are applications and related notices
and orders, when issued. This metric gauges the timeliness of initial comments issued by the Divisions of Trading and Markets, Investment
Management, and Corporation Finance.

Analysis: For the seventh year in a row, IM exceeded its target for initial comments on exemptive applications within 120 days. The division
considered but decided against raising its target percentage because the ability to meet the target is dependent on factors that could change
materially during any fiscal year such as the total number of applications filed, concentration of filings at any particular time period (surges),
and the types and complexity of the applications filed. For the sixth year in a row, IM processed 100 percent of initial comments on no-action
letters within three weeks, surpassing its target of “80 percent within three weeks.” IM has been able to achieve this level of success because
of its continued emphasis on providing initial comments within the targeted timeframe as a key priority.

Strategic Objective 1.4: The SEC engages with a
multitude of stakeholders to inform and enhance
regulatory activities domestically and internationally.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of International Affairs
Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
In today’s markets, capital can cross jurisdictional boundaries
with the tap of a screen. It is more important than ever to
coordinate with other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities
and stakeholders on the best regulatory responses to the
changing market landscape. Failure to effectively coordinate
can significantly hamper the SEC’s ability to achieve its policy
objectives or avoid significant unintended consequences.
The Office of International Affairs (OIA) handled an increased
volume of requests in cross-border supervisory cooperation
matters, cross-border examinations, asset verifications and
registrations. During FY 2015, OIA continued to streamline
its processes to provide assistance in an efficient and
timely way. The Office also continued to provide technical
assistance programs for regulators around the world
(Performance Goal 1.4.1 and Performance Goal 1.4.2).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
The SEC will continue to actively participate in international
multilateral organizations, including the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the
Financial Stability Board, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, and the Financial Action
Task Force. These efforts will be complemented by direct
bilateral consultations with foreign regulatory counterparts
on enforcement and regulatory matters. In addition, the
SEC continues to promote international coordination and
cooperation through its technical assistance programs
for foreign regulators (Performance Goal 1.4.1 and
Performance Goal 1.4.2).
In FY 2017, the SEC Chair will continue to participate actively
in the Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) with
other FSOC members, such as the Chairman of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the
Treasury, and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC).

Strategic Goal 2: Foster and Enforce Compliance with the Federal Securities Laws
Fostering compliance with Federal securities laws is
interwoven through all of the SEC’s programs and is
central to fulfilling the critical mission of the agency. Through
disclosure reviews and examinations of broker-dealers,
investment advisers, self-regulatory organizations (SROs)
and other market participants, the SEC seeks both to detect
violations of the securities laws and rules and to foster
strong compliance and risk management practices within
these firms and organizations. The SEC’s Enforcement
program also investigates and prosecutes violations of the
law, with the aims of holding wrongdoers accountable,
returning funds to harmed investors whenever possible, and
building deterrence against future violations. In FY 2015,
approximately $839.1 million and 2,474 full-time equivalents
(FTEs) were directed at achieving results in Goal 2. Of 12
performance targets, the agency met or exceeded 10 and
did not meet two.
In FY 2017, the agency is requesting a total of $964.6 million
and 2,823 FTE for Goal 2. The additional resources will
allow the SEC to continue addressing the disparity between
the reach of the exam staff and the growing number and
complexity of registered firms and building out the agency’s
new responsibility areas. Additionally, the Commission
will be able to take prompt action to halt misconduct,
sanction wrongdoers effectively, and return funds to harmed
investors. In all, the agency plans to devote approximately
$964.6 million to enforcing compliance with the Federal
securities laws.

Strategic Objective 2.1: The SEC fosters compliance with
the Federal securities laws.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Compliance Inspections
and Examinations

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
The SEC seeks to encourage within firms that participate in
the securities markets a strong culture of compliance that

fosters ethical behavior and decision-making. As part of
its efforts to promote compliance within the industry, OCIE
conducted 129 outreach and educational programs events
during the year, including Compliance Outreach seminars,
targeted sessions with never before examined advisers,
and various other outreach initiatives with registrants and
other regulators (Performance Goal 2.1.1).
OCIE also works to enforce and foster compliance with
Federal securities laws through its examination and
inspection program. During examinations in FY 2015, the
staff identified a number of areas where firms appeared not
to be in compliance with Federal securities laws. In response
to deficiency letters that were sent to firms by the staff,
90 percent of registrants have continued to assert that
they are taking corrective action in response to all staff
findings. In order to achieve this level of performance, the
staff continued to make concerted efforts during the year to
improve dialogue and communication with firms, including
at the most senior levels (Performance Goal 2.1.2).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the National Examination Program (NEP) will
continue its focus on high-risk entities and activities. The
additional resources requested will serve to: (1) address the
disparity between the number of exam staff and the growing
number and complexity of registered firms, particularly
in the investment management industry; (2) continue
implementation of certain legislative changes, including
provisions of the Dodd-Frank and JOBS Acts; (3) enhance
and expand quantitative and data analytic efforts; and
(4) more effectively risk target, monitor, and examine
market participants. OCIE will also enhance training and
expertise of examiners in data analysis, fraud detection
and prevention, technology, new products and trading
strategies, and other critical areas. Also, in FY 2017, OCIE
will continue its efforts to promote industry compliance
efforts through initiatives such as the Compliance Outreach
program (Performance Goal 2.1.1).

improve dialogue and communication with firms, including at the most senior levels. These efforts have helped to ensure that there is a clear
understanding of issues and concerns between the staff and registrants. Overall, this measure continues to show that registrants are using
examination results to improve operations and compliance with Federal securities laws.

Strategic Objective 2.2: The SEC promptly detects and
deters violations of the Federal securities laws.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Compliance Inspections
and Examinations

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
In FY 2015, the National Examination Program continued
to improve its risk assessment and surveillance capabilities,
to ensure that the program is spending its limited resources
on those firms presenting the highest risk. Examinations of
high risk firms often take significant time to complete and
are frequently of large and complex entities. Overall, the staff
examined 10 percent of investment advisers in FY 2015;
these firms manage more than 30 percent of the assets under
management of currently registered advisers. Examination
resources were also allocated during the past year to other
efforts intended to improve the long-term performance of
the program, including industry outreach initiatives, rulemaking efforts and other program improvement efforts
(Performance Goal 2.2.1).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
The National Examination Program is requesting to hire
127 additional staff in FY 2017. These new positions would

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

directly affect the proportion of registered entities that would
be examined each year. Since these staff would be hired
during the course of FY 2017, the coverage rates would
not reach their new steady-state levels until the staff are all
on board, trained, and conducting examinations for a full
fiscal year. Once that occurs, the percentage of investment
advisers and investment companies examined is expected to
reach approximately 13 percent and 15 percent, respectively
(Performance Goal 2.2.1).
The National Exam Program will continue to identify and
communicate potential issues to firms to ensure that
compliance problems and issues are corrected quickly. In
FY 2017, the SEC will continue to complete all examinations
within the statutory deadline. Overall, this helps the SEC to
ensure that deficiencies are promptly detected and resolved
by firms (Performance Goal 2.2.2).
In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to focus on improving
coordination with other regulators on areas of mutual
interest, both to share expertise and to address key areas
of risk. In that regard, the exam program continued to
conduct coordinated exams and meetings with other
regulators and also maintained a number of agreements
with these regulators to help ensure that information
could be shared in an appropriate and timely manner
(Performance Goal 2.2.3).

PERFORMANCE GOAL 2.2.1
Percentage of investment advisers, investment companies, and broker-dealers examined during the year
Description: This metric indicates the number of registrants examined by the SEC or an SRO as a percentage of the total number of registrants. This
metric includes all types of examinations: risk priority examinations, cause inspections to follow up on tips and complaints, limited-scope special
inspections to probe emerging risk areas, and oversight examinations of broker-dealers to test compliance and the quality of examinations by FINRA.

Target: Investment advisers – Met; Investment companies – Exceeded; Broker-dealers – Exceeded
Analysis: Building and maintaining examination coverage of the industry helps the Commission promptly detect violations of Federal securities
laws and promote compliance with such laws. The staff continued to enhance its risk assessment and surveillance capabilities to ensure that the
program is spending its limited time and resources on those firms presenting the highest risk. Overall, the program exceeded expectations and
completed more examinations than in any of the previous five fiscal years. In addition, the NEP engaged in other critical efforts intended to improve
the long-term performance of the program, including industry outreach initiatives, rulemaking projects, and other program improvement efforts.

FY 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT AND FY 2017 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

Strategic Objective 2.3: The SEC prosecutes violations of
Federal securities laws and holds violators accountable
through appropriate sanctions and remedies.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Division of Enforcement
Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
A key part of investor protection is to quickly and
appropriately sanction those who prey on investors. The
Division of Enforcement strives to obtain swift and strong
judgments and orders, while remaining fair. The Division has
continued to implement controls and strategies to resolve
actions quickly and on a favorable basis, while at the same
time, it does not hesitate to file matters on a contested basis
where a favorable settlement was unavailable before filing
(Performance Goal 2.3.1).
Filing enforcement actions in a timely manner is an important
measure of the Division’s effectiveness. In FY 2015, the
average time between opening a matter under inquiry (MUI)
or Investigation and commencing an enforcement action was
24 months. This exceeded the similar figure in the prior fiscal
year. However, many of the Division’s cases are complex and
can take extended periods of time to develop successfully,
which will negatively impact the timeliness of actions. Indeed,
many of the cases filed by the Division in FY 2015 involved
complex financial products, market transactions, and other

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

types of conduct that are difficult to investigate. The Division
continued to focus on complex areas of the marketplace,
including emerging threats involving new trading technologies
such as high-frequency and algorithmic trading, large volume
trading, systemic insider trading and manipulation schemes,
and financial disclosure, among other areas (Performance
Goal 2.3.3).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
For FY 2017, the Division of Enforcement is requesting 52
new positions. These new staff, along with new methods,
initiatives, and organizational reforms, will help the program
bring successful cases on a timely basis. To improve the
quality and efficiency of its investigations, the SEC has
placed new emphasis on data analytics, put seasoned
investigators on the front lines, created specialized units
focused on specific programmatic priorities, enhanced
case management systems, and increased coordination
efforts with other offices and divisions in the SEC and
other regulators. In FY 2016, the SEC plans to obtain relief
on one or more claims from approximately 92 percent
of enforcement actions (Performance Goal 2.3.1). The
agency also plans to reduce in FY 2017 the average number
months between the opening of an investigation and the
commencement of an enforcement action arising out of
that investigation (Performance Goal 2.3.3).

PERFORMANCE GOAL 2.3.1
Percentage of enforcement actions in which the Commission obtained relief on one or more claims
Description: This metric identifies, as to all parties to enforcement actions that were resolved in the fiscal year, the percentage against whom
the Commission obtained a judgment or order entered on consent, a default judgment, a judgment of liability on one or more charges, and/
or the imposition of monetary or other relief.

relief. The SEC has implemented controls and strategies to resolve actions quickly and on a favorable basis, while at the same time, it does
not hesitate to file matters on a contested basis where a favorable settlement was unavailable before filing.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 2.3.2
Percentage of first enforcement actions filed within two years of the opening of an investigation
Description: This metric concerns the pace of investigations that lead to the filing of enforcement actions. Specifically, this metric captures the
rate at which the first enforcement action arising out of an investigation was filed within two years of the opening of the investigation. If the
investigation was preceded by a matter under inquiry, the metric draws on the date of the opening of the matter under inquiry. In conducting
investigations, the Enforcement program continually strives to balance the need for complete, effective and fair investigations with the need
to file enforcement actions in as timely a manner as possible.

in filing actions is important because it can enhance the action’s deterrent impact.
Plan for Improving Program Performance: To address the issue of timeliness and efficiency in investigations, the Division is taking measures that
include emphasizing timeliness in quarterly case reviews, promoting best practices regarding efficiencies in various phases of the investigative
process, and conducting training on tools that expedite investigations.

Description: This metric captures the average number of months between the opening of an investigation and the filing of the first enforcement
action arising out of that investigation. If the investigation was preceded by a matter under inquiry, the metric draws on the date of opening
of the matter under inquiry. In conducting investigations, the enforcement program continually strives to balance the need for complete,
effective, and fair investigations with the need to file enforcement actions in as timely a manner as possible. While not all investigations result
in the filing of enforcement actions, this metric provides information concerning the pace of investigations that do lead to such actions and
supplements the previous goal, which measures the percentage of first enforcement actions filed within two years.

Description: The SEC can seek a wide range of remedies for failure to comply with the securities laws. These remedies include civil monetary
penalties and disgorgement. When the remedies are imposed by the SEC or the Federal district court, payments must be made by a certain
date. This metric identifies the percentage of debts where debtors have made payments or the SEC has initiated a collection activity within
180 days of the due date. Such collection activities include, among other things, demand letters, negotiation of payment plans, enforcing
the payment of the debt through the courts, or other judicial remedies.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 2.3.5
Percentage of Fair Fund and disgorgement fund plans that have distributed 80 percent of the available
funds for distribution within twenty four (24) months of the approval of the distribution plan
Description: In addition to other types of relief, the SEC may seek orders requiring parties to disgorge any money obtained through wrongdoing.
The SEC also is empowered to seek civil penalties for violations of the securities laws. Where appropriate, the SEC has sought to return
disgorged funds to harmed investors and, as a result of the Fair Funds provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, to
combine amounts paid as penalties with disgorged funds, or to create a Fair Fund from penalties only, to reduce losses to injured parties
and to maximize funds available for distribution. This metric identifies the percentage of distribution plans that reached a critical mass during
the fiscal year and within twenty four (24) months of the approval of the distribution plan. The distribution plan includes the timeline and
procedures required to return the funds to injured investors. This reflects Commission-wide efforts to implement plans to return money to
investors quickly. Any funds not returned to investors are sent to the U.S. Treasury or the Investor Protection Fund established pursuant to
Section 21F(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Neither disgorgement nor penalties are used for the SEC’s own expenses.

Percentage of filed enforcement actions reflecting characteristics that present enhanced risk to investors
and markets, as measured by the nature of the investigation, conduct, parties and impact
Description: This indicator assesses the quality of the cases filed by the Division of Enforcement. The indicator focuses on cases filed by the
SEC that involve factors reflecting enhanced risk to investors and markets. Such cases may involve: (i) those identified through risk analytics
and cross-disciplinary initiatives to reveal difficult-to-detect or early stage misconduct, thus minimizing investor loss and preventing the spread
of unlawful conduct and practices; (ii) particularly egregious or widespread misconduct and investor harm; (iii) vulnerable victims; (iv) a high
degree of scienter; (v) involvement of individuals occupying substantial positions of authority, or having fiduciary obligations or other special
responsibilities to investors; (vi) involvement of recidivists; (vii) high amount of investor loss prevented; (viii) misconduct that is difficult to
detect due to the complexity of products, transactions, and practices; (ix) use of innovative investigative or analytical techniques; (x) effective
coordination with other law enforcement partners; and/or (xi) whether the matter involves markets, transactions or practices identified as an
enforcement priority, or that advances the programmatic priorities of other SEC Divisions or Offices.

PERFORMANCE INDICATOR (CONTEXTUAL) 2.3.2
Total amount distributed within the fiscal year, and the number of Fair Funds from which those distributions came
Description: In its enforcement actions, the SEC may seek to return funds to harmed investors through disgorgement of ill-gotten gains or
through the Fair Funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This provision permits the SEC to combine amounts paid as penalties with
disgorged funds, or to create a Fair Fund from penalties only, to reduce losses to injured parties. This reflects the SEC’s efforts to return
funds to injured investors. This indicator identifies the total amount distributed within the fiscal year, and the number of Fair Funds from
which those distributions came. This indicator may increase or decrease in dollar amount and number of distribution funds based on the
number of SEC enforcement actions brought involving distributions, amounts ordered and paid in those actions, and other factors. Due to
the variation in reporting timelines established for each individual distribution, reported amounts are based on the agency’s best available
information. Reported amounts do not include those funds distributed through receiverships. Any funds not returned to investors are sent
to the U.S. Treasury or the Investor Protection Fund established pursuant to Section 21F(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Neither
disgorgement nor penalties are used for the Commission’s own expenses.

Percent of enforcement actions filed that arose out of national priority investigations
Description: The Division of Enforcement conducts many enforcement actions each year that can be characterized as high impact and of
national priority. High impact or national priority investigations include those investigations which are significant for one or more of the following
reasons – the matter: (i) presents an opportunity to send a particularly strong and effective message of deterrence, including with respect
to markets, products and transactions that are newly developing, or that are long established but which by their nature present limited
opportunities to detect wrongdoing and thus to deter misconduct; (ii) involves particularly egregious or extensive misconduct; (iii) involves
potentially widespread and extensive harm to investors; (iv) involves misconduct by persons occupying positions of substantial authority or
responsibility, or who owe fiduciary or other enhanced duties and obligations to a broad group of investors or others; (v) involves potential
wrongdoing as prohibited under newly-enacted legislation or regulatory rules; (vi) concerns potential misconduct that occurred in connection
with products, markets, transactions or practices that pose particularly significant risks for investors or a systemically important sector of
the market; (vii) involves a substantial number of potential victims and/or particularly vulnerable victims; (viii) involves products, markets,
transactions or practices that the Enforcement Division has identified as priority areas; and/or (ix) provides an opportunity to pursue priority
interests shared by other law enforcement agencies on a coordinated basis.

Disgorgement and penalties ordered and the amounts collected
Description: In addition to other types of relief, the SEC may seek orders requiring parties to disgorge any money obtained through wrongdoing.
The SEC is also empowered to seek civil penalties for violations of the securities laws. In some cases, the SEC will seek to obtain large
monetary sanctions even in instances where the prospects of collecting on a judgment are slight. The rationale for seeking monetary relief
in these circumstances is that such relief, even when likely uncollectible, might become collectible in the future based on the defendant’s
changed circumstances, and also because such relief can serve to deter others from violating the securities laws. Where appropriate, the SEC
has sought to return disgorged funds to harmed investors. Funds not returned to investors are sent to the Treasury or the Investor Protection
Fund established pursuant to Section 21F(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This indicator lists disgorgement and penalties ordered
as a result of SEC cases in each fiscal year and the amounts collected in those actions as of the end of FY 2015. The indicator for collected

Strategic Goal 3: Facilitate Access to the Information Investors
Need to Make Informed Investment Decisions
A strong economy and a vibrant securities market rely
on investor confidence and the widespread availability
of relevant information about those securities. The SEC
promotes informed investment decisions through two
main approaches. The first is to require that investors have
accurate, adequate, and timely public access to disclosure
materials that are easily understood and analyzed. The
second is to implement a variety of investor education
initiatives aimed at giving investors a better understanding
of the operations of the nation’s securities markets.
In FY 2015, the agency dedicated approximately
$187.0 million and 609 FTEs toward achieving results in
Goal 3. Of 12 performance targets, the agency met or
exceeded eleven and did not meet one. For FY 2017, the
SEC is requesting a total of $216.8 million and 674 FTEs
towards achieving results in Strategic Goal 3.

Strategic Objective 3.1: The SEC works to ensure
that investors have access to high-quality disclosure
materials that facilitate informed investment decisionmaking.

An educated investing public ultimately provides the best
defense against fraud and costly mistakes. The Federal
securities laws place great emphasis on requiring that
corporations, investments companies, and other entities
provide investors with timely, clear, complete and accurate
financial and non-financial information, allowing investors to
make wise investment decisions. Consistent with Section 408

PAGE

  42

of the Sarbanes Oxley-Act of 2002, the SEC completed its
review of disclosures made by certain public issuers, including
issuers’ financial statements, no less frequently than once
every three years (Performance Goal 3.1.1).
The SEC strives to review all significant disclosures made
by registrants in Commission filings under the Investment
Company Act, including initial registration statements and
post-effective amendments with material changes. The SEC
does not set a target for the number of filings that are reviewed
in a fiscal year because the SEC does not dictate the number
of filings that registrants make.

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
Investors who have access to information and know what
questions to ask are more likely to invest wisely, and to
choose professional intermediaries that will best meet their
objectives. The SEC understands that not all investors need
the same information and that those needs are affected
by their backgrounds, resources and goals. In FY 2017,
the SEC will continue to conduct the requisite number
of disclosure reviews so that investors are armed with
timely and useful information they need to make informed
investment decisions (Performance Goal 3.1.1).
As technology and the complexity of financial instruments
change, so too do the needs of modern day investors.
Providing investors with information in concise, easy-to-use
formats that are tailored to their needs helps investors to
help themselves. In FY 2017, the Commission will continue
to examine its filing review program to explore whether
its disclosure requirements, review criteria, approach to
comments, and professional and technology resources
provide maximum impact to benefit investors.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 3.1.1
Percentage of public companies and investment companies with disclosures reviewed each year
Description: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that the SEC review, at least once every three years, the disclosures of all companies and
investment company portfolios reporting under the Exchange Act. These reviews help improve the information available to investors and may
identify possible violations of the Federal securities laws. This metric gauges the number of public companies and investment companies
reviewed each year.

Description: For initial registration statements, the SEC’s goal is to issue initial comments within 30 days after they are filed (60 days for
registration statements of insurance product separate accounts and related mutual funds). The SEC also aims to comment on post-effective
amendments within 45 days and preliminary proxy statements within 10 days after they are filed.

Target: Initial registration statements – Exceeded; Post-effective amendments – Exceeded; Preliminary proxy statements – Not Met
Analysis: For FY 2015, the Division of Investment Management continued its goal of providing comments on proxy statements within 10 days
of filing at least 99 percent of the time. In FY 2015, the Division missed its 10-day goal for only five of 268 filings – due largely to staff turnover.
Plan for Improving Program Performance: We note that with respect to performance goal 3.1.3 (preliminary proxy statements) in FY 2015 the
Division missed its 10-day target for initial comments for five of 268 filings (1.87 percent). Because the performance goal is high (initial comments
given within the 10-day target period 99 percent of the time) it takes only a handful of individual instances of missing the target to result in
the performance goal being missed for the entire year. Because the target period for initial comments is short (10 days from date of filing), it
can be challenging to meet the target in rare cases where we are faced with a combination of difficult conditions, such as when we receive a
complicated filing during a period of heavy workload. This risk is exacerbated if the responsible office is experiencing substantial staff changes.
Nevertheless, the Division has met the 99 percent goal during most fiscal years.

Strategic Objective 3.2: The SEC works to understand
investor needs and educate investors so they are better
prepared to make informed investment decisions.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Investor Education and
Advocacy

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
Understanding the interests and concerns of investors
is critical to carrying out the Commission’s investor
protection mission. The SEC advances this mission by
regularly communicating with investors, responding to
their complaints and inquiries, and providing educational
programs and materials. The SEC serves thousands of
investors each year who contact the SEC with investmentrelated complaints and questions. During FY 2015, the SEC
closed out 65 percent of new investor assistance matters
within seven days and 93 percent of new investor assistance
matters within 30 days. The Office of Investor Education
and Advocacy (OIEA) was able to achieve these levels in
part by identifying and referring key investor assistance
matters to the agency’s Tips, Complaints and Referrals
(TCR) system (Performance Goal 3.2.2). During FY 2015,
the SEC had 23.6 million page views of online investor
education content and OIEA participated in 71 in-person
events (Performance Goal 3.2.1).

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to seek more comprehensive data about investors and build upon the Commission’s
investor education efforts. Working in partnership with other
Federal and state agencies, financial industry associations,
consumer groups and educational organizations, the SEC
will develop investor education initiatives that are targeted
to specific audiences that will prevent future victims of fraud
(Performance Goad 3.2.4).
The SEC also works to provide individual investors with
useful and helpful investor education materials, including
clear explanations of Commission rules, and other activities
through a variety of communication channels, including
social media (Performance Goal 3.2.3). Through the
Investor Advisory Committee and other avenues, the SEC
will continue to gather information about the views and
experience of a broad spectrum of investors, which will
serve as an additional source of information concerning
investors’ priorities and perspectives on the Commission’s
regulatory agenda.

PERFORMANCE GOAL 3.2.1
Number of page views of online investor education content, and number of in-person events,
including those with specifically targeted communities and organizations
Description: The Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) initiates investor education campaigns on key strategies for making informed
investment decisions, including publicizing online resources for researching investment professionals and investments, understanding fees,
and identifying fraud. OIEA staff also participates in in-person events for investors generally and those targeted to specific investors, such
as seniors, service members, and other affinity groups. This metric tracks page views of SEC online investor education materials and the
number of investor events in which OIEA staff participated.

Strategic Goal 4: Enhance the Commission’s Performance through Effective Alignment
and Management of Human, Information, and Financial Capital
The investing public and the securities markets are best
served by an efficient, well-managed, and agile SEC. In
FY 2017, the Office of the Chief Operating Officer (OCOO)
along with its six operational offices – the Office of Support
Operations (OSO), the Office of Financial Management (OFM),
the Office of Human Resources (OHR), the Office of Strategic
Initiatives (OSI), the Office of Acquisitions (OA), and the Office
of Information Technology (OIT) – will focus on providing
organizational and infrastructure improvements necessary
to effectively support the increase in the SEC’s workforce
detailed in this request and advance the Commission’s
mission. Given the immense size of the securities markets the
SEC regulates, the agency’s success in fulfilling its mission
is highly dependent upon its ability to continually direct its
resources towards the most productive uses for investors
and the public. The SEC also is extremely mindful of its
responsibility to maximize the impact of public funds.

maintain the agency’s turnover rate at well below eight
percent (Performance Goal 4.1.1). In order to improve the
SEC’s ranking in the survey of best places to work in the
Federal government (Performance Goal 4.1.4) the agency
has continued to focus on improving communications,
working constructively on key issues with the National
Treasury Employees Union, and other initiatives.

In FY 2015, approximately $300.7 million and 755 full-time
equivalents (FTEs) were directed at achieving results in Goal
4. Of 19 performance targets, the agency met or exceeded
17 and did not meet two. During FY 2017, the agency will
continue to focus on recruiting and retaining high-performing
staff, and updating the expertise of SEC employees so they
are abreast of the latest developments in the industry. Furthermore, the SEC will continue to strengthen internal controls.
The agency is requesting a total of $358.1 million and
885 FTEs in FY 2017 to achieve results in Strategic Goal 4.

In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to implement an
effective training program to deepen the expertise of
its employees in the rapidly evolving markets and the
areas of new responsibility for the agency. The training
supports employees directly involved in examinations,
investigations, fraud detection, litigation, and other core
mission responsibilities of the SEC. Such training can focus
on new trends in the securities industry and changing market
conditions, as well as analytics and forensics. It also allows
staff to obtain certain specialized financial certifications and
regulatory credentials, as well as the advanced continuing
education credits required for maintaining legal and financial
credentials (Performance Goal 4.1.2).

Strategic Objective 4.1: The SEC promotes a resultsoriented work environment that attracts, engages, and
retains a technically proficient and diverse workforce,
including leaders who provide motivation and strategic
direction.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Human Resources;
Director, Office of Minority and Women Inclusion

The SEC’s employees are its most vital strategic resource. In
FY 2015, the SEC continued to refine a series of programs

PAGE

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
The SEC is committed to being an employer of choice by
consistently attracting, hiring, developing, and retaining
a high-quality, diverse, and results-oriented workforce.
In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to refine its programs
to enhance human capital, such as rewarding high
performance, promoting high employee satisfaction and
updating staff skills.

The SEC’s success at meeting its mission depends upon
effective leadership at all levels. From branch chiefs to
the agency’s senior leadership, the SEC’s leaders must
motivate, manage employees effectively, and play a critical
role in identifying the key areas on which staff should focus
their attention to generate the greatest benefit for investors.
Through leadership and employee development programs,
the SEC will continue to maintain a diverse group of technically
proficient leaders that can conduct their supervisory
responsibilities effectively and meet the dynamic challenges
of market oversight (Performance Goal 4.1.5).

Description: Internal training and hiring programs are designed to help the agency recruit and develop a diverse and qualified staff with the key
skills, industry knowledge, and expertise to support the SEC mission. In particular, there is a need to train examiners, attorneys, economists,
and other experts for subject matter expertise relevant to the marketplace and investment and trading practices. This metric tracks whether
certain areas requiring significant training are being addressed. The agency will track the number of SEC staff participants in mission-focused
training and development programs and will report on specific items through the use of post-course evaluations to assess the impact and
results of this training on a five-point scale.

University will diversify its methods of delivery to a more blended learning approach. This will result in more learning items, at times delivered
in smaller, more focused portions, aimed at specific knowledge or skill areas.
Plan for Improving Program Performance: SEC University will work closely with internal stakeholders to identify specific learning needs, and will
revise the content of training materials and programs to better address these needs.

Strategic Objective 4.2: The SEC encourages a collaborative environment across divisions and offices and
leverages technology and data to fulfill its mission more
effectively and efficiently.
Goal Leader(s): Director, Office of Information Technology
Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
The SEC’s divisions and offices collaborate in a variety
of ways to advance the Commission’s mission. Such
coordination is critical for any organization as large and
complex as the SEC to bring together different perspectives,
decide on the best course of action, and implement that
course in the most effective way. Given the importance and
complexity of the SEC’s mission, it is imperative that the
Commission continuously improve its ability to break down
silos, share information and work jointly towards a common
purpose through enhanced information technology.
In FY 2015, the SEC continued to consolidate and centralize
its collaborative technologies to a commonly used enterprise
set and met its target of 40 percent of the SEC’s offices
and divisions utilizing enterprise collaboration solutions
(Performance Goal 4.2.2).

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, information technology will continue to play
a crucial role in the mission of the SEC and its ability to
share information and data both internally and externally.
The SEC will continue to gather a wide variety of data from
corporate disclosures, equity exchange feeds, investigations
and examinations, tips, complaints, and referrals, and
commercial vendors. The SEC will continue to work to
develop systems that will allow more of this information
to be quickly shared, analyzed, and combined with other
information about the same entity or individual. These efforts
should save staff time, provide better information about the
firms the SEC regulates, and enhance the ability to uncover
hidden risks to investors (Performance Goal 4.2.2 and
Performance Goal 4.2.3).
The increasing size and complexity of the U.S. markets
require that the SEC continue to leverage technology to
improve its productivity, as well as identify and address the
most significant threats to investors and eliminate downtime
to SEC systems (Performance Goal 4.2.1).

operations and bolstering internal controls.
Goal Leader(s): Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating
Officer

Spotlight: FY 2015 Performance Achievements
Given the SEC’s role in overseeing the securities markets,
it is important that the agency maintain strong internal
controls and sound financial management practices in its
own operations. In FY 2015 the SEC successfully received
an unqualified audit opinion with no material weaknesses
or significant deficiencies (Performance Goal 4.3.1 and
Performance Goal 4.3.2).

PAGE

Budgeting for the Future (FY 2017)
In FY 2017, the SEC will continue to maintain strong
financial management practices and robust internal
controls (Performance Goal 4.3.1). The SEC will continue
to focus on enhancing its processes and systems in its
budgeting, accounting, and internal controls over operations
(Performance Goal 4.3.2). In addition, the SEC will continue
delivering complete, concise, and meaningful information
about the financial and operating performance of the agency
that supports management decision-making.
As an agency of the Federal government entrusted with public
funds, the SEC must always strive to enhance the value for
investors it creates from every budget dollar. In FY 2017, the
SEC will continue to strive to allocate the resources approved
by Congress and the President towards the highest and best
uses for the agency’s mission (Performance Goal 4.3.3).
The SEC also constantly reevaluates its operations to identify
cost savings and maximize their benefit.

The SEC relies upon a vigorous enforcement program
in order to protect investors and instill confidence in the
integrity of the markets. The Division of Enforcement
(“Enforcement” or the “Division”) supports this mandate by
investigating potential violations of the securities laws and,
when appropriate, filing civil charges against wrongdoers
in Federal district court or in administrative proceedings.
Among other things, the Division can obtain monetary
penalties that punish wrongdoers and deter others from
committing similar violations; disgorgement of ill-gotten gains
that, along with monetary penalties, may be returned to
harmed investors; injunctions that prevent wrongdoers from
committing additional violations of the securities laws; and
bars that prevent wrongdoers from working in the industry
where they could otherwise victimize again.
In FY 2015, the Division of Enforcement achieved
significant results. The Division’s accomplishments include
groundbreaking actions spanning the spectrum of the
securities laws and reaching a wide range of registrants
and other market participants. In FY 2015 the SEC brought
a record 507 standalone actions for violations of the Federal
securities laws, as well as 300 delinquent filing and follow-on
proceedings, and obtained orders for a record $4.2 billion in

PAGE

  58

monetary sanctions. However, the SEC’s FY 2015 numbers
only tell a part of the story. The SEC’s actions in FY 2015
included a number of first-of-their-kind cases, included the
first action involving a private equity adviser for misallocating
broken deal expenses, an underwriter for pricing-related
fraud in the primary market for municipal securities, and
a “Big Three” credit rating agency for misrepresenting a
rating methodology.
Notwithstanding these results, the Division faces continued
challenges. Accordingly, the Division is requesting 52
additional positions in FY 2017. As described in more detail
below, the Division needs resources in each of three missioncritical functions. First, the Division needs sophisticated
technology tools to collect and analyze market data, as
well as staff to analyze that data; assess and triage tips,
complaints, and referrals; pursue whistleblower submissions;
and conduct preliminary inquiries of potential securities
law violations. Second, the Division needs to continue
devoting investigative resources to high-priority areas such
as accounting and reporting fraud, market structure, and
other areas. Third, to maximize the deterrent impact of
enforcement actions, the Division needs additional staff to
litigate the growing number of contested cases.

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

Challenges Facing the Enforcement Program
The Division of Enforcement faces a number of key challenges
to its ability to effectively and efficiently prosecute violations
of the securities laws. Some of these are discussed below.
Fragmented and complex equity markets pose unique challenges
to Enforcement. In recent years, the securities markets have
grown increasingly complex and opaque, with a proliferation
of sophisticated tools and trading methods such as high
frequency trading, complex algorithmic trading, and
off-exchange trading venues. Unlawful trading strategies
are becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to
identify. The Division needs advanced analytical tools, as
well as staff to analyze data from these tools, to ensure it
keeps pace with this constantly evolving environment.
Data Analysis. Analysis of large datasets – including filings
and disclosures, trading data in equities, options, municipal
bonds, and other securities – is critical to effectively
identifying and investigating potential misconduct. The
Division expects that its improved information processing
and analysis is likely to yield additional case leads through
FY 2017. The Division needs commensurate staffing to
review, analyze, and pursue these leads.
The Division is filing more cases and conducting more trials.
The Division’s caseload is growing rapidly. FY 2015 saw
the most-ever standalone enforcement actions filed
(507) and a substantial increase in the number of trials as
compared to historical averages. As its litigation caseload
increases, the Division is incurring greater expenses for
experts, consultants, e-discovery, data loading, and
contractor support. The Division expects the current
trends in litigation activity and costs to continue, and needs
sufficient resources to ensure it can continue to effectively
prosecute violations of Federal securities laws, with the
credible capacity to continue taking complex cases to trial
if required to hold violators accountable.
Advanced technological capabilities are essential for effective
investigations. Each month, the Division receives seven
terabytes of electronic data in its investigations, and hosts
nearly 525 TB of data related to investigations and litigation.
The sheer volume of digital evidence requires ever-greater
storage and processing powers – as well as additional investigators to review that mass of information. Also, in today’s
society, there is an ever-expanding array of technological

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

options to conceal misconduct and encrypt the evidence
of wrongdoing. As a result, the Division will need additional
resources to effectively penetrate this changing landscape.
The Division prosecutes resource-intensive and highly technical
areas of misconduct. Certain high-priority areas of misconduct,
such as financial reporting matters, can be highly technical
and resource-intensive. Having adequate resources is vital to
uncovering the misconduct in a timely manner. The number
of financial reporting and issuer disclosure cases brought in
FY 2015 rose by 40 percent from the previous fiscal year as
the SEC increased its focus on this area. Absent additional
funds, the resources to conduct these types of investigations
will have to be drawn from other priority areas.
The Division takes in thousands of tips per year, generating a fresh
stream of case leads that deserve investigation. In FY 2015,
the Division received approximately 4,000 tips, complaints,
and referrals from whistleblowers. Whistleblowers can often
provide high-quality information that allows the Division to
more quickly and efficiently detect and investigate alleged
violations of the law. Individuals who voluntarily provide the
SEC with original information that leads to a successful
enforcement action resulting in monetary sanctions greater
than $1 million may be eligible to receive an award equal
to 10-30 percent of the monies collected. In FY 2015, the
Office of the Whistleblower received more tips than ever
before, handled and assessed the merit of more whistleblower
award claims than ever before, and recommended the award
of $37 million to whistleblowers. The Division anticipates
that these significant payments will further incentivize
whistleblowers to come forward and submit high quality tips.
In turn, the Division expects to initiate more investigations
and enforcement actions against violators.
The Division’s policy of requiring admissions of wrongdoing in
certain cases may require additional resources. In FY 2013, the
SEC changed its long-standing settlement policy, and now
requires admissions of misconduct in a discrete category
of cases where heightened accountability and acceptance
of responsibility by a defendant are appropriate and in the
public interest. By the end of FY 2015, the SEC had obtained
admissions in over 30 actions, and this trend is expected
to continue through FY 2017. Where admissions or other
acknowledgements of wrongdoing are critical, the SEC will
insist on them and, should defendants refuse, will litigate
those cases.

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

The Division is committed to charging wrongdoing across the
spectrum of securities laws violations. The Division is tasked
with enforcing a wide variety of statutes and rules, some
applicable only to certain types of firms such as brokerdealers, and some, such as antifraud provisions, that apply
broadly to all market participants. The Division requires
additional resources in order to properly address this wide
range of violations and violators.

Proactive Enforcement Efforts
The Division continues to implement a range of initiatives
designed to help it identify hidden or emerging threats
to the markets, act quickly to halt misconduct and
minimize investor harm, and maximize deterrence. These
initiatives include:
•	 Addressing Violations Through Resource-Saving
Sweeps and Streamlined Investigations: The Division
is committed to pursuing violations of varying type
and severity. For example, in early FY 2016, the
SEC filed its third round of actions under its Rule
105 initiative. Rule 105 is an anti-manipulation rule
intended to prevent stock price manipulation by
prohibiting firms and individuals from participating in
public stock offerings after selling short those same
stocks. The third round of actions involved only six
violators, as opposed to 24 in the first round and 20
in the second, suggesting that the initiative is having
a strong deterrent effect on would-be violators.
•	 Leveraging Data Tools and Analysis to Detect and
Investigate Violations: The Division has filed a number
of cases filed during the past fiscal year where data
tools and analysis played a significant role in their
origin or investigation, a trend that Enforcement sees
continuing into the following fiscal year and beyond.
For example, during FY 2015, the SEC announced
fraud charges against an investment advisory firm
and its owner for fraudulently “cherry-picking”
winning options trades, with help from DERA staff
who conducted a statistical analysis to determine
whether the trades at issue could have resulted
from a coincidental or lucky combination of trades.
To continue to bring cases like these that rely on data
tools and analysis, the Division needs commensurate
technology and staff.

PAGE

  60

•	 Continued Focus on Market Structure, Exchanges, and
Broker-Dealers: As sophisticated trading technologies and
trading venues have proliferated, Enforcement is focused
on keeping pace with an ever-evolving marketplace.
As an example, during FY 2015, the Commission filed
significant cases against market participants – such as
exchanges, ATSs, and broker-dealers – for failures in
controls, failures to safeguard customer information, net
capital violations, and manipulative trading, including
the hacking and Avon manipulation cases.
•	 Advanced Relational Trading Enforcement Metrics
Investigation System (ARTEMIS): This initiative focuses
on the analysis of suspicious trading patterns and
relationships among multiple traders. ARTEMIS
combines about 10 billion equity and options trade
records from SEC and FINRA and uses advanced
analytics, created by Division staff, to rank trades
based on different metrics. ARTEMIS is helpful in
not only identifying new suspicious trades, but also
finding previously undetected traders who might be
involved in an existing investigation.

FY 2017 Request
The Division must be adequately staffed to address
increasingly complex financial products and transactions,
handle the increasing size and complexity of the securities
markets, identify emerging threats and take prompt action
to halt violations, and recover funds for the benefit of
harmed investors. For FY 2017, the Division is requesting
52 additional positions. The Division will use the additional
requested positions to support its three core functions –
intelligence analysis, investigation, and litigation – in the
following ways:
Processing and prioritizing intelligence is key to Enforcement’s
efforts: A strong intelligence analysis capacity is at the core
of an effective enforcement program. The Division receives
and analyzes approximately 15,000 tips, complaints, and
referrals a year, and expects this volume to expand in
the coming years. Additionally, the SEC will shortly begin
receiving security-based swaps (SBS) data, as mandated
by the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, the Division needs to
continue to bolster its capabilities to efficiently analyze
the information so that the most promising leads can be
handed off to investigative staff.

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

The Division also requires additional staff to conduct earlystage investigations known as “matters under inquiry”
that often arise from these tips, complaints, and referrals.
Accordingly, the Division is requesting 10 new positions in
FY 2017 to continue to develop its data analytics function,
its tips review function, and the staff to whom the most
promising tips, complaints, and referrals are sent for
further investigation.

critical to the SEC’s investor-protection efforts. Furthermore,
an increasing percentage of enforcement actions have been
filed as contested matters, as opposed to being fully settled
at the outset. Enforcement requests 12 new positions in
FY 2017 to reinforce its litigation operations nationwide.
This increased allocation will enable the SEC to litigate
any case where it believes admissions of wrongdoing are
appropriate under its new policy, if necessary.

Enforcement must act swiftly and decisively in investigating
misconduct: The Enforcement program requires increased
staffing to promptly detect complex frauds and other
difficult-to-detect misconduct, whether it occurs at
hedge funds, broker-dealers, or “boiler rooms”; respond
to misconduct in the changing equity markets related
to algorithmic trading and “dark pools”; and address
large-scale insider trading and stock manipulation. Since
2012, the Division’s caseload of ongoing investigations
has risen 14 percent, from 1,475 to a current level of
1,677. The number of investigations opened has also risen
considerably, up to 980 investigations in FY 2015, only
slightly less than the previous fiscal year, which represented
the highest number of new investigations in the last five
fiscal years. We expect this historically high level of new
matters to continue in FY 2016 and FY 2017.

The Division must continue to invest in technology: The
Enforcement program must continue to invest in new
technologies that make our investigative and litigation
staff more efficient and effective – while being mindful of
overall costs and the need to keep pace with the market:

Enforcement is seeking 30 new positions in FY 2017 to
reinforce its investigative function. These new positions
will help the Division continue progress on existing
investigations and handle its increasing caseload, while
quickly investigating and bringing emergency actions in
cases where investors’ money may dissipate if immediate
action is not taken. These new staff would be applied
to the areas posing the highest risk to investors and
the marketplace.
The Division’s ability to litigate its increased caseload is
mission critical: The Division handles an expansive and
sophisticated docket of litigation and trials, often against
well-funded defendants. Ensuring that appropriate
resources are devoted to these cases after they are filed is

•	 Enterprise Data Analytics Platform: The Division plans
to develop a centralized, dynamic, and crossorganization workspace for data analytics.
•	 eDiscovery: The Division’s investigations deal with
expanding amounts of data and new techniques,
and we must continue to modernize our eDiscovery
technologies and toolsets so we can better collect,
search, categorize, and review relevant materials.
•	 Forensics Lab: Robust enforcement requires advanced
data forensics resources, so it is critical that the
Division continue to build out its forensics lab.
•	 Knowledge Management: The Division will continue to
enhance its new intranet knowledge management
portal that provides staff with an easy to navigate, fully
searchable repository of content and standard templates.
Many of these technologies will have benefits for
divisions and offices across the SEC. Investments made
into eDiscovery, knowledge management, document
management, and analytical tools and analysis platforms
are readily shared agency-wide. The Division also will
continue working closely with other Federal regulators
and law enforcement to share investigative techniques,
technologies, and capabilities when appropriate.

“Ongoing” investigations are those in which the investigation remains active. It excludes those that are open solely because they are in litigation; those in which the
SEC is seeking to collect assets and funds to satisfy outstanding judgments and debts owed to the SEC; those in which the SEC is distributing funds to harmed
investors; and those that are in some other post-litigation activity. “Ongoing” investigations also exclude those that are in the process of being closed.

The Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations
(OCIE) administers the SEC’s National Examination
Program (NEP). OCIE’s mission is to protect investors,
ensure market integrity and support responsible capital
formation through risk-focused strategies that: (1) improve
compliance; (2) prevent fraud; (3) monitor risk; and (4) inform
regulatory policy.
The additional resources being requested are essential for
OCIE to meet its objectives and fulfill the agency’s mission.
In particular, resources are needed to: (1) lessen the impact
of the disparity between the number of exam staff and
the growing number, size, and complexity of registered
firms, particularly in the investment management industry;
(2) examine new categories of regulated entities now
registered, or to be registered, as a result of the Dodd-Frank
and JOBS Acts; (3) enhance quantitative and data analytic
efforts; and (4) develop mechanisms to more effectively risk
target, monitor, and examine market participants.
OCIE requests an additional 127 positions to accomplish
these goals. Overall, OCIE’s risk-based program is designed
to focus resources on those firms and practices that pose the
greatest potential risk of violations that can harm investors
and the markets, and those entities that introduce significant

financial risks to the market. The following summarizes
key observations, issues, and challenges impacting the
examination program, all of which have influenced the
FY 2017 OCIE staffing request.
The breadth and complexity of the SEC-regulated securities
market is vast and growing: Overall, the size of the SEC
regulated community continues to dwarf the size of the
current examination program. OCIE anticipates that at
the beginning of FY 2017 it will oversee over 26,000
market participants, including approximately 12,500
investment advisers with nearly $70 trillion in assets under
management, approximately 850 investment company
complexes managing nearly 11,000 mutual funds and
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), over 4,000 broker-dealers
with more than 163,000 branch offices, more than 800
municipal advisors, 18 national securities exchanges, and
over 400 transfer agents. OCIE will also oversee at least
eight entities that provide clearing agency functions, four of
which have been deemed systemically important, as well as
the PCAOB, MSRB, SIPC, and FINRA. Additionally, several
new registrant categories, including security-based swap
execution facilities, security-based swap data repositories,
security-based swap dealers, and funding portals will

  63

PAGE

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

•

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

likely be subject to OCIE examinations and will require
additional resources
Exam coverage of the securities market remains limited: The staff
examined approximately 10 percent of registered investment
advisers in FY 2015 but roughly 40 percent of all registered
investment advisers have never been examined. Significant
additional resources are critical to the examination program in
order to improve the examination coverage of these advisers.
With respect to broker-dealers, the program is supplemented
by self-regulated organizations (SRO) oversight. Although
together the SEC and SROs examined at least a portion of the
activities of approximately 50 percent of broker-dealers during
FY 2015, regulators are examining well below one percent of
the approximately 163,000 branch offices each year.
Increases in the regulatory population and complex new products
and lines of business complicate oversight: The largest increase
in registered entities has occurred among investment
advisers. A decade ago, there were approximately 9,000
investment advisers managing $28 trillion in assets. OCIE
projects these figures will grow to 12,500 advisers managing
over $70 trillion in assets in FY 2017. But the increase in
the number of advisers and the amount of assets are not
the only factors necessitating more resources. NEP staff
also faces the challenges of increased use of new and
complex products by both investment advisers and brokerdealers, the increasing use of technology in areas such as
high-frequency and algorithmic trading, and the growth of
complex “families” of financial services companies with both
broker-dealer and investment adviser affiliates.
Legislative changes are having a significant impact on the
examination program: Additional staffing is needed to address
responsibilities added by various legislative changes. For
example, the registration of municipal advisors has added
responsibility for hundreds of additional registrants with
increasingly complex business lines. Other provisions in the
Dodd-Frank and JOBS Acts, such as those directing the
Commission to create a regulatory regime for the securitybased swap market and those addressing new fundraising
mechanisms, such as general solicitation and crowdfunding,
will require additional staff resources in FY 2017 in order for
OCIE to effectively carry out its expanded responsibilities.
Independent reviews have highlighted insufficient examination
resources and recommended additional funding: In the last
several years, a number of studies and reports have identified

PAGE

  64

inadequate resources as being a significant impediment to
examination program effectiveness. For example, a 2015
IMF review noted that the SEC’s “resources to conduct
examinations [of investment advisers] are limited.” Likewise,
the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General stated in 2009
that “OCIE’s staff resources have not kept pace with the
growth in the number of registered investment advisers,”
and “we strongly encourage OCIE and the Commission
to make available the necessary resources to ensure
that OCIE is better able to select investment advisers
and investment companies for examination and better
equipped to conduct comprehensive examinations of
these entities.” In addition, the SEC’s Office of the Investor
Advocate in June 2014 stated in a report to Congress
that the “SEC needs additional resources to bolster its
examination program.”
In light of the limited resources currently available to the
examination program and the existing challenges, the Office
is requesting 127 additional positions, which it intends to use
to address the issues identified above, including increasing
examination coverage of investment advisers, addressing
new responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank and JOBS Acts,
and other program improvements.

FY 2017 Request
The 127 requested positions for the National Examinations
Program would be used for the following key areas of focus:

Investment Adviser/Investment Company
Examination Program
The SEC plans to dedicate 102 positions to improving
coverage and implementing enhancements to the
examinations program pertaining to investment advisers
and investment companies. As stated above, the number
of registered investment advisers and their assets under
management has grown steadily over the last decade,
while staff resources have not kept pace with the growing
responsibilities. We expect the industry growth to continue
through FY 2016 and FY 2017, so that by FY 2017, OCIE
estimates that there will be nearly 20-25 investment advisers
per examiner. With the additional resources requested, the
staff will continue efforts to improve overall coverage of
investment advisers, including an emphasis on the nearly
40 percent of advisers that have never been examined.

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

Without these additional resources, it is likely that the
coverage level of investment advisers cannot rise much
above a range of 10 percent annually.
These requested positions also will be used to help improve
coverage of investment fund complexes, which will be
critically important given their increasing complexity. These
resources will aid the NEP in addressing factors such as
offerings of “alternative” investment strategies; significant
growth in certain types of funds, including ETFs; and the
relative riskiness of certain funds, including fixed income
funds that may be impacted by rising interest rates. OCIE is
undertaking an exercise to review the allocation of resources
across its program areas with a goal of reallocating staff to
examinations of investment advisors. This review is currently
in the formative stages and will include an assessment of
the potential impact of proposed reallocation.

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

area in order to evaluate compliance and the resulting impact
to capital formation and investor protection. Further, the
Volcker rule will present resource issues for broker-dealer
oversight given the complexity and wide-ranging impact on
broker-dealer operations and the efforts to coordinate with
other financial regulators.
Finally, while the number of registered broker-dealers has
decreased somewhat, in part due to consolidation in the
industry, the number of broker-dealer branch offices has
increased to more than 163,000. The SEC and SROs do not
have sufficient resources to examine an adequate portion
of these offices. Branch office activities are significant since
they are a main point of contact with retail customers and
present risks such as remote supervision. In light of these
risks, OCIE intends to continue to dedicate resources to
this area.

Broker-Dealer Examination Program

Clearance and Settlement Examination Program

The broker-dealer examination program continues to have
significant and expanding responsibilities and 10 additional
positions are being requested in order to hire expertise
necessary to supplement existing staff and address new
areas of responsibility. For example, resources in this program
will be used for examinations of recently registered municipal
advisors. By FY 2017, the SEC estimates that more than
800 entities will be registered as municipal advisors. OCIE
will utilize a portion of the additional resources requested to
examine and monitor these new registrants for compliance
with recently and soon-to-be adopted rules.

Overall, five additional positions are being requested to
enhance and expand the oversight of clearing agencies,
security-based swap data repositories, and transfer
agents. In recent years, both the scope and number of
clearing agencies required to be examined by the SEC have
grown. Examinations of these entities are complex and time
consuming and require particular expertise.

The requested positions will also be used to cover several
new categories of security-based swap market participants
that will be required to register with the Commission, including
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants. In order to effectively implement the related
Dodd-Frank Act provisions, OCIE is requesting additional
positions in FY 2017 in order to conduct inspections of these
newly registered market participants, provide information
to relevant Commission personnel, and coordinate efforts
with other regulators.
OCIE also expects to enhance exam procedures and
techniques in FY 2017 in response to recent regulatory
requirements. For example, as regulations related to
crowdfunding offerings become effective, the program will
need to devote additional resources and expertise to this

The SEC is required to conduct examinations, on at least
an annual basis, of securities clearing agencies that are
designated as “systemically important” and for which it is
the supervisory agency. These examinations are conducted
in consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System. In addition, as security-based swap data
repositories become registrants, additional staff will be
needed to perform periodic examinations of those entities.
These requested positions will help OCIE build a dedicated
team of derivatives and clearing specialists that will be able
to conduct cross-sector examinations of clearing agencies,
collaborate and respond to requests for assistance from
the Division of Trading and Markets and other regulators,
and enhance the NEP’s clearing and credit default swap/
derivatives expertise.
The additional positions also will help OCIE conduct riskbased, cause, and special examinations of transfer agents,
including joint examinations with Federal banking regulators.
The staff will review the services offered by transfer agents

  65

•

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

that are beyond their traditional transfer agent functions
(such as stock plan administration), and review transfer
agents’ safeguarding of customer information and custody
of shareholder funds.

Market Oversight Examination Program
Self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are critical to the SEC’s
oversight of the markets. In FY 2017, OCIE will conduct
risk-based inspections of national securities exchanges,
enhanced reviews of FINRA, and risk focused exams
of FINRA District Offices. Further, security-based swap
execution facilities (SEFs) are expected to be subject to
examination in FY 2017, requiring additional examination
staff. To fulfill these needs, OCIE would devote three
additional positions to this area.

Additional Significant Examination Program Efforts
OCIE also requires additional staffing to continue other
significant program-wide efforts, including its Technology
Controls Program (TCP), outreach initiatives and specialized
working groups as described further below.
Technology Controls Program (TCP): Technology has increased
the complexity, interconnectedness, and speed of
transactions, and continues to challenge market participants
and regulators. In FY 2017, OCIE’s TCP will conduct risk
targeted exams of Regulation Systems Compliance and
Integrity Entities (SCI entities), to evaluate whether they
have written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure the capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability,
and security of their SCI systems. OCIE also will seek to
enhance cyber-security examinations by working with the
Department of Treasury, National Security Agency, and the
Department of Homeland Security. To adequately fulfill the
above obligations, TCP would need to hire a significant
number of information technology security professionals with
specialized experiences and skills. Three additional positions
are requested to further enhance the work of the TCP.
Office of Managing Executive (OME) and Office of Chief
Counsel: OME supports the NEP through risk analysis
and surveillance, registration, training, human capital, and
information technology initiatives. Significantly, the Office of
Risk Analysis and Surveillance within OME will continue to
improve the risk targeting of firms and activities by helping to
monitor and assess risks of all registered entities. Meanwhile,

PAGE

  66

OCIE’s Office of Chief Counsel will continue to provide legal
and other interpretative advice to the program while also
overseeing the examination program’s internal compliance
program. Four additional positions are requested in FY 2017
to support the functions of these groups.
Other Significant Initiatives: In FY 2017, OCIE will continue to
improve its surveillance and risk assessment functions. This
includes performing thousands of preliminary risk reviews
that help to focus the program’s limited resources on firms
and industry practices posing the greatest risk to investors
and the markets. OCIE anticipates that improvements in
risk assessment and surveillance activities, combined with
other initiatives aimed at incentivizing whistleblowers and
improving the agency’s tracking and monitoring of tips,
complaints, and referrals, will necessitate more time spent on
conducting examinations of the identified higher risk entities.
OCIE also will continue its monitoring program focused
on large and complex firms that may pose significant risk
to the various markets and to their customers, due to
their size, complexity, and connectivity with other large
firms and financial institutions. This program is designed
to ensure we have an accurate and timely understanding
of the key risks and controls of these firms, and to help
facilitate effective, targeted examinations.
OCIE is also continuing the deployment of specialized
teams focusing on particular market issues that directly
affect investors and the functioning of the markets. OCIE
will work to broaden the expertise and knowledge of these
teams, enabling them to better identify, monitor, and assess
the impact of certain risks on the industry.
In FY 2017, OCIE will continue efforts aimed at encouraging
stronger industry compliance programs. These efforts
include conducting OCIE’s Compliance Outreach programs,
which provide information and resources for compliance
personnel of registered entities, issuing public reports and
Risk Alerts, and speaking at conferences concerning areas
of regulatory interest.

Developing Technology and Data Analytics
As technology continues to evolve and alter the way entities
conduct business, it is imperative that the examination
program make appropriate investments to keep pace and to
more effectively conduct its activities. Continued investment

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

in a multi-year technology and analytics plan is critically
important to the success of OCIE’s programs. Several of
the key initiatives in this area for FY 2017 and beyond are
discussed below.
Data and Quantitative Analytics: The examination program
will continue to focus resources on developing tools that
will help analyze large amounts of data and generate alerts
and exception reports focused on high risk activities and
registered entities that require additional follow-up by the
staff. These tools also will improve risk assessment and
surveillance efforts by providing the staff with a greater
ability to monitor for trends and emerging fraud risks,
ultimately enabling the staff to allocate SEC resources
more effectively.

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

Continued Development of Comprehensive Examination Platform:
In FY 2017, OCIE will continue to improve and enhance
a comprehensive program tracking and examination
management system. The system provides examiners with a
complete repository of exam related information that allows
the staff to conduct exams more effectively and analyze
trends across the program.
Improvements to IT Infrastructure: In FY 2017, the examination
program will continue to focus on identifying and acquiring
additional tools and technologies that can be utilized in
risk assessment efforts, examinations, and other related
initiatives. The examination program will work with the
Office of Information Technology to develop and maintain
an appropriate technological infrastructure for this data, so
that it can be easily accessed, analyzed, and disseminated.

In support of the Commission’s mission to protect investors,
maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and facilitate
capital formation, the Division of Corporation Finance (CF)
seeks to ensure that investors have access to material
information in order to make informed investment decisions
when a company offers its securities to the public and
on an ongoing basis as companies continue to provide
information to the marketplace. Through its selective
review program, CF reviews company filings and provides
comments to address possible material noncompliance with
disclosure and accounting requirements under the Federal
securities laws and to enhance investor protection. CF also
makes recommendations to the Commission for new or
revised rules relating to the disclosure requirements for
reporting companies, and provides interpretive assistance
to companies on SEC rules and forms.

Filing Review Activities
In FY 2017, CF will continue its regular and systematic
review of reporting companies, reviewing company
reports representing a substantial portion of total market
capitalization. As in past years, CF anticipates exceeding
the minimum review requirement of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. CF selectively reviews filings, including
registration statements, other transactional filings, and

PAGE

  68

ongoing reports made under the Securities Act of 1933 and
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to monitor and enhance
compliance with disclosure and accounting requirements.
These filings include those of new issuers and companies
already reporting under the Exchange Act. In conducting
disclosure reviews, CF concentrates its review resources on
critical disclosures that appear to conflict with Commission
rules or applicable accounting standards or that appear to
be materially deficient in explanation or clarity.

Rulemaking and Interpretive Advice
CF recommends new rules, or amendments to existing
rules, to the Commission to improve investor protection
and facilitate capital formation, at times in response
to statutory mandates. CF also provides interpretive
guidance to companies, investors, and their advisors
through issuance of staff legal and accounting bulletins,
updates to the Division’s financial reporting manual,
no-action and interpretive letters, compliance and
disclosure interpretations on the Commission’s website,
and responses to telephone and email inquiries. During
FY 2017, CF will continue to assist the Commission, as
needed, with implementing any remaining rules mandated
by the Dodd-Frank Act and JOBS Act. CF will also assist
the Commission in finalizing the study of the Commission’s

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

disclosure rules required by the Fixing America’s Surface
Transportation (FAST) Act, enacted in December 2015,
and in developing recommendations arising out of that
study for new or revised rules. In FY 2017, CF will also
provide assistance and interpretive guidance to small
businesses and other market participants related to the
Commission’s 2015 rules that allow for expanded access
to capital through crowdfunding and under Regulation A.

FY 2017 Request
The Division requests four additional positions in FY 2017
to meet its goals and to enhance its role in promoting
full, fair, and timely disclosure of information for investors.
The new positions will enable CF to strengthen its core
disclosure review program and meet any increased

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

workload in capital raising or transactional filings resulting
from changing market conditions, additional emerging
growth companies confidentially submitting registration
statements for non-public review, and additional small
business Regulation A filings resulting from the Commission’s
2015 rules changes. The new positions will also enable
CF to fully support the Commission’s rulemaking priorities,
including improving the effectiveness of reporting company
disclosure and implementing recommendations resulting
from the Regulation S-K study required by the FAST Act of
2015. Finally, the new positions will enable CF to respond
to anticipated increases in requests for assistance and
interpretive guidance from small businesses, investors,
and their representatives related to the rules adopted by
the Commission in 2015 to allow for expanded access
to capital through crowdfunding and under Regulation A.

The mission of the Division of Trading and Markets (TM,
or the Division) is to establish and maintain standards for
fair, orderly, and efficient markets, while fostering investor
protection and confidence in the markets. To meet the
mission requirements, TM has five functions, each
focused on a specific part of the markets. These include
Broker-Dealer Finance/Broker-Dealer Risk (OBDF/OBDR),
Chief Counsel (OCC), Clearance and Settlement (OCS),
Derivatives Policy and Trading Practices (ODPTP), and
Market Supervision (OMS). In addition, the Division has
two groups serving in supporting functions: the Office
of Analytics and Research (OAR) and the Office of the
Managing Executive (OME).
Overall, TM supervises the major market participants
in the U.S. securities markets, including 18 securities
exchanges (equities and options), 84 alternative trading
systems (ATSs), over 4,000 broker-dealers, six active
clearing agencies, over 400 transfer agents, FINRA, and
securities information processors. The Division also works
closely with the Office of Municipal Securities to supervise
the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) and
municipal advisors.
The scope of the Division’s supervisory responsibilities
is expected to continue to increase. Since FY 2006, the
number of exchanges registered with the Commission

PAGE

  70

has doubled to 18. In FY 2016 and FY 2017, the Division
expects to review and process registration applications
by up to four more entities seeking exchange registration.
The Division also anticipates that up to three new clearing
agencies will register with the Commission, as well as a
significant number of new registrants under the DoddFrank Act and the JOBS Act once registration requirements
established by those laws are implemented.
The Division is responsible for more than 30 separate
rulemaking initiatives under the Dodd-Frank Act. Many
of these rulemakings are the first step in new ongoing
supervisory and regulatory functions for the Division
that will extend into FY 2017. These initiatives and
functions include:
•	 Registration and regulation of security-based swap
data repositories (SDRs), SBSDs, MSBSPs, and swap
execution facilities;
•	 Regulatory reporting and public dissemination of
security-based swap data;
•	 Mandatory clearing of security-based swaps;
•	 Application of security-based swap rules to crossborder activities and persons engaged in those
activities;

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

•	 Expanded regulation and supervision of clearing
agencies; and
•	 Ongoing implementation of final rules restricting certain
proprietary trading activities of broker-dealers under
the Volcker Rule, including interagency coordination
of interpretations, examinations, and enforcement of
the rules.
The JOBS Act also provided for “crowdfunding” brokers
and funding portals, creating a need for implementation
and oversight in conjunction with new rules.
As part of its ongoing duties to regulate the anti-money
laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF)
obligations of broker-dealers, TM serves on a Treasury-led
task force evaluating the government’s AML-CTF regime.
TM also continues to represent the SEC in the U.S.
delegation to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an
intergovernmental organization that develops and promotes
policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
The Division provides technical assistance to the Department
of the Treasury, which heads the U.S. delegation to FATF
on issues pertaining to the securities industry, including the
upcoming evaluation by FATF of U.S.’ AML-CTF efforts.
In FY 2017, TM also will face growing demands in its
supervision of critical securities market infrastructure, with
respect to both the implementation of new Dodd-Frank
Act-related responsibilities and the expansion of its existing
oversight program. The Division will expand its oversight
of existing clearing agencies, particularly those that are
designated as systemically important by the Financial
Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC), and will continue
to review their rule filings on an ongoing basis. As with
exchanges, many clearing agency rule changes filed with
the SEC must be handled on a significantly expedited basis
under the Dodd-Frank Act. Additionally, TM will need to focus
on significant industry initiatives to reform clearing agency
practices with respect to disclosure of risk management
information, tri-party securities lending activities, and the
duration of the standard securities settlement cycle, among
other matters.
The need for better trading and market information for
the SEC and SROs to effectively conduct surveillance and
assess market activity across a wide range of trading venues
remains a priority for TM. In FY 2012, the Commission

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

adopted a rule directing SROs to implement a consolidated
audit trail that would capture order and other trade
information across all markets. TM expects to continue to
monitor the SROs’ progress in developing the consolidated
audit trail and to review and analyze the national market
system plan submitted by the SROs. This effort is going to
result in technology development and implementation, as
well as processes in support of analysis on the consolidated
audit trail data. This data is expected to become available
starting in FY 2017.
OAR, working with the Division of Economic and Risk
Analysis (DERA), will continue to publish both one-time
and recurring reports concerning liquidity, volatility and
other market characteristics, both to expand the amount of
publicly available information on these topics and to establish
a more sound empirical basis for future market structure
initiatives. Such tools will enable TM and other SEC staff to
perform regular analyses related to general market depth,
order flow, and liquidity, helping to further inform the SEC’s
rulemaking and market oversight.
TM will continue to monitor trading in the U.S. exchange and
OTC securities markets, as well as continue its analysis of
the economic research on market structure issues. TM will
consider initiatives to protect investors and improve the
quality of markets – particularly in light of the increasing
technological sophistication of the markets and the potential
for excessive market volatility, among other developments.
The Division will consider initiatives with respect to the OTC
equity markets, including a focus on fair competition among
these markets.
TM will continue to pursue initiatives to improve the market
structure for trading fixed income securities, including
municipal and corporate bonds. Current and ongoing
initiatives include the adoption of riskless principal markup
disclosure rules by FINRA and the MSRB and development
of Commission rule proposals designed to improve pre-trade
price transparency in these markets.
The SEC’s oversight of security-based swap clearing
agencies requires (1) ongoing reviews of the rulebooks
and proposed rule changes of these clearing agencies;
(2) reviews of their requests for exemptive orders and other
relief to better harmonize the practices of the CFTC and
the SEC; and (3) reviews of new clearing business initiatives
as the use of security-based swaps expands. TM expects

  71

PAGE

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

•

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

greater workload associated with SEC rules related to
security-based swaps clearing, as many of the standards
and the associated registrations are new.
TM will continue rulemaking efforts regarding its supervision
of broker-dealers, including by conducting ongoing
monitoring of broker-dealers that use value-at-risk (VaR)
models to calculate net capital and assessing risks arising
from broker-dealer affiliates through the Section 17(h)
program. The Division also is reviewing proposals to enhance
the capital and liquidity arrangements by these firms. The
Division also expects to advance the last set of amendments
to the rules regarding the removal of statutory references to
credit ratings, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
The staff, in conjunction with the Office of Compliance
Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), expects to register
security based – swap dealers (SBSDs), major securitybased swap participants (MSBSPs), and municipal advisors
– in addition to already regulated broker-dealers on a rolling
basis, monitor market developments and promulgate new
rules where needed, and respond to interpretive requests.
The demand on agency resources of this registration
process will be especially high to the extent that firms are
permitted to use VaR models to calculate regulatory capital
and customer margin requirements. Currently, the Division
oversees six firms subject to the Alternative Net Capital rules,
and expects to add two firms to this group in FY 2016, that
will require monitoring in FY 2017 and beyond.
Other areas of focus in rulemaking and otherwise include:
•	 Expanded regulation and supervision of transfer agents;
•	 Facilitation of the Equity Market Structure Advisory
Committee;
•	 Implementation of ATS transparency;
•	 Market structure-related rule proposals;
•	 Establishing a uniform fiduciary standard of conduct
for all broker-dealers and investment advisers when
providing personalized investment advice; and
•	 Crowdfunding, including registration of crowdfunding
portals, market assessment and the three-year lookback study.
TM further expects that additional responsibilities will arise
based on the significant implementation efforts that will

PAGE

  72

be required for the rulemaking already underway. Once
implemented, each new programmatic responsibility will
require incorporation into the interpretation and guidance
function in order to provide response to inquiries from
registered entities.

FY 2017 Request
The Division will face significant new challenges in
FY 2017 regarding regulation and supervision of the U.S.
securities markets. In FY 2017, the Division plans to use
the seven additional positions requested to undertake
new market-related responsibilities resulting from ongoing
or recently completed rulemaking, as well as continuing
challenges in the area of market supervision. These positions
would be employed in the following areas:
Office of Clearance and Settlement: The Division would add
three positions to the Office of Clearance and Settlement.
One Attorney Advisor would help support international
initiatives to comprehensively address risks posed by
central counterparties, clearing agencies, and other financial
market infrastructure. The Office also would bring on board
a Financial Engineer to leverage their technical expertise in
support of domestic rulemaking and international initiatives.
This individual also would coordinate with peers in other
stakeholder groups to ensure forward progress against
goals. Finally, the Division would hire an additional Attorney
Advisor to work with risk staff and other stakeholders to
ensure appropriate supervision and monitoring of the 2-3
new clearing agencies and swap data repositories that are
expected to register in the next year.
Office of Market Supervision: The Division requests adding a
supervisory staff member to lead the effort to act upon the
large number of rule filings that are submitted by national
securities exchanges and FINRA and that must be acted
on within strict statutory deadlines.
Office of Broker-Dealer Finance/Broker-Dealer Risk: TM would
add one position to lead a new Analytics and Reporting
function dedicated to monitoring internal controls and
risk management practices of broker-dealers, including
compliance with the new business conduct rules. Also, TM
seeks to hire a staff member to improve reporting about
broker-dealer finances, perform cross-firm liquidity analysis,
and analyze fully the risks of the derivatives positions in
the firms.

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

Office of Derivatives Policy and Trading Practices: TM requests
a new Attorney Advisor to assist in implementing procedures
for foreign regulators or market participants to apply for
substituted compliance, including performing interpretive

•

work on behalf of the Division, which would permit market
participants to comply with U.S. requirements by complying
with foreign requirements.

Mutual funds are the largest segment of the investment
company industry, accounting for 87 percent of investment
company assets. Mutual funds’ assets under management
have grown from $94.5 billion at the end of 1979 to
$15.3 trillion at September 30, 2015, a more than 100 fold
increase. Over the same period, the number of mutual fund
portfolios has increased from 526 to 8,066.
New types of funds are growing in market share. Exchangetraded funds (ETFs) – open-end funds and unit investment
trusts whose shares list and trade on a national securities
exchange – have grown rapidly in recent years and
now account for approximately $2 trillion in assets, or
approximately 11 percent of the long-term U.S. openend investment company industry, primarily in passive,
index-based strategies. In June 2015, ETF trading was
approximately 28 percent of total daily exchange value.
Private funds have also grown significantly in number and
size. In addition, many mutual funds are now engaging in

alternative investment strategies, and some are making
extensive use of derivatives.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, there has been a
significant flow of cash into bond funds accompanied by
a lesser but significant flow of cash out of equity funds.
From January 2009 to September 2015, approximately
$1 trillion flowed into bond mutual funds while approximately
$133 billion flowed out of equity funds.

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

As of October 1, 2015, there were 11,986 SEC-registered
investment advisers reporting approximately $66.8 trillion
in regulatory assets under management, which was an
eight percent increase from the beginning of FY 2015.
Approximately 60 percent of these advisers provide
investment advice to individuals. Approximately 37 percent
provide investment advice to private funds such as hedge
funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds with
gross assets of about $10.4 trillion. In addition to registered
investment advisers, the SEC also receives reports from
approximately 3,047 exempt reporting advisers – advisers
that are exempt from registration with the SEC because they
are venture capital fund advisers or mid-sized private fund
advisers – that report managing approximately $2.3 trillion
in private funds.

Improved Reporting of Information about
Fund Operations and Portfolio Holdings
The financial crisis highlighted the importance of the
careful management of risk by funds and their advisers,
including portfolio composition risks and operational risks
in particular. In FY 2017, IM expects to continue to focus
considerable attention on a set of initiatives to enhance
investment management industry resilience to portfolio
composition risk and operational risk. The initiatives are
designed to:
•	 Improve the data and other information used by the
Commission to understand the risks of the asset
management industry and develop appropriate
regulatory responses. The Commission has benefited
from monthly portfolio and other information
reported by money market funds, which has been
used to inform policy, rulemaking, examination,
and enforcement use. In FY 2015, the Commission
proposed rules that are designed to modernize and
consolidate certain reporting forms and require more
frequent and enhanced reporting of portfolio holdings.
The rules would require all mutual funds (other than
money market funds), ETFs and closed-end funds to
file monthly portfolio holdings information and selected
volatility metrics with the Commission in a tagged
format and to file a new form with census-type data.
The staff expects to analyze comments and develop
recommendations for the Commission to adopt and
implement the rules in FY 2016 and FY 2017.

PAGE

  76

•	 Ensure that registered funds enhance their fund-level
controls so they are able to identify and address risks
related to their liquidity and use of derivatives.
In FY 2015, the Commission proposed reforms
to promote effective liquidity risk management
throughout the open-end fund industry. The proposed
reforms would require mutual funds and exchangetraded funds to implement liquidity risk management
programs and enhance disclosure regarding fund
liquidity and redemption practices. The proposal also
would provide a framework under which mutual funds
could elect to use “swing pricing.” The staff anticipates
reviewing comments received and developing
recommendations for the Commission to adopt and
implement the rules in FY 2016 and FY 2017.
In FY 2016, the Commission proposed a new rule that
would address the use of derivatives by registered
investment companies under Section 18 of the
Investment Company Act. The rule is designed to
enhance management and oversight of mutual fund,
ETF, and closed-end fund exposure to derivatives,
taking into account comments on the Commission’s
2011 Concept Release on the Use of Derivatives by
Registered Investment Companies. Our staff anticipates
reviewing comments received and developing
recommendations for the Commission to adopt and
implement the rules in FY 2016 and FY 2017.
•	 Ensure that firms have a plan for transitioning their
clients’ assets when circumstances warrant. Staff is
developing a recommendation to the Commission
to propose requiring investment advisers to create
and maintain transition plans reasonably designed
to address risks related to the transition of significant
numbers of clients.
•	 Implement the new requirements for annual stress
testing by large investment advisers and large funds,
as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Periodic stress
testing could help these firms and the Commission
better understand the potential impact of stress events
on the asset management industry, particularly in
assessing liquidity and redemption risk. The staff is
developing a recommendation that the Commission
propose rules providing methodologies and reporting
requirements.

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

Other Rulemaking Initiatives

FY 2017 Request

In FY 2017, IM anticipates that additional staff time will be
devoted to pursuing other rulemaking initiatives, including
work towards establishing a uniform fiduciary standard of
conduct for all broker-dealers and investment advisers
when providing personalized investment advice about
securities to retail customers, and requiring third party
compliance reviews for registered investment advisers.

The SEC requests a total of seven new positons for the
Division of Investment Management to implement these
important policy objectives. Of these seven positions, IM
requests three personnel to conduct ongoing analysis
of data, including new data that would be submitted to
the SEC under the initiatives described above. The new
positions would be used to develop holdings, performance,
and risk analytics for portfolio and other data filed by more
than 15,000 investment company portfolios on new Forms
N-PORT (monthly) and N-CEN (annually), if adopted. The
new staff would also manage N-PORT and N-CEN data;
produce and evaluate analytical reports; resolve complex
data quality and data management issues; and work with
filers and filing agents to resolve process, definitional, and
computational issues associated with individual filings’
portfolio holdings or risk metrics.

Exchange Traded Funds
ETFs have unique attributes that present different regulatory
concerns than conventional investment companies. ETFs
are rapidly growing, increasingly complex financial products
whose activities raise disclosure, conflict of interest, and
market structure, and other issues. In FY 2017, IM plans
to continue to focus considerable attention on product
innovation and potential market stresses in this area,
including evaluating additional applications for exchangetraded funds that may involve novel and complex structures,
trading mechanisms, and index replication methodologies.

Risk and Examinations Office
The Risk and Examinations Office (REO) manages,
monitors, and analyzes industry data; engages in dialogues
with senior management and boards of significant asset
management firms; provides ongoing financial analysis of
the asset management industry, including the risk-taking
activities of investment advisers and investment companies;
gathers and analyzes through its examination function
operational information directly from participants in the asset
management industry; and maintains industry knowledge
and technical expertise for the Division. In FY 2017, REO
plans to devote additional resources to expand and improve
IM’s monitoring and oversight of the industry, hire additional
staff with industry, quantitative and computerized data
analysis expertise, and implement new data analytics based
on modernized data reporting.

IM also requests three additional positions to monitor
implementation of new liquidity, derivatives, stress testing
and transition planning requirements described above,
provide interpretive advice, and respond to exemptive
applications requests.
Finally, IM requests one new quantitative research analyst
position to support its Disclosure Review and Accounting
Office (DRAO). The new position would enhance IM’s
risk monitoring program by (1) applying sophisticated
quantitative analysis techniques to the review of disclosure
filings of investment companies whose investment
objectives seek to provide specified return, risk, or market
volatility results through use of complex option, futures, or
swaps strategies; and (2) providing subject matter expertise
to DRAO in connection with the process of identifying
selected comments that may be appropriate for a variety
of seemingly different options, futures or swaps strategies
that share similar risk/return profiles.

The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)
integrates sophisticated analysis of economic, financial,
and legal disciplines with data analytics and quantitative
methodologies in support of the SEC’s mission. The Division’s
expertise supports a spectrum of SEC activities including:
policymaking, rulemaking, enforcement, examination, and
data processing and risk analytics.
As part of the policy decision-making process, DERA uses
rigorous data analytics to produce high-quality analyses
that address the economic issues associated with the
regulation of the financial markets and enforcement of
Federal securities laws. These analyses typically involve
qualitatively analyzing the potential economic impacts of
a particular regulatory action, collecting and quantitatively
analyzing market data, evaluating pertinent academic
literature, and/or conducting follow-up monitoring or
review of market impacts. DERA economists conduct
studies mandated by Congress and the Commission that
support the Commission in crafting policies and regulations.
Economists also often develop and execute independent
analysis of salient economic issues and identify and
summarize current academic literature, which is frequently
used to suggest or support Commission actions.

In addition to its role in the rulemaking process, DERA also
performs the following functions:
•	 Working with Office of Compliance Inspections and
Examinations (OCIE) on developing new models,
methods, and tools in support of a risk-based
inspections program designed to help allocate
resources effectively in review and examination of
regulated entities;
•	 Providing analyses in support of the enforcement
program, including to detect market abuse and other
violations, calculate ill-gotten gains, and determine
penalties and disgorgement;
•	 Conducting in-depth and data-driven studies on
investors, other market participants, and financial
markets to inform the Commission on a variety of topics,
such as descriptive studies of current market conditions,
analyses of the potential effects of policy choices, and
reviews of the effects of recently implemented rules;
•	 Developing a framework for the analysis of public and
private financial data to proactively track market trends,
new products and new product reviews, and innovative
financial practices;

  79

PAGE

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

•

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

•	 Identifying, evaluating, and recommending ways
staff can use data, including interactive data, as well
as providing expertise in analytical and quantitative
research and support;
•	 Building relationships with a broad range of external
financial experts, whether in academia, the private
sector, or other agencies, in order to remain current on
new market developments and the latest in financial
research; and
•	 Sharing knowledge through the development and
publication of research which focuses on matters of
significance to the SEC.
DERA assists in the Commission’s efforts to identify, analyze,
and respond to risks and trends, including those associated
with new financial products and strategies. Because of the
range and nature of its activities, DERA serves the critical
function of promoting cross-agency collaboration that takes
advantage of the agency’s broad range of expertise. DERA
continues to amplify its expertise by bringing on board a
small cadre of academics under Intergovernmental Personnel
Agreements (IPAs) and experts under the Special Government
Employees authority. These individuals work closely with
DERA’s Financial Economists and actively contribute to the
Division’s mission functions and activities.

FY 2017 Request
The FY 2017 request focuses on expanding DERA’s core
expertise and capacity in the following crucial areas:
Economic Analysis and Research: The majority of DERA’s staff
provide economic analyses and conduct robust research in
support of Commission rulemaking and policy development.

PAGE

  80

Many of these staff also conduct research to enhance the
Division’s awareness and understanding of significant
financial market issues and potential solutions to identified
market failures and risks. There is a continued demand for
this expertise analyses across the SEC. In FY 2017, one
new Financial Economist position is requested to focus on
Commission considerations of Exchange Traded Funds and
Products. The incumbent will have strong programming and
empirical analysis skills and expertise in financial economics
sufficient to work on highly complex cases involving
policy issues.
Data Analytics, Technical Support, and Risk Assessment:
DERA provides data analytics, technical support, and
risk assessment to help focus the agency’s resources on
matters presenting the greatest perceived risks in litigation,
examinations, and registrant reviews. DERA will continue
working with staff throughout the SEC to develop analytical
approaches and tools to help inform policy, monitoring,
and surveillance activities. These efforts include continued
responsibility for management of the SEC’s Tips, Complains
and Referral (TCR) system. For FY 2017, a total of four new
positions are requested to further enhance DERA efforts in
this area. Specifically, the Division is requesting two Financial
Economists, one Research Associate, and one IT Specialist.
Program Support: The Office of Chief Counsel (OCC) delivers
extensive legal advice and support for DERA’s mission
essential functions and activities. Also, the OCC provides
guidance and counsel to the Chief Economist and staff
regarding legal issues implicated by the Division’s broad
mandate. The FY 2017 request includes one new attorney
adviser to support DERA’s work across the SEC.

The General Counsel serves as the chief legal officer of the
Commission and heads the Office of the General Counsel
(OGC). OGC provides independent legal analysis and advice
to the Chair, Commissioners, and operating divisions on all
aspects of the Commission’s activities. OGC also defends
the Commission in Federal district courts, represents the
Commission in appellate matters and amicus curiae filings,
and oversees the SEC’s bankruptcy program.
In FY 2017, OGC anticipates continued work on initiatives
to reform the existing regulatory structure for the securities
markets and the financial services industry. OGC also expects
to continue to provide technical assistance to Congress and
other financial regulatory agencies on numerous legislative
initiatives and other matters, as well as continue to respond
to Congressional inquiries.

FY 2017 Request
OGC is seeking two positions for FY 2017, of which one is
for OGC’s Legal Policy Group and the other for the Office’s
General Litigation Group. These two positions would assist
in the following areas:
Legislative Activity and Technical Assistance: In FY 2017,
efforts to strengthen the framework for financial regulation
likely will involve continued legislative activity, for which OGC

PAGE

  82

will be tasked to provide ongoing technical assistance to
Congress and other financial regulatory agencies. OGC
also expects to prepare and review written testimony for
congressional hearings, and prepare and review responses
to Congressional correspondence. The high level of
Congressional interest in the SEC’s mission, organization,
and activities has resulted in the need to provide large
volumes of documents in response to specific Congressional
inquiries. In FY 2017, Congressional and public interest in
the Commission is expected to remain high.
Rulemaking Activities: OGC expects to advise the divisions and
offices on a continued high number of rulemaking initiatives
to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other rulemaking initiatives such as rules designed to: improve transparency and investor protection; facilitate capital raising in small
offerings; improve practices in the asset-backed securities
markets; and address market structure developments.
Investigations Support: In FY 2017, OGC anticipates increased
workload related to a larger number of enforcement actions
and the high volume of enforcement cases against attorneys
practicing before the Commission who may have engaged
in unethical or improper conduct. This workload also will
be affected by the increase in whistleblower complaints
received from outside sources. OGC also anticipates that
the volume of labor and employee relations matters requiring

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

OGC assistance will rise with the size of the SEC’s workforce,
and OGC expects to receive an increase in the number of

The Office of the Chief Accountant (OCA) is responsible for
establishing and interpreting accounting policy to enhance
the transparency and relevancy of financial reporting
for investors. OCA works to improve the professional
performance of public company auditors to ensure
that financial statements used for investment decisions
are presented fairly and have credibility. OCA leads the
SEC’s efforts to oversee accounting standard-setting by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB),
and auditor oversight and standard-setting by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).
In FY 2015, OCA engaged in further outreach and analysis
regarding possible paths forward for incorporating IFRS
into the U.S. financial reporting system for U.S. issuers.
Furthermore, OCA focused on implementation of the new
converged accounting standard on revenue recognition.
In addition, in FY 2015, OCA coordinated with the PCAOB
as the Commission considered revisions to audit committee
disclosures and the PCAOB moved forward with its project to
improve transparency through disclosure of the engagement
partner and other participants in the audit.
OCA also continued to support the Commission in reviewing
PCAOB inspection findings and processing requests for
review, evaluating new PCAOB auditing standards and
interpretations and overseeing other PCAOB matters.
In addition to these areas of focus, in 2015, OCA, with
the assistance from staff from the Office of Compliance
Inspections and Examinations, planned and began

preparing for an inspection of a PCAOB program area, to
be conducted in FY 2016.
In FY 2016, OCA plans to conduct the inspection of a
PCAOB program area described above. OCA also plans
to continue to oversee the PCAOB’s efforts to improve audit
quality by revising its standard-setting process, with a focus
on improving its timeliness in this regard. Given the growth of
the PCAOB in recent years and the expansion of its authority,
OCA will need to increase its PCAOB oversight efforts.
Such efforts may include this type of review of PCAOB
program areas as appropriate. In addition, OCA will continue
to monitor FASB/IASB standard setting and transition
activities for new standards for revenue recognition, leasing,
consolidation, financial instruments, and credit losses.

FY 2017 Request
OCA requests at two additional positions in FY 2017 to
support planned initiatives, goals and objectives. OCA’s
primary initiatives, goals and objectives include the oversight
of the FASB/IASB standard setting and transition activities
for new, comprehensive standards on revenue recognition,
leasing, financial instruments and credit losses. Additionally
for oversight of the PCAOB, support for other division and
office rule-making through consultation on significant
accounting and auditing matters, provide accounting and
auditing training and advice to CF in the context of their filing
review program and to ENF in the context of enforcement
of the federal securities laws, and executing OCA-led
rulemaking and policy initiatives.

The Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA)
seek to provide individual investors with the information
they need to make sound investment decisions. OIEA
administers two primary programs to promote this mission:
assisting individual investors with complaints and inquiries
about the securities markets and market participants, and
conducting educational outreach to individual investors.
OIEA also helps to inform Commission policy by advising
the Commission and Commission staff on various issues
from the perspective of the individual investor, including
with respect to rulemakings, Investor Advisory Committee
recommendations, and through IOSCO’s Committee on
Retail Investors.

Research indicates that many individuals are not taking
key steps to protect their money from investment fraud,
including researching the background of an investment
professional before investing. In FY 2016, OIEA plans to
launch a public service campaign pilot focused on helping
individuals protect themselves from investment fraud,
including raising awareness about Investor.gov. The Office
expects that this campaign will drive increased traffic to
Investor.gov which will in turn significantly increase the
number of investor inquiries and questions received by
the Office going forward, including in FY 2017.

Each year, OIEA has contact with millions of individuals
through its investor assistance and education programs.
OIEA assists investors who contact the SEC with questions
or to complain about the perceived mishandling of their
investments by investment professionals and others.
Through its investor education program, OIEA produces
and distributes educational materials, leads educational
seminars and investor-oriented events, and partners
with other Federal agencies, state regulators, consumer
groups, and self-regulatory organizations on financial
literacy initiatives. OIEA plays an important role in the
Commission’s key initiatives aimed at protecting investors,
including helping senior citizens and military families guard
against securities fraud.

The Office is seeking two new positions to expand its investor
assistance efforts. The Office estimates it will respond to an
increased level of investor assistance requests compared to
previous years. These positions are needed to address this
increasing workload, maintain response times for investor
contacts and improve quality assurance.

supervisory cooperation, developing and implementing
strategies to further SEC policy interests in the regulation
and oversight of cross-border securities activities, managing
and executing the SEC’s participation in international
regulatory bodies, engaging in regulatory dialogues with our
international counterparts, and providing technical assistance
to strengthen partnerships with foreign authorities.
OIA has four primary functional areas:
•	 Enforcement Cooperation
•	 Regulatory Policy and Relationships with
Foreign Counterparts
•	 Supervisory Cooperation
•	 Technical Assistance.

Enforcement Cooperation
Investigative and Litigation Support: OIA staff assists the
SEC’s Division of Enforcement with hundreds of requests
for international assistance each year, particularly in the area
of coordination of parallel proceedings with foreign securities
and law enforcement authorities. This assistance is provided
through all stages from investigation, through litigation, to
the conclusion of the matter. OIA assists Enforcement with
efforts to freeze and repatriate assets held in foreign nations
and provides guidance to foreign counterparts in their efforts
to secure the proceeds of fraud present within the U.S.

International Enforcement Policy: OIA actively participates in
multilateral efforts to enhance international enforcement
cooperation, representing the SEC on multiple International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) committees
and steering groups. OIA coordinates with foreign counterparts
to develop policies relating to enforcement matters, and to
promote international cooperation among securities regulators
in their respective investigations and cases.

Regulatory Policy and Relationships
with Foreign Counterparts
OIA supports the SEC’s prominent role in international
bodies of securities regulators such as IOSCO and the
Financial Stability Board (FSB). Through these entities,
the SEC addresses international regulatory issues by
developing international guidance, recommendations and
standards, and assessing the implementation of foreign
financial market reforms and their ramifications for U.S.
investors. The SEC is involved in multiple IOSCO policy
committees, working groups and task forces, and influences
IOSCO’s contributions to the FSB. For example, the SEC
is working with IOSCO to develop a toolbox of approaches
for regulating market conduct.
OIA will also continue to work with the Office of the Chief
Accountant in managing the SEC’s representation in the
International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation
Monitoring Board, as well as monitoring the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board’s inspection of registered foreign
audit firms.

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

In FY 2017, OIA anticipates that the pace of regulatory action
in other jurisdictions will increase, particularly in the European
Union. OIA will inform and advise the Commission and
staff about these developments with the goal of promoting
opportunities for converged approaches to high quality
regulatory standards.

demand for international cooperation. Moreover, the demand
for supervisory MOUs with foreign regulators will grow as
regulators look to share information and exchange views
in cross-border supervisory matters.

OIA also coordinates and participates in bilateral dialogues
with foreign counterparts on securities markets issues. OIA
also participates in dialogues led by the Treasury Department,
including the U.S.-EU Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue,
NAFTA Financial Services Committee, U.S.-EU Financial
Services Committee, US-China Strategic and Economic
Dialogue, and U.S.-India Financial Regulatory Dialogue.

OIA provides technical assistance to foreign securities
regulators through a number of activities, such as conducting
the annual Institute for International Enforcement and the
International Institute for Market Development; holding
training programs for foreign regulatory and law enforcement
counterparts; providing assessments or “peer reviews” of
other entity’s regulatory oversight regimes; and handling
special projects including foreign visits to the SEC and
arranging for foreign authorities to accompany SEC staff
on examinations.

Supervisory Cooperation
The OIA supervisory cooperation group focuses on four
areas: (1) assisting other SEC divisions and offices in the
supervision of cross-border regulated entities by facilitating
cooperation with foreign counterparts, including conducting
on-site examinations abroad and addressing cross-border
registration issues; (2) responding to requests from foreign
counterparts in supervisory matters; (3) developing and
implementing supervisory memorandum of understandings
(MOUs) aimed at facilitating cooperation in the oversight of
cross-border regulated entities; and (4) providing subject
matter expertise on multilateral projects involving supervisory
cooperation issues.
Supervisory cooperation activities are expected to increase
in the future as the Offices of Compliance Inspections and
Examinations (OCIE) and Credit Ratings (OCR) continue to
expand their examination programs, generating additional

Technical Assistance

FY 2017 Request
OIA is requesting one new position for the international
enforcement cooperation and assistance section, to enable
the enforcement cooperation team to more effectively
respond to Division of Enforcement and foreign requests for
assistance in the area of investigation and litigation support.
OIA is also seeking a new position in the regulatory policy
area, due to the increasing number of projects undertaken
by the international organizations in which the Commission
participates, a heightened level of bilateral engagement
with foreign authorities, and an increased intensity of
multilateral assessment processes which will begin as
more international standards are developed by standardsetting bodies.

The Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) supports the
mission of the SEC by conducting administrative hearings
and issuing initial decisions from Commission Orders
Instituting Proceedings.
Administrative Law Judges serve as independent
adjudicators. Under the Administrative Procedure Act and
the Commission’s Rules of Practice, administrative law
judges conduct public hearings at locations throughout
the United States in a manner similar to non-jury trials
in the Federal district courts. Among other actions, they
issue subpoenas, hold prehearing conferences, and rule
on motions and the admissibility of evidence.

FY 2017 Request
In FY 2017, OALJ anticipates the Commission will institute
and order public hearings in 230 proceedings, although the
exact number and specific nature of these cases is unknown.
This estimate reflects the increasingly heavy and complex
caseload the Office has experienced in recent years. OALJ
requests one attorney to help in addressing this caseload.

The Office of the Investor Advocate (OIAD) is required by
Section 915 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and was
established during FY 2014. The Office is responsible for,
among other things, identifying areas in which investors
would benefit from changes to Federal laws, SEC regulations,
or the rules of self-regulatory organizations (SROs), and for
providing assistance to investors in resolving significant
problems they may have with the SEC or SROs.

Activities must summarize the most serious problems
encountered by investors during the reporting period,
identify any Commission or SRO action that was taken to
address those problems, and recommend, as appropriate,
any administrative and legislative actions to resolve problems
encountered by investors.

Investor Advocacy: Consistent with the requirements of
Section 915 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office is responsible
for identifying problems that investors have with financial
service providers and investment products; analyzing the
potential impact on investors of proposed regulations and
rules; identifying areas in which investors would benefit from
changes in SEC regulations or SRO rules; and proposing
changes in regulations, legislation, or administration
of programs that may mitigate problems identified. The
additional position requested in FY 2016 will provide counsel
to the Investor Advocate on matters arising out of the Division
of Corporation Finance.

Ombudsman: The Investor Advocate is required by Section
919D of the Dodd-Frank Act to appoint an Ombudsman
who will act as a liaison between the SEC and any retail
investor in resolving problems that retail investors may have
with the SEC or SROs. The Ombudsman must also review
policies and procedures and make recommendations to
encourage the investing public and other interested persons
to submit questions to the Investor Advocate regarding
compliance with the securities law. The Ombudsman
is also required to establish safeguards to maintain the
confidentiality of communications between these persons
and the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman must evaluate
the effectiveness of this program and submit semiannual
reports to the Investor Advocate for inclusion in the reports
to Congress.

Reports to Congress: The Office is responsible for submitting
two reports to Congress per year. A Report on Objectives
is due not later than June 30 of each year, and its purpose
is to set forth the objectives of the Investor Advocate for
the following fiscal year. A Report on Activities is due no
later than December 31 of each year, and it describes the
activities of the Investor Advocate during the immediately
preceding fiscal year. Among other things, the Report on

Investor Advisory Committee: The Investor Advocate serves
as a member of the Investor Advisory Committee, which is
authorized by Section 911 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as codified
under Section 39 of the Exchange Act. This committee
advises and consults with the SEC on regulatory priorities
and protection of investors. The Office of the Investor
Advocate provides support and assistance to this advisory
committee to assist it with fulfilling its statutory mission.

The Office of Credit Ratings (“OCR” or the “Office”) is
charged with administering Commission rules with respect
to the practices of nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations (NRSROs). These rules are aimed towards
promoting accuracy in credit ratings issued by NRSROs,
ensuring that credit ratings are not unduly influenced
by conflicts of interest, and helping to ensure that firms
provide greater disclosure to investors. In support of this
mission, OCR conducts policy oversight of NRSROs and
conducts examinations.
OCR is responsible for presenting recommendations to
the Commission on policy and rulemaking with respect to
NRSROs, consulting with other SEC divisions and offices
as appropriate. OCR also works to: (1) implement rules
pertaining to NRSROs; (2) develop recommendations on
requests for Commission exemptive relief from the rules;
(3) prepare responses to requests for staff “no-action” relief
from the rules; and (4) formulate staff guidance and other
interpretive positions.
Examination of NRSROs for compliance with the Federal
securities laws and Commission rules accounts for the
majority of OCR’s workload. The Dodd-Frank Act requires
that OCR conduct an examination of each NRSRO at least
annually, in eight review areas prescribed by the Act.
OCR also conducts special targeted examinations based
on particular issues and to follow-up on tips, complaints,
and NRSRO self-reported incidents. OCR employs
a risk-based approach to exam planning, identifying
different risks for different NRSROs so that resources are

prioritized and appropriately focused on areas of higher
risk. The examinations of the larger or more complex
NRSROs are staffed with a quantitative analyst to provide
analytical support directly alongside the examination
teams. The Office also participates in discussions with
international regulators of the globally-active credit rating
agencies to determine potential areas of focus for domestic
NRSRO examinations.
OCR’s annual examinations in FY 2016 will include a
comprehensive review of NRSROs’ compliance with the
comprehensive new rules and rule amendments. OCR
expects that the FY 2017 examinations will include a
significant amount of testing and follow-up to ensure that the
NRSROs are complying with the new rules. OCR will further
review registrants’ technological initiatives, cybersecurity
governance, and risk assessment processes relating to
access rights, data loss prevention, vendor management,
training, and incident response. In addition, OCR will further
evaluate credit models quantitatively and qualitatively and
will initiate specialized examinations to conduct sweeps and
targeted examinations as appropriate.
When necessary, OCR’s examinations will result in a referral
to the Division of Enforcement. Since June 2012 when OCR
was formed, there have been three settled enforcement
matters against NRSROs.
Separate from the examination function, the NRSRO
monitoring and constituent monitoring functions within OCR
are responsible for gathering, analyzing, and assessing data
and identifying trends across the industry. This information

  95

PAGE

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

may be useful for examination scoping, determining and
communicating best practices for NRSROs, and guiding
the direction for future policy activities or rulemakings
related to NRSROs. As part of the monitoring activities,
OCR meets with NRSRO boards of directors (including
a separate discussion with the independent directors) to
engage them in broader policy discussions. OCR also holds
meetings with investors, issuers, arrangers, industry trade
groups and other market participants.
The OCR monitoring function is also responsible for:
•	 reviewing applications for registration as an NRSRO
and applications to register for an additional asset class
or classes, and then developing recommendations for
the Commission;
•	 reviewing the annual and periodic updates submitted
by existing registrants on Form NRSRO;

•	 reviewing the NRSRO Employment Transition Reports
for former employees of NRSROs; and
•	 receiving tips from NRSROs that are reported pursuant
to Section 15E(u) of the Securities Exchange Act.

FY 2017 Request
For FY 2017, the SEC is requesting two additional Securities
Compliance Examiners positions for OCR. These new
positions will establish a dedicated team to focus on
specialized, targeted examination work and to be responsive
to market events that require immediate attention. OCR’s risk
assessments identify different risks for different NRSROs,
and many of the identified issues require follow-up through
targeted examination work on an expedited basis. This
specialized examination team will bolster OCR’s examination
function and allow OCR’s other examiners to focus on the
statutorily-mandated, annual examinations of each NRSRO.

The Office of Municipal Securities (OMS) was created in
FY 2012 as an independent office that reports directly
to the SEC Chair, as required by Sec. 979 of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(Dodd-Frank Act). OMS is responsible for overseeing the
$3.7 trillion municipal securities market and administering the
Commission’s rules pertaining to municipal securities brokers
and dealers, municipal advisors, investors in municipal
securities, and municipal issuers. OMS also coordinates
with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)
on rulemaking and enforcement actions.
OMS coordinates the SEC’s municipal securities
activities, administers SEC rules relating to the municipal
securities market, oversees MSRB rulemaking, informs
the Commission on current market issues, advises the
Commission on policy matters relating to the municipal
securities market, and provides technical assistance in the
development and implementation of major SEC initiatives
in the municipal securities market. OMS assists other SEC
offices and divisions, including the Office of Compliance
Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) and the Division of
Enforcement (ENF), on a wide array of municipal securities
matters. OMS monitors current developments and emerging
risks in the municipal securities market and communicates
its observations and conclusions to other SEC offices
and divisions and other regulators for possible regulatory
responses. OMS’s workload is anticipated to grow due to
the expanding responsibilities of OMS and the offices OMS
directly supports, such as OCIE and ENF.

OMS has significant responsibilities derived from the
implementation of Sec. 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which
amended the Exchange Act to require the registration of
municipal advisors with the SEC and provided for their
regulation by the MSRB. OMS continues to implement
the final rules adopted in FY 2013 for municipal advisor
registration by monitoring and improving the SEC’s
registration system for municipal advisors, participating
in the review of municipal advisor registrations, reviewing
and processing MSRB rule filings related to municipal
advisor regulation, advising OCIE regarding inspections
and examinations of municipal advisors, coordinating with
the MSRB and FINRA to assure fair and uniform application
of new rules applicable to municipal advisors, and providing
interpretive guidance to those market participants who may
be required to register as municipal advisors.
In addition, OMS acts as the Commission’s liaison to the
MSRB, FINRA, the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) Office
of Tax-Exempt Bonds, and a variety of investor and industry
groups and regulators on municipal securities issues.
OMS interacts closely with the MSRB and is responsible
for reviewing and processing all MSRB rule filings. OMS
communicates with the MSRB Chairman, Board and staff
concerning MSRB activities, market developments, and
potential improvements of MSRB systems that either collect
information for regulators or provide information to the public.
OMS will continue to lead semiannual meetings with the
MSRB and FINRA regarding the municipal securities market,
as required by the Dodd-Frank Act; meet with MSRB and

  97

•

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

FINRA staff regularly; meet with IRS staff pursuant to the
SEC’s memorandum of understanding with the IRS; and
coordinate with other regulators as needed. OMS also
will continue to work closely with the municipal securities
industry to educate state and local governmental officials
and conduit borrowers about the Commission’s rules and
to foster a thorough understanding of the Commission’s
policies among all market participants.

FY 2017 Request
OMS is requesting one new attorney position to support
the office’s responsibilities mandated by Sec. 979 of the
Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, the additional staff position will
support OMS’s considerable responsibilities to implement
the new regulatory regime for municipal advisors as
described above.

Office of Public Affairs
The Office of Public Affairs (OPA), under the direction of the
Chair, is responsible for coordinating the SEC’s external and
internal communications with the media, the public, and SEC
staff. OPA distributes news and information that informs
the public and staff about the agency’s efforts to protect
investors; promote fair, efficient and orderly markets; and
facilitate capital formation.
OPA manages development of and creates written and
graphic content for all of the agency’s digital platforms,
including SEC.gov – which received more than 6.3 billion page
views in FY 2015. In FY 2016 OPA will continue to expand
our digital efforts to meet increasing demand. Significant
undertakings will include the launch of a new internal
communications platform, a new EDGAR search interface,
and a new, mobile-friendly public website for researching
investment professionals. The Office will also continue to
respond to media inquiries, write and edit news releases
and other materials, and facilitate media interactions with

agency officials to promote understanding of the agency’s
work in an increasingly dynamic marketplace.

FY 2017 Request
In FY 2017, OPA will work to continue to provide effective,
transparent and timely communication with investors,
market participants and other stakeholders. Especially as
Americans are increasingly using mobile devices to access
news, information, and services, the Office intends to place
a continuing high priority on leveraging the Internet and other
digital communication platforms and tools to communicate
the SEC’s achievements and priorities. Leveraging technology
will also help increase staff efficiency, productivity, and
effectiveness by facilitating the access, sharing, and analysis
of information. Accordingly, OPA requests one additional
position in FY 2017 to help provide strategic direction to our
digital communication efforts, including continuous evaluation
of our performance in a hyper-changing digital landscape
to maximize our opportunities while minimizing duplication
or redundancy.

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

Office of the Secretary
The Office of the Secretary (OS) reviews all documents
issued by the Commission, schedules and coordinates
Commission meetings, prepares and maintains records
of Commission actions, and advises the Commission and
staff about practice and procedure. OS directly supports the
Commission staff, maintains the SEC’s website and Intranet,
and receives and tracks filings in administrative proceedings.
OS is comprised of two branches:
(1)	 Legal and Operations: This branch handles all of the
processes by which the Commission considers
matters under its purview. Legal and Operations
staff review all SEC documents submitted to and
approved by the Commission and ensure their
appropriate online and/or print publication. The
branch receives and tracks documents filed in
administrative proceedings, requests for confidential
treatment, and comment letters on rule proposals,
and monitors compliance with the Government in the
Sunshine Act. In addition, members of this Branch
provide advice to the Commission and the staff on
questions of practice and procedure.
(2)	 Web Operations: This Branch manages the public
website’s design and information architecture;
publishes the content to the public website; processes
all comment letters submitted by the public to the
agency; serves as “webmaster” in communicating
with the public about SEC.gov; and develops,
implements, and manages tools, such as RSS feeds,
to improve the dissemination of information on SEC.
gov. The staff of the Branch of Web Operations works
with the Office of Public Affairs to manage the Web
content management system and to improve the user
experience on the agency’s website.

  102

PAGE

In FY 2016, OS expects to implement the first phase
of a system to allow the intake of electronic filings from
parties to administrative proceedings, to serve parties with
Commission and ALJ orders, and to internally distribute
filings electronically. The system, when fully complete,
will provide a searchable public docket. Also in FY 2016,
OS expects to release an initial update modernizing
the internal system that manages information about
Commission meetings, tracks Commission votes on action
memoranda, monitors and processes seriatims, and tracks
advice memoranda. In FY 2017, after implementation
of these new systems, OS expects to consolidate and
replace several antiquated internal systems, including
the replacement of the current legacy administrative
proceedings tracking system.
OS has consistently increased workload due to work
produced by other offices and divisions. For example, in
FY 2015, the Legal and Operations Branch experienced an
11 percent increase in releases processed and a 45 percent
increase in administrative proceeding documents processed
over FY 2014. Similarly, in FY 2015, the Web Operations
Branch published approximately seven percent more
documents to the public website than in the previous
fiscal year. Furthermore, the agency’s rulemaking agenda
and enhanced enforcement program will have a significant
impact on OS in FY 2016 and FY 2017, as all enforcement
actions, examination reports, and rulemakings flow
through OS.

FY 2017 Request
OS requests one additional position in FY 2017 to meet the
additional workload placed on OS from the increased activities
of other divisions and offices in both FY 2016 and FY 2017.
This additional staff member will be necessary to process the
releases, notices, orders and other documents produced.

The Office of the Chief Operating Officer (OCOO) develops,
coordinates and provides strategic leadership and
operational oversight of the SEC’s core mission support
activities and compliance with the GPRA Modernization Act
of 2010 and other requirements imposed by Congress and
the Executive Branch.
In FY 2015, the Office of the Chief Operating Officer (OCOO),
and the offices that comprise it, embraced a new vision:
To be an exemplary service and support organization with a
proven reputation as a valued partner that enables the SEC
to perform its critical work on behalf of investors.
The vision is supported by four “pillars,” or guideposts
marking the route to becoming an exemplary service and
support organization:
•	 Create an Energizing Work Environment
•	 Increase Public Trust Through the Highest Standards
of Integrity and Accountability

  104

PAGE

•	 Deliver Extraordinary Solutions and Services for our
Customers
•	 Be Excellent in All We Do.
Accordingly, the OCOO’s mission is accomplished by the
coordinated activities of its six mission support offices:
•	 Office of Financial Management (OFM): Responsible for
directing the SEC’s financial management, formulation
and execution of its budget, monitoring resource
utilization, developing and maintaining financial systems,
and managing financial statements and reporting.
•	 The Office of Information Technology (OIT): Responsible
for developing and executing the agency’s enterprise
IT strategy and programs, including application
development, infrastructure operations and engineering,
user support, program management, capital planning,
information security, and enterprise architecture.

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

•	 The Office of Human Resources (OHR): Responsible
for the SEC’s strategic management of its human
capital, including the capacity to recruit, train, develop,
reward and retain a talented, multifaceted workforce.
OHR collaborates closely with the National Treasury
Employees Union on labor relations issues.
•	 The Office of Acquisitions (OA): Responsible for executing
and overseeing the SEC’s acquisition strategy, including
contract administration and management, compliance
with procurement policies, and acquisition workforce
certification, training and support.
•	 The Office of Support Operations (OSO): Responsible for
managing the agency’s Freedom of Information and
Privacy Act (FOIA) requests and official records. OSO
also conducts activities that support the physical safety
and security of the SEC’s Federal and contractor staff,
and strategic management of the agency’s facilities,
space, office supplies, transportation, mail distribution
and in-house print operations and publications.
•	 The Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI): Responsible
for providing specific senior level focus on identified
functions and programs requiring modernization or
transformation and which have strategic value to the
carrying out of the SEC’s mission. OSI is also responsible
for the governance, oversight and management of
the ongoing investments in information sources, both
physical and electronic, as well as data used by the
agency in support of its analytics.
Additionally, the OCOO has a small, core staff that performs
specialized activities and functions to further enable the six
mission support offices to successfully carry out the SEC’s
mission.
In FY 2017, OCOO remains on track to meet the following
strategic objectives defined in the SEC’s Strategic Plan:
•	 Promote a results oriented work environment that
attracts, engages, and retains a technically proficient
and diverse workforce, including leaders who provide
motivation and strategic direction.
•	 Encourage a collaborative environment across divisions
and offices and leverages technology and data to fulfill
its mission more effectively and efficiently.

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

•	 Maximize the use of agency resources by continually
improving agency operations and bolstering internal
controls.
In order to accomplish its mission, the OCOO is focused on
delivering direct and robust support in five specific areas:
•	 Operational risk and internal control: OCOO will continue
to improve the management of operational risk by
applying a rigorous and consistent process for all
divisions and offices to identify, assess, manage and
report operational risks and institute effective internal
controls. The OCOO will continue to support all divisions
and offices through direct technical assistance as well
as oversee business process re-engineering initiatives
throughout the agency.
•	 Audit Coordination and Follow-up: OCOO will continue to
manage communications between the SEC and audit
organizations and support the timely completion of
corrective action on audit recommendations.
•	 Internal communications: OCOO will continue to lead
internal communication efforts that promote high rates
of employee awareness and participation in agencywide initiatives and programs.
•	 Small Office Managing Executive support: OCOO will
continue to support small offices throughout the
Agency by providing administrative and management
support, enabling those offices to focus on their
specific missions.
•	 Project and program management: OCOO will continue
to enhance project management standards and
best practices throughout the agency by providing
leadership, tools, and guidance to project managers.

FY 2017 Request
In FY 2017, OCOO will need to maintain the same staffing
levels in four of the five focus areas articulated above and will
seek to increase the Small Office Managing Executive support
area by one position. This additional position will support
the increase from five to six offices benefiting from Small
Office Managing Executive Support and will also support
a number of planned Small Office technology initiatives.

The Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI) was formalized within the Office of the Chief Operating Officer in FY 2016, therefore lowering OCOO’s FTE between FY 2015
and FY 2016.

Office of Financial Management
The Office of Financial Management (OFM) is responsible
for the SEC’s financial and budgetary operations. OFM
maintains the agency’s financial systems and prepares
financial statements and reports; manages the formulation
and execution of the SEC’s annual Budget; coordinates the
agency’s performance and cost reporting; and oversees
internal controls over financial reporting.
In FY 2015, OFM reevaluated its business processes and
bolstered controls related to the timely recording of court
judgments impacting the financial statements. OFM is also in
the early stages of implementing a disgorgement and penalty
sub-ledger system which will allow for significantly more
automation and reporting in the area of disgorgement and
penalties. SEC also participated in the Federal governmentwide deployment of a new travel system.

  106

PAGE

FY 2015
Actual

During FY 2016 and FY 2017, OFM will concentrate on
further improving other systems that support the SEC’s
financial processes and controls. OFM will continue efforts
to modernize the systems supporting filing fees and property
and equipment. In addition, OFM will work to replace
the system supporting the SEC’s budget execution and
formulation functions. Finally, the SEC is in the early stages
of building a financial data mart, which when completed will
integrate data from various systems for more comprehensive
financial and management reporting.

FY 2017 Request
OFM expects to complete the build-out of the Internal
Controls Branch in FY 2017 and has therefore requested
one additional position. Management’s self-assessment of
internal controls was previously a fully outsourced function.
Given the emphasis on management self-assessing its own
controls, OFM has been gradually transitioning to an in-house
assessment function, and this additional staff member will
allow the Office to finish that transition.

Office of Information Technology
Information Technology (IT) plays a critical role in the mission
of the SEC and its ability to share information and data both
internally and externally. The increasing size and complexity
of U.S. markets require that the SEC continue leveraging
technology to streamline operations and increase the
effectiveness of the agency’s programs, building on the
progress made over the past several years in modernizing
technology systems. In FY 2017, the Office of Information
Technology (OIT) will continue its leadership role in the
SEC’s application development, infrastructure operations
and engineering, user support, IT program management,
capital planning, security, and enterprise architecture.
OIT leads the agency’s efforts to develop systems that will
allow a wide variety of data and other information from a
variety of sources, including corporate disclosures, equity
exchange feeds, investigations and examinations, tips,
complaints, and referrals, and commercial vendors, to be
gathered, shared, analyzed, and joined with other information
about the same entity or individual. Data management and
analysis is critical in identifying and assessing potential risk

to investors and the U.S. financial markets. The continued
growth in the size and technological complexity of the U.S.
markets requires that the SEC leverage technology to facilitate
its critically important quantitative and data analytic efforts.
Information technology is an increasingly vital function to the
SEC in modernizing filing practices, disseminating the vast
quantity of regulatory filings, managing the large number
of internal business processes and work products, and
protecting the Commission’s information assets. Since
FY 2013, online searches for Electronic Data Gathering
Analysis Retrieval (EDGAR) filings have more than tripled from
3 million to 9.4 million at the end of FY 2015. OIT requires
additional resources to keep pace with the increasing
demand and to better execute technology initiatives in
support of the SEC mission.
In FY 2017, OIT will pursue IT investments that focus on
improving the agency’s ability to analyze data to uncover
potential violations of the securities laws; improving
agency business processes, including in Enforcement and
Examinations; improving the usability of agency information
for the public; and further strengthening our information

security program to counter advanced persistent threats
and enhance monitoring of SEC systems. Specific projects
include efforts to:
•	 Enhance data analytics and reporting – to provide a
Web-based solution that will enable SEC registrant
disclosures to be analyzed much more quickly and
comprehensively;
•	 Improve the eXtensible Business Reporting Language
(XBRL) Distribution System for EDGAR users, to help
facilitate the submission and use of this key data;
•	 Enhance the SEC’s quantitative research infrastructure
by offering a scalable, multi-tier solution to identify and
analyze key risks in the securities markets;
•	 Address new reporting requirements included in
Commission-approved rulemaking;
•	 Bolster the document management system by adding
an automated records management system to facilitate
compliance with Federal records management statutes;
•	 Leverage the data produced by business intelligence
tools that enhance the agency’s ability to track key
performance indicators;
•	 Implement enhanced data analytical systems for
investment adviser data;
•	 Strengthen cybersecurity and continuous monitoring;
and
•	 Continue the agency’s focus on cloud technology

Reserve Fund
In FY 2017, the SEC intends to continue using its Reserve
Fund to fund large, multi-year, mission-critical technology
projects. The SEC plans to use the Fund for the following
programs:
•	 Data Analytics;
•	 EDGAR Enhancements;
•	 EDGAR Redesign;
•	 Enforcement, Litigation, and E-Discovery;
•	 Examination Management;
•	 SEC.gov modernization;

  108

PAGE

•	 TCR enhancements; and
•	 Business process improvements.
These key priorities will enhance the SEC’s ability to improve
service to registrants and the public, integrate and analyze
large amounts of data, and improve SEC business and
operational processes.
The multi-year effort of overhauling EDGAR will create a
new, modernized system that will, among other things,
meet requirements for real-time system updates, reduce
filer burden by providing simplified search and filing options
based on filer experience (i.e., professional or novice),
improve data capture by moving to structured formats for
various SEC forms that will reduce the burden of producing
and consuming the data, and limit the long-term costs of
operating and maintaining the system.
In FY 2017, OIT will help the Division of Enforcement develop
systems supporting its efforts in early detection of violations
of securities laws, investigations, and litigation. Investments
planned for FY 2017 for the Enforcement program include:
•	 expanding an enterprise document management
system for users in Enforcement and throughout the
agency, and possible integration with other legacy
systems;
•	 enhancing a large file transfer capability to permit the
electronic transmittal of data directly from entities to
replace the current mode of submitting data devices;
•	 modernizing the current tools used to collect Blue
Sheets trade data from market participants;
•	 expanding the Division of Enforcement’s e-discovery
approach, to include an early assessment of documents
and the consolidation of e-discovery into a single
solution; and
•	 expanding the enterprise data analytics platform to
better detect large scale trading abuse.
For FY 2017, OIT will assist the Office of Compliance
Inspections and Examinations in the modernization of its
primary business systems, such as enhancing the examination
management platform, implementing advanced analytics tools
and operations such as the High-Frequency Analytics Lab
(HAL), supporting the Technology Controls Program’s (TCP)
testing center and registrant auditing system, and deploying

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

a Registrant Tracking Solution. These tools will provide OCIE
staff with a greater ability to detect trends and emerging fraud
risks, with the goal of enabling the SEC to allocate and direct
examination resources more effectively.
FY 2017 funding will also support enhancements to the
system that manages Tips, Complaints and Referrals
(TCRs), aimed towards providing a more capable and userfriendly system with increased flexibility, configurability, and
adaptability. The enhancements will provide flexible and
comprehensive intake, triage, resolution tracking, searching,
and reporting functionalities with full auditing capabilities.
OIT will build on the enterprise-wide platform to rapidly
automate business process workflows to streamline
communication, reinforce accountability, and adapt to
changing business needs and legislative requirements while
minimizing costs due to manual errors and inefficiency.

FY 2017 Request

Office of Human Resources
The Office of Human Resources (OHR) provides operational
and consulting services in the areas of recruitment, staffing,
organizational development, leadership and employee
development, compensation and benefits administration,
position management and classification, workforce planning,
and labor relations.
In FY 2015, OHR achieved significant success in meeting
goals established in its recruitment and hiring action
plan. OHR implemented a series of enhancements that
streamlined the hiring process and significantly reduced
the hiring timeline and increased the Office’s marketing and
outreach activities via social media outlets.
Also in FY 2015, OHR automated previously laborintensive, manual processes to improve efficiencies for
multiple OHR programs. In addition to the deployment of
these automation tools, OHR also developed and began
deployment of a comprehensive, single-source repository
for all personnel data. OHR will continue to develop and
implement organizational changes to reengineer, streamline,
and automate its internal processes.
To further enhance the SEC’s recruitment goals, the OHR
will finalize the SEC Workforce Plan in FY 2016. The
Workforce Plan will enhance the SEC’s ability to maximize
current use of talent by identifying, reducing and eliminating
competency gaps or deficiencies to ensure the agency has
the right talent in the right place at the right time. Also, the
OHR staff will continue to conduct human capital reviews
with the SEC divisions and offices. These reviews provide
an overview of the status of various aspects of human
capital activities, including long and short-term trends; use
of various OHR programs and services; and areas where
organizations may want or need additional assistance from
OHR. Additionally, OHR will continue to implement agencywide action plans for improving employee engagement
and satisfaction as measured by the Federal Employee
Viewpoint Survey (EVS).

SEC University (SECU) continued to build upon its suite of
e-learning, training, and educational resources covering
securities market structure and trading issues, legal and
accounting skills, investor protection, regulatory oversight,
management strategies, and other areas needed for
effective operations.

FY 2017 Request
To ensure fulfillment of strategic objectives, OHR is requesting
an increase of 11 positions in FY 2017. The eleven positions
will support the recruitment, development and retention of a
competent, high-performing and diversified SEC workforce in
the following areas: (2) recruitment and staffing, (2) benefits
administration, (2) leadership and professional development,
(2) organizational development, (2) labor relations and
performance management and (1) payroll and business
program management.
The recruitment and staffing positions will support the SEC
hiring process in attracting highly-talented and technically
proficient workforce as the agency continues to grow in
size. The SEC provides a cadre of benefits programs to
enhance the workforce and increase retention, the benefits
positions will perform duties related to the administration,
management, and oversight of various benefit programs.
The positions in organizational development and leadership
development will continue to support the agency in developing
a dynamic and innovative workforce and promoting leadership
and knowledge management. The focus in these areas
will concentrate on current and future employee skill and
competency needs to ensure the agency has access to the
knowledge and skills necessary to respond to market changes
and agency requirements.
The labor relations and performance management positions
will assist with managing union employee matters and the
implementation of an agency-wide performance management
system. The payroll and business program management
position will provide support to the payroll program including
time and attendance along with performing duties related
to managing the business operations of OHR.

Office of Acquisitions
The Office of Acquisitions (OA) is responsible for procuring
all goods and services, except real property and employee
training, for the SEC. OA provides oversight of the Government
Purchase Card program and certification programs for
Contracting Officer’s Representatives and Program Managers.
OA is responsible for maintaining the on-site contractors’
database, closing out contracts, and the implementation and
enforcement of specific Congressional legislation, Executive
mandates, and other directives relating to procurement.
OA reports detailed information on expenditures and assures
contract-related data is properly reported to Federal systems
and SEC financial systems. OA tracks and reports a broad
range of information, in addition to financial data, required by
the SEC for its financial reporting. Examples include the Buy
American Act information; awards by Congressional District,
state, vendor, business type, and competition information;
and small business and other data necessary to ensure
transparency and accountability with respect to numerous
Federal programs.
In FY 2016, OA plans to further strengthen internal controls
over the contractual aspects of financial reporting by implementing an Electronic Contract File Project which, when fully

implemented, will result in greater ability to analyze contract
information, facilitate telework, and reduce space footprint for
paper files. The project will improve operations by enabling
simultaneous access to documents by multiple users, reduce
paper usage, improve records management efficiency and
ensure all pertinent records are included in the official contract
file. OA’s SharePoint site is also undergoing a redesign to
improve usability. In FY 2017, OA plans on continuing the
Contracting Officers’ Representative (COR) Improvement
Initiative which is to create a more comprehensive COR
Program that will provide efficient and functional control,
transparency, and management of the COR program across
the SEC. OA also will continue to enhance training and monitoring for the Program/Project Management programs.
OA’s workload continues to increase as the Office expands
its contract administration functions and as the volume and
complexity of contract awards increases. In FY 2017, OA
will continue to seek savings in operations by:
•	 reducing the proportion of cost reimbursement, time
and materials, and labor-hour contracts by converting
to firm fixed price contracts, where appropriate;
•	 improving acquisition planning for recurring contracts
to manage costs through review and adjustment of
labor categories, where appropriate;

  111

•	 seeking further discounts from GSA schedule vendors
for awards made under the Multiple Award Schedule
program;
•	 improving Strategic Sourcing through education and
planning; increasing use of Enterprise Agreements and/
or Longer Term Vehicles; and improving communication
of existing vehicles to customers;
•	 pursuing improvements in acquisition planning early
in the project life cycle;
•	 improving service contract assessments to achieve
maximum value and efficiency, as well as proper
balance between Federal and contracted positions;

OA plans to continue to improve its oversight and reporting
functions, including those related to the Acquisition
Requisition Management System (ARMS) and the Small
Business Program. OA will also continue to monitor and
track Management Assurance controls and will manage
the SEC’s Contract Review Board, which reviews large
dollar procurement actions to make sure the most
effective contracting approach is taken. Based on current
initiatives, it is likely that OA’s workload will continue to
increase, especially as we work to improve contract
administration; however, OA will continue to drive internal
operational efficiency and does not anticipate the need
for additional staff.

•	 reducing expired contract liability and returning funds
to SEC for re-allocation; and
•	 strengthening contract administration efforts such as
invoice and quality reviews.

for publishing, printing and mail operations, facilities
management, and construction and leasing services.
In FY 2017, OBO will continue overseeing all activities
required at each SEC location to provide agreed-upon tenant
improvements. OBO will continue ensuring that costs and
schedules are on target and buildings provide functional,
usable space which meets applicable building codes and
agency functional requirements.
Since 2011, the President has made it a priority for Federal
tenants to optimize their real estate assets. Consistent with
this objective, OBO will continue working with the General
Services Administration in devising new approaches to
increase space utilization across the SEC’s real property
portfolio.

FY 2017 Request
OSO is requesting three new positions in FY 2017. The
first position will support the Physical Security Operations
Branch to ensure the safety and security of SEC personnel
and assets at the eleven Regional Offices, two data centers,
and SEC Headquarters Office. Specifically, this position
will be responsible for continuing the risk assessment and
management program, remediating identified vulnerabilities,
and enhancing regional office security systems.
OSO requests a second staff member for the Personnel
Security Operations Branch (PERSEC) to assist with
processing and adjudicating background investigations for
SEC staff and supporting compliance with new requirements
from the Office of Personnel Management and Office of the
Director of National Intelligence. Finally, OSO requests an
additional Security Specialist to help the SEC meet relevant
continuity requirements.

The Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) is
responsible for all matters related to diversity in management,
employment and business activities at the SEC as required
by Section 342 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The responsibilities of
the Office include developing standards for equal employment
opportunity and the diversity of SEC’s workforce (including
senior management), facilitating increased participation of
minority-owned and women-owned businesses in SEC’s
programs and contracts, and assessing the diversity policies
and practices of entities regulated by the SEC.
Diversity in SEC’s Workforce: Workforce diversity and inclusion
continue to be an integral part of OMWI’s operations.
Developing and implementing strategies to ensure that the
SEC attracts a diverse, qualified talent pool at all levels of the
organization, including the senior level, will be a priority. A key
component of OMWI’s outreach and recruitment strategy
will be to engage SEC staff, including the SEC Employee
Resource Groups, Diversity Councils (one in headquarters
and four in regional offices), managers and supervisors and
regional offices.
In FY 2017, OMWI will explore strategies to address any
residual triggers and barriers to equal employment opportunity
that exist in the SEC’s workforce. To enhance multicultural
competencies over time, training also will be a key component
of OMWI’s diversity and inclusion strategy. OMWI will administer both instructor-led and on-line diversity and inclusion
workshops to train our workforce on emerging issues relating
to diversity. Finally, OMWI will continue to expand its partnerships and alliances, sponsorships, recruitments efforts, and
outreach consistent with the requirements of Section 342.

Diversity of SEC’s Contracting and Business Activities: In FY 2017,
OMWI will continue to promote the fair inclusion of minorityowned and women-owned businesses in the Agency’s
business activities. Outreach, advocacy and education are
the core components of the SEC’s supplier diversity program.
OMWI will attend business opportunity events to attract
diverse suppliers, provide technical assistance to minorityowned and women-owned businesses on navigating the
SEC contracting process, and offer internal training on the
supplier diversity program to SEC staff involved in contracting
activities. Additionally, OMWI, in collaboration with the Office
of Acquisitions (OA), plans to host vendor events to promote
a wider pool of potential suppliers and to educate potential
businesses of future contract opportunities.
In FY 2015, OMWI finalized the “good faith effort” (GFE)
contract standard that requires contractors to demonstrate
the fair inclusion of minorities and women in their workforce,
as required by Section 342(c)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
By FY 2017, OMWI will have formalized the policies and
procedures for monitoring contractor compliance with the
GFE contract requirement, and will be conducting reviews
to evaluate the fair inclusion of women and minorities within
the workforce of existing contractors (and, as applicable,
of subcontractors).
Diversity Policies and Practices of SEC Regulated Entities: In
FY 2015, the SEC, along with the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
National Credit Union Administration, and the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau (the Agencies) issued an

  117

PAGE

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

•

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

interagency policy statement establishing joint standards for
assessing the diversity policies and practices of the entities
they regulate (Joint Standards).
The Joint Standards provide a framework for regulated
entities to create and strengthen their diversity policies and
practices. The Joint Standards contemplate that regulated
entities will conduct voluntary self-assessments of their
diversity policies and practices at least annually, and submit
information pertaining to their diversity assessments to their
primary federal financial regulator.
In FY 2017, OMWI expects to continue: (1) developing a selfassessment tool for the SEC’s regulated entities that could
be used as an instrument for providing information pertaining
to diversity assessments to OMWI; (2) meeting with industry
trade organizations and advocacy organizations to solicit
their views on the form and content of a self-assessment
tool and information collection instrument; (3) participating in
educational events hosted by industry trade organizations to
publicize the Joint Standards and encourage the submission
of self-assessments of diversity information to OMWI; and
(4) monitoring progress and trends in the financial services
industry regarding diversity and inclusion in employment
and contracting, and identifying and highlighting successful
policies and practices.
Annual Report to Congress: OMWI is responsible for preparing an
annual report to Congress describing the Office’s activities with
respect to diversity in the Agency’s workforce and business
activities. This includes successes and challenges in operating

  118

PAGE

minority and women outreach programs, hiring qualified
minorities and women employees, and contracting with
minority-owned and women-owned businesses. The report
also includes quantitative information related to the SEC’s
contracting activities (e.g., total amounts paid to contractors
during the past year, and percentage of that amount paid
to contractors that are minority-owned or women-owned).
Because data analytics continues to be an important aspect
of the SEC’s diversity goals and objectives, OMWI developed
additional metrics that enhance the SEC’s ability to monitor
and track equal employment access, diversity and inclusion.

FY 2017 Request
Data analytics continues to be an important aspect of the
Agency’s diversity goals and objectives. In FY 2017, OMWI
requests one additional Data Analyst position, based on
a projected increase in workload as all of the mandatory
requirements of DFA Section 342 are implemented. These
include contractors’ compliance with the good faith clause
and regulated entities’ compliance with the Interagency
Policy Statement. Implementation will require OMWI to
conduct detailed analyses and reporting of data provided
by external entities. The additional position also will augment
the current data analytics that OMWI performs for all divisions
and offices by expanding OMWI’s capabilities to produce
predictive analyses that will inform strategic initiatives. Finally,
the position also will support continuous monitoring and
performance evaluation for all of the Agency’s diversity and
inclusion initiative.

The Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (OEEO)
empowers employees to perform the SEC’s mission by
fostering equality of opportunity in all aspects of employment
from hiring to separation. SEC employees come from diverse
backgrounds and, as Federal employees, are entitled to a
workplace where employment decisions are made without
regard to race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin,
disability, or genetic information. OEEO is organized in four
primary functions: Compliance, Reporting, Barrier Analysis,
and Mission Support.
The Compliance function focuses on the processing and
resolution of individual complaints of discrimination where the
alleged discrimination has already occurred, as well as the
prevention of illegal harassment. The Compliance function
also provides content for EEO-related training.
The Reporting function focuses on producing annual and
quarterly reports regarding the SEC’s equal employment
opportunity (EEO) program to internal and external
stakeholders, including Congress and the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which provides oversight
of EEO programs across the Federal government.
The Barrier Analysis function focuses on identifying
any systemic discrimination that may be occurring in
the workplace. This function analyzes quantitative and
qualitative data to determine whether a SEC policy, practice,
procedure, or condition limits employment opportunities
for members of particular demographic groups and makes
recommendations to eliminate any identified barriers. The

  120

PAGE

SEC has committed to conducting eight barrier analyses from
2015 to 2017. In support of this function as well as OEEO’s
other functions, in FY 2015 OEEO added the capability to
analyze and report on large sets of employment data, e.g.,
applicant flow data. Data analytics has increasingly become
important for OEEO to accomplish its mission.
The Mission Support function operates as the “business
office” of OEEO to ensure OEEO can complete its
mission. Mission support functions include acquisitions,
staff administration, budgeting, all internal reporting, and
program management. OEEO’s goal is to ensure that SEC
employees have a fair and equitable working environment
that will support them in their efforts to protect investors and
maintain the integrity of the securities markets.

FY 2017 Request
OEEO is requesting a new position to be filled by a data
analyst. Data analytics have become increasingly important
to OEEO in conducting barrier analyses, preparing internal
and external reports, improving operational efficiencies,
and enhancing internal controls. As discussed in OIG Audit
Report No. 528, statutory and regulatory requirements
mandate that the SEC conduct barrier analyses and
submit workforce data tables to the EEOC annually. The
new data analyst will analyze data to support the agency’s
ongoing barrier analysis program, as well as its reporting
and compliance functions.

The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent
office that conducts audits of programs and operations of
the SEC and investigations into allegations of misconduct
involving the SEC’s programs and operations. The mission of
the OIG is to detect fraud, waste, and abuse and to promote
integrity, economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the SEC’s
programs and operations. The rapid pace of significant
internal and external changes impacting the work of the SEC
drives the work of the OIG. The OIG supports the efforts
of Congress and the SEC to fulfill their responsibilities and
achieve their goals and objectives with respect to oversight
of the securities industry and investor protection.
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, the OIG will continue to focus
on improving agency programs and operations through
audits, evaluations, and reviews. The Office also will enhance
staff and agency integrity by investigating allegations of
misconduct involving the SEC’s programs and operations.
The OIG’s workload remains high and the Office expects
both its investigative and audit teams to maintain active
workloads through FY 2017.
The Dodd-Frank Act imposed significant new responsibilities
on the SEC as a whole and, as a result, on the OIG.
In particular, Section 966 of the Dodd-Frank Act required
the OIG to establish an OIG SEC Employee Suggestion
Program (ESP). Under that program, SEC employees may

  122

PAGE

submit to the OIG suggestions for improving the SEC’s work
efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity, as well as the
SEC’s use of its resources. SEC employees may also submit
through the ESP allegations of waste, abuse, misconduct,
or mismanagement within the SEC. During FY 2017, the
OIG will continue to monitor, track, and analyze information
received through the ESP, and produce the required annual
report to Congress on the ESP. In addition, the OIG will
operate a program for recognizing employees who make
suggestions, through the ESP, that result in increased work
efficiency, effectiveness, or productivity of the SEC, or reduce
waste, abuse, misconduct, or mismanagement, as provided
for by the Dodd-Frank Act.
There also has been an increase in the coordination of OIG
activities to strengthen the oversight of the Federal financial
regulatory structure. For example, the SEC Inspector General
(IG) currently serves on the Council of Inspectors General
on Financial Oversight (CIGFO), which was established by
Section 989E of the Dodd-Frank Act. The OIG’s participation
on CIGFO requires additional resources to provide effective
oversight. In particular, the OIG will be required in FY 2017
to prepare a section of CIGFO’s annual report to Congress.
That section of the report will highlight the concerns and
recommendations in the OIG’s ongoing and completed work,
focusing on issues that might apply to the broader financial

FY 2017 BUDGET REQUEST BY PROGRAM

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

sector. CIGFO may also task the SEC OIG to conduct other
audit or review activities on CIGFO’s behalf.

•	 The aggregate amount of funds requested for the
operations of the OIG.

The increase in agency staff requested in FY 2017 will
result in the need for more OIG oversight. To continue
effective oversight, the OIG will need additional personnel
to accommodate this increased workload. In FY 2017, the
OIG plans to add four positions, consisting of one Attorney,
one Auditor, one Special Agent and one Investigative Analyst/
Criminal Research Specialist.

•	 The portion of that amount requested for OIG training,
including a certification from the IG that the amount
requested satisfies all OIG training requirements for
that fiscal year.

Specifically, as the OIG grows and expands its functions, the
OIG will need to build an Office of Chief Counsel, which will
include attorneys who provide legal advice and support to all
OIG components, including the Office of Audits, the Office of
Investigations, and the Office of Management Support. It is
essential that sufficient legal staff is available to review all OIG
products for legal soundness and accuracy consistent with
the requirements of the IG Act (as amended). Also, the OIG
will add an investigative analyst or criminal research specialist
to assist the OIG’s criminal investigators in gathering data
from multiple sources to ensure investigations are thorough
and complete. The Auditor and Special Agent are requested
to accomplish the core mission of the OIG.

Regulatory Requirement
The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-409),
amended the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. app. 3).
Section 6(f)(1) of the Act requires that each IG submit a
budget estimate and request each fiscal year to the head of
the agency to which the IG reports, specifying the following:

•	 The portion of that amount necessary to support the
Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and
Efficiency (CIGIE).
As required by the Act, the SEC OIG submits the following
information for the OIG’s budget estimate and request for
FY 2017.
•	 The aggregate budget request for the operations of
the OIG is $14,700,700.
•	 The OIG budget request incorporates a sufficient
aggregate amount of funds for the operations of the
OIG. The OIG training needs have traditionally been
partially funded out of the agency’s training budget.
We estimate FY 2017 OIG specialized training costs of
$197,500. The IG certifies that the aggregate amount
of the request satisfies all training requirements for the
OIG for FY 2017 and also any assessment required
to support CIGIE.
•	 The estimated amount of the SEC OIG’s contribution
to CIGIE is 0.30 percent of the budget request, 2017
or $43,970.

Major Management Priorities, Challenges and Risks
As markets, products, and participants that the SEC
oversees and regulates increase in size and complexity,
the agency’s mandate to protect investors, maintain fair,
orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation
becomes more challenging. To maximize the use of the
SEC’s resources for the agency’s mission, the agency
continually strives to allocate its time and funds towards the
highest and best uses. As the agency turns from rule writing
to implementation and enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act
and JOBS Act, agency resources need to stretch further
to cover the statutory expansions in the SEC’s jurisdiction.
The SEC also constantly must reevaluate its operations
to identify risks and ensure the agency is operating most
efficiently to achieve agency priorities.

•	 Protecting investors by expanding our enforcement
program’s investigative capabilities and strengthening
our ability to litigate against wrongdoers;
•	 Strengthening the SEC’s economic and risk analysis
functions; and
•	 Hiring experts capable of permitting the agency to fulfill
its expanded rulemaking and oversight responsibilities.
These priorities are discussed in further detail in the Executive
Summary and in relevant chapters of this report.

Management Challenges

•	 Increasing examination coverage of investment
advisers and other key entities who deal with retail
and institutional investors;

The SEC’s FY 2015 Annual Financial Report (www.sec.gov/
about/secpar/secafr2015.pdf), Other Information Section,
provides a summary of the most serious management
and performance challenges facing the SEC as identified
by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The AFR
provides details on current actions being taken to address
these challenges.

•	 Further leveraging cutting-edge technology to permit
the SEC to better keep pace with the entities and
markets we regulate;

The following table describes how the resources requested
for FY 2017 will help address the challenges identified by
the Inspector General.

In light of these challenges, the SEC has developed its
FY 2017 budget request with five main management
priorities in mind:

Management Challenge

Inspector General
Regulatory Oversight

How the FY 2017 Budget Addresses the Challenge
The President’s Budget Request for the SEC in FY 2017 seeks additional staff to allow the SEC to
accomplish several key and pressing priorities, including bolstering examination coverage for investment
advisers and other key areas; continuing the agency’s investments in the technologies needed to keep
pace with today’s high-tech, high-speed markets; strengthening our enforcement program’s efforts to
detect, investigate, and prosecute wrongdoing; and enhancing the agency’s oversight of the rapidly
changing markets and ability to carry out its increased regulatory responsibilities.

How the FY 2017 Budget Addresses the Challenge (continued)

Information Security

In FY 2017, the SEC will continue ongoing efforts to continuously strengthen its cyber security posture
and protect information stored, processed, and transmitted by SEC information systems. In today’s threat
landscape, agencies must possess advanced protocols and capabilities to proactively defend against
sophisticated data breaches and cyber intrusions. The SEC will continue efforts to enhance its continuous
monitoring program consistent with the federal government’s Information System Continuous Monitoring
(ISCM) methodology. Continuous monitoring is a critical capability in assessing the security posture of an
environment and maintaining a situational awareness of weaknesses and vulnerabilities, thereby reducing the
risk of security incidents. The SEC plans to leverage ISCM in integrating an Ongoing Authorization approach
consistent with guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This approach will help
the SEC build upon its organization-wide risk management process and better ensure information security
risk can be managed more effectively, to include risks presented by shared services and externally-operated
systems. Additionally, the SEC plans to focus on bolstering its capability to rapidly respond to unauthorized
or anomalous user activity through enhancing its security logging and analysis mechanisms.

Acquisition Management

In FY 2017, the Office of Acquisitions (OA) will use its resources to continue the Contracting Officers’
Representative (COR) Improvement Initiative, aimed towards providing greater efficient and functional
control, transparency, and management of the COR program across the SEC. OA also will also continue to
enhance training and monitoring for the Program/Project Management programs, as a tool to ensure that
significant investments are appropriately managed and controlled.

Financial Management

The annual financial audit for FY 2015 found that the SEC had no significant issues in its internal controls over
financial reporting. However, the SEC will continue to press ahead with efforts to strengthen and automate
controls. For example, we will continue developing our monitoring program, to self-assess and proactively
address any control weaknesses that may arise. During FY 2016 and FY 2017, the Office of Financial
Management (OFM) also will concentrate on further improving systems that support the SEC’s financial
processes and controls, such as those pertaining to disgorgements and penalties, filing fees, and asset
management. Finally, OFM expects to complete the build out of the Internal Controls Branch in FY 2017.

Human Capital
Management

The SEC is committed to consistently attracting, hiring, developing, and retaining a high-performing and
diverse workforce. To further enhance the SEC’s recruitment goals, the Office of Human Resources (OHR)
plans to finalize the SEC Workforce Plan in FY 2016. In FY 2017, OHR will conduct periodic reviews to
assess whether the plan aligns with current agency workforce and succession planning efforts. Overall,
OHR’s FY 2017 allocation will further the strategic management of the SEC’s human capital by attracting and
retaining a diverse and talented workforce, administering programs to enhance employee engagement and
leadership development, implementing advanced technologies to enhance and streamline work processes,
and establishing policies and procedures to ensure compliance with Federal regulations and negotiated
agreements. Also, in FY 2017, the SEC is requesting one additional position for the Office of Minority and
Women Inclusion (OMWI) to support the continuous monitoring and performance evaluation for all of the
Agency’s diversity and inclusion initiatives, as well as one data analyst for the Office of Equal Employment
Opportunity (OEEO) to assist in conducting barrier analysis, preparing internal and external reports, improving
operational efficiencies, and enhancing internal controls.

Operational Risk Management
The SEC has further enhanced operational effectiveness via
an agency-wide Operational Risk Management program.
Risk management processes and procedures are being
institutionalized and consistently applied within all operating
units, to ensure that internal operating risks are identified,
analyzed, and managed at all levels of the organization. The
Operational Risk Management Oversight Committee (RMOC)

provides oversight of the development and implementation
of operational risk policies, frameworks, and methodologies,
and it provides leadership and monitoring of agency-wide
operational risks. In FY 2016 and FY 2017, the SEC expects
to make adjustments to its risk management practices based
on upcoming guidance from the Office of Management and
Budget, as appropriate.

OTHER INFORMATION

Cross Agency Collaboration
Working with partners across regulatory boundaries, market
segments, and national borders furthers the SEC’s ability
to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient
markets; and facilitate capital formation. The SEC values
these partnerships and understands that these collaborations
are critical for the SEC to meet its strategic goals. Examples
of these collaboration efforts are discussed below.

Strategic Goal 1
To establish an effective regulatory environment, several SEC
divisions and offices regularly collaborate with both internal
and external partners.
For example, the SEC participates in international regulatory
organizations such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and
the International Organization of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO). Through these entities, the SEC addresses
international regulatory issues by developing international
guidance, recommendations and standards, and assessing
the implementation of foreign financial market reforms and
their ramifications for U.S. investors. The SEC is involved in
multiple IOSCO policy committees, working groups and task
forces, and influences IOSCO’s contributions to the FSB.
For example, the SEC is working with IOSCO to develop
a toolbox of approaches for regulating market conduct.
These organizations also issued papers in FY 2015 related
to, among other topics, cross-border regulation, credit rating
agencies, and methodologies for determining non-bank,
non-insurance systemically relevant entities.
The SEC also participates in bilateral dialogues with foreign
counterparts on securities markets issues, including
dialogues led by the Treasury Department such as the
U.S.-EU Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue, NAFTA
Financial Services Committee, U.S.-EU Financial Services
Committee, US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue,
and U.S.-India Financial Regulatory Dialogue. In FY 2017,
the SEC anticipates that the pace of regulatory action in
other jurisdictions will increase, particularly in the European
Union, and the SEC will continue to explore opportunities for
converged approaches to high quality regulatory standards.
Moreover, the demand for supervisory MOUs with foreign
regulators will grow as regulators look to share information
and exchange views in cross-border supervisory matters.

  128

PAGE

In FY 2014, the SEC and four other regulatory agencies
adopted a common rule to implement Section 619 of the
Dodd-Frank Act, known as the “Volcker Rule.” The Division
of Trading and Markets continues to work closely with these
agencies to coordinate their implementation of the common
rules, including collaboration on responses to interpretive
questions, collection of metrics data, and examining and
supervising affected firms. This close partnership enables
the Commission to fulfill its statutory mandate to issue and
implement rules under Section 619 in coordination with
the other rulemaking agencies. Interagency coordination
also reduces the potential costs to affected firms that could
arise from diverging interpretations of the common rule.
Partners within the SEC include the Division of Investment
Management, Division of Corporation Finance, Division
of Economic and Risk Analysis, Office of Compliance
Inspections and Examinations, and Office of the General
Counsel. Other Federal agencies involved in this project
include the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
The Division of Corporate Finance (CF) ensures the SEC’s
compliance with Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which
requires the SEC to partner with other Federal financial
regulators to jointly prescribe regulations on risk retention
for securitizers in asset-backed securities transactions.
After the agencies jointly adopted the final rules on risk
retention in October 2014, CF staff collaborated with the
other agencies to provide interpretive guidance on the rules,
as appropriate. CF also consults with other Federal agencies
on implementation of credit risk retention rules. These
agencies include the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD), Federal Housing Finance Agency
(FHFA), and the Department of the Treasury. Furthermore,
CF routinely participates with Federal banking regulators
on accounting issues in accordance to Section 241 of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act which requires the SEC to
consult and coordinate with the appropriate Federal banking
agencies before issuing comments to banks regarding loan
loss allowances.

OTHER INFORMATION

The Office of the Chief Accountant leads the SEC’s efforts
to oversee accounting standard-setting by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and auditor oversight
and standard-setting by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB). In addition, OCA, together with
the Office of International Affairs, will continue to manage the
SEC’s representation in the International Financial Reporting
Standards Foundation Monitoring Board.

Strategic Goal 2
To foster and enforce compliance with the Federal securities laws, the SEC works closely with other agencies and
foreign governments.
The Division of Enforcement (ENF) collaborates with a
number of criminal authorities. For example, the Division, the
U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Attorney’s Offices
frequently collaborate on individual cases and broad sweeps
or task forces through access grants to their respective
investigative files. The Division also collaborates with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on individual matters
and through a Memorandum of Understanding to embed
several Agents and Intelligence Analysts from the FBI’s
Economic Crimes Unit into the Division’s Office of Market
Intelligence (OMI) for the purpose of information sharing
and combatting securities fraud by leveraging each other’s
resources and expertise.
ENF also coordinates with other Federal agencies, routinely
exchanging tips, complaints and referrals and sharing
information and intelligence. The Division primarily coordinated
in this regard with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S.
Attorney’s Offices, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
but also coordinates with other Federal and state agencies
including, among others, the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Internal Revenue Service,
the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency.
The Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations
(OCIE) is responsible for the oversight of broker-dealers
and does so through many coordinated efforts with the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The SEC
and FINRA have regular contact to discuss strategic initiatives,
examination coordination, risk assessment efforts, rule-making

•

FY 2017 CBJ, FY 2017 APP, AND FY 2015 APR

issues, industry risks, etc. This type of coordination is
ultimately intended to make oversight of broker-dealers more
effective and to improve compliance within the industry. As
an example, the two agencies coordinate to formally present
Compliance Outreach Seminars. Additional SEC offices,
particularly the Division of Trading and Markets, are involved
heavily in this coordination as well.
OIA staff assists the SEC’s Division of Enforcement with
hundreds of requests for international assistance each year,
particularly in the area of coordination of parallel proceedings
with foreign securities and law enforcement authorities.
OIA assists Enforcement with efforts to freeze and repatriate
assets held in foreign nations and provides guidance to
foreign counterparts in their efforts to secure the proceeds
of fraud present within the U.S.
OIA actively participates in multilateral efforts to enhance
international enforcement cooperation, representing the
SEC on multiple International Organization of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO) committees and steering groups.
OIA coordinates with foreign counterparts to develop policies
relating to enforcement matters, and to promote international
cooperation among securities regulators in their respective
investigations and cases. In addition, OIA coordinates with
the Division of Enforcement and the CFTC on joint and parallel
investigations of possible violations of U.S. securities and
commodities and futures laws where international issues
exist. OIA also works with the Department of Justice and
foreign law enforcement agencies on joint and parallel
investigations of possible violations of U.S. securities laws
where international issues exist.

Strategic Goal 3
The SEC frequently works with other entities to facilitate
access to the information investors need to make informed
investment decisions.
For example, the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy
(OIEA) is an active member of IOSCO Committee 8, the
primary mandate of which is to conduct IOSCO’s policy work
on retail investor education and financial literacy. On May 6,
IOSCO published results of the Committee’s survey on
anti-fraud messaging, which described strategies used by
securities market regulators to educate individual investors
about how to protect themselves against investment fraud.
OIEA led the project working in coordination with various
IOSCO members.

OTHER INFORMATION

OIEA also worked with FINRA to issue two Joint Investor
Alerts: “Dormant Shell Companies – How to Protect Your
Portfolio from Fraud” and “Automated Investment Tools”.
These alerts warn investors about aggressively promoted
“penny” stocks that may be stocks of companies that have
no or nominal business operations or non-cash assets for
an extended period of time, and gave the public information
on automated investment tools.
CF and OMWI staff also work with the Small Business
Administration (SBA) to develop outreach events to educate
the public about the changes made by the JOBS Act.

Strategic Goal 4
To enhance the Commission’s performance through effective
alignment and management of human, information, and
financial capital the Commission’s administrative offices often
work collaboratively with other agencies. Below are just a
few examples of activities the SEC participates in to help
further enhance the effectiveness of our core operations.
The Office of Human Resources is developing a Financial
Rotation Program in collaboration with Treasury, FDIC, CFPB,
Federal Reserve and CFTC. This program will provide an
opportunity for front line employees to be able to share
knowledge and best practices across the financial community.
OHR also participates in quarterly discussions to benchmark
the benefits and worklife program offerings among the
FIRREA agencies. The shared goal is to benchmark program
areas, understand each other’s organizational climate, and

explore best practices. Participants include the FDIC, the
CFTC, the Federal Housing Finance Administration, the OCC,
NCUA, and the Farm Credit Administration
The Project Management Office (PMO) within the Chief
Operating Officer’s Office (COO) participates in a roundtable
with the CFTC and the CFPB. The purpose of the roundtable
is to build relationships between Project Management Office
(PMO) staff across Federal agencies, to share lessons learned
in PMO development and project delivery, to establish a
forum for partnership and idea-sharing, and to help each
pursue excellence in mission delivery within our respective
organizations. The Office of Risk Management (ORM), also
within the COO, participates in another roundtable called the
Program Management Community of Practice. Collaboration
activities include sharing best practices; comparing risk
management technology; benchmarking program maturity;
and sharing tools, templates, and methodologies with other
risk management professionals across Federal agencies.
The Office of Information Technology is another office at the
SEC that routinely works with other agencies. For example,
OIT is involved in a project with GSA called GSA Networkx.
The goal of this project is to provide a flexible, responsive
and cost effective vehicle for telecommunications and data
services from the nations’ telecommunication providers.
OIT also works with the National Telecommunications &
Information Administration (NTIA) within the Department
of Commerce (DOC) so the SEC may have use of DOC/
NTIA’s radio frequencies, assesses interference concerns,
and assure spectrum efficiency.

Evidence Building
Internal and external evaluations play a significant role in
monitoring and improving SEC program performance.
Through objective measurement and analysis, agency
managers determine the extent to which programs are
achieving mission objectives allowing them to direct
SEC resources accordingly. In FY 2015, there were nine
Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports and
eleven Office of Inspector General reports related to
agency operations. Beyond this, examples of reviews
and evaluations that the agency has initiated and plan to
continue include:

•	 The agency initiated and advanced broad-based reviews
of core agency programs involving equity market
structure and the effectiveness of its public company
disclosure rules to protect investors and promote capital
formation. These initiatives will continue in FY 2017.
•	 The Division of Trading and Markets will continue to
explore options to improve the market structure for
trading fixed income securities, including municipal and
corporate bonds. Current and ongoing initiatives include
the adoption of riskless principal markup disclosure

rules by FINRA and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board (MSRB), development of best execution guidance
for the corporate and municipal bond markets, and
development of SEC rules designed to improve
pre-trade price transparency in these markets.
•	 In FY 2017, the Division of Investment Management (IM)
will continue to focus on a set of initiatives to enhance
investment management industry resilience to portfolio
composition risk and operational risk.
•	 Through customer satisfaction surveys and other
research, the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy
and the Office of the Investor Advocate will seek
additional information regarding the behavior of individual
investors, the types of information they need and use
when making investment decisions, and the usefulness
of SEC’s investor education programs and materials.
•	 The SEC reviews performance goal data on a quarterly
basis through the Chair’s Quarterly Operating Report
(CQOR), which was created to establish a performance
measure monitoring process for the agency. Once per
quarter, the SEC’s Performance Improvement Officer
and the Chair’s Office review the status of performance
goals and indicators and determine whether the agency
is on target for achieving the performance goals for the
fiscal year. The report includes the quarterly result for
each performance goal or indicator and the progress
achieved towards meeting the target for the fiscal

year. The SECs quarterly review process is in line
with OMB and Performance Improvement Council
recommendations for frequent data-driven reviews.
While the SEC is not required to comply with OMB
Memorandum M-14-06, the agency is supportive of the aims
to make greater use of existing administrative data where
possible. The SEC is already implementing activities that are
consonant with the guidance outlined in the Memorandum.
Examples of such activities are highlighted below.
•	 The SEC’s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis
(DERA) established the Quantitative Research and
Analytic Data Support (QRADS) program, with a formal
governance committee to manage the flow of SEC
data/analytic projects.
•	 The SEC manages a website to provide investors
and others with the ability to interactively explore a
range of new market metrics and access empirical
research and analyses that further inform the broader
public debate on market structure. The website is
located at www.sec.gov/marketstructure. It serves as
a central location for the SEC to publicly share evolving
data, research, and analysis as the agency continues
its review of equity market structure. The data and
related observations address the nature and quality of
displayed liquidity across the full range of U.S.-listed
equities – from the lifetime of quotes and the speed of
the market to the nature of order cancellations.

APPENDICES

Appendix B: Verification and Validation of Performance Data
The SEC’s programs require accurate data to properly assess
program performance and to make good management
decisions. The SEC performs data verification and validation
to evaluate whether data has been generated according to
specifications, satisfy acceptance criteria, and is appropriate
and consistent with its intended use. Data verification is a
systematic process for evaluating a dataset compared to a
series of standards regarding its completeness, correctness,
and consistency, using the methods and criteria defined in
the project documentation. Data validation follows the data
verification process and uses information from the project
documentation to ascertain the usability of the data in light
of its objectives and to ensure that results obtained are
scientifically defensible.
The SEC ensures that the performance data presented in
this report is complete, reliable and accurate based upon
the following assessment steps:
(1)	 The agency develops performance measures through
its strategic planning process.

  136

(2)	 The SEC’s divisions and offices perform steps
to ensure that data used in the calculation of
performance measures is accurate and reliable,
including adequately documenting:
■■

■■

the sources of the underlying data elements, and
the procedures used to gather the data;
the procedures used to obtain assurance as to the
accuracy and reliability of the data; and
the data definitions for reference, as well as the
measure calculations.

(3)	 The divisions and offices calculate and report the
performance measures to the Office of Financial
Management, and the measures are approved by
division directors and office heads. This process
ensures that the data used in the calculation of
performance measures is accurate and reliable
and that internal control is maintained through the
approval process.

This report was produced through the energies and talents of the SEC staff. To these individuals we
offer our sincerest thanks and acknowledgment. To comment on this report, please send an e-mail to
