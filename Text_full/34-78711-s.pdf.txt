SEC Suspends Public Accountant for Deficient Audits
August 29, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the
suspension of Thomas Dulek, a California-based accountant from practicing or appearing
before the SEC based on his violations of important auditing standards.
An SEC investigation found that Dulek conducted deficient audits of the fiscal years
2011 and 2012 financial statements of OCZ Technology Group, Inc., a now-bankrupt
company that manufactured and sold memory storage and power supply devices. The
investigation found that Dulek failed to adequately audit (a) OCZ’s accounting treatment
of credits that it provided to customers, purportedly for marketing activities, but which, in
fact, were used as a mechanism to provide sales discounts to customers and were
improperly recorded as marketing expenses; (b) OCZ’s failure to include labor and
overhead costs relating to inventory manufacturing in valuing its inventory, a departure
from generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”); (c) sales cut-off at the end of
the year (OCZ’s policies resulted in the recognition of revenue before it was earned); and
(d) OCZ’s GAAP departure in accounting for sales returns. Dulek violated a number of
auditing standards, including the requirements that auditors exercise due professional
care in conducting audits and that engagement partners properly supervise their teams.
The SEC’s order finds that Dulek engaged in improper professional conduct pursuant to
Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice.
Without admitting or denying the findings in the Commission’s order, Dulek agreed to be
suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an accountant, which
includes not participating in the financial reporting or audits of public companies. The
SEC’s order permits Dulek to apply for reinstatement after three years.
Previously, the SEC charged two former top executives at OCZ for making material
misstatements, among other things.
The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Ian Dattner, under the supervision of
Assistant Director Lisa Deitch. Trial Counsel Kevin Lombardi also participated in the
investigation.
