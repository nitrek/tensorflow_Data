Re: File No. S7-15-16, Disclosure Update and Simplification Proposed Rule

Dear Mr. Fields:
On behalf of Oxfam America, I would like to thank the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) for the opportunity to comment on the Disclosure Update and
Simplification Proposed Rule (the “Proposed Rule”) which seeks “[…] to facilitate the disclosure
of information to investors, while simplifying compliance efforts, without significantly altering
the total mix of information provided to investors.”1.

Oxfam America is a global organization working to right the wrongs of poverty, hunger,
and injustice. We save lives, develop long-term solutions to poverty, and campaign for social
change. Along with coalition partners, Oxfam America seeks an honest and fair international tax
system, greater transparency in corporate ownership and operations, and commonsense policies
that contribute to reduce inequality that are undermining our social fabric and hindering
economic growth.

On July 21, 2016, Oxfam submitted detailed comments in response to the Concept
Release demonstrating the need to provide investors with better tools to identify risk factors and
financial irregularities, and therefore make informed investment and voting decisions. In our
July letter, we offered our recommendations on the following: (1) requiring registrants to
disclose all subsidiaries and provide basic information about all of them rather than just
significant ones; (2) requiring registrants to disclose their legal entity identifiers (LEIs) and the
LEIs of their subsidiaries; (3) requiring disclosure of the number of employees for each of a
registrant’s subsidiaries; and (4) requiring registrants to submit basic corporate information on a
country-by-country (CbC) basis (CbC Reporting).
We would like to offer here our comments to the Proposed Rule as formulated in our July
submission, particularly on the need for country-by-country reporting and full disclosure of all
corporate subsidiaries rather than just the “significant” ones. A copy of these comments is also
attached to this letter as an appendix and for inclusion in the record.

Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule. Please contact Tatu Y.
Ilunga at Oxfam America (

) with any questions you may have.

Sincerely,

Tatu Y. Ilunga
Senior Policy Advisor
Oxfam America
