ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
AND
POSTPONEMENT ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act), on January 28, 2016, and the hearing was scheduled to commence on February 22,
2016. The OIP alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has repeatedly failed to
file required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement is seeking to revoke the registrations of
Respondents’ securities.
The OIP provides that each Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the
OIP on it. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Each Respondent was served with the OIP on
January 30, 2016, by USPS Express Mail delivery at “the most recent address shown on [its] most
recent filing with the Commission.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). To date, each Respondent has
failed to file an Answer within the time provided.
Accordingly, each Respondent is ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE, by February 29, 2016,
why it should not be deemed to be in default and the registration of its securities revoked. See OIP
at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the hearing is POSTPONED sine die, and a prehearing
conference shall be held by telephone on March 11, 2016, at 10:30 a.m. EST, if the proceeding has
not been resolved by then.
