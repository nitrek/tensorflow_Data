In the Matter of
DAVID S. HALL, P.C.
ORDER FOLLOWING
d/b/a THE HALL GROUP CPAs,
PREHEARING CONFERENCE
DAVID S. HALL, CPA,
MICHELLE L. HELTERBRAN COCHRAN, CPA,
and SUSAN A. CISNEROS

On October 7, 2016, a telephonic prehearing conference was held in this matter. Appearing
at the conference were the Division of Enforcement, Respondent Michelle Helterbran Cochran
(pro se), and Respondent Susan Cisneros (pro se). The remaining Respondents were not required
to participate in this conference.
The parties discussed their witness lists. Based on this discussion, no sanctions will be
imposed for failure to follow the order on witness lists dated September 28, 2016. Since it appears
that no additional matters need to be decided before the hearing, the telephonic prehearing
conference scheduled for October 17, 2016, is CANCELED. Should the need for an additional
prehearing conference arise, a party may request one by motion.
