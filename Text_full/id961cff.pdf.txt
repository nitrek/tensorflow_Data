INITIAL DECISION MAKING FINDINGS
AND REVOKING REGISTRATION
BY DEFAULT
February 11, 2016

APPEARANCE:

David S. Frye for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of Respondent USA
Graphite, Inc. (USGT).1 The revocation is based on Respondent’s repeated failure to file required
periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I. BACKGROUND
The Commission initiated this proceeding on December 30, 2015, with an Order Instituting
Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP alleges
that Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant
to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and that it has repeatedly failed to file with the Commission
annual and quarterly reports in compliance with the Exchange Act. The OIP provides that
Respondent’s Answer to the OIP is due within ten days of service of the OIP on it. See OIP at 2; 17
C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Respondent was served with the OIP on January 13, 2016.2 It failed to file an
Answer and was ordered to show cause why it should not be deemed to be in default and the
registration of its securities revoked. USA Graphite, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3541,
2016 SEC LEXIS 293 (A.L.J. Jan. 28, 2016). To date, Respondent has not filed an Answer to the
OIP or responded to the order to show cause. Thus, Respondent has failed to answer or otherwise to
defend the proceeding within the meaning of 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2). Accordingly, Respondent is

Respondent, a revoked Nevada corporation, was served with the OIP by service on its Nevada
registered agent and on its president, in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii) and Nev.
Rev. Stat. § 78.750.

in default, and the undersigned finds that the allegations in the OIP are true. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), .220(f). Official notice has been taken of the Commission’s public official records
concerning Respondent, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323.
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
USGT (CIK No. 1355420)3 is a revoked Nevada corporation located in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). USGT is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any
periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-K for the period ended August 31, 2013, which reported a
net loss of $50,613 for the prior six months. As of October 30, 2015, the common stock of USGT
was quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (formerly “Pink Sheets”), had
eleven market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c211(f)(3).
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
By failing to file required annual and quarterly reports, Respondent violated Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
IV. SANCTION
Revocation of the registration of the registered securities of Respondent will serve the public
interest and the protection of investors, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act. Revocation
will help ensure that the corporate shell is not later put to an illicit use involving publicly traded
securities manipulated to the detriment of market participants. Further, revocation accords with
Commission sanction considerations set forth in Gateway International Holdings, Inc., Exchange
Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006) (citing Steadman v.
SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1139-40 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981)), and with
the sanctions imposed in similar cases in which corporations violated Exchange Act Section 13(a)
by failing to file required annual and quarterly reports. See Cobalis Corp., Exchange Act Release
No. 64813, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2313 (July 6, 2011); Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197 (May 23, 2008); America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act Release
No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1242 (June 6, 2007); Eagletech Commc’ns, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 54095, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1534 (July 5, 2006). Respondent’s violations were recurrent,
egregious, and deprived the investing public of current and accurate financial information on which
to make informed decisions.
Failure to file periodic reports violates a crucial provision of the Exchange Act. The
purpose of the periodic reporting requirements is to publicly disclose current, accurate financial
information about an issuer so that investors may make informed decisions:

The reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is the primary
tool which Congress has fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent,
careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the sale of stock and securities.
Congress has extended the reporting requirements even to companies which are
“relatively unknown and insubstantial.”
SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977) (quoting legislative history); accord
e-Smart Techs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 50514, 2004 SEC LEXIS 2361, at *8-9 (Oct. 12,
2004). The Commission has warned that “many publicly traded companies that fail to file on a
timely basis are ‘shell companies’ and, as such, attractive vehicles for fraudulent stock manipulation
schemes.” e-Smart Techs., Inc., 2004 SEC LEXIS 2361, at *9 n.14.
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15

party files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the Initial Decision shall not become final as to that party.4
