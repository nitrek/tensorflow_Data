ORDER INSTITUTING
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS
AND NOTICE OF HEARING
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(j)
OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

In the Matter of
GLOBAL EARTH ENERGY, INC.,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") against
Global Earth Energy, Inc. ("Respondent").
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

RESPONDENT

1.
Global Earth Energy, Inc. (CIK No. 1121901) was a Nevada corporation whose
charter has been revoked. Respondent formerly was based in or near Wilmington, North Carolina,
and has a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act. On March 7, 2014, the Commission issued an Order of Suspension of Trading to
suspend trading in Respondent's securities, for the period from 9:30 a.m. EST on March 7, 2014,
through 11:59 p.m. EDT on March 20, 2014, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act (the
"Trading Suspension"). At the time of the Trading Suspension, Respondent's common stock was
quoted on OTC Link, operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., under the symbol "GLER." After the
Trading Suspension ended, Global Earth's common stock has continued to trade over-the-counter
in the "grey market," although OTC Markets Group Inc. has announced that it has discontinued
the display of quotes for GLER. See http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GLER/quote (last visited
July 13, 2016).

B.

DELINQUENT AND MATERIALLY DEFICIENT FILINGS, INCLUDING
MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

2.
Respondent is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not
filed any periodic reports since Respondent filed a Form 10-Q quarterly report on July 21, 2014,
for Respondent's third quarter ended May 31, 2014 (the "Form 10-Q"). Moreover, Respondent
filed the Form 10-Q before its independent registered public accountant, M&K CPAS, PLLC (the
"Independent Accountant"), had completed a review of the unaudited, interim financial statements
included in the Form 10-Q, pursuant to Rule 8-03 (for smaller reporting companies) and Rule 1001(d) of Regulation S-X. The Independent Accountant reported this illegal act to Respondent on
or about July 30, 2014, and the Independent Accountant reported this illegal act to staff of the
Commission on or about August 1, 2014, pursuant to the requirements of Section 10A(b) of the
Exchange Act. However, Respondent failed to notify the Commission of the illegal act as
required by Section 10A(b)(3) of the Exchange Act.
3.
In addition, Respondent made materially false and misleading statements in reports
filed with the Commission, primarily relating to Respondent's purported exchange of 20% of its
common stock for 20% of the common stock of privately-held Hawk Manufacturing Corporation
a/k/a Hawk Manufacturing, Inc. ("Hawk"), and Respondent's subsequent purported merger with
Hawk. For example:
(a)
On or about August 28, 2013, Respondent filed a Form 8-K current report
with the Commission, and an attached press release, falsely and misleadingly stating that
Respondent had exchanged 20% of its common stock for 20% of Hawk's common stock, that the
price per share of Respondent's stock was deemed to be $0.02, and that the price per share of
Hawk's common stock was deemed to be $3,200.00. These statements were false and misleading
because Respondent and Hawk had not exchanged any of their stock and had no reasonable basis
for the purported share valuations.
(b)
On or about December 16, 2013, Respondent filed a Form 10-K annual
report with the Commission for Respondent's fiscal year ended August 31, 2013, falsely stating
that on "August 28, 2013, the Company acquired a 20% equity ownership in Hawk." This
statement was false because Respondent had not acquired any equity ownership in Hawk.
Moreover, in this same filing, Respondent acknowledged that Hawk had no material book value at
the time of the "acquisition," indicating that Respondent's statement in the Form 8-K filed on
August 28, 2013 regarding the purported $3,200.00 per share value for Hawk’s common stock was
false and misleading. Respondent repeated these false and misleading statements in an amended
Form 10-K annual report filed on or about April 25, 2014, and in Form 10-Q quarterly reports
filed on or about January 21, 2014, April 21, 2014, and July 21, 2014.
(c)
On or about February 12, 2014, Respondent filed a Form 8-K current report,
which repeated a press release issued by Respondent dated February 5, 2014, falsely and
misleadingly announcing "the closing of the transaction to acquire and merger into Global Earth
Energy," when no such merger had ever occurred.

2

4.
On or about July 30, 2014, the Independent Accountant resigned as Respondent's
independent accountant and informed Respondent of the resignation. Respondent failed to file an
adequate and complete current report on Form 8-K disclosing the resignation of Respondent's
Independent Accountant. See Form 8-K, Item 4.01 instruction ("The resignation . . . of an
independent accountant . . . is a reportable event . . . .").
5.
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder require
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file with the
Commission current and accurate information in its periodic and other reports, even if the
registration is voluntary under Section 12(g). Specifically, Exchange Act Rule 13a-1 requires
issuers to file annual reports, Exchange Act Rule 13a-13 requires issuers to file quarterly reports,
Exchange Act 13a-11 requires issuers to file necessary or appropriate current reports, and
Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires issuers to report any further material information as may be
necessary to make the issuer's required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.
6.
As a result of the foregoing, Respondent failed to comply with Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be
instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and,
B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to suspend for a
period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of each class of securities registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of Respondent, and any successor under Exchange Act
Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate name of Respondent.
IV.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the
questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before
an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220(b) of
the Commission's Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b)].
If Respondent fails to file the directed Answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, Respondent, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new
3

corporate names of Respondent, may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined
against Respondent upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be
true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice [17
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310].
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified, registered,
or Express Mail, or by other means permitted by the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2)].
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related proceeding
will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness or counsel in
proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not "rule making" within the meaning
of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the provisions of
Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
