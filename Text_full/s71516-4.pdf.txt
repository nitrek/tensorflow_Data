Proposed Rule: Disclosure Update and Simplification 


Dear Mr. Fields:
The American Gas Association requests an extension of the comment deadline for the Securities
and Exchange Commission's (Commission) Proposed Rule, Disclosure Update and Simplification,
File No. 87-15-16 to at least ninety days.
The American Gas Association, founded in 1918, represents more than 200 local energy
companies that deliver clean natural gas throughout the United States. There are more than 72
million residential, commercial and industrial natural gas customers in the U.S., of which 95
percent-just under 69 million customers - receive their gas from AGA members. AGA is an
advocate for natural gas utility companies and their customers and provides a broad range of
·programs and services for member natural gas pipelines, marketers, gatherers, international natural
gas companies and industry associates. Today, natural gas meets more than one-fourth of the
United States' energy needs.
AGA and its members have reviewed the Proposed Rule and many aspects of the proposal will
impact our members. However, due to number of proposed changes, we respectfully request the
Commission extend the comment period for this proposal to at least ninety days in order for our
industry to thoroughly review and provide you with thoughtful comments.
AGA appreciates the opportunity to comment on this important proposal and your consideration of
our request for an extension of the comment period.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Patrick Migliaccio
