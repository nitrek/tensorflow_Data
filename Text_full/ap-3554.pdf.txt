In the Matter of
ORDER REGARDING EXHIBIT 2
GEORGE BUSSANICH, JR.

On December 2, 2015, the Division of Enforcement filed its motion for sanctions,
attaching sixteen exhibits. I determined that exhibits 4, 8-9, and 15-16 contained personally
identifiable information (PII) and ordered them sealed, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.322(b).
George Bussanich, Jr., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3512, 2016 SEC LEXIS 162 (ALJ
Jan. 14, 2016). On January 28, the Division submitted redacted versions of these exhibits, as
well as a redacted version of exhibit 2, which the Division contends contains PII.
Exhibit 2 is a certified mail return receipt, showing that the OIP was originally mailed by
the Office of the Secretary to the Respondent at an address in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey,
and that it was “unclaimed.” Exhibit 4 is an affidavit of service documenting personal service of
the OIP on Bussanich at a different address in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. The information
redacted from exhibit 2 appears to be only the house number and street, that is, the address where
Bussanich seemingly does not reside.
Although the Division’s caution in redacting an apparently incorrect street address is
commendable, I am not persuaded that the harm resulting from the disclosure of this information
outweighs the benefits of such disclosure. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.322(b). I therefore decline to
seal Division exhibit 2.
SO ORDERED.
