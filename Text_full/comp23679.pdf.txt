ECF CASE

Plaintiff,

:COMPLAINT

- against MARC D. BROIDY and BROIDY WEALTH
ADVISORS,LLC,

:JURY TRIAL
DEMANDED

Defendants.

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission"), for its Complaint against
Defendants Marc D. Broidy("Broidy") and Broidy Wealth Advisors, LLC("BWA", and
together with Broidy,"Defendants"), alleges as follows:
SUMMARY
1.

Defendants—an investment adviser and its sole owner and principal—defrauded

their advisory clients through three separate schemes.
2.

First, from at least February 2011 to July 2016, Defendants intentionally

overbilled clients and used the excess fees to pay for, among other things, Broidy's personal
expenses, including his home mortgage, trips overseas, and lease payments on two new

Case 1:16-cv-05960 Document 1 Filed 10/27/16 Page 2 of 19 PageID #: 2

Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
Pursuant to the terms set forth in BWA's Form ADV and its Investment Advisory
Contracts with clients, BWA's clients should have been charged an annual fee, ranging from 1%
to 1.5% oftheir assets under management, billed on a quarterly basis. Instead, Broidy billed
them at much higher rates, resulting in overbilling of advisory fees of approximately $643,000.
4.

Broidy covered up his overbilling scheme by altering the management fees

reported on Forms 1099 issued by brokerage firms before sending those forms to clients or their
accountants. Broidy also sent one of BWA's brokerage firms a number offalse and misleading
documents in an attempt to cover up his overbilling.
5.

Second, from April 2015 to February 2016, Broidy misappropriated $865,318 in

assets from trusts for which he was trustee, again using the funds to pay for personal expenses.
6.

To cover up his personal use of the trusts' assets, Broidy purported to sell to the

trusts shares that he personally owned in two privately-held, risky, start-up companies.
However, Broidy never transferred these shares to the trusts.
7.

Finally, Broidy made material misrepresentations and omissions to advisory

clients regarding their investments in privately-held companies with which he was affiliated.
Specifically, he omitted information about the financial and operational status ofthose
companies, his compensation for soliciting investments, and his role as a board member ofthose
companies.

By engaging in the conduct set forth in this Complaint, Defendants Broidy and

BWA have violated, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, Section 17(a) ofthe Securities

DEFENDANTS'OVERBILLING SCHEME
22.

From at least February 2011 to February 2016, Defendants overbilled Clients A

through E by a total of approximately $643,000, and took steps to hide the overbilling scheme.
23.

BWA entered into ageements with its clients entitled Investment Advisory

Contracts in which BWA was appointed as an investment adviser. BWA's Form ADV and
Investment Advisory Contracts disclosed that clients were billed a certain percentage of their
assets under management("AUM")on a quarterly basis based on the following chart:

Client A

24.

From February 2011 to March 2016, Defendants managed, on average, at least $2

million in assets for Client A. In accordance with BWA's written disclosures, Defendants told
Client A that they would charge him a 1 %annual fee, which would be deducted from one of his
accounts on a quarterly basis. From February 2011 to March 2016, Defendants overcharged
Client A by approximately $213,273.

B.

Clients B & C

25.

From March 2011 to March 2016, Defendants managed, on average, at least $2

million in assets for Clients B and C. Through the Form ADV,the advisory agreement, and
Broidy's oral statements to Clients B and C. Defendants communicated to Clients B and C that
they would be charged a 1 %annual fee, deducted on a quarterly basis. From March 2011 to
March 2016, Clients B and C were overcharged approximately $190,874. In addition, in July
2016—after Clients B and C had terminated their relationship with him—Broidy deducted
$6,000 in advisory fees from one of Clients B and C's brokerage accounts.
C.

Clients D & E

26.

From April 2011 to August 2015, Defendants managed approximately $2 million

in assets for Clients D and E. Defendants told Clients D and E that they would be charged a
1.5%annual fee, deducted on a quarterly basis. From April 2011 to August 2015, Clients D and
E were overcharged approximately $239,000 based on their own calculation.
27.

After noticing a lower account balance than anticipated, Clients D and E

examined their brokerage statements in more detail and found higher than expected fee
deductions. They confronted Broidy about this in person. He denied there was an issue and
falsely claimed that any error was the brokerage firm's fault.
28.

Ultimately, Clients D and E reached a settlement pursuant to which Broidy paid

them $325,000.
D.

BWA's Brokerage Firm Severs Ties with Defendants.

29.

In April 2013, BWA's broker-dealer("Broker-Dealer A")contacted Broidy to

inquire about an increase in fees for Client A's accounts. Broidy pointed Broker-Dealer A to an
"outside asset letter," dated March 11, 2013, purportedly signed by Client A, which indicated

7

Case 1:16-cv-05960 Document 1 Filed 10/27/16 Page 8 of 19 PageID #: 8

that Defendants were billing for advising on assets held outside of Broker-Dealer A. This
statement was false and misleading because at that time, Defendants only managed one asset
outside of the brokerage account for Client A, and the appropriate advisory fees for this account
should have been under $1,000 annually.
30.

In July 2014, Broker-Dealer A again contacted Broidy to inquire about

fluctuations in fee amounts and billing frequency in the accounts held by Clients B, C, D, and E.
Broidy told Broker-Dealer A that the increased fees were due to (1) his providing advice on
assets held outside ofBroker-Dealer A; and (2)fees related to hourly billing for services outside
of investment advisory services. However, as Broidy knew, should have known, or recklessly
disregarded, these statements were also false and misleading. Although Broidy performed
certain services for Clients B and C beyond investment advisory services, Broidy told Clients B
and C that he would not charge them for additional services. Broidy also provided an invoice
reflecting hourly services to Broker-Dealer A; neither this bill, nor any other bill for services,
was ever sent to Clients B and C, who understood from Defendants these services were included
in Defendants' 1 %annual advisory fee.
31.

By the end of August 2014, Broker-Dealer A terminated Defendants' ability to

bill clients directly through its platform. In January 2015, Broker-Dealer A terminated its
relationship with Defendants' entirely.
32.

In or about October 2014—after Broker-Dealer A terminated Defendants' ability

to collect fees through its platform—Defendants transferred their clients' assets to another
broker-dealer ("Broker-Dealer B"). However, a year later, Broker-Dealer B also terminated its
relationship with Defendants, and Defendants moved the accounts to yet another brokerage firm
("Broker-Dealer C").

E.

Defendants Take Steps to Hide Their Overbilling.

33.

To hide the overbilling scheme, Broidy altered the Forms 1099 that he sent to

clients and clients' accountants in order to eliminate or decrease the advisory fees he had
deducted from the accounts. Below is a chart comparing a sample ~f the Forms 1099 produced
by the brokerage firms to the Forms 1099 for which Broidy either whited-out or manually cut
and pasted a lower fee amount:

In a March 31, 2015 email, Client D and E's accountant pointed out to Broidy that

Clients D and E "dropped off original copies of these [1099] forms, and on page 5 of6 ofthe
advisor fees on the hard copy they brought to me do not match the copy you e-mailed ...It's a
pretty big difference between the two ..."
35.

Broidy responded:"We had this problem a prior year with [Broker-Dealer A].

The numbers I provided to you are CORRECT:... $4,918.50." He later clarified: ``Not unlike a

E

Case 1:16-cv-05960 Document 1 Filed 10/27/16 Page 10 of 19 PageID #: 10

couple of years ago, there was a batch error for some clients ... it was random in nature. This
was one of the reasons I make sure to review ALL my client's [sic] 1099's and another reason I
moved to [Broker-Dealer B]." However, Broidy's statements to the accountant were untrue, as
he knew, should have known, or recklessly disregarded. There was no batch error at BrokerDealer A; the fees on the hard copy form provided to the accountant by Clients D and E were
correct.
II.

THE TRUST ACCOUNTS SCHEME
A.

Defendants Misappropriate Assets from Certain Trusts.

36.

Clients B and C set up separate trusts for each of their six children ("Trusts") and

appointed Broidy as the trustee. The Trusts were funded solely with 318,321 shares ofPubCo
(the publicly-traded company founded and run by Clients B and C). The shares were allocated to
the various Trusts in accordance with a trust agreement ("Trust Agreement"). According to the
Trust Agreement, dated November 13, 2013, the stated purpose of the Trusts was to provide for
the interest and benefit of the children of Clients B and C.
37.

The Trust Agreement provided that, if Broidy were to sell the Trusts' PubCo

shares, he was required to invest the Trusts' assets in those things that "persons of prudence ...
acquire for their own account." While the Trust Agreement provided Broidy with certain
discretion over the investment of the Trusts' assets, it explicitly required him to obtain an
"independent appraisal" if Broidy transacted with the Trusts for his own account in order to
ensure that the prices charged were "not in excess ofthe fair market value."
38.

Despite telling Clients B and C that he would not charge them any additional fees

in connection with his work as trustee, Broidy billed Clients B and C's advisory account—and
not the Trusts—for services he provided to the Trusts. Such billing was contrary to Broidy's

10

Case 1:16-cv-05960 Document 1 Filed 10/27/16 Page 11 of 19 PageID #: 11

representations to Clients B and C, as he knew, should have known, or recklessly disregarded.
39.

In addition, Broidy told Clients B and C that he would not sell the Trusts' PubCo

stock. However,from April through October 2015, he proceeded to do just that. He transferred
71,321 PubCo shares from the Trusts' brokerage accounts to the BWA's omnibus account and
sold those shares for $352,778.~ Broidy then wired the proceeds to BWA's bank account and
used the funds to pay for personal credit cards and other expenses.
40.

For example, on July 28, 2015, the balance in BWA's Bank of America checking

account was $3,022.49. From July 29, 2015 through September 1, 2015, the only deposits to the
BWA Bank of America account was a total of over $200,000 of proceeds from Defendants" sales
ofthe Trusts' PubCo stock. Broidy used the proceeds ofthese sales to pay over $150,000 in
personal expenses:
a. Over $49,000 to American Express for Broidy's personal credit card expenses;
b. Over $49,000 to Barclaycard for Broidy's personal credit card expenses;
c. Over $23,000 to Chase Bank for Broidy's personal credit card expenses;
d. Over $7,000 to Citi Card for Broidy's personal credit card expenses;
e. $4,000 to Broidy's then-wife;
f. Over $9,400 to FNFG Credit Card for Broidy's personal credit card expenses;
g. $652 to Lending Club to service a personal loan Broidy had taken out months
earlier;
h. $4,400 to Broidy's personal accounts;
i. Over $1,200 to Mercedes-Benz Financial Services for leases on two cars;
j. Over $360 for assorted personal expenses;
'
In order to transfer the PubCo certificates into the brokerage account, Broidy initiated numerous
communications with PubCo's transfer agent, American Stock Transfer, whose principal place of business is
Brooklyn, New York.

11

Case 1:16-cv-05960 Document 1 Filed 10/27/16 Page 12 of 19 PageID #: 12

k. Cash withdrawals of $1,315; and
1. Gas and electric bills.
41.

During that same time, April through October 2015, Broidy also directly sold

49,000 shares from the Trusts' accounts at Broker-Dealer B. The proceeds from those sales were
transferred to accounts held at Broker-Dealer C in the Trusts' beneficiaries' names.
42.

On a May 22, 2015, Broidy received an email from the CFO ofPubCo asking "so

the trusts still hold the same holdings as before (including PIPE shares and previous shares
held)?" Broidy replied,"For your purposes that is correct ..." However, Broidy knew, should
have known, or recklessly disregarded that this statement was untrue as he had begun selling the
Trusts' PubCo shares a month before he sent that email.
43.

From October 19, 2015 through February 22,2016, Broidy sold an additional

83,900 PubCo shares directly from the Trusts' accounts at Broker-Dealer C and wired $512,540
to his personal bank account. Broidy also used these funds for personal expenses, including
paying his settlement with Clients D and E on account of his overbilling.
44.

Broidy knew, should have known,or recklessly disregarded that he was not

allowed, by the terms of the Trust Agreement or his representations to Clients B and C, to sell
the PubCo Shares and use the proceeds for his personal gain. Defendants never informed Clients
B and C about their use ofthe Trusts' assets for personal gain.
45.

In addition—by exercising control over the purchase and sale ofthe Trusts'

securities and compensating themselves for that activity—Defendants acted as investment
advisers to the Trusts.
B.

Defendants Took Steps to Cover Up Their Misappropriation.

46.

In order to cover up the misappropriation, Broidy created the false appearance

12

Case 1:16-cv-05960 Document 1 Filed 10/27/16 Page 13 of 19 PageID #: 13

that he was using the proceeds of the PubCo sales—not for his own benetit—but to have the
Trusts purchase shares that Broidy personally owned in two privately-held companies, CableCo
and JetCo. In truth, however, Broidy never transferred any of the shares of CableCo or JetCo to
the Trusts. Moreover, as Broidy knew, should have known, or recklessly disregarded, such
transfers, even if they had occurred, would have violated both the terms of the Trust Agreement
and his fiduciary duty as an investment adviser as discussed below.
1. CableCo
47.

In August 2015,four months after he began transferring the PubCo shares and the

proceeds from their sales to the BWA account that he used for personal expenses, Broidy
purportedly entered into a stock purchase agreement between himself and the Trusts (the
"CableCo Agreement"). Pursuant to this agreement, Broidy purported to transfer 175,000 shares
of CableCo to the Trusts for $350,000.
48.

The CableCo Agreement, which Broidy signed both as seller and trustee, falsely

stated that(1) CableCo "has assembled a proprietary technology";(2)that CableCo "is the owner
of all its unique multiplexing and bandwidth utilization enabling technologies, proprietary
intellectual property and technology assets as set forth in its Patents ....";(3)that CableCo "is
the owner of all trademarks, trade names, trade name registrations and applications, patents and
patent applications ...used or held by the Company in connection with the Company's
business"; and (4)that the company's "Technology and Intangible Rights are subject to no
pending or threatened challenge."
49.

However, at the time that Broidy invested the Trusts' assets in CableCo, the

company had virtually no assets and no business operations. Based on his position at CableCo,
Broidy knew, should have known, or recklessly disregarded that CableCo had virtually no assets.

13

Case 1:16-cv-05960 Document 1 Filed 10/27/16 Page 14 of 19 PageID #: 14

Broidy was one of only two board members of CableCo, a private company incorporated months
earlier in January 2015. Its bank account was opened shortly thereafter by Broidy and another
individual. CableCo's goal was to purchase intellectual property assets relating to broadband
technology from the bankrupt estate of Bandwidth, another company with which Broidy had
been closely associated. As ofthe date of this filing, CableCo has not yet purchased those assets.
Moreover, Broidy never actually transferred any of the CableCo shares that he purported to own
to the Trusts.
2. JetCo
50.

Starting in late 2013, Broidy served as the Chairman of JetCo. JetCo, a privately-

held online jet chartering service, had limited operations and generated virtually no profit.
51.

Broidy created a stock purchase agreement on October 1, 2015 between BWA

and the Trusts, purporting to memorialize Broidy's sale of 80,000 shares of JetCo—that he
claimed to personally own—to the Trusts for $400,000 (the "JetCo Agreement").
52.

As with the CableCo fraud, however, Broidy never actually transferred these

shares to the Trusts. Moreover, such a transfer was not possible as Broidy only owned
approximately 73,000 JetCo shares. In addition, approximately 50,000 of those shares were
restricted by agreement with the company and could not be resold absent certain circumstances,
which did not occur.
53.

Moreover, as Defendants knew, should have known,or recklessly disregarded

(1)the purported sales of the CableCo and JetCo shares, at most, accounted for only $750,000 of
the $865,318 in proceeds generated from the sales ofPubCo shares that Broidy transferred from
the Trusts to himself; (2) Defendants never obtained an independent valuation ofthe JetCo and
CableCo shares they purported to sell to the Trusts as required by the Trust Agreement; and

14

Case 1:16-cv-05960 Document 1 Filed 10/27/16 Page 15 of 19 PageID #: 15

(3) Defendants never disclosed the conflicts of interest they faced in purporting to sell shares that
Broidy personally owned to his advisory clients, the Trusts.
III.

ADDITIONAL MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS
54.

Broidy made additional false and misleading statements to his clients relating to

CableCo, JetCo, and Bandwidth while advising them to purchase interests in these companies.
55.

First, in or about April 2015, Broidy recommended that an advisory client

("Client F") make a $25,000 investment in CableCo. Broidy told Client F that CableCo owned
technology in a special kind of cable and had operations and assets. However, as discussed in
Section II above, CableCo had no assets and no business operations, which Broidy was aware of
due to his board position.
56.

Second, Broidy falsely stated on his Form ADV that he did not receive

commissions for investments he made on behalf of advisory clients: "[n]either BWA nor its
supervised persons accept any compensation for the sale of securities or other investment

for Bandwidth. Broidy solicited multiple investments by his advisory clients during his tenure as
a Bandwidth board member.
