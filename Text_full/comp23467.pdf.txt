COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), for its Complaint against
Defendant Wade James Lawrence ("Lawrence"), alleges:
SUMMARY
1.

Between 2010 and 2013, Wade James Lawrence ("Lawrence"), age 44, formerly

of Dallas, Texas, was an investment adviser associated with two companies registered with the
SEC as broker-dealers and investment advisers. Lawrence defrauded and breached his fiduciary
duties to at least 18 advisory clients by making numerous misrepresentations to them and by
placing numerous unauthorized trades in their accounts. As a result of his unlawful trading,
Lawrence’s clients lost at least $2 million. Lawrence received approximately $28,700 in
advisory fees from these clients. Lawrence also solicited at least $480,000 from five persons by
making false representations that he would trade securities for their benefit in his own brokerage
account. In reality, Lawrence spent the vast majority of the $480,000 for his personal use, while
returning roughly $50,000 in the form of Ponzi-like payments.

As a result of his actions, Lawrence violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of

1933 ("Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 ("Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder

U.S.C. § 80b-6(1) and 80b-6(2)]. In the interest of protecting the public from any further
violations of the federal securities laws by Lawrence, the SEC brings this action against him.
The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with pre-judgment interest, civil
money penalties, and all other equitable and ancillary relief deemed necessary by the Court.

PARTIES
7.

Plaintiff SEC is an agency of the United States of America charged with

enforcing the federal securities laws.
FACTS
8.

Between June 2008 and July 2013, Lawrence was associated with two companies

that were dually registered with the SEC as both broker-dealers and investments advisers.
9.

At the time he began engaging in the conduct at issue in this Complaint,

Lawrence was associated with the first of the two companies. During that time, Lawrence was
managing approximately 250 advisory and brokerage accounts. Initially, he traded on a
generally profitable basis in accordance with his clients’ and customers’ investment objectives
and trade authorizations.1
10.

Lawrence’s clients and customers included personal friends and relatives. Their

investment objectives ranged from preservation of principal to growth and/or speculation. In
general, Lawrence’s customers and clients placed great personal trust in him.
11.

In mid-June 2010, Lawrence began pursuing a more aggressive and risky trading

strategy for his own account and a few of his advisory clients. That strategy involved trading
equities and options, including purchasing options on a highly speculative security known as the
iPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures ETN ("VXX"). The VXX is structured in such a way
that it must continually purchase short-term VIX futures, often at a price more expensive than the

last.2 This ongoing cost increase generally results in a negative return, which is typically
exacerbated the longer the instrument is held.
12.

Lawrence’s clients never gave him written discretionary authority to conduct

transactions in their accounts without prior authorization. In spite of this, Lawrence purchased
and sold securities—including risky investments—without authorization.
13.

Even with those clients with whom he had some discussion about trading more

aggressively or who had speculation as a trading objective, Lawrence did not fully disclose the
risks of VXX and other aggressive trading. This included failing to disclose the risk of holding
VXX positions for extended periods.
14.

Because Lawrence had some initial successes with his strategies, he began

executing similar trades in more client accounts. He did this without providing notification or
getting authorization.
15.

In 2011, Lawrence’s trading strategy resulted in significant losses for him and his

clients. In an effort to recoup the losses, Lawrence began making additional speculative trades
on a more frequent basis—resulting in more losses.

Like the earlier trades, these were

unauthorized.
16.

Some of Lawrence’s clients eventually began questioning him about the losses in

their accounts. In response, Lawrence misrepresented and mischaracterized the unauthorized
trades he had placed in their accounts.
17.

In June 2011, one of Lawrence’s clients contacted his Branch Manager. The

client complained that Lawrence had executed unauthorized trades in his account and offered to

personally pay for the losses.

Page 5 of 9 PageID 5

When asked about this by his Branch Manager, Lawrence

admitted to making unauthorized trades. However, he denied offering to personally reimburse
the client—which he had in fact done. Lawrence also failed to reveal that he had placed similar
unauthorized trades in the accounts of other clients.
18.

In August 2011, Lawrence began his association with the second broker-dealer

and investment adviser. As with the previous company, none of Lawrence’s clients gave him
written discretionary authority to trade in their accounts.
19.

Lawrence quickly resumed his aggressive and unauthorized trading. For his first

two months at the new firm, Lawrence’s clients experienced gains as a result of his trading. In
November 2011, however, both Lawrence and his clients began suffering significant losses from
his unauthorized trading—including in the VXX, options, and other securities.
20.

As at the prior company, Lawrence tried to recoup the losses. He again made

unauthorized speculative trades on a more frequent basis. This resulted in additional losses.
21.

Through his unlawful activities at both firms, Lawrence breached fiduciary duties

to his clients. This resulted in Lawrence receiving advisory fees of roughly $28,700.
22.

In January 2012, Lawrence needed more funds to cover his own and his clients’

investment losses and to pay off various debts. Consequently, he raised at least $480,000 from at
least five people. He accepted money both directly and via personal checks or wire transfers to
his personal checking account. The funds were supposedly for investment and trading for their
behalf in his personal brokerage account. Lawrence falsely claimed that by not opening personal
accounts for them, they would benefit because he could purchase securities at prices lower than
those for the general public. He also falsely claimed he could make trades that the general public
could not make.

23.

Page 6 of 9 PageID 6

Rather than invest and trade the funds as promised, Lawrence first used the

funds—as well as other loan proceeds—to pay personal expenses and debts and to make Ponzilike payments to the investors. The approximate amount of these payments was $50,000. When
investors asked Lawrence about the status of their investments, he claimed they were performing
well—even going so far as to send fake account balances to investors by text message.
24.

In November 2013, Lawrence voluntarily ended his association with the second

firm. He subsequently entered a plea of guilty to charges that he criminally violated Section
17(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)]. See Case No. 3:15-cr-374M: United States of America v. Wade Lawrence (N.D. Tex.). Lawrence was sentenced to a three
year prison term, ordered to pay restitution of $1,454,384.48, and to forfeit $126,074.10 from the
sale of real property he had acquired through his fraud.
CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
