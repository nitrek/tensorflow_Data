CONFERENCE

On September 22, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondents pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The hearing is scheduled to commence on October 11, 2016.
On September 29, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondents were served with the OIP by U.S. Postal Service express mail by
September 26, 2016, in accordance with Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(ii).1
Respondents’ answers are due by October 11, 2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a)-(b), .220(b).
I ORDER that the hearing scheduled for October 11, 2016, is POSTPONED and a telephonic
prehearing conference shall be held on October 24, 2016 at 2:00 p.m. EDT. Any Respondent that
fails to timely file an answer, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding
will be deemed in default and the registration of its securities will be revoked. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§
201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).

The Division’s declaration states that Respondent Amarillo Mesquite Grill, Inc. was served
with the OIP on September 29, 2016. However, that date of delivery is based on the USPS tracking
number provided in Exhibit 1 to the declaration (EI283507031US), which is different than the
tracking number in the body of the declaration and on file with the Office of the Secretary
(EF177629736US). USPS tracking information for this latter tracking number, which appears to be
the correct number, shows that the OIP was in fact delivered to Amarillo on September 26, 2016.
