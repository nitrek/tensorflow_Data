PARTIAL STAY ORDER

June 24, 2016
July 1, 2016
July 6, 2016

On June 13, 2016, the Commission issued an opinion and order finding that respondents
Mohammed Riad and Kevin Timothy Swanson violated the antifraud provisions of the securities
laws while associated with an investment adviser responsible for managing the portfolio of a
closed-end investment company.1 The Commission ordered respondents to cease and desist
from violations of the securities laws, to disgorge ill-gotten gains, and to each pay a third-tier
civil penalty. The Commission also imposed a permanent bar on Riad and a bar with the right
to reapply after two years on Swanson.
Respondents now move for a stay of the Commission’s Order Imposing Remedial
Sanctions (“Order”) pending judicial review.2 We will deny the stay application; however, we

stay the disgorgement and civil monetary penalties imposed by the Order for the reasons
discussed below.
The party requesting a stay pending appeal has the burden of establishing that a stay is
justified.3 The Commission’s consideration of such requests is governed by the traditional,
four-factor standard—namely, (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he
or she is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured
absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested
in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.4 Because the first two factors are the
most critical, an applicant’s failure to demonstrate the requisite likelihood of success or
irreparable harm ordinarily will be dispositive of the stay inquiry.5
We conclude that respondents have not carried their burden on their request for a stay.
Respondents have failed to demonstrate a likelihood that they will prevail on appeal. They urge
the Commission to reflect upon the “gravity of the issues that will be considered by the appellate
court on appeal.” Yet their stay motion merely asserts, in conclusory fashion, that there are
errors in the Commission’s analysis.6 Necessarily, they have failed to make a “strong showing

not materially alter the opinion’s reasoning or amend the Order itself. Thus, respondents’
motion for a stay was appropriately directed to the June 13 Order. See Rule of Practice 401(c),
17 C.F.R. § 201.401(c).

In their reply in support of their stay request, respondents develop for the first time their
contentions as to purported errors in the Commission’s analysis. As these arguments were not
made in the stay motion, we deem them waived. See, e.g., Gen. Carbon Co. v. OSHA, 854
F.2d 1329, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (per curiam) (denying request for stay where motion failed to
present argument on stay factors and finding that the movant’s “attempt, by way of reply, to
expand its arguments, and to address for the first time [the stay] factors omitted from its original
motion, is unacceptable”); McBride v. Merrell Dow & Pharm., Inc., 800 F.2d 1208, 1210 (D.C.
Cir. 1986). At any rate, even if the arguments had been timely presented, we would still find
that respondents failed to establish a strong likelihood of success. They merely repeat
arguments that the Commission already considered and rejected, Riad, 2016 WL 3226836, at *36

stay.

This factor thus weighs strongly against a

Given respondents’ failure to show a strong likelihood of success, they must marshal a
much more compelling showing of irreparable injury absent a stay.7 This they have also failed
to do. To be cognizable, an asserted irreparable “injury must be both certain and great; it must
be actual and not theoretical.”8 The Commission has consistently found that the kinds of harms
asserted by respondents—e.g., financial detriment, the loss of employment prospects, and the
potential for collateral proceedings initiated by third parties—do not amount to irreparable
injury.9 So too here. For example, Swanson asserts that his reputation suffered when the CFA
Institute, a professional organization, acted to summarily suspend his membership following the
Commission’s decision in this matter. Swanson identifies no concrete consequences flowing
from loss of membership, let alone grave and irreparable ones. Moreover, as a general matter, a
concern that the Commission’s decision could be employed “against [the respondents] in
collateral . . . litigation does not constitute irreparable harm because reversal of the decision on
appeal . . . would vitiate its use in other proceedings.”10 If respondents ultimately prevail, there

is every reason to believe that the CFA Institute (and other third parties) will take note
accordingly. Indeed, the CFA Institute’s Rules of Procedure for Professional Conduct provide
that a summary suspension of membership “may be rescinded . . . if the [affected member]
provides reliable evidence demonstrating that the underlying . . . industry bar . . . has been
reversed.”11
Furthermore, any harm that might be suffered by respondents is outweighed by the
danger posed by allowing them to continue to serve in the securities industry while their appeal
is pending.12 As explained in the Commission’s opinion, the sanctions imposed on respondents
are in the public interest. The Commission found that respondents’ fraudulent “conduct was
egregious and undertaken with scienter,” “recurrent,” and resulted in substantial losses to
investors.13 The Commission also found that respondents failed to “recognize[] the wrongful
nature of their misconduct” or “suppl[y] assurances against future violations.”14 In light of
these considerations, the Commission found that investor protection and the public interest
required imposing bars. Respondents have provided no persuasive reason to revisit the
determination that they pose a continuing, substantial threat to investors and to the public
interest. Given these findings, consideration of the potential harm to third parties and the public
interest supports keeping sanctions in place during the pendency of the judicial review process.
The instant matter is unlike Michael E. McCune and Electronic Transaction Clearing,
Inc., which respondents cite for the proposition that denying a stay “would put them in jeopardy
of losing the benefit of a successful appeal.” Those cases both involved short-term suspensions
issued by an SRO that would likely terminate before the Commission could dispose of the

seeking a stay], … any harm that [they] may incur from the denial of . . . their stay requests is
outweighed by the danger to the investing public if the effect . . . is delayed”).

applicant’s appeals.15 In determining that a stay was appropriate, the Commission observed
that requiring the suspensions to start immediately “could denigrate the benefits” of an eventual
victory on appeal.16 The Commission also noted that the underlying misconduct was not found
by the SRO to be “so troubling as to necessitate a permanent bar”—only a “relatively short
suspension[].”17
The bars imposed on respondents are materially different from the suspensions at issue in
McCune and Electronic Transaction Clearing. Here, the Commission permanently barred Riad
and barred Swanson with the right to reapply after two years. In so doing, it specifically found
that a bar was necessary to provide “sufficient protection of the public interest and investors”
given the seriousness of their misconduct and other considerations.18
The Commission has recognized the “significant distinction[s] between a true
time-limited bar and a bar that includes a right to reapply after a certain period of time.”19
Unlike a suspension or a time-limited bar (whose duration is limited by its terms), a bar with the
right to reapply does not create an entitlement to automatically rejoin the securities industry after
a pre-determined period of time. Swanson is eligible to reapply after two years; if he submits
an application at that time, the Commission would determine whether, “under all the facts and
circumstances presented, it is consistent with the public interest and investor protection to permit
[him] to function in the industry.”20 Thus, in the event that Swanson ultimately prevails in
court and the Commission’s sanctions against him are vacated, he would enjoy a meaningful,
tangible benefit—the ability to resume his advisory practice without seeking relief from the

Commission—regardless of whether he prevailed before or after the two-year period had run.21
In short, the considerations that motivated McCune, Electronic Transaction Clearing, and similar
cases have no application to permanent bars (with or without the right to reapply) because the
respondent is not in “jeopardy of losing the benefit of a successful appeal.”
Nonetheless, the Commission “has at times stayed monetary sanctions pending appeal
without reference to the applicant’s likelihood of success on the merits” or the other components
of the four-factor test.22 We have not been presented with a developed argument as to the
continued application of this practice. Therefore, under the circumstances and in our discretion,
we elect to stay the monetary components of the Order Imposing Remedial Sanctions.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that respondents’ motion to stay sanctions is DENIED.
On the Commission’s own motion, it is further ORDERED that the requirements in the Order
Imposing Remedial Sanctions that respondents pay disgorgement and civil money penalties are
STAYED pending the filing of a petition for review with a United States Court of Appeals and,
upon the timely filing of such a petition, pending the determination of that appeal and the
issuance of the court’s mandate. The Order Imposing Remedial Sanctions remains effective in
all other respects.

At any rate, respondents are incorrect to assert that “it would not be surprising if final
adjudication of [their] appeal were to take all or nearly all of those two years.” For the
12-month period ending March 31, 2016, the median time from the filing of a notice of appeal to
disposition on the merits by a United States Court of Appeals was 8.6 months. See
