STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE ................................................................................. 1
INTEREST OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
AND SUMMARY OF ITS POSITION .......................................................... 2
STATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................................................................. 4
A.

The securities laws recognize that internal company reporting by
employees and others is important for deterring, detecting, and
stopping unlawful conduct that may harm investors. ...................................... 4

B.

By providing new incentives and protections for individuals to
engage in whistleblowing activity, the Dodd-Frank whistleblower
program enhances the existing securities-law enforcement scheme,
including internal company reporting. ............................................................ 9
1.

The Commission carefully calibrated the rules implementing
the monetary award component of the whistleblower program
to ensure that individuals were not disincentivized from first
reporting internally. ............................................................................... 9

2.

Using its broad rulemaking authority, the Commission
adopted a rule clarifying that employment retaliation is
prohibited against individuals who engage in any of the
whistleblowing activity described in Section
21F(h)(1)(A)(iii)—including making internal reports at public
companies of securities fraud violations. ............................................13

STANDARD OF REVIEW .....................................................................................16
ARGUMENT ...........................................................................................................18
I.

Section 21F does not unambiguously demonstrate a Congressional
intent to restrict employment anti-retaliation protection to only those
individuals who provide the Commission with information relating
to a violation of the securities laws. ..............................................................18

_____________________________________________________
BRIEF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLANT
_____________________________________________________
STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), after noticeand-comment rulemaking, issued a rule to clarify an ambiguity in the
whistleblower employment anti-retaliation provisions in Section 21F(h)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. §78u-6(h)(1). The
Commission’s rule interpreted the anti-retaliation protections to extend to any
individual who engages in the whistleblowing activities described in Section

Case: 14-2734

Document: 003111817814

Page: 12

Date Filed: 12/11/2014

21F(h)(1)(A), irrespective of whether the individual makes a separate report to the
Commission. Is the Commission’s rule entitled to deference under Chevron,
U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984)?
INTEREST OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
AND SUMMARY OF ITS POSITION
The Commission—the agency principally responsible for the administration
of the federal securities laws—submits this brief as amicus curiae pursuant to Fed.
R. App. P. 29(a) to address an important securities law issue presented in this
appeal.
Congress, in Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376,
1841-49 (2010), amended the Exchange Act to add Section 21F, entitled
“Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protection” and codified at 15 U.S.C.
§78u-6. Section 21F directs the Commission to pay awards to individuals whose
reports to the Commission about violations of the securities laws result in
successful Commission enforcement actions, and prohibits employers from
retaliating against individuals in the terms and conditions of their employment
when they engage in certain specified whistleblowing activities. (The award
program and anti-retaliation protections are referred to collectively herein as “the
whistleblower program.”)

Case: 14-2734

Document: 003111817814

Page: 13

Date Filed: 12/11/2014

In May 2011, at Congress’s direction, the Commission issued final rules
“implementing the provisions of Section 21F.” See Dodd-Frank §924(a), 124 Stat.
at 1850. Throughout the rulemaking process, the Commission considered the
“significant issue” of how to ensure that the whistleblower program does not
undermine the willingness of individuals to make whistleblower reports internally
at their companies before they make reports to the Commission. Securities
Whistleblower Incentives and Protections (“Adopting Release”), 76 Fed. Reg.
34300, 34300, 34323 (June 13, 2011); Proposed Rules for Implementing the
Whistleblower Provisions of Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Proposing Release”), 75 Fed. Reg. 70488, 70488 (Nov. 17, 2010). The
Commission’s final rules were carefully calibrated to achieve this objective by
providing “strong incentives” for individuals in appropriate circumstances to report
internally in the first instance. Adopting Release at 34301, 34322. 1

1

The Commission recognized that internal reporting is not always
appropriate, and the decision whether to do so (either prior to reporting to the
Commission or at all) is best left for whistleblowers to determine based on the
particular facts and circumstances. See Adopting Release at 34327. Among the
considerations a whistleblower would likely consider are: (i) whether the
employer has an anonymous reporting system; (ii) whether the potential
misconduct involves upper-level management; (iii) whether the misconduct is still
ongoing and poses a risk of sufficiently significant harm to investors that
immediate reporting to the Commission is more appropriate; and (iv) whether the
employer may be prone to bad faith conduct such as the destruction of evidence.

One of those rules—Exchange Act Rule 21F-2(b)(1), 17 C.F.R. §240.21F2(b)(1)—is at issue in this litigation. 2 The Commission has a strong programmatic
interest in demonstrating that the rule’s reasonable interpretation of certain
ambiguous statutory language was a valid exercise of the Commission’s broad
rulemaking authority under Section 21F. This interest arises for two related
reasons. First, the rule helps protect individuals who choose to report potential
violations internally in the first instance (i.e., before reporting to the Commission),
and thus is an important component of the overall design of the whistleblower
program. Second, if the rule were invalidated, the Commission’s authority to
pursue enforcement actions against employers that retaliate against individuals
who report internally would be substantially weakened.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
A.

The securities laws recognize that internal company reporting by
employees and others is important for deterring, detecting, and
stopping unlawful conduct that may harm investors.
Companies’ processes for the internal reporting of violations of law and

other misconduct “play an important role in facilitating compliance with the
securities laws.” Adopting Release at 34325; accord id. at 34324. Among other
things, these internal reporting processes can help companies to promptly identify,
correct, and self-report unlawful conduct by officers, employees, or others
2

Each rule designated in this brief as Exchange Act Rule 21F-___ is codified
at 17 C.F.R. §240.21F-___.

connected to the company. See generally Proposing Release at 70496. In this
way, “reporting through internal compliance procedures can complement or
otherwise appreciably enhance [the Commission’s] enforcement efforts … .”
Adopting Release at 34359 n.450; see also Report of Investigation Pursuant to

Recognizing the significant role that internal company reporting can play,
Congress for nearly two decades has enacted a series of amendments to the
securities laws to encourage, and in some instances to require, internal reporting of
potential misconduct. In 1995, Congress amended the Exchange Act to add
Section 10A(b), entitled “Required Response to Audit Discoveries.” See Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-67, §301, 109 Stat. 737,
762-64. Section 10A(b) imposes a series of internal company disclosure
obligations on a registered public accounting firm that, during the course of

programs are valuable, they are not substitutes for strong law enforcement.”

conducting an audit of a public company required by the Exchange Act, discovers
that an illegal act connected to the company has occurred. 4 Section 10A(b)
describes a process of disclosure by the auditor to the Commission after the
auditor’s internal disclosures occur and certain other conditions are met, including
a failure on the company’s part to take an appropriate response. 5
In 2002, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SarbanesOxley”), Pub. L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745, in response to “a series of celebrated
accounting debacles” 6 involving companies such as Enron and WorldCom. As
part of Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress enacted several additional provisions related to
the internal company reporting of wrongdoing. 7 In Section 307, for example,

This brief uses the term “public company” to refer to a company with a class
of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and those required to
file reports under Section 15(d) of that Act.

An early version of the legislative proposal that became Section 10A would
have required auditors to report immediately to the Commission. SEC Chairman
John Shad testified before Congress at the time in opposition to such a reporting
requirement. See SEC and Corporate Audits (Part 6): Hearings on Detecting and
Disclosing Financial Fraud Before Subcomm. on Oversight and Investigations of
the Comm. on Energy and Commerce, 99th Cong. 345 (1986) (“[W]hy not give
management an opportunity to respond to suspicions and take corrective action?”).

A principal aim of Sarbanes-Oxley was to promote the establishment of
robust internal corporate governance mechanisms and processes that could
promptly identify and remedy violations. See, e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley §404, 15

Congress directed the Commission to issue rules requiring attorneys appearing and
practicing before the Commission in the representation of public companies “to
report evidence of a material violation” of the securities laws or any “breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the company or any agent thereof” to
specified company officials. Sarbanes-Oxley §307, 15 U.S.C. §7245. These
attorneys are not required to make reports to the Commission and, indeed, may
often be precluded from doing so as a result of their ethical obligations to their
clients.8 Similarly, Sarbanes-Oxley added Exchange Act Section 10A(m)(4),
which required the Commission, by rule, to direct that national securities
exchanges and national securities associations require that audit committees of
listed companies establish internal company procedures allowing employees and
others to submit complaints “regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or
auditing matters,” and to report anonymously “concerns regarding questionable

U.S.C. §7262 (requiring internal compliance systems and an annual audit by
outside auditors).

Only in limited situations—where an attorney reasonably believes it is
“necessary” to report to the Commission to prevent a securities law violation that
will cause substantial financial injury, or to correct past violations of similar
severity where the attorney’s services were used—may attorneys report evidence
of a material violation to the Commission. 17 C.F.R. §205.3(d)(2). But even when
such disclosure to the Commission is permitted, an attorney will typically need to
report internally first in order to satisfy the requirement that disclosure to the
Commission may be necessary.

accounting or auditing matters.” See Sarbanes-Oxley §301, 116 Stat. at 775-77; 17
C.F.R. §240.10A-3(b)(3).
Further, Section 806 of Sarbanes-Oxley (as later amended by Dodd-Frank)
prohibited public companies, certain related persons or entities, and nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations from engaging in employment retaliation
against an employee who makes certain whistleblower disclosures concerning,
among other things, securities fraud (18 U.S.C. §1348), bank fraud (id. §1344),
mail fraud (id. §1341), wire fraud (id. §1343), or any violation of a Commission
rule or regulation. 18 U.S.C. §1514A(a). The whistleblower disclosures are
protected if they are made to “a person with supervisory authority over the
employee (or such other person working for the employer who has the authority to
investigate, discover, or terminate misconduct),” or to Congress or certain
governmental agencies (including the Commission). Id. §1514A(a)(1)(C).9

The Commission has periodically adopted rules and regulations requiring
internal reporting in certain circumstances either within or among regulated
entities. See, e.g., 17 C.F.R. §270.38a-1(a)(4) (requiring the chief compliance
officer of a mutual fund to report the details of any material compliance matters to
the fund’s board); 17 C.F.R. §240.17a-5(h)(2) (requiring the auditor of a brokerdealer to report material inadequacies to the chief financial officer);17 C.F.R.
§275.204A-1(a)(4) (requiring each investment adviser to establish a code of ethics
requiring supervised persons to report any violations thereof to the chief
compliance officer); 17 C.F.R. §275.206(4)-2(a)(6)(ii) (requiring each investment
adviser to obtain an internal control report with respect to custody of client assets
maintained by the investment adviser or an affiliate).

By providing new incentives and protections for individuals to engage in
whistleblowing activity, the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program
enhances the existing securities-law enforcement scheme, including
internal company reporting.
As noted above, Dodd-Frank established the Commission’s new

whistleblower program in 2010 by adding Section 21F to the Exchange Act.
Section 21F expressly authorized the Commission “to issue such rules and
regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of this
section consistent with the purposes of this section.” Exchange Act §21F(j). In
May 2011, the Commission used that broad authority to adopt final rules
implementing both the monetary award and employment anti-retaliation aspects of
the whistleblower program.
1.

The Commission carefully calibrated the rules implementing the
monetary award component of the whistleblower program to
ensure that individuals were not disincentivized from first
reporting internally.

Section 21F directs the Commission to pay awards, subject to certain
limitations and conditions, to individuals who voluntarily provide the Commission
with original information about a violation of the securities laws that leads to the
successful enforcement of an action brought by the Commission resulting in
monetary sanctions exceeding $1,000,000. See Exchange Act §21F(a)-(c).
Further, Section 21F affords the Commission discretion to set the amount of each
award within a range of 10% to 30% of the total monetary sanctions collected. Id.

A principal challenge the Commission faced in crafting rules to implement
the award program was ensuring that employees and others were not dissuaded
from reporting internally due to the possibility of a monetary award. See
Proposing Release at 70488 (expressing the Commission’s desire “not to
discourage whistleblowers who work for companies that have robust compliance
programs [from] first report[ing] the violation to appropriate company personnel”)
(emphasis added). Were this to happen, the Commission recognized, the result
could be a reduction in the “effectiveness of a company’s existing compliance,
legal, audit and similar internal processes for investigating and responding to
potential violations of the Federal securities laws,” which in turn could weaken
corporate compliance with the securities laws. Id. at 70488.10 The Commission
also recognized that “reporting through internal compliance procedures can
complement or otherwise appreciably enhance [its] enforcement efforts in
appropriate circumstances.” Adopting Release at 34359 n.450.
For instance, the subject company may at times be better able to
distinguish between meritorious and frivolous claims, and may make
such findings available for the Commission. This would be
particularly true in instances where the reported matter entails a high

Cf. Proposing Release at 70516 (explaining that “allow[ing] a company a
reasonable period of time to investigate and respond to potential securities laws
violations (or at least begin an investigation) prior to [an individual making a
report] to the Commission” is “consistent with the Commission’s efforts to
encourage companies to create and implement strong corporate compliance
programs”).

level of institutional or company-specific knowledge and/or the
company has a well-functioning internal compliance program in
place. Screening allegations through internal compliance programs
may limit false or frivolous claims, provide the entity an opportunity
to resolve the violation and report the result to the Commission, and
allow the Commission to use its resources more efficiently.
Id. 11
Accordingly, the Commission “tailored the final rules to provide
whistleblowers who are otherwise pre-disposed to report internally, but who may
also be affected by financial incentives, with additional economic incentives to
continue to report internally.” Id. at 34360. The final rules seek to do this in three
principal ways:
 An individual “who reports internally can collect a whistleblower
award from the Commission if his internal report to the company or
entity results in a successful covered action.” Id. (discussing
Exchange Act Rule 21F-4(c)(3)).
 An individual “who first reports [pursuant] to an entity’s internal
whistleblower, legal, or compliance procedures for reporting
allegations of possible violations of law and within 120 days reports
to the Commission” will be treated for purposes of an award as “if
[the submission to the Commission] had been made at the earlier
internal reporting date.” Id. at 34322 (emphasis added) (discussing
Exchange Act Rule 21F-4(b)(7)). “This means that even if, in the
interim, another whistleblower has made a submission that caused the
[Commission’s] staff to begin an investigation into the same matter,

11

See also Proposing Release at 70516 (explaining that allowing individuals to
first report internally “provides a mechanism by which some of th[e] erroneous
[tips] may be eliminated before reaching the Commission,” and that otherwise “a
large number of tips of varying quality [could] caus[e] the Commission to incur
costs to process and validate the information”).

the [individual] who had first reported internally will be considered
the first whistleblower who came to the Commission … .” Id.
 “In addition, the final rules provide that when determining the amount
of an award, the Commission will consider as a plus-factor the
whistleblower’s participation in an entity’s internal compliance
procedures.” Id. at 34360 (discussing Exchange Act Rule 21F6(a)(4)).12 The ability to adjust an award upward based on internal
reporting, the Commission explained, would “allow [the Commission]
to account for a reduced monetary sanction … where the internal
reporting potentially resulted in a lower monetary sanction” because
the company responded to the internal report by engaging in
remediation, self-reporting and cooperating with the Commission. Id.
at 34360 n.455.
Beyond the tailored financial incentives that the Commission crafted
to encourage individuals to report internally in appropriate situations, the
final rules also require that officers, directors, trustees, and partners, as well
as other specified personnel having internal audit or compliance
responsibilities, must in certain instances first internally disclose the
information about potential securities law violations and then wait 120 days
before reporting the information to the Commission. See Exchange Act
Rule 21F-4(b)(4). The Commission determined that this restriction was
necessary to discourage “whistleblower submission[s] [that] might
undermine the proper operation of internal compliance systems” that

Relatedly, the Commission’s rules also provide that “a whistleblower’s
interference with internal compliance and reporting is a factor that can decrease the
amount of an award.” Adopting Release at 34301, 34331 (discussing Exchange

Release at 34317.
2.

Using its broad rulemaking authority, the Commission adopted a
rule clarifying that employment retaliation is prohibited against
individuals who engage in any of the whistleblowing activity
described in Section 21F(h)(1)(A)(iii)—including making internal
reports at public companies of securities fraud violations.

Section 21F(h)(1) is designed to protect employees who engage in certain
specified whistleblowing activities. It does this in two significant ways.
First, subparagraph (A) seeks to prevent employment retaliation by placing
employers on notice that they may not retaliate against employees who engage in
certain whistleblowing activity. This is clear from the express terms of the
subparagraph, which is drafted as a prohibition directed to employers:
(A)

In General. No employer may discharge, demote, suspend,
threaten, harass, directly or indirectly, or in any other manner
discriminate against, a whistleblower in the terms and
conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by
the whistleblower—
(i)

in providing information to the Commission in
accordance with this section;

(ii)

in initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investigation
or judicial or administrative action of the Commission
based upon or related to such information; or

(iii)

in making disclosures that are required or protected under
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.),
this chapter [i.e., the Exchange Act], including section
78j-1(m) of this title [i.e., Section 10A(m) of the
Exchange Act], section 1513(e) of Title 18, and any other
13

Case: 14-2734

law, rule, or regulation subject to the jurisdiction of the
Commission.13
Second, subparagraphs (B) and (C) address the legal remedies that employees can
pursue against employers who have failed to heed subparagraph (A)’s
prohibition.14
The Commission, employing its broad rulemaking authority under Section
21F, adopted two clarifying rules related to the prohibition in subparagraph (A).
The first rule expressly stated that the Commission possesses authority to bring
civil enforcement actions and proceedings against employers who violate the
retaliation prohibition. See Exchange Act Rule 21F-2(b)(2).
The second rule, Exchange Act Rule 21F-2(b)(1), clarified that the
retaliation prohibition in subparagraph (A) protects any employee who engages in
any of the whistleblowing activities specified in clauses (i)-(iii) above, irrespective
of whether the employee separately reports the information to the Commission. It
provides in pertinent part:

13

As discussed infra 19-20, the disclosures listed in clause (iii) include the
internal company reporting disclosures described above in Part A.

14

Subparagraph (B) provides a cause of action in federal district court for any
“individual who alleges discharge or other discrimination in violation of
subparagraph (A).” Exchange Act §21F(h)(1)(B)(i). Subparagraph (C) provides
that relief in a successful action shall include reinstatement, two times back pay,
compensation for litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorneys’
fees. Id. §21F(h)(1)(C).
14

Case: 14-2734

For purposes of the anti-retaliation protections afforded by Section
21F(h)(1) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78u-6(h)(1)), you are a
whistleblower if:
(ii)

You provide that information in a manner described in Section
21F(h)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78u-6(h)(1)(A)).

17 C.F.R. §240.21F-2(b)(1)(ii).
As the Commission explained in the adopting release, this rule reflects the
fact that clause (iii) prohibits employers from retaliating against “individuals who
report to persons or governmental authorities other than the Commission.”
Adopting Release at 34304 (emphasis in original). In particular, clause (iii)
prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who make the “disclosures
that are required or protected under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act” or the other securities
laws, including the internal company disclosures described above in Part A. For
example:
 Disclosures that Sarbanes-Oxley Section 307 requires attorneys for
the public company to make to the company’s general counsel
regarding potential evidence of a material violation of the securities
laws or a breach of fiduciary duty by a corporate director;
 Disclosures to an audit committee pursuant to Section 10A(m) of the
Exchange Act concerning “questionable accounting or auditing
matters” at a public company; and
 Disclosures protected under Sarbanes-Oxley Section 806 to a
supervisor or compliance official at a public company concerning
possible securities fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, or mail fraud.

Significantly, by clarifying that the prohibition on employment
retaliation extends to individuals who report internally in instances such as
these (irrespective of whether they have reported to the Commission), Rule
21F-2(b)(1) complements the overall goal of the whistleblower program
rulemaking to maintain incentives for individuals to first report internally in
appropriate circumstances. In the adopting release, the Commission
recognized that the prohibition on employment retaliation would help
preserve these incentives for internal reporting, since “[e]mployees who
report internally in this manner will have anti-retaliation employment
protection to the extent provided for by [Section 21F(h)(1)(A)(iii)], which
incorporates the broad anti-retaliation protections of Sarbanes-Oxley Section
806.” Adopting Release at 34325 n.223. See generally Orly Lobel,
Lawyering Loyalties: Speech Rights and Duties Within Twenty-FirstCentury New Governance, 77 FORDHAM L. REV. 1245, 1250 (2009)

that … employees are more likely to choose internal reporting systems.”).
STANDARD OF REVIEW
“An agency’s construction of its statutory mandate is entitled to a certain
degree of deference.” West v. Sullivan, 973 F.2d 179, 185 (3d Cir. 1992). See also
United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2001) (“administrative

implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for Chevron deference
when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make
rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming
deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority”). Consideration of
whether an agency interpretation is permissible involves two steps. First, this
Court considers “‘whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at
issue,’” and if so, then “the clear intent of Congress binds both the agency and the
court.” Hagans v. Comm’r of Social Sec., 694 F.3d 287, 294 (3d Cir. 2012)
(quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842). A “fundamental ambiguity” arises where two
statutory provisions present “seemingly categorical—and, at first glance,
irreconcilable—legislative commands,” thereby affording the agency discretion to
“harmonize[]” the provisions. Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. Defenders of
Wildlife, 551 U.S. 644, 661-73 (2007); accord Cheruku v. Att’y Gen., 662 F.3d
198, 203-07 (3d Cir. 2011) (where “straightforward application of [one provision]
would render [another provision] a nullity,” statutory scheme was ambiguous and
agency’s reasonable interpretation was entitled to Chevron deference).
Second, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,
this Court determines whether the agency’s interpretation is reasonable, which
means the interpretation is rational and not inconsistent with the statute. See, e.g.,
Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U.S. 83, 89 (1990); Hagans, 694 F.3d at 294. “The

agency’s interpretation will prevail so long as ‘it is a reasonable interpretation of
the statute—not necessarily the only possible interpretation, nor even the
interpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts.’” Hagans, 694 F.3d at 294
(quoting Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc., 556 U.S. 208, 218 (2009)).
ARGUMENT
I.

Section 21F does not unambiguously demonstrate a Congressional
intent to restrict employment anti-retaliation protection to only those
individuals who provide the Commission with information relating to a
violation of the securities laws.
Congress did not unambiguously limit the employment anti-retaliation

protections in Section 21F(h)(1) to only those individuals who provide the
Commission with information relating to a securities law violation. Rather, there
is ambiguity on this issue given the considerable tension between clause (iii) of
Section 21F(h)(1)(A), which as discussed above lists a broad array of
whistleblowing activity to entities and persons other than just the Commission, and
Section 21F(a)(6), which defines “whistleblower.”
To appreciate the significant tension between these two provisions, it is
useful to first examine the language and structure of Section 21F(h)(1)(A). As
quoted in full supra 13-14, Section 21F(h)(1)(A) prohibits an employer from
retaliating against a whistleblower: (i) for “providing information to the
Commission in accordance with this section”; (ii) for assisting in an investigation
or action of the Commission “based upon or related to such information”; or (iii)
18

Case: 14-2734

Document: 003111817814

Page: 29

Date Filed: 12/11/2014

for “making disclosures that are required or protected under” Sarbanes-Oxley, the
Exchange Act, 18 U.S.C. §1513(e), “and any other law, rule, or regulation subject
to the jurisdiction of the Commission.”
As the quoted language makes evident, clauses (i) and (ii), together, protect
individuals for whistleblowing to the Commission about securities law violations.
But the anti-retaliation protection that clause (iii) affords reaches beyond just
disclosures involving securities law violations and disclosures to the Commission.
It covers, among other things, an employee’s submission to a public company’s
audit committee about questionable accounting practices (including those
questionable practices that do not rise to the level of a securities law violation)
under Section 10A(m)(4) of the Exchange Act, or an in-house counsel’s disclosure
under Section 307 of Sarbanes-Oxley about a potential breach of the CEO’s
fiduciary duty. 15

15

The legislative history adds no clarity concerning Congress’s intention in
adding clause (iii) to Section 21F(h)(1)(A). Indeed, the provision was added
relatively late in the Dodd-Frank legislative process; it was not included either in
the original version of the bill that passed the House, see H.R. 4173, 111th Cong.
§7203(a) (as passed Dec. 11, 2009), or in the version that initially passed the
Senate, see H.R. 4173, 111th Cong. §922(a) (as passed May 20, 2010). The
language first appeared in the base conference committee draft that the Senate in
May 2010 approved for use in the Dodd-Frank conference committee, see H.R.
4173, 111th Cong. §922(a) (conference base text), and it remained in the final
version of the committee bill that the House and Senate subsequently approved.
Notably, the nearly identical statutory provision of Dodd-Frank that authorized a
whistleblower program for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission does not
include language comparable to clause (iii). See Dodd-Frank §748, 124 Stat. at
19

Case: 14-2734

Yet, the interplay of Section 21F(h)(1)(A) with the definition of
“whistleblower” in Section 21F(a)(6) may suggest a different result. Section
21F(h)(1)(A) protects “a whistleblower in the terms and conditions of
employment,” and Section 21F(a)(6) in turn defines a “whistleblower” as “any
individual who provides … information relating to a violation of the securities law
to the Commission.” If Section 21F(a)(6)’s narrow whistleblower definition is
read as a limitation on the overall scope of Section 21F(h)(1)(A), the disclosures
protected under clause (iii) would be significantly restricted. Specifically, an
individual would be protected for making one of the whistleblower disclosures
identified in clause (iii) only if two preconditions are met:
(1)

the individual has separately submitted that same information to
Commission, and

(2)

that information involves a securities law violation.

But this reading raises an immediate question: If Congress had actually
intended to protect only those “required or protected” disclosures that satisfy these
two conditions, why would Congress craft clause (iii) to unnecessarily suggest that
it protects a much broader class of disclosures than it actually does? Surely
Congress could have been more explicit and more direct if it in fact intended to
protect only those disclosures that involve securities law violations, and only if the

1743-44 (enacting employment anti-retaliation protections as new Section 23(h)(1)
to the Commodity Exchange Act, codified at 7 U.S.C. §26(h)(1)).
20

Case: 14-2734

employee has made a separate disclosure to the Commission. See Util. Air
Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427, 2441 (2014) (“[T]he presumption of
consistent usage readily yields to context, and a statutory term—even one defined
in the statute—may take on distinct characters from association with distinct
statutory objects calling for different implementation strategies.”) (quotations
omitted).
That Congress did not unambiguously intend such a result becomes apparent
by considering the bizarre consequences that such a narrow reading produces.
With one possible exception, clause (iii) becomes superfluous. If an employer
knows that an individual has made a disclosure listed in clause (iii), such as an
internal report about a potential securities fraud violation, and the employer is also
aware that the individual has provided the same information to the Commission,
then as a practical matter the individual will be protected from retaliation under
clauses (i) and (ii). An employer will not be able to disaggregate the
whistleblowing to the Commission from the internal whistleblowing so as
persuasively to claim that any retaliation was solely in connection with the latter.
Thus, where an employer knows that an individual has reported to the
Commission, clauses (i) and (ii) would already sufficiently protect the individual
from retaliation should the individual also wish to make the disclosures specified
in clause (iii).
21

Case: 14-2734

Page: 32

Date Filed: 12/11/2014

That leaves only one situation where clause (iii) might conceivably have
independent utility—where the employer, unaware that the individual had already
reported to the Commission, takes an adverse employment action against the
employee for a disclosure listed in clause (iii). Although the Fifth Circuit has
reasoned that this potential scenario saves clause (iii) from being superfluous under
the narrow reading of Section 21F(h)(1)’s employment anti-retaliation protection,
Asadi v. G.E. Energy (U.S.A.), L.L.C., 720 F.3d 620, 627-28 (5th Cir. 2013), that is
far from clear for two reasons. First, as discussed above, subparagraph (A)
principally operates as a prohibition directed to employers; it seeks to prevent
retaliation by placing employers on notice that they may not take adverse
employment action against employees who engage in certain whistleblowing
activity. But under the scenario posited by the Asadi court, clause (iii) would be
utterly ineffective as a preventive measure. Put simply, because in this scenario
employers would not know that a report was made to the Commission, clause (iii)
would have no appreciable effect in deterring employers from taking adverse
employment action for internal reports or the other disclosures listed in clause (iii).
Second, it is unlikely that an employee who suffers an adverse employment
action in this situation could even rely on clause (iii) to successfully pursue a
private action against the employer under Section 21F(h)(1)(B). Whether an
individual’s disclosures constitute a “protected activity” under the Fifth Circuit’s
22

Case: 14-2734

Document: 003111817814

narrow reading of clause (iii) would turn on whether the individual has made a
separate disclosure to the Commission. But if an employer is genuinely unaware
that the employee has separately disclosed to the Commission, any adverse
employment action that the employer takes would appear to lack the requisite
retaliatory intent—i.e., the intent to punish the employee for engaging in a
protected activity. 16 Cf. Hutchins v. Wilentz, Goldman & Spitzer, 253 F.3d 176,
186 (3d Cir. 2001) (for retaliation claim under False Claims Act, “a plaintiff must
show that (1) his employer had knowledge he was engaged in protected conduct;
and (2) that his employer’s retaliation was motivated, at least in part, by the
employee’s engaging in protected conduct”) (quotations omitted).
This examination of the relevant statutory language demonstrates, at a
minimum, considerable tension and inconsistency within the text, thus revealing
that Congress did not unambiguously express an intent to limit the employment
anti-retaliation protections under Section 21F(h)(1) to only those individuals who
report securities law violations to the Commission.

16

As at least one district court has recognized, the alternative would be to
construe the anti-retaliation provision to impose strict liability on an employer (i.e.,
intent would not be an element of a retaliation claim). See Liu v. Siemens, A.G.,
978 F. Supp. 2d 325, 332 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), aff’d on other grounds, 763 F.3d 175
(2d Cir. 2014). But we are aware of no precedent for treating an employment antiretaliation provision as a strict liability scheme.

Although the Fifth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion in Asadi, the
court’s holding that the statutory language compels the narrow reading described
above is based on a flawed understanding of the statutory scheme. The court
approached Section 21F as though its sole purpose is “to require individuals to
report information to the SEC to qualify as a whistleblower.” Asadi, 720 F.3d at
630. But this fails to consider the role that Section 21F occupies within the
broader securities-law framework, particularly the internal reporting processes that
Congress has previously established. As discussed infra Part II, the Commission
reasonably chose to interpret clause (iii) of Section 21F(h)(1)(A) against that
broader framework, construing the statute to afford the same employment antiretaliation protections for individuals regardless of whether they report to the
Commission under the new procedures established by Section 21F or instead make
the disclosures “required or protected” under the other provisions of the securities
laws.
The Fifth Circuit also erroneously believed that its interpretation was
necessary to avoid rendering the private cause of action under Sarbanes-Oxley
Section 806, “for practical purposes, moot.” Asadi, 720 F.3d at 628. The court,
after observing that clause (iii) covers the disclosures protected by Section 806,
reasoned that “[i]t is unlikely … that an individual would choose to raise a
[Sarbanes-Oxley] anti-retaliation claim instead of a Dodd-Frank whistleblower24

Case: 14-2734

Document: 003111817814

protection claim” because: (i) Section 21F provides “for greater monetary
damages because it allows for recovery of two times back pay, whereas [Section
806] provides for only back pay,” and (ii) “the applicable statute of limitations is
substantially longer for Dodd-Frank whistleblower-protection claims.” Id. at 62829.
But the Fifth Circuit ignored at least two countervailing advantages of a
Sarbanes-Oxley Section 806 claim over a Dodd-Frank Section 21F claim:
 For individuals who want to avoid the burdens of pursuing the claim in
court, including potential high litigation costs that they might bear if they
do not prevail, actions under Section 806 may be attractive because the
claims are heard (at least in the first instance) in an administrative forum
at the Department of Labor (“DOL”). Moreover, DOL assumes
responsibility for investigating the retaliation claim and preparing the
evidence for an administrative law judge’s review. 17
 Depending on the nature of the injury, a claim under Section 806 may
afford a greater recovery. Unlike Section 21F, Section 806 provides for
“all relief necessary to make the employee whole” and for “compensation
for any special damages.” 18 U.S.C. §1514A(c)(1) & (c)(2)(C). This
language has been held to authorize compensation for emotional distress
and reputational harm. 18 Thus, individuals who have experienced

17

DOL has delegated to its sub-agency the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (“OSHA”) responsibility for receiving and investigating claims
under Section 806. See generally 29 C.F.R. §1980. If OSHA finds the employee
suffered retaliation, it may order immediate reinstatement. Id. §1980.105.
OSHA’s findings are subject to a de novo hearing before an administrative law
judge and review by DOL’s Administrative Review Board. Id. §§1980.106-110.
18

See Halliburton, Inc. v. Admin. Review Bd., No. 13-60323, 2014 WL
5861790, at *10 (5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2014) (per curiam) (Section 806 “affords
noneconomic compensatory damages”).
25

minimal pay loss, but significant emotional injuries, may find Section
806 actions more attractive.
Finally, the Fifth Circuit expressed concern that any other reading of Section
21F “would read the words ‘to the Commission’ out of the definition of
‘whistleblower’ for purposes of the whistleblower-protection provision.” Asadi,
720 F.3d at 628. But applying the Section 21F(a)(6) definition of whistleblower to
Section 21F(h)(1)(A) makes the phrase “to the Commission” in clause (i) and the
similar reference in clause (ii) superfluous. That either of two competing
interpretations yields superfluous statutory language confirms that Congress did
not speak unambiguously on the issue. See Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P’ship, 131
S. Ct. 2238, 2248 (2011) (“[T]he canon against superfluity assists only where a
competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.”)
(quotation omitted).
II.

In light of the ambiguity here, the Commission adopted a reasonable
interpretation in Rule 21F-2(b)(1) that warrants judicial deference.
By adopting Exchange Act Rule 21F-2(b)(1) to specify what persons are

whistleblowers for purposes of the anti-retaliation provisions, the Commission
revealed its view that Section 21F(h)(1)(A) is best read as an implied exception to
the definition of whistleblower in Section 21F(a)(6). See, e.g., Egan v.
TradingScreen, Inc., No. 10 Civ. 8202, 2011 WL 1672066, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 4,

2011). 19 The Commission thus promulgated Exchange Act Rule 21F-2(b)(1) to
clarify that, “[f]or purposes of the anti-retaliation protections afforded by Section
21F(h)(1) of the Exchange Act, you are a whistleblower if … [y]ou provide that
information in a manner described in Section 21F(h)(1)(A).”
In doing so, the Commission concluded “that the statutory anti-retaliation
protections apply to three different categories of whistleblowers, and the third

category [i.e., clause (iii)] includes individuals who report to persons or
governmental authorities other than the Commission.” Adopting Release at 34304.
The Commission explained that, accordingly, the anti-retaliation protections will
extend to, among others, employees of public companies who make certain
disclosures internally to “a person with supervisory authority over the employee or
such other person working for the employer who has authority to investigate,
discover, or terminate misconduct.” Id.
The Commission’s interpretation is reasonable because it resolves the
statutory ambiguity in a manner that effectuates the broad employment antiretaliation protections that clause (iii) contemplates. The Commission’s
interpretation is also reasonable because, by ensuring that individuals who report
internally first will not be potentially disadvantaged by losing employment antiretaliation protection under Section 21F, it better supports a core overall objective
of the whistleblower rulemaking—avoiding disincentivizing individuals from
reporting internally first in appropriate circumstances. By establishing parity
between individuals who first report to the Commission and those who first report
internally, the Commission’s rule avoids a two-tiered structure of anti-retaliation
protections that might discourage some individuals from first reporting internally
in appropriate circumstances and, thus, jeopardize the benefits that can result from
internal reporting, supra 4-5, 15-16. The Commission’s decision to adopt this
28

Case: 14-2734

Document: 003111817814

Page: 39

interpretation was reasonable in light of its view, based on its experience and
expertise, that if internal compliance and reporting procedures “are not utilized or
working, our system of securities regulation will be less effective.” Proposing
Release at 70500.20
Lastly, the Commission’s interpretation was reasonable because it enhances
the Commission’s ability to bring enforcement actions when employers take
adverse employment actions against employees for reporting securities law
violations internally. A contrary result that narrowly cabined this enforcement
authority to only those situations where the employee has separately reported to the
Commission would significantly weaken the deterrence effect on employers who
might otherwise consider taking an adverse employment action. 21

20

Rule 21F-2(b)(1) also supports the whistleblower program by extending
anti-retaliation protection to individuals who first report to designated authorities
other than the Commission. Section 21F(b) & (c) authorize awards to such
individuals under certain circumstances when their information leads to successful
“related actions” by the other designated authorities. To facilitate this reporting,
the Commission adopted Rule 21F-4(b)(7), under which individuals who first
provide information to a designated authority and then within 120 days submit the
same information to the Commission will be treated as though they reported to the
Commission as of the date of the original report to the designated authority. Rule
21F-2(b)(1) ensures that individuals who follow this reporting approach will not
lose anti-retaliation protection during the period prior to their report to the
Commission.

21

The Commission lacks such authority under Sarbanes-Oxley Section 806.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should defer to the Commission’s rule
and hold that individuals are entitled to employment anti-retaliation protection if
they make any of the disclosures identified in Section 21F(h)(1)(A)(iii) of the
Exchange Act, irrespective of whether they separately report the information to the
Commission.

ORDER

Defendants.

15

Plaintiff Michael D. Peters has sued his former employer, Defendant LifeLock,

16

Inc. (“LifeLock”), for violating the whistleblower provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

17

and the Dodd-Frank Act. Peters has also sued Cristy Schaan (“Schaan”), a former

18

coworker, for defamation. LifeLock moves to dismiss the claim brought under the Dodd-

19

Frank Act and Schaan moves to dismiss the defamation claim. Peters has also moved for

20

judgment on the pleadings regarding one of the counterclaims brought against him by

21

LifeLock. As set out below, Schaan will be dismissed but the Dodd-Frank Act claim and

22

the counterclaim against Peters will be allowed to proceed.

23

BACKGROUND

24

According to his complaint, “Peters is an internationally recognized authority on

25

information technology security.” (Doc. 1 at 2). Sometime prior to 2013, Peters worked

26

at a company now known as Vantiv.

27

circumstances involving Peters and Vantiv entering into a “separation agreement.” (Doc.

28

1 at 6). Peters subsequently obtained a different job in Georgia.

Peters left that position under disputed

1

In 2013, Peters was working in Georgia when he was contacted by a recruiter

2

regarding a position at LifeLock.

Peters pursued the position by submitting an

3

application. In his application, Peters stated he had resigned from Vantiv. (Doc. 1 at 6).

4

After a lengthy interview process, LifeLock offered Peters the position of Chief

5

Information Security Officer (“CISO”). Peters moved to Arizona and started work at

6

LifeLock on July 1, 2013.

7

Upon starting work, Peters displaced Schaan who had been serving as the interim

8

CISO. Schaan had applied for the CISO position but she was passed over in favor of

9

Peters. Schaan allegedly was upset about being passed over and, the same day Peters

10

started work, Schaan decided to conduct “her own private investigation of Peters’ prior

11

employment.” (Doc. 1 at 8). Schaan emailed Kim Jones, an acquaintance who worked at

12

Vantiv, and asked Jones “if he knew anything about Peters.” Jones responded via email

13

the next day. In that email, Jones stated:

14
15

 “Peters was fired from [Vantiv] and that he was walked out of the building
without being allowed to return to his office to retrieve his personal belongings.”

16

 “Peters’s relationship building skills [are] virtually non-existent.”

17

 “Peters has a reputation for being disingenuous in his promotional activities by

18

overstating his accomplishments.”

19

 “Peters engaged in inappropriate actions.”

20

Schaan took no action with Jones’ email at that time.

21

Shortly after starting work at LifeLock, Peters “began an initial risk assessment.”

22

(Doc. 1 at 3). During that assessment, Peters discovered “many instances of illegal and

23

incompetent practices that constituted fraud against LifeLock’s shareholders.” Those

24

instances of fraud included evidence that audits were not done, despite LifeLock

25

representing otherwise, as well as LifeLock “manipulat[ing] the customer alerts sent to its

26

elderly customers.” (Doc. 1 at 4).

27

On July 9, 2013, Peters met with LifeLock’s CFO Chris Power and discussed the

28

initial assessment findings and the areas Peters found concerning. Power took no action.

1

A few days later, Peters met with his direct supervisor, LifeLock’s chief information

2

officer, Rich Stebbins. Again Peters expressed his concerns yet Stebbins did nothing.

3

After these meetings, LifeLock’s “upper management” decided to fire Peters. To do so,

4

the “upper management directed Michelle Deutsch, LifeLock’s in-house special counsel

5

for labor and employment, to try and find grounds to terminate Peters’s employment.”

6

(Doc. 1 at 6). Deutsch contacted Vantiv and “she was incorrectly told that Peters had

7

been fired.” Around this same time, Schaan “discovered that LifeLock was about to fire

8

Peters.” In an attempt to “seal Peters’s fate,” Schaan forwarded Stebbins the email she

9

had received from Jones on July 2, 2013.

10

On July 29, 2013, LifeLock fired Peters. According to LifeLock, Peters was fired

11

because he had “provided false information on his employment application” by claiming

12

he resigned from Vantiv when, in fact, he had been fired. LifeLock also claimed Peters

13

had engaged in inappropriate behavior by “‘hit[ting] upon’ a female employee.” (Doc. 1

14

at 9). Peters alleges these reasons were false and “the real reason for his termination”

15

was that he had “reported to his supervisors about the illegal, fraudulent, and incompetent

16

business practices relating to fraud against shareholders that were occurring at LifeLock.”

17

(Doc. 1 at 9).

18

A few weeks after he was fired, Peters filed complaints against LifeLock with the

19

Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Peters also

20

filed a “whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor under the Sarbanes-

21

Oxley Act.” (Doc. 1 at 6). The Sarbanes-Oxley complaint remained pending for 180

22

days and, in early 2014, Peters filed this suit. The complaint alleges a whistleblower

23

claim under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as a whistleblower claim under the Dodd-

24

Frank Act. The complaint also alleges a defamation claim against Schaan for forwarding

25

the email she received from Jones.

26

Schaan responded to the complaint by seeking dismissal of the defamation claim.

27

LifeLock answered the whistleblower claim under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act but seeks

28

dismissal of the whistleblower claim under the Dodd-Frank Act.

1

Peters’ complaint, LifeLock asserted five counterclaims, including counterclaims for

2

breach of contract and unjust enrichment. According to LifeLock, Peters made “material

3

misrepresentations and omissions regarding his employment history” when he applied for

4

the position with LifeLock. (Doc. 36 at 4). LifeLock relied on those misstatements and

5

omissions when it made him an offer of employment. That offer included a signing

6

bonus of $15,000 that would have to be repaid if Peters was terminated for cause during

7

his first year. Peters received the signing bonus and has refused to repay it despite being

8

terminated after only one month. LifeLock’s breach of contract claim seeks to recover

9

the signing bonus while the unjust enrichment claim “seeks full restitution of all salary

10

and benefits LifeLock paid to Peters prior to the termination of his employment.” (Doc.

11

36 at 3). Peters answered all the counterclaims but now moves for judgment on the

12

pleadings regarding the unjust enrichment claim.
ANALYSIS

13
14

I. Standard for Motion to Dismiss and Judgment on the Pleadings

15

LifeLock and Schaan have filed motions to dismiss and Peters has filed a motion

16

for judgment on the pleadings. The standard for evaluating these motions is the same.

17

United States ex rel. Cafasso v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc., 637 F.3d 1047, 1054 n.4

18

(9th Cir. 2011). Under that standard, a claim must either be dismissed or judgment on the

19

pleadings granted if it is not supported by “sufficient factual matter, accepted as true” to

20

state a “plausible” claim for relief.

21

(quotation omitted). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual

22

content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable

23

for the misconduct alleged.” Id. This does not require “detailed factual allegations” but

24

it does require “more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me

25

accusation.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. This is not a “probability requirement,” but a

26

requirement that the factual allegations show “more than a sheer possibility that a

27

defendant has acted unlawfully.” Id.

Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)

II. Defamation Claim Must be Dismissed

2

The sole basis for Peters’ defamation claim against Schaan is her forwarding of

3

Jones’ email. Schaan argues the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”), 47 U.S.C. §

4

230, prevents her from being held liable for forwarding that email. Schaan is correct.

5

Passed in 1996, the CDA has “been widely and consistently interpreted to confer

6

broad immunity against defamation liability for those who use the Internet to publish

7

information that originated from another source.” Barrett v. Rosenthal, 146 P.3d 510,

8

513 (Cal. 2006). The portion of the CDA conferring that immunity provides “[n]o . . .

9

user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any

10

information provided by another information content provider.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1).

11

Based on the definition in the CDA, there is no question Jones qualified as an

12

“information content provider.” 47 U.S.C. § 23(f)(3) (defining “information content

13

provider” as “any person . . . that is responsible . . . for the creation or development of

14

information”). And while “user” is not defined in the CDA, it “plainly refers to someone

15

who uses something, and the statutory context makes it clear that Congress simply meant

16

someone who uses an interactive computer service.” Barrett, 146 P.3d at 526. In light of

17

this, Schaan was a “user” of an “interactive computer service” when she forwarded

18

Jones’ email. See 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2) (defining “interactive computer service”). Put

19

together, these definitions mean Schaan cannot “be treated as the publisher or speaker” of

20

the information contained in Jones’ email. 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1). And that means

21

Schaan cannot be liable for defamation based on forwarding Jones’ email. See Peagler v.

22

Phoenix Newspapers, Inc., 560 P.2d 1216, 1222 (Ariz. 1977) (individual liable for

23

defamation if she “publishes a false and defamatory communication”) (emphasis added);

24

47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(3) (preempting state law inconsistent with CDA).

25

Peters attempts to avoid this straightforward conclusion by arguing it would

26

frustrate a central purpose of the CDA to read its immunity provision as protecting

27

individuals. (Doc. 28 at 7). But the CDA’s immunity provision explicitly covers any

28

“user of an interactive computer system.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1) (emphasis added).

1

Peters offers no argument that Schaan does not qualify as a “user” as that term is used in

2

the CDA. Therefore, his policy arguments are unconvincing. See United States v.

3

Aerojet Gen. Corp., 606 F.3d 1142, 1151 (9th Cir. 2010) (rejecting policy argument in

4

light of unambiguous statutory language).

5

Peters also argues the CDA immunity provision should not apply because Schaan

6

“instigat[ed]” the defamation and committed a “targeted move” by forwarding the email

7

“to the one person she thought could cause the most harm to Peters.” (Doc. 28 at 9).

8

Peters does not explain how, assuming Schaan’s behavior can be described in these

9

terms, that behavior takes her outside the CDA’s immunity. The CDA’s immunity

10

provision does not carve out exceptions for content “instigat[ed]” by another or content

11

that is forwarded in a “targeted move.” To be clear, under the facts alleged in the

12

complaint, Schaan did not generate any defamatory statements herself when she first

13

contacted Jones. Rather, she solicited an email from Jones and then forwarded that email

14

without adding any defamatory statements of her own. If Schaan had added her own

15

defamatory comments, the situation would be different.1 But she did not. Thus, the CDA

16

immunity provision applies and the defamation claim against Schaan must be dismissed.2

17

III. Dodd-Frank Act Claim is Plausible

18

LifeLock argues Peters cannot pursue a whistleblower claim under the Dodd-

19

Frank Act because he was fired before he made any report to the Securities and Exchange

20

Commission (the “Commission”). LifeLock has Fifth Circuit authority in its favor but

21

many courts have criticized that opinion as adopting an overly restrictive view of the

22

statutory language. Under the reading of the statute adopted by the vast majority of

23

courts, Peters’ internal complaints were sufficient to protect him from retaliatory

24
25
26
27

1

As noted in Barrett, “[a]t some point, active involvement in the creation of a
defamatory Internet posting would expose a defendant to liability as an original source.”
146 P.3d at 527 n.19. But Peters has not alleged Schaan had “active involvement” in
Jones’ email such that she could be deemed the original source of the email.
2

28

Peters asks for leave to amend his complaint against Schaan. (Doc. 28 at 12). If
Peters wishes to amend, he must file a motion to amend accompanied by his proposed
amended pleading establishing a factual basis for avoiding the broad immunity provision.

A. Chevron Analysis

3

Peters has asserted a claim under 15 U.S.C. § 78u-6(h), the provision of the Dodd-

4

Frank Act protecting an employee from adverse employment actions when that employee

5

engages in certain activities. Congress granted the Commission “authority to issue such

6

rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement” this provision.

7

15 U.S.C. § 78u-6(j).

8

providing broad whistleblower protections to employees. 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-2(b).

9

Importantly, that rule states an employee may assert a retaliation claim under the Dodd-

10

Frank Act even if the employee did not make a report to the Commission prior to the

11

adverse employment action. LifeLock argues this rule is contrary to the plain language

12

of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Court should not defer to it.

Pursuant to that authority, the Commission adopted a rule

13

LifeLock’s argument requires application of the familiar two-step framework

14

contained in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837

15

(1984). That framework requires the Court determine, using “the ordinary tools of

16

statutory construction . . . whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at

17

issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well

18

as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” City

19

of Arlington, Tex. V. FCC, 133 S. Ct. 1863, 1868 (2013) (quotation omitted). Only when

20

the statute can be deemed ambiguous must the Court proceed to the second step of

21

determining whether the agency’s interpretation “is based on a permissible construction

22

of the statute.” Id.

23

B. Statute is Ambiguous

24

Determining whether the statute is ambiguous requires the text of the statute be set

25

out in some detail. The Dodd-Frank Act whistleblower provision begins by defining

26

“whistleblower.”

27
28

The term “whistleblower” means any individual who provides
. . . information relating to a violation of the securities laws to
the Commission, in a manner established, by rule or

information; or

28

Upon first reading, there is an oddity when the statutory definition in subsection (a) is
plugged into subsection (h). The statute defines a “whistleblower” as an individual who
directly makes a report to the Commission. But subsection (h)(1)(A) then appears to
ignore the definition in setting out the types of protected activity. Subsection (h)(1)(A)(i)

1

first protects “providing information to the Commission” even though the very definition

2

of “whistleblower” requires the individual provide information to the Commission.

3

Subsection (h)(1)(A)(ii) then broadly protects “initiating, testifying in, or assisting in”

4

Commission-related actions. Again, however, the definition itself would seem to protect

5

such activities. Finally, subsection (h)(1)(A)(iii) protects a “whistleblower” when that

6

individual makes “disclosures that are required or protected under the Sarbanes-Oxley

7

Act of 2002.”

8

statutory definition, but it raises its own set of problems because the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

9

requires and protects a wide variety of disclosures other than reports to the Commission.

10

Thus, an individual can make a disclosure “required or protected under the Sarbanes-

11

Oxley Act” without ever contacting the Commission. The problem, therefore, is how to

12

reconcile the statutory definition of “whistleblower” seemingly requiring a direct report

13

to the Commission with the broader substantive protection set out in (h)(1)(A)(iii).

This last provision does not duplicate the coverage inherent in the

14

This problem has generated conflicting views of the statute. The Fifth Circuit is

15

the only court of appeals to address the issue. In Asadi v. G.E. Engergy (USA), LLC, 720

16

F.3d 620, 626 (5th Cir. 2013), the court held the statutory definition of “whistleblower”

17

and the protection provided in (h)(1)(A)(iii) “do not conflict.” In the Fifth Circuit’s view,

18

the statute’s repeated use of the term “whistleblower,” instead of “individual” or

19

“employee,” is significant.

20

describing the substantive protections, Congress was stressing that only whistleblowers,

21

as defined by the statute, were protected. And under that definition, a report to the

22

Commission before the adverse action is taken is an absolute prerequisite.

Id.

That is, by using the term “whistleblower” when

23

The Fifth Circuit acknowledged its reading raised the possibility that (h)(1)(A)(iii)

24

was “superfluous” in that it would seem to duplicate the protection afforded in

25

(h)(1)(A)(i) and (h)(1)(A)(ii). Id. at 627. But the Fifth Circuit concluded its reading of

26

the statute did not render (h)(1)(A)(iii) superfluous because that section will provide

27

protection “where the employer, unaware that the individual had already reported to the

28

Commission, takes an adverse employment action against the employee for” a disclosure

This construction is not

To start, the Fifth Circuit stressed its reading was necessary to avoid “read[ing] the

9

words ‘to the Commission’ out of the definition of ‘whistleblower’ for purposes” of

10

subsection (h). Id. at 628. In the Fifth Circuit’s view, its reading was the only way to

11

avoid violating the “surplusage canon [requiring] that every word is to be given effect.”

12

Id. The Fifth Circuit did not explain, however, how its reading does not independently

13

violate the surplusage canon.

14

abundantly clear the statutory definition must be plugged into subsection (h). But doing

15

so makes (h)(1)(A)(i) meaningless. That is, combining the statutory definition with

16

(h)(1)(A)(i) results in an employee being protected from adverse employment actions

17

when he “provides . . . information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the

18

Commission,” provided he then “provid[es] information to the Commission.” The Fifth

19

Circuit offered no explanation how this reading was sensible. In fact, the Fifth Circuit

20

simply ignored the surplusage problem its reading created in its attempt to avoid that very

21

problem.

According to the Fifth Circuit, Congress made it

The Fifth Circuit’s approach also makes the Dodd-Frank’s anti-retaliation

23

provision unique from other anti-retaliation provisions by imposing something

24

approaching strict liability for certain adverse employment actions. Under the Fifth

25

Circuit’s approach, an employee engages in “protected activity” under (h)(1)(A)(iii) by

26

doing two things: making a report to the Commission and making another disclosure

27

required or protected by Sarbanes-Oxley. An employee must engage in both activities to

qualify for protection under (h)(1)(A)(iii). But an employer will not always know an

employee has made a report to the Commission. Thus, an employer’s retaliation liability

2

under (h)(1)(A)(iii) will not depend on the employer’s knowledge of protected activity.

3

Instead, it will depend on whether the employee, unbeknownst to the employer, has made

4

a report to the Commission. This would be contrary to other anti-retaliation provisions

5

that require a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment

6

action.3 Cf. Thomas v. City of Beaverton, 379 F.3d 802, 812 n.4 (9th Cir. 2004) (“The

7

employer’s awareness of the protected activity is also important in establishing a causal

8

link.”). It is not sensible to conclude there would be a causal link between an employee’s

9

protected activity and an adverse employment action when the employer is not even

10

aware protected activity occurred.

See Bussing v. COR Clearing, LLC, 2014 WL

11

2111207, at *11 (D. Neb. May 21, 2014) (Fifth Circuit’s interpretation “creates a peculiar

12

standard of liability, in which liability for retaliation only attaches if certain

13

preconditions—of which they are unaware—are satisfied”). At the very least, lowering

14

the standard for retaliation liability in this way would represent a unique approach by

15

Congress and would be contrary to the generally accepted deterrent purpose of anti-

16

retaliation provisions. Stiltner v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 74 F.3d 1473, 1491 (4th Cir.

1996) (Phillips, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting “fundamental

18

purpose” of anti-retaliation provisions is “to impose a general deterrence upon the

19

impulse of employers to retaliate for the exercise of statutory rights.”).

20

Based on these problems, and others, the majority of district courts to address the

21

issue have rejected the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning. For the most part, those courts have not

22

concluded the Dodd-Frank Act is clear. But see Bussing, 2014 WL 2111207, at *11

23

(finding statute unambiguously protects disclosures even absent reporting to the

24

Commission).

Rather, they have simply “concluded that the Dodd-Frank Act’s

LifeLock attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing it is a “red herring.”
(Doc. 29 at 7). According to LifeLock, the “protected conduct” is the employee’s
internal report, provided he has already made a report to the Commission. But that does
not address the issue. The problem remains that, according to the Fifth Circuit, an
employer may be held liable under the anti-retaliation provision even though it does not
know the employee has engaged in the conduct actually protected by the statute (i.e.,
reporting to the Commission).

Therefore, the Court must proceed to the second step of the Chevron

C. The Commission’s Interpretation is Permissible

14

The second step requires the Court determine whether the Commission’s

15

interpretation represents “a permissible construction of the statute.” Chevron, U.S.A.,

16

Inc. v. Nat. Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984). This step

17

requires the Court determine “whether Congress has explicitly instructed the agency to

18

flesh out specific provisions of the general legislation, or has impliedly left to the agency

19

the task of developing standards to carry out the general policy of the statute.” Tovar v.

20

United States Postal Service, 3 F.3d 1271, 1276 (9th Cir. 1993). If Congress explicitly

21

instructed the agency to develop regulations, “a reviewing court must find the agency’s

22

construction permissible unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the

23

statute.” Id. If Congress only impliedly deferred to the agency, “a court must uphold the

24

agency’s construction if it is reasonable.” Id. The latter “reasonableness standard affords

25

agencies less latitude than the arbitrary and capricious standard.” McLean v. Crabtree,

26

173 F.3d 1176, 1181 (9th Cir. 1999). But even the reasonableness standard does not

27

require the agency’s construction be the only possible construction or the one the Court

would reach on its own. Id.

The Dodd-Frank Act explicitly instructs the Commission “to issue such rules and

2

regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement” the whistleblower

3

provisions. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-6(j). This may qualify as an “explicit” statement such that

the Commission’s rule is subject to review under the arbitrary and capricious standard.

The Commission’s rule reads the statute as providing protection to employees who

12

make only internal reports. Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protections, 76 Fed

13

Reg. 34300-01 (June 13, 2011) (“[T]he statutory anti-retaliation protections apply to

14

three different categories of whistleblowers, and the third category includes individuals

15

who report to persons or governmental authorities other than the Commission.”). The

16

only argument offered by LifeLock that this is not a permissible construction is that,

17

given the plain language of the statute, the Commission’s rule impermissibly expands the

18

reach of the statute. As set forth above, the plain language of the statute is not clear. In

19

fact, at least one court read the language of the statute as dictating the completely

20

opposite result as that proposed by LifeLock. Bussing, 2014 WL 2111207, at *11

21

(finding protection for internal reports “flows from the statute itself, and it is not

22

necessary to determine if deference to the SEC’s construction of the statute is

23

warranted”). In these circumstances, the Commission’s rule seeking to clarify the reach

24

of the statute is neither arbitrary and capricious nor unreasonable.

25

LifeLock does not contest that if its statutory construction is rejected, Peters has

26

stated a claim under the Dodd-Frank Act. Therefore, LifeLock will be required to answer

27

that claim.

IV. Claim for Unjust Enrichment is Plausible

2

Peters moves for judgment on the pleadings regarding LifeLock’s unjust

3

enrichment counterclaim. That counterclaim seeks to recover the salary and benefits

4

Peters received during his one month of working at LifeLock. Peters’ motion seems to

5

invoke two separate arguments.4 First, that the parties’ contract prevents any resort to

6

unjust enrichment. And second, Peters’ retention of his “salary and benefits” cannot be

7

“unjust” given that he performed services for the month he was employed.

8

arguments are addressed in turn.

These

9

Peters is correct that LifeLock cannot rely on an unjust enrichment claim if “a

10

specific contract . . . governs the [parties’] relationship.” Brooks v. Valley Nat’l Bank,

11

548 P.2d 1166, 1171 (Ariz. 1976). But LifeLock is seeking rescission of the parties’

12

alleged contract. And unjust enrichment is a viable claim when a purported contract is

13

not enforceable. W. Corrections Group, Inc. v. Tierney, 96 P.3d 1070, 1077 (Ariz. Ct.

14

App. 2004) (“Quantum meruit damages are available when services are performed under

15

an unenforceable contract . . . .”). Because the parties do not agree a contract governed

16

their relationship, LifeLock can pursue an unjust enrichment claim. Of course, LifeLock

17

cannot prevail on both its breach of contract and unjust enrichment counterclaims. See

18

Edward Greenbank Enters. Of Ariz. v. Pepper, 538 P.2d 389, 391 (Ariz. 1975) (party

19

may pursue claims for fraudulent inducement and breach of contract but cannot recover

20

on both). But under the facts alleged in LifeLock’s counterclaims, LifeLock can pursue

21

both counterclaims past the pleading stage.

22

Peters is also correct that retention of his “salary and benefits” does not appear

23

“unjust,” a prerequisite to an unjust enrichment claim. Murdock-Bryant Const. Inc. v.

24

Pearson, 703 P.2d 1197, 1203 (Ariz. 1985) (“Restitutionary relief is allowable only when

25
4

26
27
28

Peters also claims the unjust enrichment counterclaim should be dismissed
because it is duplicative of the breach of contract counterclaim. LifeLock’s breach of
contract counterclaim seeks to recover the signing bonus provided to Peters while the
unjust enrichment counterclaim seeks the “salary and benefits” LifeLock paid to Peters
during his employment. Thus, the counterclaims are not duplicative. And even if they
were, such duplication would not be a valid basis for dismissal because under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 8(d), a party may assert claims in the alternative.

Whether LifeLock can recover the salary and benefits paid to Peters raises issues
under Arizona’s law regarding payment of wages. At present, it is unclear how LifeLock
plans on avoiding Arizona law regarding payment and withholding of wages. See, e.g.,
A.R.S. § 23-352 (setting forth exclusive grounds for withholding wages). But that issue
can be addressed through later motion, if appropriate.
