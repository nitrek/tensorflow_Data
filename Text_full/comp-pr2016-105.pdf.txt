SUMMARY
3.

This case involves an ongoing fraudulent scheme perpetrated by

14

defendant Charles C. Liu (‚ÄúLiu‚Äù) and his wife, defendant Xin Wang, a/k/a Lisa Wang

15

(‚ÄúWang‚Äù), to defraud Chinese investors in the federal ‚ÄúEB-5 Immigrant Investor

16

Program,‚Äù which is administered by the United States Citizenship and Immigration

17

Service (‚ÄúUSCIS‚Äù). To date, the defendants have defrauded at least 50 Chinese

18

investors of almost $27 million by falsely claiming that their monies would be

19

invested in a program that met the requirements of the EB-5 program, and would be

20

used to build and operate a proton therapy cancer treatment center in Southern

21

California.

22

4.

The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program was created to stimulate the U.S.

23

economy with capital investment from foreign investors. Under the program, foreign

24

investors can receive a permanent visa to live and work in the U.S. if they make a

25

capital investment that satisfies certain conditions over a two-year period, including

26

the creation of jobs. Under the program‚Äôs regulations, the foreign investors must put

27

‚Äúthe required amount of capital at risk for the purpose of generating a return.‚Äù

28

5.
COMPLAINT

From at least October 2014 to the present, the defendants have offered
2

Case 8:16-cv-00974-CJC-AGR Document 1 Filed 05/26/16 Page 3 of 27 Page ID #:3

1

and sold, and continue to offer, EB-5 investments to Chinese investors, allegedly to

2

fund the development and operation of the cancer treatment center. The investors

3

made their investment in two parts: a $500,000 ‚ÄúCapital Contribution,‚Äù which was to

4

be escrowed for use in developing and operating the center, and a $45,000

5

‚ÄúAdministrative Fee.‚Äù

6

6.

Rather than invest the investors‚Äô Capital Contributions as promised‚Äî

7

and as required for the investors to meet the EB-5 program requirements‚Äîthe

8

defendants misappropriated or diverted approximately $17.4 million from the

9

accounts where the contributions were deposited. Liu misappropriated at least

10

$6,285,000 for himself, and his wife and co-defendant, Wang, misappropriated at

11

least $1,400,000. Liu also transferred over $11,845,000 to three marketing firms in

12

China, including $3,500,000 to a firm of which Wang is CEO and chairman of the

13

board. Liu also allowed most of the Administrative Fees to be used for undisclosed

14

purposes. As a result, the EB-5 eligible cancer treatment center that the defendants

15

represented would be constructed with investor funds has not been built. Liu and

16

Wang have carried out this fraud through a number of entities, three of which are

17

named as defendants.

18

7.

The defendants‚Äô fraud is still ongoing. The majority of the funds

19

dissipated by the defendants were transferred as recently as February and March

20

2016, shortly after the SEC subpoenaed Liu for investigative testimony. Also, the

21

website primarily used to offer the EB-5 investments to Chinese investors remains

22

active, and continues to market and promote the investments in a materially

23

misleading manner.

24

8.

By engaging in this conduct, the defendants have violated, and continue

25

to violate, the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C.

26

¬ß 77q(a), and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78j(b), and Rules 10b-

THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME
A.

The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program
14.

The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program sets aside EB-5 visas for

5

participants who invest in commercial enterprises associated with regional centers

6

approved by USCIS based on proposals for promoting economic growth.

7

15.

Under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, foreign investors who

8

invest capital in a ‚Äúcommercial enterprise‚Äù in the United States may petition the

9

USCIS (called an ‚ÄúI-526 Petition‚Äù) and receive conditional permanent residency

10

status for a two-year period. USCIS defines a ‚Äúcommercial enterprise‚Äù as any for-

11

profit activity formed for the ongoing conduct of lawful business.

12

16.

The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program requires a showing that the

13

foreign investor has placed the required amount of capital at risk for ‚Äúthe purpose of

14

generating a return‚Äù on the capital placed at risk. The foreign investor must invest at

15

least $500,000 in a ‚ÄúTargeted Employment Area‚Äù and thereby create at least ten full-

16

time jobs for United States workers. If the foreign investor satisfies these and other

17

conditions within the two-year period, the foreign investor may apply to have the

18

conditions removed from his or her visa and live and work in the United States

19

permanently.

20

17.

Many EB-5 investments are administered by entities called ‚Äúregional

21

centers.‚Äù EB-5 regional centers are designated by USCIS to administer the EB-5

22

investment projects based on proposals for promoting economic growth.

23

18.

Regional center investment vehicles are typically offered as limited

24

partnership interests or limited liability company units, which are managed by a

25

person or entity other than the foreign investor, who acts as a general partner or

26

managing member of the investment vehicle. To become a regional center, the entity

27

must demonstrate, with supporting economic and statistical studies, how it will

28

promote economic growth, including job creation.

Designation Of Defendant Pacific Proton As A Regional Center
19.

2

On or about November 19, 2010, Liu applied to USCIS, on behalf of

3

Pacific Proton, for its designation as a ‚Äúregional center‚Äù under the EB-5 immigrant

4

investor program.
20.

5
6

Liu reviewed the application before it was submitted to USCIS.
21.

7
8

Liu signed the application on behalf of Pacific Proton as its president.

In the application, Liu made the following representations, among 


others:

(a)

9

Pacific Proton had formed the PPEB5 Fund to serve as the

10

investment vehicle for its first project. EB-5 investors would make their qualifying

11

investment in the PPEB5 Fund, which would then pool the funds and make a loan to

12

Beverly Proton (then known as Los Angeles County Proton Therapy, LLC), to

13

partially finance the development and operation of a proton therapy center and

14

commercial office space.
(b)

15

Beverly Proton would develop and operate an innovative new

16

cancer treatment center using proton beam radiation for treatment of oncology

17

patients in Montebello, California. In addition to the proton therapy center, the

18

building was expected to contain 125,000 square feet of medical office space and

19

ancillary facilities. Beverly Proton would also develop and construct a new 30,000

20

square foot office building in Monterey Park, California, which would contain a

21

restaurant, pharmacy, and radiation therapy office and multiple-use medical office

22

space.
(c)

23

Each investor would be required to invest $500,000 as a ‚ÄúCapital

24

Contribution‚Äù in the PPEB5 Fund and to pay an ‚ÄúAdministrative Fee‚Äù of

25

approximately $45,000 before applying to USCIS for their I-526 petition. Pacific

26

Proton would use an escrow account to hold the foreign investor‚Äôs $500,000 Capital

27

Contribution. Once the escrow agent receives confirmation that the investor‚Äôs I-526

28

Petition was approved, the escrowed funds would be released to the PPEB5 Fund for

1

deployment to Beverly Proton. If USCIS were to deny the I-526 Petition, then the

2

$500,000 Capital Contribution investment would be returned to the investor, together

3

with 50% of the Administrative Fee.
(d)

4

According to an economic report included with the application,

5

the project would ‚Äúcreate an estimated 4,775 permanent new jobs, boost output by

6

$728 million per year, and increase labor (household) income by $217 million per

7

year.‚Äù
(e)

8
9

Pacific Proton and the project would have a ‚Äútransformative

effect‚Äù and ‚Äúa substantial and ongoing economic impact‚Äù on the counties of Los

10

Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino, ‚Äúcreating over 4,500 permanent,

11

full-time jobs and yielding an economic impact of nearly $728 million per year once

12

completed.‚Äù
22.

13

On June 28, 2012, USCIS approved the designation of Pacific Proton as

14

a regional center under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program.

Liu and Wang‚Äôs Roles in the Corporate Defendants
23.

Liu has been the president of the regional center, Pacific Proton, since

2010. Until recently, Liu owned 75% of the membership interests in Pacific Proton.

18

24.

Liu receives $350,000 a year in compensation from Pacific Proton.

19

25.

From about January 19, 2016 to April 4, 2016, Wang was the secretary

20
21

of Pacific Proton. Wang was ‚Äúelected‚Äù to this position by her husband, Liu.
26.

Beverly Proton is the purported job-creating vehicle sponsored by

22

Pacific Proton in connection with Pacific Proton‚Äôs status as a USCIS-approved

23

regional center. It is the entity that is supposed to develop and operate the proton

24

therapy cancer treatment center.

25

27.

Liu co-founded Beverly Proton with Dr. John Thropay, a radiation

26

oncologist. Liu has been Beverly Proton‚Äôs president since 2010, and is its treasurer

27

and managing member. He owns 75% of its membership interests.

28

28.
COMPLAINT

On January 19, 2016, Liu and Wang were elected by Liu as the two sole

1

directors of Beverly Proton. Wang has also been Beverly Proton‚Äôs ‚ÄúVice President in

2

Marketing of Asia [sic]‚Äù since 2011.

3

29.

Liu receives $550,000 a year in compensation from Beverly Proton.

4

30.

On January 28, 2016, Wang entered into an agreement with Beverly

5

Proton pursuant to which she is to receive a $280,000 annual salary from Beverly

6

Proton, going back to 2011. Liu signed the employment agreement with Wang on

7

behalf of Beverly Proton.
31.

8

Once released from escrow, the PPEB5 Fund received the Capital

9

Contributions paid by the investors, and then loaned the pooled Capital Contributions

10

to Beverly Proton. Pacific Proton received the Administrative Fees paid by investors.

11

Liu, through his control of Pacific Proton, is the sole manager of the PPEB5 Fund,

12

and has been its manager since 2010.

13

32.

Liu receives $200,000 a year in compensation from the PPEB5 Fund.

14

33.

During the entire relevant period, up to and including the present, Liu

15

has been the sole signatory on all bank accounts held in the name of each entity

16

defendant, except that Dr. Thropay, was also a signatory on the Beverly Proton

17

account from October 2015 until Liu caused passage of a board resolution on January

18

19, 2016, removing Thropay from the account.

D.

20

The EB-5 Offering
34.

From at least October 1, 2014 to the present, the defendants have offered

21

and sold investments in the form of limited liability company, or ‚ÄúLLC,‚Äù units in the

22

PPEB5 Fund. To date, the defendants have raised at least $26,967,918 from at least

23

50 investors in China.

24

35.

Of that amount, at least $24,712,217 was raised as ‚ÄúCapital

25

Contributions‚Äù through an offering of the LLC units in the PPEB5 Fund. The

26

remainder, or at least $2,255,701, was received by Pacific Proton as required

27

‚ÄúAdministrative Fees.‚Äù

28

36.
COMPLAINT

Liu and the PPEB5 Fund provided offering materials to each investor
8

Case 8:16-cv-00974-CJC-AGR Document 1 Filed 05/26/16 Page 9 of 27 Page ID #:9

1

consisting of: (1) a private offering memorandum (‚ÄúPOM‚Äù) dated May 1, 2013; (2) an

2

Escrow Agreement attached to the POM as Appendix A; (3) an Operating Agreement

3

attached to the POM as Appendix B; and (4) a Subscription Agreement attached to

4

the POM as Appendix C.

5

37.

The POM states that the PPEB5 Fund is offering the LLC units for

6

$500,000 each, and can offer up to 300 LLC units (one per each accredited investor)

7

for a maximum offering of $150 million.

8
9
10
11

38.

The POM further states that each $500,000 investment, or ‚ÄúCapital

Contribution,‚Äù would be held in escrow until notice was given to the PPEB5 Fund
that the investor‚Äôs I-526 Petition had been filed with USCIS.
39.

The POM that was provided to investors differs from the original POM

12

provided to and approved by USCIS in at least two material respects. First, the

13

amount of the offering had been reduced from $193 million to $150 million. Second,

14

the POM provided to investors states that the investor‚Äôs Capital Contribution will be

15

released from escrow when the investor files an I-526 Petition for residency with

16

USCIS, rather than when that application is approved.

17

40.

The POM further states that, once released from escrow, the offering

18

proceeds were to be loaned from the PPEB5 Fund to Beverly Proton to develop and

19

operate a proton therapy center in Los Angeles County under the medical direction of

20

Dr. Thropay. The POM states that Beverly Proton ‚Äúintends to use the proceeds from

21

this Offering to finance development and operation‚Äù of the proton therapy center.

22

41.

Additionally, the POM states that the PPEB5 Fund would charge

23

investors an ‚ÄúAdministrative Fee‚Äù of $45,000 to pay for ‚ÄúOffering Expenses,

24

including legal, accounting and administration expenses, and commissions and fees

25

related to this Offering.‚Äù Investors paid the Administrative Fee directly to Pacific

26

Proton.

27
28

42.

The POM explicitly states that ‚ÄúProceeds of this Offering do not include

Administrative Fees. 	Offering expenses, commissions and fees incurred in

connection with this Offering shall be paid from the proceeds of Administrative Fees

2

and not from EB-5 Capital Contributions.‚Äù

3
4
5

43.

Liu provided the information contained in the POM, and reviewed and

approved it.
44.

The investments in the PPEB5 Fund were securities. In fact, the POM

6

refers to the investments as ‚Äúsecurities,‚Äù even noting that ‚Äúthese securities have not

7

been registered under the Securities Act of 1933‚Äù [capitalized in original].

8
9

45.

The investments in the PPEB5 Fund were investments of money. As set

forth in the POM, each investor was required to invest a minimum of $500,000 as a

10

‚ÄúCapital Contribution‚Äù for one LLC unit. As required by USCIS regulations, the

11

investor‚Äôs investment money must be ‚Äúat risk for the purpose of generating a return

12

on such capital.‚Äù

13

46.

The investments in the PPEB5 Fund were also investments in a common

14

enterprise. The investors‚Äô $500,000 Capital Contributions were pooled together in a

15

single escrow account, and, once released from that account were pooled together in a

16

single account held by the PPEB5 Fund. The PPEB5 Fund, in turn, lent those funds

17

to Beverly Proton in order to develop and operate a proton therapy center. The

18

investor funds were pooled together in a single account held by Beverly Proton.

19

47.

According to the POM, Beverly Proton is to pay the PPEB5 Fund an

20

annual interest payment of 0.25% on the loan (comprised of the investors‚Äô Capital

21

Contributions).

22

48.

Any profits from investments in the PPEB5 Fund were to be derived

23

from the efforts of others. Liu solely manages the PPEB5 Fund; the investors have

24

no management role. The POM further provides that Pacific Proton is the sole

25

manager of the PPEB5 Fund, and that investors will have limited involvement in the

26

management of PPEB5 Fund.

27
28

49.

Additionally, the POM emphasizes that the success of the PPEB5 Fund

and Beverly Proton is principally dependent on current management personnel for

Case 8:16-cv-00974-CJC-AGR Document 1 Filed 05/26/16 Page 11 of 27 Page ID #:11

1

operation of the business. In particular, the POM states that Beverly Proton ‚Äúis

2

dependent upon the continued involvement of Dr. Thropay and Mr. Liu in this Project

3

personally. The loss of services of either Dr. Thropay or Mr. Liu would have a

4

material adverse effect on PPEB5 [Fund]‚Äôs and the Borrower‚Äôs business, financial

5

condition and results of operations.‚Äù
50.

6

The POM further states that Beverly Proton ‚Äúwill be required to hire and

7

retain skilled employees at all levels of operations in a market where such qualified

8

employees are in high demand and are subject to receiving competing offers. The

9

inability to hire needed employees on a timely basis . . . could have a material adverse

10

effect on the ability to meet the schedules of the strategic plan.‚Äù Investors are

11

therefore dependent on the efforts of others to ensure that the venture is profitable.

12

E.

13

The Sales Efforts
51.

Liu retained at least three China-based marketing firms to solicit

14

investors: (a) Overseas Chinese Immigration Consulting Ltd. (‚ÄúOverseas Chinese‚Äù),

15

based in Hong Kong; (b) United Damei Group, United Damei Investment Company,

16

Ltd. and/or Beijing Pacific Damei Consulting Co. Ltd. (collectively, ‚ÄúUDG‚Äù), based

17

in China; and (c) Hong Kong Delsk Business Co., Ltd. (‚ÄúDelsk‚Äù), based in Hong

18

Kong or China.

19

52.

Wang is CEO and chairman of the board of UDG. The UDG website

20

describes Wang in different places as ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù and ‚ÄúChairman‚Äù (as also stated on her

21

business card). It also includes her picture at the top of a group of pictures of the

22

‚ÄúExecutive Team.‚Äù

23
24
25

53.

As alleged below, Oversees Chinese, UDG and Delsk received 


substantial sums of investor funds.

54.

Liu personally participated in the offer and sale of investments in the 


26

PPEB5 Fund to Chinese investors. Liu met investors a number of times at the 


27

proposed site for the proton center in Southern California. 


28

55.

investors and patients at multiple meetings organized in China in 2014 and 2015,

6

including in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Wang was aware when she spoke to

7

potential patients that the Beverly Proton proton therapy cancer treatment center was

8

not completed. Wang also met with investors and answered questions about living in

9

the United States, such as questions about schools, taxes and the real estate market.

In 2015, Liu and Wang attended a meeting about proton therapy in

The Stalled Therapy Center Project
66.

Dr. Thropay owned a medical office building on the site where the

23

proton therapy center was purportedly to be built with PPEB5 Fund investor monies.

24

Liu caused that office building to be demolished in or about mid-2015 but there is

25

presently no construction at that site for the new Beverly Proton treatment center. In

26

fact, no construction permits have been obtained for the project.

27
28

67.

Liu knows that construction for the new therapy center has not begun.

He has personally toured the site, both before and after the demolition of the office

building. Similarly, Wang is aware that construction is not complete.
68.

2

Beverly Proton also paid Optivus approximately $368,100 for Optivus

3

equipment. However, in 2015, Liu decided to purchase radiation therapy equipment

4

from a competing manufacturer. No Optivus equipment was ever delivered to the

5

project. Nor has any equipment from the competitor been delivered to the project

6

site.

7

69.

Furthermore, on March 18 and 22, 2016, respectively, counsel for

8

Optivus and Loma Linda University wrote separate letters to the PPEB5 Fund in care

9

of Liu, protesting the defendants‚Äô continued use of their names, and instructing that

10
11

their names not be used in conjunction with the project.
70.

The Optivus letter stated that Optivus viewed it as ‚Äúhighly

12

inappropriate‚Äù for Pacific Proton and Beverly Proton to suggest that Optivus is

13

involved in the project on an ongoing basis or to use Optivus‚Äô name and reputation

14

for purposes of promoting the proposed facility. It also stated that, to the extent

15

Pacific Proton or Beverly Proton have held themselves out to any investors as

16

affiliated, associated or otherwise endorsed by Optivus, ‚Äúany such representation is

17

false and misleading and must be properly addressed, by (without limitation) the

18

immediate notification to any investors that Optivus has no ongoing involvement‚Äù in

19

the project.

20

71.

Similarly, Loma Linda University stated in its letter that the use of its

21

name, logo and health care services ‚Äúare presented in a manner that is likely to

22

confuse visitors to the [Pacific Proton] website into believing that there is an

23

affiliation or sponsorship between [Pacific Proton/Beverly Proton] on the one hand,

24

and [the University and its medical center] on the other.‚Äù It also states that, to the

25

extent that Pacific Proton or Beverly Proton have held themselves out to investors as

The Removal of Dr. Thropay
72.

Liu has also recently made a series of management changes that 


significantly diminished Dr. Thropay‚Äôs role in the project. 

73.

In late October 2015, Liu entered into a memorandum of understanding

7

with a southern California cancer treatment hospital, to develop a proton therapy

8

center. In connection with this agreement, Liu stated that the hospital would operate

9

the Beverly Proton therapy center and be able to name the center‚Äôs medical director,

10

which appears to have ended Dr. Thropay‚Äôs role as medical director of the treatment

11

facility as set forth in the offering documents.

12

74.

While the hospital had been negotiating a letter of intent with Liu, the

13

negotiations stalled and eventually ceased. Thus, as of now, there is no clearly

14

designated medical director of the proposed proton therapy center.

15

75.

Earlier this year, Liu then reorganized Pacific Proton and Beverly Proton

16

to diminish Dr. Thropay‚Äôs role and interest in those entities. On January 19, 2016,

17

Liu, as the member holding 75% of the membership interests of Pacific Proton,

18

removed Dr. Thropay as an officer of the regional center, and appointed himself

19

president and treasurer/chief financial officer, and appointed Wang secretary. That

20

same day, at the annual meeting for Beverly Proton, Liu, as the member holding 75%

21

of the membership interests, nominated and elected himself and Wang as the sole

22

directors of Beverly Proton, and authorized himself, as managing member, to execute

23

documents, agreements and instruments.

24

76.

On April 4, 2016, after being subpoenaed and providing investigative

25

testimony to the SEC, Liu reorganized the companies again. He purportedly sold

26

50% of Pacific Proton to a former salesperson of a company that sold proton therapy

27

equipment, for $1 per unit. No payments have been made by this person for the

28

purchase of Pacific Proton, however. At that time, the former salesman allegedly
COMPLAINT

15

Case 8:16-cv-00974-CJC-AGR Document 1 Filed 05/26/16 Page 16 of 27 Page ID #:16

1

replaced Liu as Pacific Proton‚Äôs president and treasurer, and Liu replaced Wang as its

2

secretary.

3

77.

In purportedly selling part of Pacific Proton to this former salesman, Liu

4

diluted Dr. Thropay‚Äôs interest in Pacific Proton from 25% to 12.5% by giving the

5

putative purchaser a 50% ownership, Liu a 37.5% ownership, and Dr. Thropay only a

6

12.5% ownership. Before this purported change in ownership structure, Liu owned

7

75% of the membership interests in Pacific Proton.

Delsk‚Äôs Letter to Liu
78.

Delsk understood that they were the exclusive marketing agent in the

10

Chinese region for the Beverly Proton EB-5 project after September 24, 2014, and

11

Liu was aware that Delsk had that understanding.

12

79.

In or after November 3, 2015, Delsk sent Liu a letter expressing its

13

concerns that its exclusive sales agency agreement with Pacific Proton was still valid,

14

and that ‚Äúthe project and all relevant materials provided by Pacific Proton . . . for

15

promotion of EB-5 project in Chinese region must be authentic, timely, complete and

16

comply with the relevant laws and regulations of the United States and China.‚Äù

17

80.

In the letter, Delsk stated that: ‚ÄúDue to the capital structure problem

18

(namely, the absence of equity capital), in [the project],‚Äù in September 2015, Delsk

19

had formally requested that Liu suspend promotional activities for the project in

20

China, ‚Äúwhile we wait for legal proof from you demonstrating that the capital

21

structure problem has been solved,‚Äù and that it met with Liu ‚Äúagain regarding the

22

capital structure of this project on November 3, 2015.‚Äù Delsk concluded by stating,

23

that in its view, the PPEB5 Fund needed to issue a written document to inform all of

24

its investors of, among other things: ‚Äúthe current status of capital raised by [the]

25

project company,‚Äù ‚Äúexplaining the progress of construction,‚Äù and ‚Äú[e]xplaining the

26

status of the capital of all investors (in which account their funds are currently

deposited, and whether the funds have been embezzled or misappropriated).‚Äù

The Misappropriation of Investor Funds
82.

Approximately $24 million in Capital Contributions were raised from

6

the investors, but at least $17.4 million (net of funds returned by Overseas Chinese as

7

alleged below) was not used to develop or construct the proton therapy center, as

8

represented in the POM sent to investors. Instead, these funds were misappropriated

9

by Liu, Wang and the three corporate defendants.

10

83.

Specifically, at least $19,530,000 was diverted to Liu, Wang and the

11

three China-based marketing firms; Overseas Chinese returned $2,060,130 of these

12

funds to the PPEB5 Fund and Beverly Proton. Thus, at least $17,469,870 was

13

misappropriated or otherwise diverted for uses other than those disclosed in the

14

investor disclosures. Most of these funds came from the investors‚Äô Capital

15

Contributions.

16

84.

Liu personally received at least $6,285,000 from the accounts where

17

investor proceeds were deposited. Of that amount, $4,270,000 was transferred to him

18

as recently as February and March 2016, shortly after he was subpoenaed to give

19

investigative testimony to the SEC.

20

85.

Wang personally received at least $1,400,000 from the accounts where

21

investor proceeds were deposited. Of that amount, $996,000 was transferred to her in

22

March 2016.

23

86.

Liu also transferred over $11,845,000 to the three marketing firms in 


24

China (Overseas Chinese, UDG and Delsk) from the accounts where investor 


25

proceeds were deposited.


26
27
28

87.

The three firms also received a substantial amount of the Administrative

Fees paid by the investors.
88.
COMPLAINT

Liu also misused a portion of the Administrative Fees, taking at least

Overseas Chinese Was Paid Over $7.7 Million

Liu knew that, pursuant to an agreement he reviewed, approved and

4

signed on or about March 8, 2013, on behalf of Beverly Proton with Overseas

5

Chinese, Overseas Chinese was being paid $75,000 for each investor it obtained, plus

6

an annual marketing fee of $800,000. The agreement further provided that Overseas

7

Chinese would return all marketing fees plus a $1,000,000 penalty within 36 months

if funds less than $50,000,000 are raised by Overseas Chinese in 36 months.

20

Damei Investment Co. Ltd. and Beijing Pacific Damei Consulting Co. Ltd., which

14

The Defendants‚Äô State of Mind in Carrying Out the Fraud
100. At all relevant times, Liu and Wang knowingly, recklessly and/or

15

negligently engaged in a fraudulent scheme by misappropriating the Capital

16

Contributions and Administrative Fees paid by investors, so that most of these funds

17

have not been used as represented in the POM and other disclosures to investors.

18

101. As president of Pacific Proton and Beverly Proton, and, through Pacific

19

Proton, the sole manager of the PPEB5 Fund, Liu‚Äôs state of mind is imputed to each

20

of these entities.

21

102. Liu understood that the sole source of funds for the offering expenses,

22

including legal, accounting and administrative expenses, and commissions and fees

23

relating to the offering would come from the $45,000 Administrative Fee, paid by

24

each investor, and not the $500,000 Capital Contribution each investor made. He

25

further understood that the Administrative Fee was paid by the investor directly to the

26

regional center, Pacific Proton, and not the investment fund, PPEB5 Fund.

27
28

103. Liu also understood that the investors were investing in the PPEB5
Fund, which then made a loan to Beverly Proton, the purpose of which was to fund
COMPLAINT

19

Case 8:16-cv-00974-CJC-AGR Document 1 Filed 05/26/16 Page 20 of 27 Page ID #:20

1

and develop the project by partially financing construction and operation of a proton

2

therapy center. Liu further understood that all of the investor funds from the PPEB5

3

Fund, consisting of each investor‚Äôs $500,000 Capital Contribution, were to be paid

4

towards this loan.
104. Notwithstanding Liu‚Äôs understanding that the Capital Contributions were

5
6

to be used, according to the POM and other investor disclosures, to develop and

7

operate the therapy center and that commissions and fees relating to the offering were

8

required to be paid from the Administrative Fees and not the Capital Contributions,

9

Liu knew that (a) he and Wang received millions of dollars from the Capital

10

Contributions and Administrative Fees and (b) both Pacific Proton, which received

11

the Administrative Fee, and Beverly Proton, which received the loan consisting of the

12

investors‚Äô Capital Contributions, were paying commissions to the three Chinese

13

firms.

14

105. Also, during the relevant time, Liu was, and is, the signatory on the 


15

relevant bank accounts of the three corporate defendants through which the 


16

misappropriation of investor funds took place. 


17

106. Wang acted negligently, at a minimum, with respect to the misleading

18

UDG website statements. She marketed the proton therapy to investors and patients,

19

and she and her husband received millions of dollars from the project. Given that,

20

and her role at the corporate defendants and UDG, Wang should have known that

21

investor money was being misused, contrary to the claims on UDG‚Äôs website.

22

107. Wang was also UDG‚Äôs CEO and chairman, and thus should have known

23

that its website was materially misleading in the way it touted the success of the

24

project, and did so with photographs and letters of government officials, which Wang

25

understood were used for promotional reasons.

26
27

108. Wang acted at least negligently in obtaining at least $1.4 million of 

investor money by means of these misleading claims.

L.

The Misrepresentations and Omissions

2

109. In addition to their fraudulent scheme, the defendants have made

3

materially false and misleading statements and omissions to the PPEB5 Fund

4

investors, and have obtained investor proceeds by means of these misstatements and

5

omissions.

6

110. As alleged above, the POM states that Capital Contributions from

7

investors would be placed at risk, for the purpose of satisfying the EB-5 program

8

criteria, in order to fund the development and operation of a proton therapy center in

9

Los Angeles, and that the Administrative Fees paid by investors would be used for

10

administrative expenses.

11

111. These representations were materially false and misleading because the

12

majority of the Capital Contributions were not used for that stated purpose. Instead,

13

they were misappropriated by Liu and Wang, and dispersed to the three Chinese

14

firms. In addition, as alleged above, the Administrative Fees were misused.

15

112. Also, even though construction of the treatment center has not even

16

begun, and the investor funds set aside for that construction have largely been

17

misappropriated and dissipated, Liu and the three corporate defendants have omitted,

18

and not disclosed, this material information to investors and potential investors.

19

113. In addition, notwithstanding that the POM states that the project ‚Äúis

20

dependent upon the continued involvement of Dr. Thropay‚Äù and that the ‚Äúloss of

21

services‚Äù of Dr. Thropay ‚Äúwould have a material adverse effect on PPEB5 [Fund]‚Äôs

22

and [Beverly Proton‚Äôs] business, financial condition and results of operations,‚Äù Liu

23

and the three corporate defendants have omitted, and not disclosed to actual and

24

potential investors that Dr. Thropay has been effectively removed from the project

25

and that there is, currently, no medical director.

26

114. At all relevant times, Liu, who is ultimately responsible for the POM and

27

other disclosures to investors, knew, or was reckless and negligent in not knowing,

28

that these representations and omissions were false and misleading. His state of mind
COMPLAINT

21

Case 8:16-cv-00974-CJC-AGR Document 1 Filed 05/26/16 Page 22 of 27 Page ID #:22

1

is imputed to Pacific Proton, Beverly Proton and the PPEB5 Fund, due to his control

2

and/or management of them.
115. In addition, UDG‚Äôs website misleadingly implies that the proton therapy

3
4

project is going well and is a ‚Äúsafe and reliable‚Äù investment.
116. The website also misleadingly implies the project will use the Optivus

5
6

proton therapy technology, including letters touting that specific technology from

7

former President Bush and then-Governor Schwarzenegger, when, in fact, the

8

Beverly Proton project is no longer using that specific technology. Moreover, the

9

website presents these letters as ‚Äúsupport‚Äù for the project, but they are completely

10

unrelated to the Beverly Proton project and are dated before the project was ever

11

formed.

12

117. UDG‚Äôs website was therefore materially misleading because the project

13

has stalled and is not being constructed, the investor proceeds were being dissipated

14

and misused, and the Optivus technology was not being used at the site.
118. At all relevant times, Wang, who is the CEO and chairman of the board

15
16

of UDG, was, and is, at least negligent in not knowing that these misleading

17

representations were and are being made on UDG‚Äôs website to actual and potential

18

investors.

19

M.

The Ongoing Fraud

20

119. UDG‚Äôs website, which markets and promotes the investment in the

21

PPEB5 Fund, is still active and thus continues to promote and encourage investments

22

in the fund.

23

120. Of the at least $17,469,870 misappropriated and dissipated by 


24

defendants, $5,266,000 was diverted from the project as recently as February and 


25

March 2016, shortly after the SEC subpoenaed Liu for investigative testimony. 


26

121. Specifically, in February and March 2016, $4,270,000 was transferred to

27

Liu and $996,000 was transferred to Wang. The overwhelming majority of these

28

funds came from investor Capital Contributions.
