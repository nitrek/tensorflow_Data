UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
BEFORE THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
Release No. 4308; January 8, 2016

ORDER CANCELLING REGISTRATIONS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENT ADVISERS
PURSUANT TO SECTION 203(h) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
The investment advisers whose names appear in the attached Appendix, hereinafter referred
to as the registrants, being registered as investment advisers pursuant to section 203 of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and
On December 2, 2015, a notice of intention to cancel registrations of certain investment
advisers, including the registrants, was issued (Investment Advisers Act Release No. 4285). The
notice gave interested persons an opportunity to request a hearing and stated that an order cancelling
the registrations would be issued unless a hearing was ordered. No request for a hearing has been
filed, and the Commission has not ordered a hearing.
The Commission having found that the registrants are no longer in existence, are not
engaged in business as investment advisers, or are prohibited from registering as investment
advisers under section 203A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; accordingly
IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to section 203(h) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, that
the registration of each of the said registrants be, and hereby is, cancelled.
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated
authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
