KONA JONES BARBERA,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Kona Jones
Barbera (“Respondent” or “Barbera”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commission’s
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the findings contained in
paragraphs III.2 and III.4 below, and consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
1.
Between in or about June 2012 and January 2014, Barbera defrauded investors in
Lustros Inc. (“Lustros”), an issuer with common stock registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act that was subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations pursuant to Section 13(a).

Among other things, Barbera received transaction-based compensation in the form of undisclosed
commissions to solicit investments in Lustros’s securities without being registered with the
Commission as a broker or dealer. Barbera, 36 years old, resides in Venice, Florida.
Respondent participated in an offering of Lustros stock, which was a penny stock.
2.
On January 13, 2016, a final judgment was entered by consent against Respondent,
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,
and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder in the civil action
entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jason Cope et al., Civil Action Number 14 Civ.
7575, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
3.
The Commission’s Amended Complaint alleged that Respondent defrauded
investors by, inter alia, accepting undisclosed commissions to solicit investors to buy Lustros
securities. The Amended Complaint also alleged that Respondent sold unregistered securities and
solicited investors to purchase Lustros securities without being registered with the Commission as
a broker or dealer.
4.
On August 18, 2015, Respondent pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit
securities fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1348, and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1349 before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, in United States v.
Kona Jones Barbera, Crim. Information No. 1:15-cr-287.
5.
The count of the criminal information to which Respondent pled guilty alleged,
inter alia, that Respondent conspired (i) to defraud persons in connection with the securities of an
issuer and to obtain money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses in connection
with the purchase and sale of securities; and (ii) to devise a scheme to defraud investors by
transmitting and causing the transmission by means of wire communications in interstate
commerce writings, signs, signals, and pictures.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Barbera’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act,
that Respondent Barbera be, and hereby is barred from association with any broker, dealer,
investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally
recognized statistical rating organization; and
Pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act Respondent Barbera be, and hereby is
barred from participating in any offering of a penny stock, including: acting as a promoter, finder,
consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for
purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the
purchase or sale of any penny stock.

Any reapplication for association by the Respondent will be subject to the applicable laws
and regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned upon a number of
factors, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of any or all of the following: (a) any
disgorgement ordered against the Respondent, whether or not the Commission has fully or partially
waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration award related to the conduct that served
as the basis for the Commission order; (c) any self-regulatory organization arbitration award to a
customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission order;
and (d) any restitution order by a self-regulatory organization, whether or not related to the conduct
that served as the basis for the Commission order.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
