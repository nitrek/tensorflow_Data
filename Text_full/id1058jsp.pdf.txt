FRANKLIN BANK CORPORATION

INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
September 14, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Delmer D. Raibourn for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of Respondent’s registered securities due to
its failure to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On July 15, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding with an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP
alleges that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g) and is delinquent in its periodic filings. Respondent was served with the OIP by
July 28 and its answer was due August 10, 2016. Franklin Bank Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 4070, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2821 (ALJ Aug. 17, 2016). When Respondent failed to file
an answer, I ordered it to show cause by August 29, 2016, why the registration of its securities
should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise defend the
proceeding. Id. To date, Respondent has not filed an answer, responded to the show cause
order, or otherwise defended this proceeding.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondent is in default for failing to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, I find the allegations in the OIP
to be true and take official notice of Respondent’s filings with the commission. See 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), .323.

Franklin Bank Corporation, Central Index Key No. 1207070, was a savings-and-loan
holding company, incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Houston, Texas. OIP at 1. It
held no significant assets other than ownership interest in its subsidiary, Franklin Bank, S.S.B.
(“the Bank”). Id. The Bank offered a variety of deposit and loan products and retail brokerage
services. Form 8-K (Oct. 1, 2008) Ex.99.1 at 1.
Formed in 2002, Respondent’s common stock was registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and was traded on NASDAQ starting in 2003
under the symbol “FBTX” and later under the symbol “FBTXQ” on OTC Link (previously “Pink
Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. OIP at 1; Form 8-K (filed Oct. 1, 2008) Ex.99.1
at 1. In 2006, Respondent’s preferred stock was traded on the AMEX under the symbol “FBKP.LF”. OIP at 1; Form 8-K (filed Oct. 1, 2008) Ex.99.1 at 1.
On November 7, 2008, the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending closed
the bank, and the FDIC was appointed as its receiver. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Trust Co., N.A. v.
Miller (In re Franklin Bank Corp.), 526 B.R. 527, 530 (Bankr. D. Del. 2014), appeal dismissed,
No. 14-3681 (3d Cir. May 20, 2015); Form 8-K (filed Nov. 12, 2008) at 2. Despite assets of
almost $5 billion at closing, the Bank was a notable casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis,
costing the FDIC’s Depositor Insurance Fund almost $1.5 billion. 1 According to the FDIC’s
material loss review, conducted pursuant to Section 38(k) of the FDIC Act, in the year preceding
the Bank’s closure, its “high-risk business strategy . . . focused on asset growth concentrated in
1-4 family residential and [acquisition, development, and construction] loans[,] . . . left the bank
unprepared and unable to effectively manage operations in a declining economic environment”
and the Bank’s “asset quality deteriorated significantly as the real estate market and economy
slowed.”2 Respondent “commence[d] a voluntary chapter 7 case in Delaware’s Bankruptcy
Court on November 12, 2008” as a result of the Bank’s failure. Bank of N.Y., 526 B.R. at 530.
In Respondent’s final filing with the Commission, it indicated its intent not to appeal the
suspension of the trading and anticipated delisting of its stock on AMEX and NASDAQ. Form
8-K (filed Nov. 12, 2008) at 3. Its bankruptcy closed on December 22, 2015. OIP at 1.
Respondent is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission. OIP at 1.
Respondent has not filed an annual report since it filed a Form 10-K/A on August 31, 2007, for
the period ended December 31, 2006. Id. The last quarterly report Respondent filed was a Form
10-Q on December 20, 2007, for the period ended September 30, 2007. Id. Respondent’s last

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file
annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R.
§§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be
subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act
Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. See SEC v. McNulty, 137
F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978).
Respondent failed to file timely periodic reports and as a result violated Exchange Act Section
13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondent’s failure to file required periodic reports is serious because the failure
constitutes a violation of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). Respondent’s
violation is also recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See Nature’s
Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21,
2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26
(May 23, 2008). Finally, Respondent has not answered the OIP, responded to the show cause
order, or otherwise participated in the proceeding to address whether it has made any efforts to
remedy its past violations. It has also made no assurances against further violations.

For these reasons, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke
the registration of each class of Respondent’s registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registration of each class of registered securities of Respondent Franklin Bank Corporation is
REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Commission Rule of Practice 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of
the initial decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct
a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a
petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a
manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
