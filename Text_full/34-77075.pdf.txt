ORDER DIRECTING TRANSFER OF
REMAINING FUNDS TO THE
UNITED STATES TREASURY

On March 16, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) instituted
settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Joseph Stilwell (“J. Stilwell”) and
Stilwell Value, LLC (“Stilwell Value” and, together with J. Stilwell, “Respondents”), finding that:
(1) Stilwell Value willfully violated Sections 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Rules 206(4)-7 and 206(4)-8 thereunder; and (2) J. Stilwell
willfully violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder,
and willfully aided and abetted and caused Stilwell Value’s violations of Sections 206(4) and 207
of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. See Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order, Rel. Nos. IAA-4049; ICA31504; Admin. Proc. File No. 3-16444 (“Order”).
The Commission ordered, among other things, that Respondents pay disgorgement of
$193,356 and prejudgment interest of $45,801, by depositing the funds into a separate account to be
used for a distribution (the “Distribution”) to affected investors. Respondents were ordered to
submit to the Commission staff a final accounting and certification of the disposition of the
Distribution. Commission staff has submitted the final accounting to the Commission for approval
and, in accordance with the Order, requested Commission approval to send remaining amounts to
the United States Treasury.
Stilwell Value has completed its distributions to affected investors and submitted a
certification and final accounting to the Commission’s staff as required by the Order. The final

accounting shows that Stilwell Value distributed a total of $239,108.55.00 of the total Distribution
amount to 109 investors (i.e., 99.9%), leaving a remaining balance of $48.45. Of that amount,
$47.66 was attributable to a check sent to a former investor at their last known address. That check
has not been cashed and Stilwell Value attempted unsuccessfully to locate the former investor.
The remaining $0.79 is attributable to a check sent to a current investor, who has informed Stilwell
Value that she does not intend to cash the check. Stilwell Value subsequently sent the
undistributed $48.45 to the Commission for transmittal to the United States Treasury, and the
Commission is in possession of that amount. The final accounting, which was submitted to the
Commission for approval as required by Rule 1105(f) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans and as set forth in the Order, is now approved.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the remaining balance of $48.45 shall be transferred to
the United States Treasury.

By the Commission.
