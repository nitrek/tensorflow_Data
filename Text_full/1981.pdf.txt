Regulation of the Securities Markets
Securities MarKets, Facilities and
Trading
The National Market System-During
the past fiscal year, continued progress was
made in the development of a national
market system. Most significantly, the
Commission had the opportunity to observe the first full year of trading pursuant to
Rule 19c-3 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), which precludes the application of off-board trading
restrictions to certain securities that became exchange-listed after April 26, 1979,
and issued its first monitoring report on
trading under that rule. In addition, significant progress was made during the year
in establishing an automated trading link
between the exchange and over-the counter (aTC) markets in securities subject to
Rule 19c-3.
Rule 19c-3 became effective on July 18,
1980.1 Its effect is generally to allow brokerdealers who are members of exchanges to
deal as principal in the aTC market in
securities which became listed on an exchange after April 29, 1979. On August 25,
1981 , the Commission issued its first monitoring report on the operation and effects of
the Rule.2 Among other things, that report
examined the characteristics of trading
under Rule 19c-3, the surveillance of that
trading by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), and the impact, to date, of Rule 19c-3 on market
quality. The report indicated that there had
been limited aTC trading under Rule 19c-3,
and that, while the results of that trading
were inconclusive, the rule did not appear
to be having an adverse effect on the quality
of markets for securities subject to the rule.
The report concluded that a more significant analysis of trading under Rule 19c-3

would have to await implementation of an
automated link between the exchange and
aTC markets for trading securities subject
to Rule 19c-3.
The Cornrnission has frequently attempted, over the past two years, to encourage the industry to voluntarily develop
a linkage between the aTC and exchange
markets. On April 21, 1981, the Commission issued an order which requires establishment of an automated link between
the Intermarket Trading System (ITS), a
trading system operated jointly by certain
national securities exchanqes.' and the
NASD's Computer Assisted Execution System (CAES). The linkage, which will be
applicable to trading in securities subject
to Rule 19c-3, must be in place by March I,
1982.4 In issuing the order, the Com.
mission stated that the interface will permit
market professionals trading in Rule 19c.3
securities to route orders efficiently between exchange and aTC markets, and will
therefore significantly further the goals of
a national market system. At the close of
the fiscal year, the ITS participants and the
NASD were continuing their work in preparation for the interface.
Previously, on February 10, 1981, the
Commission approved the admission of
the Gncinnati Stock Exchange (CSE) to
membership in the ITS and the establishment of a manual link between the CSE's
automated National Securities Trading
System and the ITS.5That interface, as well
as the ITS-NASD linkage, will increase the
opportunities for brokers to secure the best
execution of their customers' orders and
will enhance marketmaker competition
and efficient pricing. In particular, the Commission believes that these two interfaces
are critical to achieving the Commission's
goals of eliminating
"trade-throughs"

(which are orders executed in one market
at a pnce infenor to the quotatJon bemg displayed in another market) and ensunng
nationwide price protection of limit orders
in secunties traded through ITS.
In a further effort to eliminate the adverse
effects of trade-throughs, on April 9, 1981,
the Commission approved proposed rule
changes subrmtted by the ITS participants
which addressed the problems created by
trade-throughs,"
Those rules require ITS
members to avoid mitiating a trade-through
in an ITS eligible security. In the event that
a trade-through with respect to an agency
order does occur, and the aggrieved party
makes a timely complaint, it is the responsibility of the party who initiated the tradethrough to take corrective action 10 accordance with the provisions of the rules.
In addition, by the close of the fiscal year,
the ITS partJcipants had reached agreement, 10 principle, on rules which would
provide price protectJon to limit orders in
securities traded through the ITS. The
Commission expects that those rules will
be Implemented 10 the forthcoming fiscal
year. The Cornrrussion believes that the
trade-through rules and the limit order
protection rules are siqnfficant steps in
achieving the national market system envisioned by Congress 10 the Securities Act
Amendments
of 1975 (1975 Amendments).
The Commissron also took an initial step
toward including certain securitJes traded
solely 10 the OTC market in national market
system facilities. On February 17, 1981, the
Commrssron adopted Rule 11Aa2-1 under
the Exchange Act which provides for the
designatJon of certain secunties traded In
the OTC market as "national market system secunties",? The primary effects of
such designation at the present time are the
requirements that transactions in such
securilJes be reported in a real time system
and that quotations for such sec unties be
firm as to the quoted price and size. Under
the rule, approximately 50 of the most
actively traded OTC stocks will be designated as natJonal market system securitJes

2

on March I, 1982. Approximately 650 additional OTC stocks will be eligible for such
designation, upon application of the Issuer,
beginning on August I, 1982. Following
the adoption of Rule 11Aa2-1, on July 24,
1981, the NASD filed a rule making petition
with the Commission, proposing a number
of amendments
which, among other
things, would increase to approximately
1,450 the number of securities eligible for
designation upon issuer application. In
proposing those amendments, the NASD
indicated that it had concluded that the
designation of national market system
securities will have a substantial and long
lasting Impact on the OTC market. The
NASD also believes such designation, and
the accompanying dissemination of last
sale information, will be highly desired by
many NASDAQ companies. (After the
close of the fiscal year, on October I, 1981,
the Commission published the NASD's
proposals for public comment,"
On February 26, 1981, the Commission
adopted Rule l1Aa3-2 under the Exchange
Act, establishing procedures and requirements for jomt industry plans in connection
with planmng, developing, operating or
regulating a national market system or its
facilities," Rule l1Aa3-2 specifies procedures for filing and amending national
market system plans (including amendments initiated by the Commission) and
establishes certain minimum procedural
and substantive requirements applicable to
such plans.
On February 27, 1981, the Commission
proposed amendments to Rule 11Ac I-I
under the Exchange Act goveming the
collection and disserninanon of quotation
Information." The proposed amendments
would, under certain circumstances, perrmt regional exchange specialists and third
market makers to disseminate quotations
on a voluntary, rather than mandatory
basis. In proposmg the amendments, the
Commission stated Its preliminary belief
that the amendments would eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on secondary market makers and enchance the

accuracy and reliability of quotation information. At the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission was analyzing the comments
received in response to the proposed
amendments to Rule 11Ac I-I, and was
considering further action WIth respect to
it.
Monitoring Commission Rules-As
discussed earlier in this section, the Comrmssion's Directorate of Economic and
Policy Analysis has developed and implemented a program to monitor the operation and effects of Rule 19c-3 under the
Exchange Act,!' (The rule precludes application of off-board tradmg restrictions to
securities which become exchange-listed
after April 26, 1979.) The first monitonng
report prepared by the DIrectorate and the
Division of Market Regulation, published
dunng the fiscal year, focused upon major
areas of concem to the industry and the
Commission.J2 Specifically, the report dIScussed, in part, the volume trends in securities eligible for trading pursuant to the
rule, the characteristics of order flow m
those securities, and the impact of the rule
on market quality and execution quality.
In conjunction WIth the Commission's
ongoing program to monitor the national
market system facilities, the Directorate
published in February 1981, "A Monitoring
Report on the Operation of the Intermarket
Trading System," and m May 1981, "A
Monitoring Report on the Operation of the
Cmcmnati Stock Exchange National Securities Trading System." These reports
were designed to provide the Commission,
and the securities industry, with an analysis
of the impact of the Intermarket Trading
System and the National Securities T radmg
System on, the routing of order flow, intermarket competition, and the quality of
markets.
National System for Clearance and
Settlement of Securities TransactionsDuring the fiscal year, substantial progress
was made in the Commission's effort to
foster development of a national system
for clearance and settlement of securities
transactions. The staff completed its review

of the two Issues remanded by the (Jruted
States Court of Appeals for the DIstrict of
Columbia Circuit in Bradford National
Clearing Corporation v. Securities and
Exchange Commission.13ln that decision,
the court affirmed the Commission's
decision granting the application
of
National Securities Clearing Corporation
(NSCC) for registration as a clearing
agency. The Commission has Viewed that
reqistration as a key step in achieving a
national clearance and settlement system.
The two Issues remanded by the court for
further consideration by the Comrrussion
were: (a) NSCCs selection of Securities
Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC) as
the facilities manager of Its consolidated
system without competitive bidding; and
(b) NSCCs use of geographic price rnutuahzation (GPM) GPM IS the practice of
charging all participants the same fee regardless of whether the participants deal
WIth the c1eanng agency at its main facility
or through a branch office
After extensive review of comment
letters, reports and other available mformation, the Commission affirmed m substance both its decision authonzmg NSCC
to use GPM and NSCCs selection of SIAC
as facrhties manager WIthout the use of
cornpetinve biddinq 14
The Cornmission completed its review of
and approved a proposed rule change submitted by NSCC that would establish
automated comparison and clearance
systems for mumcipal securities.'> The
approved system (a) enables municipal
secunties brokers and dealers to compare
transactions through a central entity rather
than having to relate directly to each broker
and dealer with whom they execute transactions; (b) increases standardization in the
processmg of transactions in murucipal secunties; and (c) provides the settlement
and financial benefits that accrue from the
netting of transactions m the same secunty.
On the basis of a request from Bradford
Securities
Processing
Services, Inc.
(BSPS), the Commission also terminated
the authority of BSPS to operate an auto.

3

mated comparison and clearance system
for municipal securities." Finally, the Commission reviewed and approved a proposed rule change by the Depository Trust
Company that established depository
facilities for mumclpal bonds, including
municipal bonds in bearer form."
Progress toward an Increasingly comprehensive and efficient national system
was also evidenced in other areas. For example, during the fiscal year, the Commission completed a review of and approved a proposed rule change by The
Options Cleanng Corporation that established systems for the issuance, clearance
and settlement of options on Government
National Mortgage Association Securities
(GNMAS) 18 Also, Pacific Depository Trust
Company enhanced its institutional delivery system to provide for the dehvery and
acceptance of trade confirmations among
brokers and their institutional customers
through the depository,
Options Trading-During
the fiscal
year, the Commission took several actions
designed to reduce the regulation of standardized options and permit the orderly
expansion of options trading. As previously
reported, on March 26, 1980, the Cornrrussion terminated the moratorium on expansion of the standardized options markets, which had been In effect since July
15, 1977. Simultaneously, the Commission
announced Its determination to begin to
consider on a case-by-ease basis expansionary self-regulatory organization
rule proposals relating to options.'? In this
connection, on October 22, 1980, the
Commission approved three sets of proposed rule changes submitted by the options exchanges and the NASD to modify
or eliminate certain regulations pertaining
to options trading. First, the Commission
approved proposals by the options exchanges and NASD to rescind their "restricted options" rules, which, subject to
certain enumerated exceptions, generally
prohibited opening transactions in deepout-of-the-money options (r.e., options
whose exercise pnces are substantially

4

away from the current market price of the
underlying security)." Second, the Commission approved proposals by the options
exchange to increase position and exercise
hmits from 1,000 to 2,000 contracts."
Finally, the Commission approved modifications of options exchange policies
which enabled the exchanges to reduce the
intervals between options exercise prices
and which gave the exchanges additional
flexibility with respect to the introduction
of new options series.P
Rule changes proposed by certain of the
options exchanges providing stili further
flexibility in the Introduction of new options
senes were approved by the Commission
on September 15, 198 J.23 During the fiscal
year the Commission also approved rule
changes eliminating
the requirement
that exchange member firms automatically
submit monthly reports of uncovered short
options positions, requiring instead that
such reports be submitted only upon

request."
The Commission has approved, or is
actively considering, exchange proposals
to trade a variety of new options products.
On February 26, 1981 , the Commission approved a proposed rule change of the
Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.
(CBOE) to trade standardized options on
mortgage pass-through certificates guaranteed by the Govemment National Mortgage Associatron (GNMAs).25The proposal
was approved after the Commission sohcited comrnents-" and received the VIewsof
more than 80 persons, including GNMA,
the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board and other interested government agencies. Commentators generally
were strongly supportive of the proposal,
many stating that the availability of GNMA
options would facihtate capital formation in
the housing and related financial markets."
The Comrnission's approval order, however, has been challenged in court by the
Chicago Board of Trade, which contends
that the Commission lacked the authority
to approve the CBOE proposal-" At the
end of the fiscal year, no decision had been

reached on the petition for review of the
Commission order.
In addition to the CBOE proposal, the
Commission has received a proposal from
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to
trade options on GNMAs.29 The Commission also has received proposal from the
American Stock Exchange (Amex), CBOE
and NYSE to trade options on various
United States Treasury securities," and
from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange
(Phlx) to trade options on certain foreign
currencies.F These proposals have been
published for public comment's and at the
close of the fiscal year were under review. In
addition, the Commission has received proposals from the Pacific Stock Exchange
(PSE) and Amex to trade options on gold
currency and on gold and silver bullion
value demand promissory notes, respectIvely.33
Finally, Trans Canada Options, Inc.
(TCO), which issues and performs clearing
and related functions with respect to standardized options traded on the Montreal
and Toronto Stock Exchanges, is seeking
to register those options with the Commission for sale in the United States." At the
end of the fiscal year, the Commission was
reviewing the TCO registration statement
to assure that it adequately disclosed the
terms, risks and other characteristics of
TCO options and the trading of TCO options. (On November 2, 1981, the Commission declared the registration statement
effective).
Option Transactions During Underwritten Offerings-On March 6, 1981, the
Commission authorized Issuance of two
staff letters setting forth the Interpretative
and enforcement positions of the Dlvislons
of Market RegulatIon and Corporation Anance regarding the application of certain
provisions of the Federal securities laws to
transactions involving exchange-traded options by participants in an underwriting of
the security underlying such options." The
letters addressed the application to these
transactions of Sections 2( 11 ) and 5 of the
Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and

Section 1O(b) of the Exchange Act, and
Rule ross thereunder.
Issuer Repurchases-On October 17,
1980, the Commission published a release
asking for public comment on a revised version of proposed Rule 13e-2.36 If adopted,
proposed Rule 13e.2 would regulate purchases of an issuer's securities by or on behalf of an issuer and certain other persons.
As proposed, the rule would generally limit
the time, price and volume of such pur.
chases. It also would impose disclosure requirements that would pertain to repurchase programs of substantial size. In addition, the rule subjects issuers and certain
other persons to a general antifraud provision in connection with their purchases of an
issuer's common or preferred stock. The
proposed rule is designed to assure that the
trading rnarkets are free from control and
domination by the issuer and certain other
persons. It had previously been published
for comment in 1970 and 1973.
Short Tendering of Securities-On Au.
gust 21, 1981, the Commission withdrew
its previously proposed amendments to
Rule 10b4 under the Exchange Act The
rule was adopted in 1968 for the purpose of
prohibiting a practice known as "short tendering" (i.e., tendering more shares than a
person owns in order to avoid or reduce the
risk of pro rata acceptance in tender offers
for less than all the outstanding securities of
a class or series)." The Commission also
announced that it was requesting com.
ment on two alternative proposals. The first
would amend the rule to (a) impose additional ownership requirements for persons
tendering securities in response to tender
offers; (b) clarify the application of existing
provisions of the Rule; and (c) limit the type
of offers to which the Rule applies. The alternative proposal would dereg ulate " short.
tendering" entirely.
Markel Manipulallon-On
February
17, 1981, the Commission announced that
it had adopted amendments to Rule 10b-6
under the Exchange Act, 38 which generally
prohibits trading by persons interested in a
distribution of securities. These amend.

ments except from the application of the
rule, distributions of securities pursuant to
employee or shareholder plans sponsored
by an issuer or its subsidiaries. These distributions generally do not present the potential for manipulative abuse that the rule was
designed to prohibit

Regulation of Brokers, Dealers.
Municipal Securities Dealers and
Transfer Agents
Regulatory Burdens on Small Broker.
Commission is aware of
the need to assess and balance the costs
and competitive impact of its regulations
on small brokers and dealers. Accordingly,
in adopting new rules and amending
others, the Commission carefully weighs
the investor protection benefits and other
statutory goals against the burdens which
will be imposed upon competition. More.
over, the Commission strives to tailor its
regulatory requirements to particular business practices so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens. These efforts are particularly beneficial to the small,
more specialized firms.
In addition, on September 19, 1980, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) was
adopted by Conqress." The RFAamended
the Administrative Procedure Act to require
that agencies examine the impact of pro'
posed rules on small entities, as defined in
the RFA, and consider altemative require'
ments that could accomplish the stated objectives of the applicable statutes. Although
the RFA defines the term "small entity" by
reference to industry size standards established by the Small Business Adrninistration (SBA), Congress recognized that those
size standards may be inappropriate in dfferent regulatory contexts. It authorized
agencies to adopt, after public comment
and consultation with the SBA, different
definitions for affected industries. In that regard, the Commission, on March 30, 198] ,
proposed for comment definitions of the
terms "small business" and "small busi-

Broker-Deeter
Reporting
Requirements-On February 11, 1981, the Com.
mission adopted amendments to Part I of
Form X.] 7A.S, the Financial and Opera.
tional Combined Uniform Single Report
(FOCUS Report) required to be filed by
brokers and dealers, and related Rule 17a'S
under the Exchange Act 41 The amend.
ments to Part I of the FOCUS Report are de.
signed to reorganize the form so that it follows a more logical progression from an accounting and operational standpoint In ad.
dition, the Commission has issued instructions useful to completion of Part I. These
changes should enable the Commission to
more effectively and efficiently monitor the
financial condition of brokers and dealers
and also to reduce the overall reporting bur.
den on the brokerage community.
Using FOCUS data submitted by brokers
and dealers, the Directorate of Economic
and Pohcy Analysis produced last year its
third annual Staff Report on the Securities
Industry in 1980. The report's purpose is
to provide the Commission with a cornprehensive factual basis on which to ascertain
the effects of regulatory changes on the in.
dustry and investors. This report analyzes
the financial results of the securities indus.
try, and centers on the performance and financial structure of various industry seg.
ments. An examination of changes in the
macro economy and their impact on the
securities industry in 1980 is presented
along with a comprehensive analysis of the
securities industry as a whole. Discussions
of discount broker-dealers are included in
addition to analyses of securities firms classified according to type of business con.
ducted and exchange membership. Also
presented is a section on recent industry
trends and developments which contains
information on concentration, diversification and commission rate trends.
On August 31, 1981, the Commission
proposed for comment a new rule under
the Exchange Act, Rule 17a-8,42that would

incorporate by reference existing Treasury
regulations promulgated under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Act of
1970. These regulations, among other
things, require brokers and dealers to make
reports and maintain records on domestic
currency transactions
of more than
$10,000 and the import and export of currency and monetary instruments of $5,000
or more. The Currency Act and the Treasury regulations are designed to assist in
discovering violations of Federal laws that
are difficult to detect because of vanous
practices, including the use of foreign bank
accounts and the "laundering" of funds
through domestic businesses. The Treasury regulations delegate to the Commission, with respect to brokers and dealers,
the responsibility for assuring compliance.
The proposed rule is the most appropriate
means of enabling the Commission and
the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) to
enforce these regulations. Since. brokers
and dealers already must comply with the
Treasury regulations, it would not impose
any new regulatory burdens.

Financial

ments- The

Responsibility

Require'

uniform net capital rule43is an
integral part of the Commission's financial
responsibility program designed to ensure
that brokers and dealers have on hand at all
times sufficient amounts of liquid assets to
promptly satisfy the claims of customers.
The rule, in essence, requires brokers and
dealers to rnaintain specified levels of net
capital in relation to their aggregate indebtedness. In the case of brokers or dealers
electing an alternative method of computing net capital, it would be in relation to ago
gregate debit items computed in accordance with the reserve formula under the
Commission's customer protection rule.
Since its inception in 1975,44 the uniform
net capital rule has continually been modified in response to changing industry con.
ditions and the regulatory environment In
this regard, the Commission, on October 9,
1980, proposed for comment revisions to
the rule which will substantially reduce capl-

tal requirements for those brokers and dealers electing the altemative method of computing net capital.45 These proposed revisions include a lowering of the ratio of required net capital to aggregate debit items
computed in accordance with the reserve
formula under the Commission's customer
protection rule, as well as a reduction in the
minimum net capital requirement under
the altemative method.
The Commission also proposed to eliminate certain items from the reserve for'
mula which would serve to further reduce
the amount of net capital required under
the altematJve method. In addition, the
Commission solicited comment on a
broad range of questions in an effort to initiate a dialogue with the securities industry
which might lead to a refashioning or eventual elimination of certain of the financial
responsibility rules.
Also, on October 9, 1980, the Com.
mission proposed for comment revisions
to the uniform net capital rule which would
increase the percentage deductions from
net worth ("haircuts") for certain debt
securities held in the proprietary or other
accounts of the broker or dealer. 46 This proposal is in response to the recent sharp fluctuation in the market value of these securities which consistently have exceeded the
"haircuts" prescribed under the rule. The
Commission, however, also is soliciting
comments on whether and to what extent
these deductions should be reduced by
hedging positions in financial futures or securities of a different issuer.
In an attempt to reduce the burden of
computing net capital on brokers and dealers who also are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC), as futures comrnissrons merchants, on July 9, 1981 the Commission
adopted amendments to Appendix B of the
uniform net capital rule relating to capital
charges taken in connection with comrnodity transactions." The amendments to
Appendix B were adopted In response to
the "silver crisis" of 1980, and conform the
Commission's
rule to certain recent

7

amendments adopted by the CFTC to its
net rule. Basically, the amendments require
brokers and dealers to take capital charges
for undermargined customer commodity
accounts or debit/deficit commodity accounts sooner than under the old provision.
In addition, the amendments require that
non-cash items used to collateralize a com.
modity related receivable or used to margin, guarantee or secure a commodity futures account be valued at a substantial dis.
count from their market value.
Registration Requirements-Form
U4,
the Uniform Application for Securities and
Commodities Industry Registration, is the
personnel form that the Commission requires a registered broker or dealer who
is not a member of a registered national
secunties association to file on behalf of its
associated persons. Form U4 IS also
accepted as a uniform application form
for associated persons by 46 states, all
of the national securities exchanges and
the NASD. On December 17, 1980. the
Comrrussion adopted previously proposed
revisions to Form U448• The revisions
included changes in format to improve
clarity and to eliminate duplicative information. In addition, new questions have
been added in order to include information
required by the 1975 Amendments and
Item lO(a) of Form BD.
Sell-Underumunq
by SECO BrokerDealers--On August 20, 1981 the Commission proposed to amend Rule 15b 10-9,
the so-called "self-underwriting" rule, which
prohibits a broker-dealer that is not a memo
ber of a registered securities association
(SECO broker-dealer) from underwriting or
otherwise participating in any public offering of its own securities or the securities of
an affiliate unless several conditions are
met 49 The proposed amendment would
create a conditional exception to that rule
for SECO broker-dealers that limit their
business to participation in the offer and
sale of securities issued by an affiliate that
is not a broker-dealer. The proposed
amendment would essentially codfy the
disclosure conditions imposed by the Com-

8

mission in granting exemptive requests to
certain SECO broker-dealers.

Broker-Dealer Examinations-The

Di-

vision of Market Regulation's Branch of
Broker-Dealer Examinations has primary
responsibility for planning and coordinating the Commission's broker-dealer examination programs. During the fiscal year,
the Commission's regional offices, under
the direction of the branch, conducted 202
routine SECO broker-dealer examinations,
716 oversight or cause examinations of
broker-dealers, and 457 post-effective conferences with newly registered broker-dealers. The reqional offices also reviewed, within 15 days of receipt, approximately 7,800
financial reports filed by broker-dealers with
the regional offices.
During the fiscal year, the branch initiated formal periodic reviews of each regional
office's broker-dealer examinations program. These reviews resulted in improved
program planning and effectiveness, and
made it possible to identify potential regulatory problems quickly and respond accordingly. In addition, the branch directed
and participated in an examination of a mao
jor wirehouse which was conducted by the
staff of several reqional offices. This exammation established the feasibility of such
interregional examinations of broker-dealers. The branch also initiated a joint regional office and Division pilot project whereby
examiners can be provided on-line access
to historical price and volume data on all
NASDAQ listed and several thousand over.
the-counter securities.
In addition, two conferences were conducted for senior regional office regulatory
staffs in order to discuss various regulatory
developments and problems. These conferences resulted in a number of improve.
ments in the Commission's examination
program.
Two, two-week training programs for
new and senior securities compliance
examiners were also held. The program for
new examiners covered an overview of the
Exchange Act, methods for examining a
broker-dealer's records (particularly for

compliance with net capital customer protection and sales practice rules). The program for senior examiners concentrated on
examination techniques for the in-depth review of broker-dealer sales practices.
Municipal
Securities Brokers and
Dealers-Although
the Comrmssion did
not adopt any rules or regulations with respect to municipal securities dealers,
amendments to Form MSD, the form used
by mumclpal securities dealers that are
banks or separately identifiable departments or divisions of banks, became effective during the year. These amendments
conform a definition In Form MSD to a definition in a rule of the MuniCIpal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), and allow,
under certain circumstances, a reduction In
the number of different forms required to
be filed by bank municipal securities
dealers.
The Cornmission also continued to consult with the bank regulatory agencies with
respect to bank municipal secunties activities, and in addition, the Commission staff
issued several no-action and interpretative
letters with respect to securities activities
by municipal securitres brokers and dealers.
Lost and Stolen Securities-The Lost
and Stolen Securities Program, wmch Includes nearly 18,000 securities organizations, Federally-Insured banks, and nonbank transfer agents as participants, uses
a data bank to monitor missing securities.
Participants use the system to validate the
authenticity and ownership of the certificates coming into their possession. On
April 7, 1981, the Comrnission released a
staff report containing comprehensive general statistical information reqardmq the
operation of the Program for calendar year
1980_ As stated in that report, the Securities Information Center, the Commission's
designee to operate and maintain the computerized data base of missing, lost, counterfeit and stolen secunties, received reports
of loss, theft or counterfeitinq conceming
approximately 290,000 certificates valued
at approximately $1 2 billion. As of Decem-

ber 31, 1980, the aggregate net value of the
data base since the inception of the program was approximately $3.6 bilhon.
Securities Investor Protection Corporation- The Secunties Investor Protection
Act of 1970 (SIPA)50provides certain protections to customers of brokers and dealers that fail to meet their obligations to their
customers. SIPA is administered principally
by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a non-profit membership
corporation, the members of which are,
with lirruted exceptions, registered brokers
and dealers. SIPC is funded through assessments on Its members, although it may borrow up to $1 bilhon from the United States
Treasury under certain emergency conditions.
Dunng fiscal year 1981, Congress
adopted amendments to SIPA51 that increased the level of customer protection
provided by SIPA to $500,000 (from the
previous level of $100,000), not more than
$100,000 (previously $40,000) of which
may be for cash claims.
Transfer Agents-On
December 30,
1980, the Cornrrussion announced the
adoption of amendments to Rule 17Ac2-1
under the Exchange Act and Form TA-1 ,
the uniform transfer agent form.52 These
amendments eliminated the requirement
that a transfer agent registered with the
Commission file annual updates to the Information contained in Schedule B of
Form TA-1. Schedule B requires registered
transfer agents to list, among other things,
securities forwhich they performed transfer
agent functions and the capacities in which
they acted for those securities. The Commission determined that the cost to collect
and update that information by transfer
agents and the cost to process it by the
Comrrussion outweighed the regulatory
benefit of that information to the Commission.
Oversight of Self-Regulatory

Orgunizations
Suroeil/ance and Compliance Inspections-During
the fiscal year, the Comrnis9

sion staff continued its comprehensive inspection program of the Nation's securities
markets, The purpose of this program is to
evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the adequacy of market surveillance, compliance, disciplinary and operational programs of all
the national securities exchanges and the
NASD.
A total of 12 inspections focusing on
market surveillance were conducted during
the fiscal year. These inspections included
an overall review of the equity trading programs of the SSE, MSE, the NASDAQ tradmg program of the NASD, the PSE and the
Phlx. The staff also inspected the NYSE and
Amex programs for evaluation of specialist
performance and the disciplinary programs of these exchanges. In addition, the
staff continued to monitor the programs of
the NYSE in developing a complete audit
trail for stock tradmg on its floor. Finally, the
staff conducted a complete review of options tradmg programs at the PSE and the
Phlx.
A total of seven inspections focusing on
SRO compliance programs were conducted in the fiscal year. These inspections
encompassed reviews of such program
areas as routine and cause examinations,
financial surveillance, and discipline of
broker-dealers by SROs.
The Commission's inspection program
disclosed progress at several of the SROs
in addressing surveillance deficiencies
found during earlier Inspections. Factors
which contributed to enhanced market surveillance programs included additional
staffing, upgraded or refined computerized
surveillance capacity, and better procedures among the SROs for exchanging
surveillance mformation. Nevertheless, the
inspection program disclosed some significant surveillance deficiencies at certain of
the SROs. These deficiencies were attributable to such factors as inadequate
trading information and data gathering
systems to detect specific types of trading
violations and, in some instances, the
failure to optimize the use of existing
trading information for surveillance purposes. Finally, the inspection program
10

disclosed laxity in the prosecution of some
categories of trading violations at certain of
the SROs. The SROs were asked to address
these problems and throughout the fiscal
year significant corrective actions were
taken by several of them.
In February 1981, the staff completed
inspections of the stock and options
trading programs of the Phlx. These inspections disclosed various deficiencies in the
administration and conduct of surveillance
activities for both stock and options trading.
In July 1981, the Phlx submitted a detailed
plan to remedy each of the concems raised
by these inspections. The Commission
staff has planned a series of inspections in
fiscal year 1982 to monitor the enhancement of surveillance programs at the Phlx.
In August 1981, the staff completed a
comprehensive inspection of the NASD's
market surveillance and disciplinary programs respecting OTC trading in stocks
quoted in the NASDAQ system. This inspection disclosed certain systemic weaknesses that exist because OTC trading in
NASDAQ securities takes place without the
reporting of Individual trades in such securities. This situation will change somewhat
during the next fiscal year with the
commencement
of last-sale transaction
reporting for approximately the 50 most
active NASDAQ stocks. The staffs of the
Commission and the NASD will be meeting
to discuss implementation of improved
surveillance procedures as a result of lastsale reporting and other automated en.
hancements proposed by the NASD that
will expand the scope of trading information readily available for surveillance
programs.
Inspections
conducted
during
the
previous fiscal year disclosed that a complete transaction audit trail was essential for
the NYSE to conduct adequate surveillance
of stock trading on its floor. During fiscal
year 1981, the Commission staff conducted a series of inspections to monitor
the NYSE's efforts to develop data gathering systems needed to create an acceptable transaction audit trail. The NYSE

expects to implement a pilot program providing a complete audit trail In a limited
number of stocks by December 1981.
During fiscal year 1982, the Commission
staff will monitor expansion of the pilot
program to additional stocks as well as the
refinement of surveillance procedures
made possible by the capture of additional
trading information
through the pilot
program.
In fiscal year 1980, the Commission
instituted an administrative proceeding
against the SSE for failure to develop and
employ adequate surveillance procedures
to detect certain trading VIolations by SSE
specialists. That matter was settled with the
SSE undertaking to Implement corrective
procedures. An inspection conducted in
March 1981 verified the implementation of
those procedures.
At the end of the fiscal year, inspections
that were in progress included the disciplinary programs of the Amex and NYSE as
well as an inspection of the CBOE's market
surveillance and disciplinary programs.
Since September 1980, the staff has conducted inspections of the operations of
NASD Distnct Offices located in New York
City, New Orleans and Denver. The focus of
these inspections was the overall quality of
the NASD's programs to insure compliance by its member firms with the secunties laws. Specifically, the staff reviewed all
NASD District programs, including not
only the District Offices' routine examination programs, but also their programs for
(a) Investigating customer complaints and
terminations of registered representives
from employment for cause; (b) monitoring the financial condition of member
firms; (c) processing Regulation T extension requests; and (d) disciplining member
firms. In these inspections, the Cornrnission's staff found that those offices generally appeared to be executing their routine
examination programs with reasonable
thoroughness. However, the staff identified
several areas in which remedial attention
was needed to cure problems in the examination program.

The staff also conducted an inspection of
the CBOE, which was similar in scope to
the NASD District Office inspections. The
staff found that the CBOE had made a
commendable
commitment
of its resources to Its compliance programs,
although some areas In need of improvement were noted.
During the fiscal year, the staff conducted an Inspection in which it reviewed
the NASD's examination procedures for
enforcing
compliance
with its selfunderwriting rule proposal. The staff also
conducted an inspection of the NYSE's
financial surveillance program for the
purpose of assessmq the impact of certain
proposed amendments to the net capital
rule.
Finally, in fiscal year 1981, the staff concluded a comprehensive
compliance
inspectIon of the Phlx. In that inspection,
the staff found substantial deficiencies in
the Phlx's financial surveillance, disciplinary
and routine and cause examination programs. Followmq extensive consultation
with the Commission, the Phlx determined
to reallocate its upstairs member firm compliance responsibilities to the NASD, as
have the other regional stock exchanges, in
order to concentrate resources on its rernairunq regulatory responsibilities, particularly market surveillance
At the end of the fiscal year, an inspectIon
of the NYSE's cause examination program
was still In progress.
Market Oversight Surveillance System
- The Market Oversiqht Surveillance
System (MOSS) ISan automated mforrnation system designed to enhance Commission oversight of the Nation's secunties
markets.
The Moss project was initiated In August
1978 as a two-part study and design effort.
The study examined the market surveillance capabilities of the Commission and
the SROs. It concluded that, in VIew of sigmficent developments in the complexity,
structure and trading volume in the securities markets, and in VIewof the increasingly
sophisticated product mix of the securities
11

markets resulting from the introduction of
standardized options trading, the Commission must improve its oversight and surveil.
lance capabilities. In its review of the project
In 1980, Congress reached a similar

concluslon.P
In order to evaluate the feasibility of building a system such as MOSS, the Commission initiated a pilot project of portions of
the proposed system in New York City
in early 1980. Throughout 1980 and the
early part of 1981, a series of computer
algorithms was designed to detect unusual
trading activity. These algorithms were
tested and refined by monitoring actual
trading in a small number of stocks and
options.
In early 198 I , the staff began the process
of converting the computer programs of
the pilot project in order to transfer the system to a computer at the Commission's
headquarters in Washington, D.C. The
transfer was completed in July.
Consistent with its commitment to work
closely with the SROs in the development
of MOSS, Chairman Shad invited the presidents and senior staff members of the three
largest exchanges involved in the MOSS
pilot project (the Amex, C8OE, and NYSE)
to attend a series of meetings with Commission staff members in August to discuss
the possibility of the SROs developing an
altemative to MOSS for the surveillance of
inter-rnarket trading activity. As an outcome of these meetings, the SROs submit.
ted a proposal to the Commission for the
establishment of such a program to be
operated by the SROs and the implementation of a complete audit trail of securities
transactions on the NYSE, a keystone of
any effective surveillance effort. The SROs
have begun to implement their proposal
and the Commission is closely monitoring
the progress of the project in order to reach
decisions on the future direction of MOSS.
Pursuant to the requirement in the Con.
gressional budget authorization for MOSS,
the Commission has submitted two reports
to Congress on the project. These reports,
submitted on April I and October I, 198 I ,
12

provide greater detail about developments
in the MOSS project and the proposal from
the SROs to develop a program for surveillance of inter-market trading activity.
National Securities Exchanges-As
of
September 30, 1981, ten exchanges were
registered with the Commission as national
securities exchanges pursuant to Section 6
of the Exchange Act: American Stock
Exchange (Amex); Boston Stock Exchange (BSE); Chicago Board Options
Exchange (C8OE); Cincinnati Stock Exchange
(CSE);
Intermountain
Stock
Exchange (lSE); Midwest Stock Exchange
(MSE); New York Stock Exchange (NYSE);
Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE); Philadelphia Stock Exchange (Phlx); and Spokane
Stock Exchange (SSE). No exchange is
currently operating under an exemption
from registration as a national securities
exchange.
In connection with the Commission's
oversight of the deli sting of securities
traded on national securities exchanges
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Exchange
Act, during the fiscal year the Commission
granted applications by exchanges to strike
57 equity issues and 18 debt issues from
listing and registration. The Cornmissron
also granted applications by issuers requesting withdrawal from listing and registratJon for 25 equity issues and 4 debt
Issues.
Pursuant to the Commission's responsibility under Section 12(f) of the Exchange
Act, during the fiscal year, the Commission
granted 248 applications by exchanges for
unlisted trading privileges in listed securities. The Commission also revised its policy
conceming applications for unlisted trading pnvileges In listed securities. The Commission had previously limited unlisted
trading privileges for listed securities to
securities reported in the consolidated quotation and transaction reporting system (reported securities). However, it determined
to grant unlisted trading privileges in non.
reported securities provided the applicant
exchange certifies that it will provide to vendors last sale reports and quotation infor-

mation for the security, and that such in.
formation will be available on the floor of
the applicant exchange.
During the fiscal year, the Commission
also created a Iirnited exception to its gen.
eral policy to defer any decision regarding
the granting of unlisted trading privileges
in OTC securities pending further developments in the national market system. The
Commission concluded that it would grant
unlisted trading privileges in OTC securities
in the narrow situation involving a solely
listed reported security subject to an issuer
delisting application where the applicant
exchange has exempted such security
from any applicable off-board trading reo
strictions. In such instances, third markets
makers would be subject to the last sale
reporting requirements of Rule 11Aa3.1
under the Exchange Act54
The national securities exchanges reo
ported to the Commission, pursuant to
Section 19(d)(l) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 19d.l thereunder, 309 final disci.
plinary actions imposing a variety of
sanctions upon member firms and their
employees.
During the fiscal year, the Commission
received from the national exchanges 154
filings of proposed rule changes, pursuant
to Rule 19b4 under the Exchange Act.
Among the significant exchange rule fllings approved by the Commission during
the fiscal year were (a) revisions to Phlx
disciplinary procedures's (b) a one-year
pilot program by the PSE relating to the
appointment and evaluation of specialists
and the creation of new specialist posts56
and (c) rule changes by seven national
securities exchanges regarding trade.
throughs and locked-markets on the ITS.57
During the fiscal year, the Commission
concluded proceedings initiated the pre.
vious year to determine whether to disapprove proposed rule changes of the NYSE
and Amex to make permanent their rules
governing registered competitive market
makers (RCMMs) and registered equity
market makers (REMMs), respectively.58
The Commission found that RCMM and

REMM trading activity did not qualify for the
market maker exemption from the general
exchange member proprietary trading pro.
hibitions of Section l1(a)(1) of the Ex.
change Act Nevertheless, the Commission
determined that, on balance, RCMMs and
REMMs provide the potential for benefits
to their markets. Accordingly, the Com.
mission approved the RCMM and REMM
rules and adopted a rule under Section
II(a)(I)(H)
of the Exchange Act exempting RCMM and REMM transactions from
the proprietary trading prohibitions of
Section l1(a)(1) of the Exchange Act59
During the fiscal year, the Commission
approved proposed rule changes filed by
the NYSE60 and the Amex61 conceming
their regulatory authority over corporate
affiliates, mcluding foreign affiliates, of their
members. In particular, the rules provide
for third party examination procedures for
certain foreign-domiciled
persons. The
Cornrnissron found that the examination
procedures reflected good faith efforts to
balance the need for effective surveillance
against what today seems to be appropriate
deference to the laws and customs of
foreign nations.
National Assocuuion
of Securities
Dealers, Inc.-The NASD is the only national securities association registered with
the Commission. At the close of the fiscal
year, 3,132 brokers and dealers were
NASD members.
During the last nine months of the fiscal
year, the NASD reported to the Commission the final disposition of 393 disciplinary
actions.
During the fiscal year, the Commission
received also from the NASD 29 filings of
proposed rule changes. One of the signifi.
cant NASD rules aproved by the Comrnission during the fiscal year-onginally sub.
mitted in 1978-prohibits
NASD members
from giving discounts to customers m dis.
tributions of securities offered at a fixed
price.62 The rule change amended the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice to impose a
more explicit prohibition on an NASD
member's
taking securities in trade

13

(swapping) at more than their fair market
price and to limit the ability of members to
grant or receive discounts in connection
with fixed price offerings. In addition, the
Commission approved amendments to the
NASD's Anti-Reciprocal Rule to permit,
subject to certain restrictions, NASD
members to seek or grant brokerage commissions in connection with the sale of
investment company securities.P
The Commission reviewed a number of
proposed NASD rules to revise qualiflcations for securities included on NASDAQ.
One rule approved by the Commission increased the minimum standards for total
assets and total capital and surplus for
companies included on NASDAQ. 64 The
Commission also approved the NASD's
request to use financial criteria, as well as
dollar volume data, in determining which
NASDAQ companies will have their securities included on the NASDAQ National
and Additional Iists,65which are distributed
to the news media for publication. The
NASD was also authorized to make future
revisions in the size or number of lists as
market conditions, or the needs of issuers,
investors, the news media or the securities
industry require.
During the year, the Commission also
authorized the NASDAQ market makers
to display, on a voluntary basis, a quotation
for an amount of securities in excess of the
normal unit of trading.66 This information
will appear on NASDAQ six months after
the installation of new NASDAQ terminal
equipment is completed.
Allocation of Regulatory Responsibility- During the fiscal year 1981, the
Commission
continued
its efforts to
eliminate duplication in the self-regulatory
system for brokers and dealers. The Commission began reviewing plans proposed
by the SROs for allocating their responsibility to perform various regulatory funcnons for brokers and dealers which belong
to more than one SRO. One set of plans
represents agreements among the Arnex,
MSE, PSE, Phlx, CBOE and NASD to reduce regulatory duplication relative to
14

options-related sales practice matters for
firms currently members of two or more of
the organizations. The second set of plans
- represents agreements between the NYSE
and the Amex, SSE, Phlx, MSE, PSE and
CSE, which reflect progress toward reducing unnecessary regulatory duplication by
assigning to one SRO much of the responsibility for conducting on-site examinations
of dual members and for processing various applications.
Statutory Disqualifications-On March
10, 1981, the Commission
proposed
amendments to Rule 19h-l under the Exchange Act conceming admissions to, or
continuances in, membership in SROs or
participation in the securities business of
persons subject to statutory dlsqualitlcations/"
The revisions are designed
primarily to reduce the burdens that have
been encountered by SROs and the Commission in the administration of the rule.
Under the proposed amendments: (a) detailed fIlings would be required to be made
with the Commission on behalf of statutorily disquahfled persons in fewer situations;
(b) certain additional information would
have to be included in those detailed fIlings
that are required, in order to facilitate their
review and processing by the Commission;
and (c) certain provisions of the rule would
be clanfled.
Applications for ReEntry- During the
fiscal year, the Division of Market Regulation processed 54 applications, pursuant to
Section 6(c)(2) and 15A(g)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 19h-l thereunder, to
permit persons subject to statutory disqualifications, as defined in Section 3(a)
(39) of the Exchange Act, to become
associated with broker-dealers. The following SROs filed such applications:
(a) NASD- 35 applications; (b) NYSE-18
applications; and (c) Arnex-one application. Five of the 54 applications filed were
subsequently withdrawn.
Municipal
Securities Rulemaking
Board-As in the case of national securities exchanges and the NASD, the Commission reviews proposed rule changes of

the MSRB. During the fiscal year, the MSRB
filed 14 rule proposals; the Commission
considered a number of these proposals
plus others that were pending from previous years.
The Commission approved amendments to the MSRB rule on syndicate
practices in connection with the sale of new
issue municipal securities. These revisrons:
(a) ehminated the requirement that a municipal securities dealer that IS not a member of the syndicate disclose the fact that
secunties which it is purchasing from the
syndicate are for a related portfoho; and
(b) require that the syndicate manager
disclose In writing to members of the syndicate the securities that had been allocated
on a "priority" baSIS,and the customers to
whom such securities had been allocated."
In addition, the cornrmssion approved a
rule filing to consolidate the MSRB's advertising rules into a single rule69 and to require
the disclosure of certain Information by
municipal securities professionals In con.
nection WIth the sale of new issue municipal secunties. Specifically, the advertisements must disclose, If applicable, the fact
that certain securities may not be available
from the syndicate or may be available at a
different pnce or yield than those hsted in
the advertisement.
Finally, the Commission
approved
amendments to the MSRB rule on umform
industry practice. These amendments altered the procedure by which murncipal
securities professions may close-out open
transactions in municipal securities."
Cleanng Agencies- During the fiscal
year, the Commission received and began
reviewing applications from 12 clearing
agencies for full registration
under
standards adopted by the Division of
Market Regulation dunng the 1980 fiscal
year," These standards represent the views
of the Division regarding the manner In
which clearing agencies should comply
with the clearing agency registration provisions of Section 17A(b )(3) of the Exchange Act. The Division standards deal
with, among other things, requirements

regarding participation in c1eanng agencies, fair representation of partrcipants,
disciplinary procedures, the safeguarding
of securities and funds and the clearing
agency's obligation to participants. The
DIvision WIll apply the standards In making
recommendations to the Cornrrussion regarding the granting or denial of registration to clearing aqecies. At present, 13
clearing agencies are temporanly registered WIth the Cornmissron.
Dunng the fiscal year, the Commission
staff conducted oversight inspections of
Midwest Clearing Corporation and Boston
Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation. The
staff also conducted jornt inspections of
MIdwest Securities Trust Company (MSTC)
and New England Securities Depository
Trust Company (NESDTC) with the Board
Govemors of the Federal Reserve System
(FRS). The FRS IS the appropriate regulatory authority for MSTC and NESDTC, and
the joint conduct of these examinations
furthered the statutory goal of avoidmq
unnecessary regulatory duplication and regulatory burdens on clearing agencies that
are subject to inspection by both the Comrnissron and the Federal bank regulators.
The findings of these Inspections were
discussed with the respective c1eanng
agencies, and they either have been or are
being addressed by those clearing agencres,

Procedures for Filing Proposed Rule
Changes-SectIon 19(b) of the Exchange
Act, as amended by the 1975 Amendments, requires self-regulatory organizations to file all proposed rule changes WIth
the Commission for approval. Shortly after
Section 19(b) became effective, the Commission adopted Rule 19b-4 and related
Form 19b-4A establishing procedures for
SROs to file proposed rule changes, and
deSIgnating the types of proposed rule
changes that may become effective upon
filing_
On October 3D, 1980, the Commission
adopted amendments to Rule 19b-4 and
Form 19b4N2 winch were designed to improve and SImplify the rule filing process,
15

thus expediting Commission review of proposed rule changes. The amendments,
which became effective on .January 1,
1981, include: (a) an amendment to Rule
19b4 clarifying which actions of SROs require proposed rule changes; (b) an

16

amendment to Rule 19b4 designating certain clearing agency rules as eligible for
summary effectiveness; and (c) amendments to Form 19b4A, redesignated as
Form 19b4, to specify, in greater detail, the
information required by that form.

The Disclosure System

The purpose of the "full disclosure" system administered by the Commission ISto
assure that the securities markets operate
in an environment in which full and accurate material information about publicly
traded companies ISavailable to investors,
securities analysts and other interested
persons. By fostenng investor confidence
and Implementing the Congressional mandate of investor protection, the full dISclosure system contnbutes to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and
facilitates the capital formation
process. In 1980, over $600 billion in equity
securities was traded on exchanges and in
the over-the-counter (OTC) market, and
there were public offenngs of over $100
billion in equity and debt securities.
During the fiscal year, the Commission's
continuing efforts to Improve the disclosure system centered on major initiatives In implementing its integration program and responding to the particular
needs of small business. The integration
program will be implemented through
changes in the operations of the Commission's DIvision of Corporation Finance,
particularly the selective review system
which was initiated dunng the year. Also
in fiscal year 1981, the Commission undertook several other rule-making projects
in the area of full disclosure and continued its program of providing interpretive
advice on disclosure matters. Certain of
these initiatives were cooperative efforts
with representatives of the state securities
administrators. The Commission VIews
such cooperative efforts as a means of enhancing the longstanding beneficial relationship between the Federal government and the states, in addition to reducing
the burdens Imposed by multiple levels of

regulation while maintaining a high degree
of investor protection.
The Integration

Program

The aim of the integration program is
to enhance Investor protection through
disclosure documents
which provide
meamngful information in a clear, concise and understandable format. At the
same time, the program responds to the
need to reduce the burdens of compliance
caused by duplicative, outmoded or unnecessary requirements. The Securities
Act of 1933 (Securities Act) established a
system of transaction-oriented disclosure
WIth a focus on particular offerings of securities. The Secunties Exchange Act of
1934 (Exchange Act) established a system
of continuous disclosure WIth a focus on
public companies and their ongoing reporting obligations to the Cornrnissron
and to their shareholders. Because the two
disclosure systems have developed and
operated Independently for more than 40
years, the same information is frequently
required to be disclosed in different formats
under the separate systems.
The
integrated
disclosure
system
harmonizes the two disclosure systems
Into a comprehensive whole. It will perform the role envisioned by both the
Secunnes Act and the Exchange Act, will
eliminate or reduce overlapping or duplicative corporate reporting, and WIll streamline corporate reporting generally. The
system Simplifies corporate reporting In
three ways: ( 1) disclosure requirements are
made uniform under the Secunties Act and
the Exchange Act, (2) Exchange Act penodic reporting IS used to satisfy much of
the disclosure necessary In Securities
Act registration statements; and (3) the
use of Informal shareholder cornrnuruca-

17

tions is encouraged, but not required, to
satisfy formal statutory requirements under
both Acts.
Development of the integrated disclosure system is an on-going process
which is scheduled to be completed during
fiscal year 1982. Dunng fiscal 1981, the
Commission made substantial progress
toward full Implementation of the system.
In December 1980, the Commission pubhshed proposals resulting from the "sunset" review of the GUIdes for the Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements
and Reports (GUIdes) and from the en.
hanced role of Regulation S.K in an Integrated disclosure system." In February
1981, the Commission adopted revisions
to Form 1O-Qand Regulations S.X and S-K
to streamline intenm financial and other
reporting and to make quarterly and interim disclosure requirements uniform
under both Acts.74 In August 1981, eight
releases compnsing the latest phase of the
program were published as proposed rulemaking actions.
Each of these eight releases was in.
tegrally related to the others and to the
rulemaking actions taken in 1980. In the
integrated disclosure system, a Securities
Act registrant would look (1 ) to the appro'
pnate form for a deterrnination of the type
and amount of disclosure which must be
fumished to Investors; (2) to Regulation
S.K for substantive disclosure require'
ments; and (3) to Regulation C for pro.
cedural instructions. Separate releases
addressed the role in the integrated system
of security ratings, delayed or continuous
offerings and Securities Act liabilities In
connection with Exchange Act periodic
reports incorporated by reference into
Securities Act registration statements
Finally, the Commission's integration of the
two existing corporate disclosure systems
Included a wide ranging "sunset" review,
resultIng in revisions to Regulation C and in
proposed coordinating changes to rules
and forms under the two systems. The republished outstanding proposals and the
five newly developed coordinating projects

18

are summarized in the following discus.
sion.
Proposed Forms 5.], 5-2 and 5.]75These three proposed forms would con.
stitute the baSIC framework for the registration of securities under the Securities
Act. DIfferences among the forms take into
account differences in information regarding companies already publicly avail.
able and the WIdevariety of public offerings.
Thus, Form S-3 requires minimal disclosure in the prospectus and relies upon in.
corporation by reference of material already presented in Exchange Act reports. It
would be used by the most widely followed
corporations for equity offerings and by
most other companies reporting under the
Exchange Act for registenng investment
grade debt, dividend reinvestment plans,
and certain other offerings. Form S.2 would
be available to companies which are not as
widely followed as Form S.3 companies,
but which have reported under the Exchange Act for at least three years. Under
Form S-2, registrants would either In'
corporate by reference into the prospectus
the information in their annual reports to
shareholders or provide similar information
In the prospectus. Companies which have
reported under the Exchange Act for less
than three years would generally use Form
S.l. It requires complete disclosure of relevant information to investors in the prospectus and permits no incorporation by reo
ference.
Revision of Regulation 5-K76- The proposed revision of Regulation S.K represents the evolution of that regulation Into
a repository of uniform disclosure pro.
visions relating to substantially all of the
informatIon required to be set forth in registration statements under the Securities
Act and In annual and other periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act.
Disclosure requirements would be centralized in Regulation S-K in order to aVOId
the need to refer to multiple sources for
document content requirements. Thus,
certain disclosure requirements currently
included in the GUIdes, in Regulation C and

10 various Securities Act registration forms
and Exchange Act forms would now be
moved to Regulation S-K
The Regulatlon S-K release also represented the completion of the "sunset"
review of the Guides. In addition to moving
certain substantive GUIde provisions to
Regulation S-K, the "sunset" review of the
Guides resulted in the inclusion of certain
procedural provisions in Regulation C and
the deletion of 50 percent of the Guides
as obsolete. The only remaining Guides
would be those relating to specific 10dustries, where greater flexibility than that
provided by formal Cornmission rules is
desirable.
Recision of Requleiion C and 12£317

The rules comprismg Regulation C and
Regulation 126 were adopted 10 order to
standardize the mechanics of secunties registration under the Securities Act and Exchange Act, respectively. The rules implement the statutes and provide more specific instructions for registrants than are contained in the statutes. Although these regulations developed over a long period, no
overall review of their provisions had been
undertaken for some time. The Cornrrussion believed a comprehensive review of
Regulation C and Regulation 126 was appropriate at this time in order to implement fully the integrated disclosure system
and to continue the Commission's ongoing
"sunset" review of its regulations.
The proposed amendments are designed to simplify and clarify procedural requirements and to conform the provisions of Regulation C and Regulation 126
to the procedures established 10 the integrated disclosure system. These amendments involve revising existing provisions, incorporatinq
certain procedural requirements from the Guides and
the current registration forms into Regulation C, and rnovmq certain Regulation C
provisions relating to substantive disclosure and document content into Regulation S-K, The "sunset" amendments, which
would revise, up-date or delete provisions
where appropriate, include the proposed

rescission of approximately 25 percent of
the rules now contained in Regulation C.
Delayed or Continuous Offenngs78Proposed Rule 462A, which was first published in the December 1980 GUIdes release. would facihtate new methods of flnancing. For the first time, the Commission
would speofy by rulemakmg the conditions
under which registrants could register se.
cunties to be offered on a delayed or con.
tinuous basis at the market (so-called" shelf
registration"). The proposal would codify
staff practice concemmg
"traditronal"
shelf offenngs, such as securities to be offered in a contmumq acquisition program.
It would also permit, for the first tirne, the
reqrstratron of secunties that the Issuer did
not intend to offer immediately to the public
or that it intended to sell gradually on a nonfixed price basis over time depending on
market conditions. The proposed rule
would permit an issuer to sell the secunties so reqistered in a succession of different kinds of offerings. The proposed shelf
rule is designed to reheve processmg pressures upon the Cornrmssion staff and to
facilitate capital formation by granting issuers ready access to the markets.
Llabtllty lssuesv-« Because the secunties markets absorb previously filed information about seasoned issuers, the
Cornrrussion has determined, as part of the
mtegrated disclosure system, to permit
such Issuers to satisfy certarn disclosure
requirements of the Securities Act by 10corporatlng by reference into the reqistration statement pertinent information, up.
dated where necessary, from previously
filed Exchange Act reports (See discussron of Forms 5-1, 5-2 and 5-3 above)
Nevertheless, persons subject to Section
11 of the Secuntres Act will continue to be
responsible for confirming the accuracy of
mforrnation 10 the reqistration statement,
including information incorporated by reference. The Cornrrnssion pubhshed for
comment several proposals addressing the
questions of liability which anse 10 the
context of the integrated disclosure system.
Proposed Rule 176 would codity Section
19

1704(g) of the draft Federal Securites
Code as modified and approved by the
Commission in 1980. The proposed rule
would Identify certain Circumstances, including Incorporation by reference, which
may bear upon the determination of what
constitutes reasonable Investigation and
reasonable ground for belief as those terms
are used in Section 11. The Commission
also proposed to codify in Regulation C
certain previously proposed provisions reo
garding the effective date of documents incorporated by reference and the making
of statements modifying or superseding
such incorporated documents.
Security Ratings-The rating assigned
to a class of debt securities or preferred
stock by a professional rating organization
represents, along with the interest or dividend rate, one of the most significant con.
siderations in an investor's decision to pur'
chase such secunties. In recognition of this
fact, the Commission proposed to permit
the voluntary disclosure of such ratings in
filings with the Commission. The security
rating release contained two proposals to
facilitate this change In policy: an exernptive rule conceming the issues of expert's
consent and Securities Act liability (Rule
436(g); and an amendment to Rule 134
permitting the disclosure of ratings in
"tombstone" advertisements. The release
also set forth the Commission's views reo
garding other mformation which should be
included WIth disclosure of the security
rating.
Coordinating ReLeases-As part of Its
efforts to implement a comprehensive integrated disclosure system, the Commission
proposed to amend existing Securities Act
registration forms," These proposed
amendments were the result of a review of
existing forms that was designed: (1) to
identify portions of such forms where the
Regulation S-K uniform disclosure items
could be substituted for individual form
items containing substantially similar requirements; (2) to conform existing references to Regulation S.K with the proposed
revisions thereto; and (3) to conform other

20

Securities Act forms, wherever possible, to
the instructions, format and requirements
of proposed Forms S-l, S.2 and S.3. In addition, the Commission proposed to rescind five rarely used registration forms.
The Commission also proposed amend.
ments resulting from an examination of Exchange Act continuous disclosure and
proxy-related rules, forms and schedules.v
This review was undertaken with a view to
coordination with other aspects of the integration rule making program, particularly
the revision of Regulation S.K, as well as
WIth a view to streamlining and improving
the quality of Exchange Act disclosure,
which is critical to the functioning of the integrated disclosure system. As in the Securities Act context, the Commission pro.
posed to rescind six rarely used forms,
three for registration and three for annual
reporting.
The Exchange Act coordinating release
also proposed amendments to broaden
and clarify the scope of safe harbor protection available under the various secunties
laws for disclosure of forward looking statements. The release proposed correcting an
inconsistency in the scope of the rules, as
currently in effect, to permit projections in
first-time Exchange Act registrations as well
as Securities Act registrations.
FinaLPhase of Program-The period for
public comment upon the eight outstanding proposals descnbed above closed on
October 30, 1981. The Commission intended to take final action with respect to
these proposals as soon as possible in order to set in place the completed integrated
disclosure system.

Selective Review
In anticipation of the final phase of irnplementation of the Commission's integrated
disclosure program and m response to
budgetary constraints, the Division of Corporation Finance during the course of fiscal
1981 significantly revised its program for
the examination of filings under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act by implementing a system of" selective review". The

purpose of this system is to allocate more

staff resources to the examination of Exchange Act reports, which fonn the basis
for the integrated disclosure system. Selective review is also designed to make optimal
use of the Division's staff by focusing staff
review attention upon filings which are
most likely to present problems in the area
of full disclosure. To those ends, only filings
for certain types of transactions, such as
"new issues," non-issuer tender offers, and
contested director elections, are generally
examined without regard to the company
involved. This will free staff resources to
pennit more comprehensive examinations
of the entire scope of certain companies'
disclosure. Staff examination of other filings reflects the economic conditions prevailing at the time, areas of particular concem to the Division, and existing staff levels.
Selective review follows the Division's reorganization in 1980 which focused the activities of staff groups on particular industries. By making the staff more familiar with
the disclosure problems of companies in
particular industries, "industry centralization" laid the groundwork for implementation of the selective review system.

Sman Business
The Office of Small Business Policy m
the Division of Corporation Finance was established in June 1979, to coordinate the
Commission's small business rulemaking
and legislative initiatives, to review and
comment upon the impact of rule proposals on small business, and to serve as liaison with Congressional committees, government agencies and other groups concerned with small business. Since its inception, the Office has initiated several comprehensive projects designed to address
and alleviate, to a degree consistent with
the public interest and the protection of investors, the problems confronted by small
business in raising capital.
Regulation D-During fiscal 1981, the
Commission detennined to evaluate the
Securities Act exemptive scheme in light of
recent amendments to the Securities Act

occasioned by the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 198()83 (the Incentive
Act), and the VIews expressed by commentators at the Commission's Small
Business Hearings held m 1978. Specifically, the Incentive Act significantly increased
the Section 3(b) dollar ceiling and authonzed the Commission, pursuant to newly
created Section 19(c), to work with the
states to develop a umform exemption
Thus, on December 23, 1980, the Commission announced that It was considering
the Interrelationship among certain exemptions from the registration provisions of the
Securities Act and the utihty of such exemptions as they relate to the capital formatron
needs of small business.s"
As a result of the public hearings, the
comments received In response to the December 23, 1980 release, and discussions
with the North American Securities Administrators Associanon (NASM), in August
1981 , the Commission proposed for comment a new regulation, proposed Regulation [)85, governing the offers and sales of
certain seeurities without registration under
the Securities Act. This action represents a
major effort by the Commission to make
the various limited offering provisions and
the requirements for private offers and
sales of seeunties more unifonn and to
coordinate the small offenng requirements under the Federal and state secunties laws to alleviate the burden of those regulations upon capital formation by small
business. The regulation, If adopted, would
replace and significantly revise the existing
limited offering exemptions contained In
Securities Act Rules 146,240 and 242.
In conjunction with its examination of the
Securities Act exemptive rules, and as provided for In newly created Section 19(c) of
the Securities Act, the Division of Corpora.
tion Finance has had discussions with
NASM

to develop the proposed regula-

tion, which is Intended to be adopted, in
part, as a uniform Federal-state exemption.
As a result of this cooperative effort, the
NASM Board of Directors has solicited
21

comment on the proposed exemptions
from the NASM
membership and approved a uniform state limited offering
exemption closely paralleling the relevant
portion of Regulaoon D. The Commission
and NASM believe the uniform limited offering exemptive scheme WIll reduce the
burdens on small Issuers by eliminating, in
most instances, the multiplicity of regulations imposed at both the state and Federal
levels.
Form S-18- The Office of Small Bustness Policy is responsible for monitonng
the content and quality of disclosure in offerings made on Form S-18 (which was
adopted in April, 197986) as the simplified
Securities Act reqistration procedure for
small business. Form S-18 calls for substantially less narrative and financial disclosure than Form S'l , which is the form
such Issuers would otherwise use for registration of their securities. However, In view
of the experimental nature of Form S-18
and the initiation of regional processing, its
availability was limited to certain domestic
and Canadian corporate issuers for the registration of securities up to $5 million. In
f.'\arch 1981, on the basis of relatively widespread acceptance of the form and the absence of any significant disclosure problems, the Commission adopted amendments to Form S-18 to expand the availability of the form to certain companies engaged In the mining business." Additionally, at the end of the year, the Commission
was considering proposing certain amendments to Form S-18, which, If adopted,
would further expand the availability of
Form S-18 to non-corporate issuers and to
those issuers who engage or intend to engage In oil and gas related operations. In
this regard, disclosure provisions applicable to these types of issuers will also be proposed.
Classifymg of Issuers-On June 2,
1980, the Commission announced that it
was considerinq the advisability of classifying issuers under the Exchange Act so that
defined classes of smaller issuers might
have modified reporting and other require-

22

ments.88 This effort was undertaken in order to determine whether the burden of
compliance with Exchange Act reporting
requirements, which is relatively greater for
smaller companies, might be alleviated
without detriment to Investor protection.
The Commission, mindful of the Report
of the Advisory Committee on Corporate
Disclosure, the views expressed by witnesses at the public hearings held by the Commission in Apnl and f.'\ay of 1978, and the
comments received regarding the June
1980 advance notice release, intended to
propose in October 1981 a system of classifying small issuers for purposes of
exempting them from certain obligations
under the Exchange Act. Generally speaking, the classification system would represent an inflationary adjustment to the $1
million asset figure of Section 12(g) established by Congress in 1964. (After the close
of the fiscal year on October 20, 1981, the
Commission issued a release proposing for
comment rule and form amendments
which would implement this system of classification of smaller issuers.")
Regulation
A- The
Commission's
small business hearings of April and f.'\ay
1978 also addressed the continued viability
of Regulaoon A as an altemative to full
registration. Commentators at the hearings
consistently indicated the need to revise
and update the requirements of Regulation
A to make it a more practical means for
small business to raise capital.
In response to these comments, on December 23, 1980, the Commission proposed a comprehensive revision and reformatting of the Regulation A disclosure provisions designed to codify disclosure standards which were being applied to Regulation A offenngs, to provide specific disclosure requirements for different types of issuers and different types of offerings, and to
assist the administration of uniform disclosure policies.90 The proposed revisions were
adopted in final form on August 7, 1981. 91
Section 4(6)-The
Incentive Act provided several statutory changes in the Securities Act which have an impact on small

business capital formation, one of which
was the adoption of new Section 4(6). That
section provides an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities
Act for offers and sales of securities by an
issuer solely to accredited investors, without any public solicitation, if the aggregate
amount of securities offered IS$5 million or
less. In connection therewith the issuer ISrequired to file a notice of sales with the Commission on such forms as the Commission
shall prescribe.
In order to permit issuers to utilize Section 4(6) promptly after the enactment of
the Incentive Act, the Commission adopted, on an interim basis, a notice-of-sales
form to be used by issuers relying on the
new statutory exernptlon." The final form,
Form 4(6), was adopted on March 19,
1981.93
In an effort to further the utihty of Section
4(6), the Commission, in conjunction with
proposed Regulation 0 and pursuant to the
statutory language of Section 2(15 )(ii), has
proposed new Rule 215 which would, if
adopted, define "accredited investor" for
purposes of that exemption.
Rule 242-Rule
242, adopted under
Section 3(b) of the Securities Act, provides
an exemption from registration for sales of
securities by domestic or Canadian corporate issuers to an unlimited number of accredited persons, as defined in the rule, and
to 35 non-accredited persons.
In the release adopting Rule 24294, the
Commission stated that the rule was in the
nature of an experiment, and that after an
appropriate period, consideration would be
given to determining whether the availability of the rule should be expanded. Since
Rule 242 requires that non-accredited investors receive the same kind of information as that specified in Part I of Form 5-18,
the restrictions on the issuers ehgible to
use the rule were consistent with similar restrictions as to the availability of Form 5-18.
The Commission went on to indicate that if
revisions as to eligibility for registration on
Form 5-18 were effected, it was possible
that changes in the Rule 242 definition of

"qualified Issuer" would be marie. When
the Commission adopted amendments to
Form 5-18 in order to permit certain Issuers
engaged In mining operations to register
their securities on that form and to include
a new disclosure item apphcable to such ISsuers, In accordance WIth its stated pohcy
regarding Rule 242, the Commission authorized the publication of a release proposing to expand the availablhty of Rule
242 by deleting the exclusion relating to
mining companies appeanng In Rule
242(a)(5)(iii) and the Note thereto." The reVIsions were adopted In final form on June
11,1981.96
Trust Indenture Act of 1939- The Incentive Act included, among other measures, amendments to Sections 304(a)(8)
and 304(a)(9) of the Trust Indenture Act of
1939, the substance of which was submitted by the Commission as a legislative proposal. These amendments provided an increase to the aggregate amount of debt securities that could be offered and remain
partially or totally exempt from the provisions of that Act. On October 23, 1980, the
Commission adopted rules, on an interim
basis and pursuant to the above enumerated sections, which established $2 milhon
and $5 million, respectively, as the dollar
hmitation on the amount of debt secunties
that could be offered without qualification
under that Act.97 These interim rules were
adopted to remain in effect until December
31, 1981. The Commission adopted the fi.
nal rules prior to that expiration date.
Studies Involving Small Issuers-Two
joint small business projects were completed by the Commission's Directorate of
Economic and Pohcy Analysis (the Directorate) in 1981. A project with the Department of Commerce's Experimental
Technology Incentives Program (ETIP),
that was begun in 1977, examined the capital market environment for small issuers,
particularly the high technology issuers
which often have venture capital financing.
Several of the Commission's regulatory initiatives regarding these firms were examined, Including usage of Form S-18. The
23

project also encompassed a variety of other
studies related to small issuers which have
been published as Capital Market Working
Papers by the Directorate.
As part of the ETIP project the Commission released the results of another study of
the use of form 5-18,98prepared by the Directorate. The report updated the Directorate's initial study covering the first nine
months of the registration form's use.
Since its April 3, 1979, adoption, form
S-18 has become the predominant reqistration statement used for smaller initial public offerings of common stock and has
been especially popular for use by l'startup" firms. The report also examined the financial characteristics of Issuers utihzing
form S-18, the distribution arrangements
and costs associated with its use, and the
post-offering price performance of secunues sold in offenngs reqistered using the
form.
A second joint project WIth the Small
Business Administration examined the role
of regional brokers as underwriters of the
imtial public offerings of small businesses.
This project broke new ground in examining the market-making and securities reo
search support activities of the securities industry for these stocks.99 The final segment
of this project, which is examining the experience of small issuers with several of the
Commission's small offerings exemptions
from registration, was bemg completed as
the fiscal year ended.
The Directorate has also published the
results of its monitonng of the first six
months of the availability of Rule 242,100
and is completIng a study of the use of Regulation A. The Regulation A study is focus.
ing on the effects of the 1978 increase from
$500,000 in the aggregate dollar amount
ceihng constraining the size of Regulation A
offerings. The study also analyzes issuer
and offenng characteristics, issuance costs
and after-offering price performance of se.
curities sold in Regulation A offerings.
Another study being undertaken by the
Directorate is of the use of Rule 146 by is.
suers during 1980. Rule 146, which is used

24

primarily by small business, was adopted
by the Commission as a "safe harbor" rule
to provide objective standards upon which
businessmen may rely in raising capital under the private placement exemption provided in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act

Amendments

to

Proxy

RuLes-On february 5, 1981, the Commission proposed for public comment'?'
amendments to the disclosure require.
ments for proxy statements contained in
Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act and
Regulation S-K, relating to: (1) business
and other relationships between directors
and companies; (2) full board consideration of shareholder nominations; (3) the
vote needed for election to office; (4) management indebtedness and remuneration;
and (5) beneficial ownership. In addition,
the Commission proposed amendments to
Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 conceming proposals of security holders. The proposals,
which were based. in large part, on recommendations contained in the Staff Report
on Corporate Accountability issued by the
Division of Corporation FInance in 1980
(the Accountability Report)102, were designed to improve disclosure and to reduce
compliance burdens on registrants.
The amendments to Schedule 14A were
reproposed without change as part of, the
integration proposals in order to give commentators the opportunity to view them in
the context of those other proposed actions.103 The comment period was thus ex.
tended to October 3D, 1981.
Proxy Monitonng Program-In February 1981, the Division of Corporation FInance was authorized to publish a release
announcing the results of its 1980 proxy
disclosure monitoring program.t?' The
analysis of disclosures conceming corporate boards of directors indicated that since
1979. there have been increases In the
number of boards with nominating com.
mittees, the average number of board

meetings per year, and the average amount
of compensation paid to directors by the
1,100 Issuers surveyed. The release also reported a substantial decrease in the number of Issuers which had their investment
banker or outside counsel serving as a
director.
Shareholder Communications-In
April 1981 , on the baSISof a recommendation contained in the Accountability Report,
the Commission established an Advisory
Committee on Shareholder Comrnurucations.IOS This Committee, composed of professionals from business, banking and the
securities industry, was created for the purpose of advising the Director of the Division
of Corporation Finance on questions relating to the development of better procedures for Issuers to communicate WIth the
beneficial owners of securities registered m
the name of a broker-dealer, bank or other
nominee.
Amendments to Rule 144-ln October
of 1980, the Commission proposed.l'" and
in February 1981 adopted.l'" amendments
to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which
provides a method for resales of unregistered securities and securities held byaffilrates of an issuer. The amendments relieve
nonaffiliates, who have held their securities
for three years or more, from certain provisions of the rule which limit the amount of
securities which they can sell, restrict the
manner in which they can dispose of the securities and require a Form 144 to be filed
in connection with such sales. Because of
the successful operation of Rule 144 since
its onginal adoption in 1972, the Commission believed that It was appropnate to lessen the burdens of the rule on non-affiliates.
Proposed Amendments
to Rule
13e-3-Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange
Act applies to certain transactions by public
issuers or their affiliates which result in one
or more classes of equity securities of the issuer no longer having the attributes of public ownership. As a result of its experience in
administering Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act relating to so-called "going pnvate" transactions, in April 1981 the Com-

mission published for comment proposed
amendments to the rule and related Schedule 13E-3.1081f adopted, certain of the.proposals would codify staff interpretations
and practice respecting existing exceptions
for (1 ) transactions pursuant to a multi-step
plan for the acquisition of a class of equity
securities of an Issuer by or on behalf of a
person who becomes an affiliate of such issuer prior to the consummation of the last
step; and (2) the use of a cash election in
connection with certam transactions otherwise excepted from the operation of the
rule. Other proposals would make clarifyIng and technical changes to Improve the
operation of the rule.
Eninronmentsl Dtsclosure-Dtv May 4,
198 I, the Commission proposed for public
comment amendments to its regulations
regarding disclosure of environmental
proceedings 109 The proposals would: (I)
establish a threshold for companies'
omission of disclosure about certain environrnental proceedings to which a
governmental authority IS a party and (2)
require that registrants provide Interested
investors with the names and addresses of
the governmental authorities from which
compliance related reports about disclosable environmental proceedings can be obtamed. Because the current requirements
have resulted in the disclosure of environmental proceedings which are not siqnif
cant, the Commission believes that the
amendments will improve the quality and
unhty of environmental disclosure to shareholders while reducing burdens on corporanons drsclosmq environmental proceedmcs,
International Corporation FinanceThe Commission proposed'!" and adopted'!' amendments to the exemptive regulations for primary distributions of securities
Issued by the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (the Banks). The amendments permit the Banks to sell their securities immediately upon filing certain information with the Commission instead of

25

waiting a penod of seven days. The purpose
of the amendments was to give the Banks
the same flexibility in reaching the financial
markets as Issuers of registered securities
are developing under the integrated disclosure program.

Real Estate Guidelines-Dunng

1981,

the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance continued Its cooperation with the
Subcommittee on Financial Statement and
Track Record Disclosure of the NASAA in
developing revised disclosure require.
ments for public real estate programs. This
cooperative effort resulted in proposals that
would revise the track record disclosure
guidelines of the Commission's Guide 60
for" Preparation of Registration Statements
Relating to Interests in Real Estate Lirmted
Partnerships" and would amend the financial statement requirements of Item 3.14 of
Regulation SOX concermnq "Special In.
structions for Real Estate Operations to be
Acquired." The proposals would standardize and streamline prospectus presentation of the pnor expenence of sponsors of
public real estate programs by setting forth
specific gUidelines as to the type and quantity of disclosure required. The proposed
amendment to Item 3.14 of Regulation SOX
would reduce the requirement for financial
statements of significant properties acquired by a real estate program from three
years to one year If certain conditions are
met by the issuer. (Mer the close of the fiscal year, on October 7, 1981, the proposals
were published for public cornment.UOther Rule-Making-On September I,
1981, the Commission adopted amend.
ments to Rule 463 and related Form SR under the Securities Act, which require filings
by Issuers with respect to their first reqistranon statement disclosmq their sales of securines and uses of proceeds. I13The major
changes consisted of: standardization of
Form SR to a short-answer format; Inclusion of a matenality standard for disclosure
of differences between actual uses of proceeds and the uses stated in the prospectus; clanfication of the time for filing reports
and the filing requirement for certain sue-

26

cessor issuers; and addition of several
exemptions from the filing requirement.

Interpretive Advice
Concomitant to the Commission's rule.
makIng function is the role which its staff
plays in providinq interpretive advice con.
cernmq the Federal secunties laws and the
rules thereunder. In the area of full disclosure, the staff provides such advice through
responses to telephone Inquiries (an estimated 45,000 in fiscal 1981 ) and written reo
sponses to formal requests for advice (an
estimated 1,600 through the year). During
fiscal 1981, the Commission also pub.
Iished several interpretive releases in the
area of full disclosure with the aim of providIng reference sources for the public in areas
of general concem.lt is hoped that these reo
leases will also reduce the need for individualized staff responses, thus making bet.
ter use of the staff s resources.
Employee Benefit Plans-On January
15, 1981,114the Commission authorized
the publication of staff Interpretive advice
conceming several aspects of employee
benefit plans This release supplemented
an earlier, extensive release discussing reg.
istration of Interests In employee benefit
plans and related tOPICS.1I5 The supple.
mental release discussed four major
topics: (1) applicability of the Securities
Act registration provisions to specific types
of plans, such as Tax Reduction Act Stock
Option Plans and open-market stock pur.
chase plans; (2) aspects of the exemption
from Securities Act registration provided by
Section 3(a)(2) of that Act; (3) plan sales
and participant resales of stock; and (4)
simplification of procedures connected
With reqistranons on Form S-8.
Going Private Transactions-On April
17, 1981, concurrent with its publication of
proposed amendments to Rule 13e-3 (see
above), the Commission published the
views of the Division of Corporation Flnance on various interpretive questions reo
gardlng the rule and related Schedule
13E-3 under the Exchange Act.116The principal matters discussed in the release were:

(1 ) the kinds of transactions which are subject to the rule; (2) the persons subject to
the filing, disclosure and disserrunation provisions of the rule; (3) the scope of the Rule
13e-3 exceptions; and (4) the nature and
tirrunq of the Schedule 13e-3 disclosure requirements.
Insider Tradmg and Reports-On September 23, 1981, the Commission authorized the publication of a comprehensive interpretative release treating various aspects
of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the
rules thereunder.'!"
Section 16 requires
corporate "insiders" to disclose transactions in their companies' securities and for
the recovery by the corporation of "shortswing" profits made by insiders through
such transactions. While the release addressed a wide variety of issues arising In
this area of the Federal securities laws, it devoted particular attention to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, which regulates the
applicability of Section 16 to employee
stock purchase plans, bonus and option
plans and other similar arrangements.
Retail Repurchase Agreements-During September 1981, the Cornrmssron authorized the publication of staff positIons
concerning the applicability of the Secunties Act registration provisions to so-called
"retail repurchase agreements" issued by
banks and savings and loan associations.I'" The Commission determined to
address this area in light of the volume of inquiries from financial institutions, prompted by the increase in the use of "retail repos'' as a means of raismq short-term capital. While the staff took the position that the
Securities Act registration requirements
would not apply to the offer and sale of retail
repos, it emphasized the applicability of the
antifraud provisions of the Federal secunties laws to such transactions.
Other Interpretive Releases-During
the course of fiscal 1981, the Commission
authorized the Issuance of other interpretive releases in the area of full disclosure on
a variety of specific topics. These included:
(1 ) procedures for requesting specific interpretations or "no action" positions'P; (2) a

simplified form of trust indenture'>, (3) the
distnbution of proxy materials to beneficial
shareownersv': and (4) option and optionrelated transactions during underwritten
offerings.122

Accounting Matters
Oversight of the Accountmg

Profes-

sion- The Commission has continued to
actively monitor and encourage private sector initiatives to Implement meaningful selfregulation of accountants practicmq before
the Comrrussron, to mamtam the independ
ence of auditors, and to establish and improve accounting and auditing standards.
The objective of the Commission's oversight activities is to assure that the accounting profession continues to make progress
In lrnprovmq the integnty and credibility of
financial reporting by public entities.
For the past three years, the Commission
has submitted to Congress separate comprehensive reports on the accounting profession and the Commission's oversight
role. These reports commented on the accounting profession's response to the various challenges which Congress and others
had placed before it and on the Commission's own Initiatives in this area. Dunng the
current fiscal year, the Cornrrussion deterrmned that it was not necessary to issue a
separate report on the accounting profession, Rather, It believes that this annual report IS the appropnate forum in which to
comment on the developments withm the
accounting profession, and to assess the
degree to which the profession IS meeting
the challenges it faces.
During the past year, the accounting profession continued to make progress in implementing a meaningful system of self-regulation. This effort represents a major
commitment on the part of the professron,
and the Commission continues to actively
support and encourage its continuing
evolution. Although additional expenence
is necessary In order to form a conclusion
as to the ultimate success of the profession's self-regulatory irutiatives, the Comrrussion believes that they have great poten-

27

tial for achieving improvements in the quality of audit practice, and thus, sigmficantly
adding to the credibility of financial
reportinq.
With respect to the standard-settIng processes of the pnvate sector, the Commission continues to believe that the initiatIve
for establishing and improving accounting
and auditIng standards should remain in
the private sector, subject to Commission
oversight. The Commission reaffirms its
strong support of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB). The Commission believes that the FASB must continue
its efforts to provide leadership and take
timely action in controversial areas, and
that members of the accountIng profession
and the business community must continue to support the FASB' s decisions and
partIcipate In the standard-setting process.
The Commission also continues to believe
that the Auditing Standards Board (ASB)
has generally performed In a satIsfactory
manner.
Although the Commission
acknowledges that significant progress has been
made by the private sector self-regulatory
organizations, the Commission's statutory
responsibilIty for the integnty of the financial information disseminated by public
companies requires that It be concerned
with the accounting principles underlying
that informatIon, the auditIng standards by
which it is reviewed, and the independence
and competency of the profession which
performs that review. The Commission will
continue to seek to fulfill its responsibilIty by
close oversight of the various private sector
initiatives, but will not hesrtate to take appropriate action if necessary.
SEC Practice Section-In 1977, the
American Institute of CertIfied Public Accountants (A1CPA) established the Division
for CPA Firms. The Division is a voluntary
organization for accounting firms and consists of two sections-the Private Companies Practice Section and the SEC Practice
Section (SECPS). The SECPS has membership requirements that are designed to
improve the qualIty of practice by account-

28

ing firms that audit the financial statements
of companies which file registration statements and reports with the Commission.
The SECPS's member firms collectIvely
audit the financial statements of approximately 9,000 registrants, including virtually
all companies listed on the national stock
exchanges.
The Commission believes that the peer
review program is the most important element In this self-regulatory initiative. The
periodic peer reviews test for compliance
with the SECPS's membership requirements, including a determination as to
whether or not the firm is maintaining and
applying an appropriate system of quality
control. During the fiscal year, approximately 150 peer reviews were conducted
pursuant to SECPS requirements. This
compares with a total of about 50 reviews
during the previous two years. The Commission's staff has reviewed a sample of the
public reports and comment letters reflecting the results of the peer reviews, as well as
the oversight files of the Public Oversight
Board (POB). The POB is an independent
body responsible for monitoring and evaluatIng the activities of the SECPS. The
Commission's staff is encouraged by the
results of its review because they suggest
that: (a) the standards for performing and
reportIng on peer reviews are appropriate;
(b) the standards are being meaningfully
applied; and (c) the POB is actively monitoring the peer review process.
Starting with the approximately 250 peer
reviews scheduled to be completed during
fiscal year 1982, the Commission's staff will
have the opportunity-under
an access arrangement which has been agreed to by
the SECPS and the Comrnissron-e-to
review a sample of certain working papers
prepared by the reviewers in support of the
results of their review. The objective of the
staff s access to peer review working papers
is to enable the Comrnission to reach an informed judgment as to the adequacy and
application of the peer review standards,
and the extent of reliance which can be
placed on the work of the POB consistent

with the Commission's oversight responsibilities. Based on its experience to date, the
Commission's staff expects that the Commission will be able to place substantial reliance on the POS's oversight function.
The SECPS is empowered to impose
sanctions on member firms for failure to
comply with membership requirements.
Sanctions may be imposed as a result of
monitoring specific alleged or possible
audit failures, or as a result of serious quality control deficiencies uncovered during
peer reviews. The POS has reported that
while the SECPS has made significant
progress in establishing operational procedures for monitoring audit failures, it is too
early to draw any conclusions regarding the
effectiveness of this aspect of the SECPS's
disciplinary program.l23 With respect to
deficiencies noted dunnq peer reviews, the
SECPS's emphasis to date has largely been
on remedial steps- such as voluntary
agreements to correct deficiencies and
undergo additional professional education
or follow-up peer reviews. While such a
remedial approach appears to make sense,
the SECPS must be prepared to take more
stringent actions if warranted in order to
ensure the credibility of its disciplinary procedures.
The Commission continues to agree
with the POS that all accounting firms
which audit publicly-held
companies
should participate in the accounting profession's self-regulatory proqrarn.P' In this
connection, the Commission encourages
the SECPS to continue to explore ways in
which to facilitate membership. Membership in an organization such as the
SECPS-with
attendant peer review and
other meaningful membership requirements-should
provide investors and
clients with the requisite degree of assurance that member firms consistently
conduct their accounting and auditing
practice in accordance with professional
standards. While membership
cannot
guarantee that there will be no future audit
failures, it should reduce the likelihood of
such failures. If and when audit failures

occur, the Commission expects they will be
due to isolated breakdowns or "people
problems," and not to inherent deficiencies
in firms' systems of quality control.
The POS has stated its belief that since
the principle objectives of the Division for
CPA Arms are improvement of the profession and protection of the public, the public
is entitled to know the identity of firms that
are members of the Division and the type of
standards with which they must comply.125
The Commission agrees that it may be important that investors know whether a registrant's auditor is a member of a recognized and effective self-regulatory organization. Therefore, the Commission endorses
the decision of the A1CPA Council to pub.
lish a directory of accounting firms that are
members of the Division for CPA Arms.
FASB Activities-The
FASS has continued its efforts to develop and improve
the financial accounting and reporting
standards upon which financial reporting
is based. A number of statements and
interpretations were issued during the past
year, and the FASS's agenda currently
includes various significant projects such
as: (a) development of a conceptual framework for financial accounting and reporting
by business enterprises; (b) reconsideration of a standard on accounting for foreign
currency translation; (c) consideration of
employers' accounting for pensions and
other post-employment benefits; (d) consideration of the extent to which the ratemaking process should affect the application of financial accounting standards to
companies in certain regulated industries;
(e) development of a cohesive and comprehensive set of disclosures about oil and gas
exploration and producing activities; and
(f) extraction of specialized accounting and
reporting practices in the A1CPA statements of position and guides on accounting and auditing matters. The FASS is also
continuing its efforts to provide timely
guidance on various implementation and
practice problems.
The Commission's staff has closely
monitored the FASS's activities during the

29

year. A description of certain FASB
projects follows.
(J) Conceptual Framework-Shortly
following its creation in 1973, the FASB
began the task of developing a conceptual
framework for business enterprises. This
project was not an entirely new effort, but It
was the first time that significant resources
were dedicated to the planned development of a comprehensive body of concepts
intended to undergrid financial accounting
and reportmq,
A unified body of concepts that support
financial accounting and reporting and
facilitate the process of finding solutions
to emerging problems would provide logical order and uniformity to the process of
standard-setting. Ideally, a conceptual
framework would lead to the elimination of
alternative pnnciples and practices and
contribute to increased comparability of
financial
Information
among
diverse
business enterpnses.
Although, as In prior years, deadlines In
the project's timetable were missed, some
progress was made. During the year, two
statements In the concepts series were
issued which identified and defined the ten
Interrelated
elements
that
comprise
flnencial statements, and the objectives of
financial reporting by nonbusiness organizations. Additionally, the FASB published
two research studies related to the recoqrubon phase of the project, and held public
heanngs on the funds flows, liquidity and
financial flexibility phase.
In the coming year, the FASB expects to
Issue a statement of financial accounting
concepts which will combine in a single
pronouncement the interrelated phases
of reporting eamings and funds flows,
liquidity and financial flexibility. The display
of eamings and funds flows data IS also
under active consideration. At least one
discussion memorandum regarding the
issues to be considered in the recognitIon
phase is also expected dunng 1982. Work
on the measurement-of-elements phase of
the conceptual framework project should
extend beyond 1982.

30

The FASB's work on a conceptual framework is now at a critical stage. The fundamental conceptual issues identified WIth
reporting earrunqs and funds flows, including the display of this information,
have been under active consideration for
several years. Work on the difficult areas of
accounting recognition and measurement
of the elements of financial statements has
been started, but delays persist and meaninqful solutions continue to be elusive. It
is possible that the FASB's success in
resolving the conceptual issues related to
recognition and measurement may determine the ultimate success or failure of the
conceptual framework project.
The FASB believes that the progress
made to date on the framework does assist
In its deliberations on specific standards.
Substantial completion of the project-that
is, the point where it becomes a visible aid
in the reporting process-does
not, however, appear to be a near-term prospect.
Thus, the FASB should continually assess
Its resource allocations to ensure that work
on specific accounting issues which have
been Identified as needing the board's
attention-such
as accounting for income
taxes and consolidation accounting- is not
being mappropnately postponed. While the
Commission continues to believe that the
development of a conceptual framework is
worthwhile, the FASB's major objective
should be to provide timely guidance on
major Issues and emerging accounting
problems which constantly arise in a
dynamic financial reporting environment.
In addition, work on some of the major
accounting Issues currently facing the
financial community, including the FASB's
project on accounting for pensions by
employers, may aid in the future development of recognition and measurement
concepts
The Commission will continue to work
with the FASB by offenng its comments
and observations as this process continues
to evolve.
(2) Financial Reportmg and Changing

Prices- During the past two years, certain
large, publicly-held enterprises have disclosed supplementary
information
regarding the effects of changing prices
under the FASS's Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 33 (FAS 33).
FAS 33 requires information regarding
both operations and financial position on
two bases-constant
dollar accounting
and current cost accounting. This year, the
Commission revised its rules to specifically require disclosure pursuant to FAS 33
10 certain registration statements, annual
reports on Form lO-K and annual reports
subject to the proxy rules and certain proxy
statements.
FAS 33 does not require current cost
Information for specialized assets associated with unprocessed natural resources
and income-producing real estate. However, it was supplemented dunng the past
year by three new statements which cover
the specialized assets in those industries.
Two of the new statements merely extended the interim provisions of FAS
33 for certain specialized assets- incomeproducing real estate and timberlands and
growing timber- so that current-cost
based data remains optional for these
assets and related depreciation, depletion
and amortization. The remaining statement
Imposes a requirement for current-cost
information for the specialized assets 10 the
oil and gas and hard mmerals industries.
Accounting for the effects of changing
prices is not a settled area 10 accounting
theory or practlce. Consequently, the FASS
issued FAS 33 before the definitional,
conceptual and display issues were fully
settled, and decided to reexamine the
issues after a five-year period of experimentation. In June 1981, the FASS issued
an invitation to comment regardmg research needed on reporting the effects of
changing prices in order to provide information about cost/benefit assessments,
use of the data, behavioral effects, and
indicated needs for change in the manner
in which the data are derived and communicated.

High rates of mflation seriously impair
the ability of financial statements, which are
predicated on historical cost/ nominal
dollars, to indicate eamings available for
expansion or distribution to owners. The
FASS made a significant breakthrough in
private sector standard-setting process
10 issuing FAS 33. The Commission recogruzes the importance of coordinated
research 10 this important area of financial
reporting. Preparers and users of financial
Information should be joined by auditors,
academics and others 10 providing useful
empirical data and opmions on the issues
identified in the FASS's invitation to comment. The ultimate success in achieving
disclosure of useful information concerning the effects of changing prices should
not be dependent entirely on the efforts of
the FASS. The business community and
the accounting profession should be partners WIth the FASS in this effort through
their contributions of time and talent to
relevant research and experimentation.
Other Siqnuicsni Financial Reporting
Issues- During the past year, the Commission continued to be actIvely involved with
several important
financial
reporting
issues. These include' (l) the efforts to
achieve more useful financial reporting for
oil and gas producing companies; (2) the
private sector's initiatives regardmg voluntary reporting on internal accounting
control; and (3) the evolving area of
supplemental financial Information and the
question of appropriate auditor association
with that data. A brief discussion of each
of these issues follows.
(1) Financial Reporting Practices for
Oil and Gas Producers-During the fiscal year, the Commission and its staff
continued to review the various sup.
plemental disclosures made as a part of
the Commission's experiment to develop a
new method of accounting for oil and gas
producers- reserve recognition account109 (RRA). Companies are required to
disclose supplementary mformation about
the value of their reserves, changes in
those values and an altemative measure
31

of performance, all based on RRA. The
Commission noted significant revisions to
estimated proved reserves quantities in the
supplemental disclosures included in various required filings, and received comments from oil and gas reservoir engineers
that a sigmficant range of reserve estimates
is considered reasonable by that profession. Also, the published results of several
studies suggested a substantial degree of
uncertainty of oil and gas reserve estimates.
After assessing the development of RRA
since September 1978, the Commission
determined that, because of the inherent
uncertainty of recoverable quantities of
proved oil and gas reserves, RRA does not
presently possess the requisite degree
of certainty to be useful as a primary
method of accounting. Therefore, in
February 1981, the Commission
announced that it no longer considered RRA
to be a potential method of accounting for
use in the primary financial statements.
At that time, the Commission also
announced its support for an FASB project
to develop a comprehensive set of disclosures for oil and gas producers. This
project comprehends all aspects of financial reporbng by oil and gas producers
except the issue of a uniform method of
accounting. The Cornrnissron
presently
has no plans to attempt to address the issue
of a uniform method of accounting since it
believes that concepts developed by the
FASB in its standard-setting role may
have an impact on the ultimate resolution
of the uniform method question.
In connection with its disclosure project,
the FASB issued an invitation to comment
In May 1981 and held public hearings on
the subject in August 1981. It expects to
issue an exposure draft of a reporting
standard in early 1982, with a final standard to be adopted in the summer of 1982.
The Commission's staff has followed and
will continue to closely follow the FASB's
progress on this disclosure project, and
expects that the Commission's rules will be
amended to be consistent with the dis.
closure standards adopted by the FASS.

Since the Commission is no longer
working to develop RRA as a method of
accounting for use in the primal}' financial
statements and there are no immediate
plans for adopting a single uniform method
of accounting, the staff has recommended
the rescission of Accounting Series Re.
lease No. 261 (February 23, 1979) which
expressed the Commission's view that
changes from either the full cost or the
successful efforts method of accounting
would not be in the interest of investors.
This view was espoused because of the
potential for another change in accounting
method in the near future. Since RRA is no
longer being developed, the Commission's
staff believes that it IS no longer necessary to discourage accounting changes.
Therefore, the staff has recommended
rescission of the subject release. If this
recommendation is adopted, in the future
the Commission will accept accounting
changes from either the full cost or the
successful efforts method when such
changes are in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (GMP).
(After the close of the fiscal year, on
October 7,1981, the Commission authorized the publication of the recommended
release.I26)
(2) Management
Reports-The
Commission's staff continued to monitor
the private sector initiatives for manage.
ment reports on intemal accounting
controls. Significantly more annual reports
issued this year included such reports than
those issued last year. The staff is encouraged by the Increasing number of reports
submitted and by the broad range of topics
covered by these reports. The strong positive response by the private sector suggests
that regulatory action in this area is not
warranted at this time.
(3) Supplemental Financial lniormetion-In 1978, in connection with its
project to develop a conceptual framework,
the FASB concluded that some financial
information should be reported outside the
financial statements, notwithstanding its
relevance to an understanding of an

entity's financial position and results of
operation. Accordingly, the FASB determined to develop standards for disclosure
of supplementary financial information
where appropnate. The Commission has
previously expressed support for the
FASB's decision to look beyond the reporting of financial information in financial
statements to a broader concept of financial reporting. The Commission continues
to concur in this broadened objective of
the FASB.
At the present time, the only FASB
standards that address supplementary
financial informatJon concem inflation
accountJng and, to a limited extent, information about oil and gas reserves. The
new FASB initiative in the area of disclosures about oil and gas exploration and
producing activities is expected to result
in additJonal specific standards for supplementary disclosures.
Independent accountants are required,
by generally accepted auditing standards,
to review the supplementary financial information presented under FASB pronouncements and the oil and gas reserve disclosures required by the Commission. The
required review of supplementary financial
information is less extensive than an audit
However, independent accountants are not
required to report on the supplementary
financial Information. They are only required to expand their reports on the
audited financial statements when they
have been unable to complete the prescribed review procedures, or when the
disclosure is incomplete or materially
different from the reporting standards.
The Commission has stated that an
accountant's report on supplementary
information would provide an Important
channel of communication between the
profession and users of financial reports.
Such a report would describe the nature
of the accountant's review and state
whether he is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the
information for it to conform with the
FASB's gUidelines.

The Commission
understood
that
consideration of explicit reporting had been
hindered by uncertainty over the applicability of Section 11 of the Securities Act to
accountants' reports on supplementary
mformation which are included in reqistration statements. Accordingly, it proposed rules which would clarify that
accountants would not be liable under
Section 11 for their reports on supplementary financial information as to the
effects of changing prices and as to oil
and gas reserves. Final action on these
rules has been deferred because of questions relating to the most appropnate way
for the Commission to express Its view
that accountants' exposure to liability
must be consistent With the responsibilities
they assume.
Review ot Accaunting-ReLated RuLes
and Interpretatians- The Commission.
relies to a great extent on GAAP, as established by the private sector, to provide
gUidance to registrants and accountants 10
preparing financial statements required
to be included in various registration statements and reports filed with the Commission. The Commission's
accountingrelated rules and interpretations serve
primarily
to supplement
GAAP, by
addressing those areas which are unique
to Commission filings or where GAAP is
not explicit.
The Commission's principal accounting
requirements are embodied in Regulation SoX(S-X) which govems the form and
content of, and requirements for, most
financial statements filed under the Federal
securities laws. The Commission also
publicizes its views on various accounting
and financial reporting matters in Account109 Series Releases (ASRs). In addition,
the Commission's staff periodically issues
Staff Accounting BulletJns (SASs) as a
means of informing the financial community of its views on accounting and disclosure practices.
The Comrnissron continually evaluates
Its requirements as the private sector
effectuates changes in financial reporting

33

standards, and modifies or eliminates
those requirements
which
become
unnecessary. To the extent that the
FASB and the NCPA accelerate their
efforts to enhance financial
report109, the Commission should be able
to place more rehance on pnvate sector
standards.
In addition, the Commission updates its
rules and issues mterpretations where
necessary and appropriate For example, in
July 1981, the Cornrrussron announced Its
concems about certain apphcation and
disclosure practices relatlOg to the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method of accoununq for 10ventones. The Cornrmssion encouraged
reqistrants and accountants to carefully
reexamine LIFO accounting and disclosure
practices to ensure that those practices
result in accurate and meaningful flnancial
reporting.
Dunng the past year, the Commission
has devoted substantial resources to a
comprehensive review of its existing accounting-related rules and mterpretations.
The objective of this review is to ensure that
the Cornrmssion's requirements remain
necessary and cost-effective in today's
environment and that they contnbute to the
usefulness of financial reporting WIthout
imposing unjustified burdens on registrants. As a result of this effort, the Commission has made progress in reducinq and
sirnphtyinq its rules WIthout sacrificmq the
integnty of financial disclosure documents.
Some specific initiatives 10 this area are
discussed below.
(I) Scope of Services by Independent
Accountants-In
1978 and 1979, the
Commission issued two releases relating
to the scope of services performed by rndependent accountants for their audit clients.
ASR No. 250 (June 29, 1978) announced
the adoption of a rule requrrinq disclosure
10 proxy statements about nonaudrt services performed by accountants. In ASR No.
264 (June 14, 1979), the Commission dIScussed factors relevant to an evaluation of
the Impact of the performance of nonaudit services on auditor independence.

34

These releases were issued by the
Cornrmssion as a part of its response to
concems raised by members of Congress
and the public during the mid-1970's that
the performance by accountants of nonaudit services could or could appear to
create a conflict of interest which would
Impair the accountant's independence.
The disclosure about nonaudit services
was intended to permit security holders to
better evaluate registrants' relationships
with their independent accountants. In
addition, the Commission intended to
rnorntor the disclosures to assist 10 developing an emprrtcal baSIS from which to
determine the need for any further action 10
this area.
Based on the review of the proxy dISclosures conducted by the Commission's
staff, the Commissron obtained a better
understandmq of the nature and extent of
nonaudit services performed by accountants. Nthough the Commission believes
that information about nonaudit services
performed by independent accountants
IS important for monitoring the relationships between accountants and their
clients, in August 1981, it proposed to
rescind the proxy rule because It believed
that the detailed nonaudit services disclosure may not be of sufficient utility to
investors to justify continuation of the
disclosure requirernent.P? In addition, the
Commission thought that the SECPS
could generate sufficient information to
enable the Cornrnission, the POB, and
others to appropriately monitor the services
performed by accountants. In this connection, subsequent to the Issuance of
the above proposal, the Executive Committee of the SECPS agreed to require
member firms to provide additional dISclosure about nonaudit services in annual
reports filed with the SECPS and available
for public inspection
In a related action, the Commission withdrew ASR No. 264.128 Although registrants
and accountants must contmueto carefully
evaluate their relationships to ensure that
the public maintains confidence in the

integrity of financial reporting, the Commission took this action because ASR
No. 264 might have confused persons
trying to evaluate services performed or to
be performed by accountants. Moreover,
the Commission believes It has achieved
its objective In issurnq that policy statement. Accountants and their self-regulatory
structure, audit committees, boards of
directors and managements are aware of
the Commission's views on accountants'
independence and should be sensitive to
possible impact on Independence of nonaudit services performed by accountants.
The Commission believes It should be able
to rely on these persons to ensure adequate
consideration of the Impact on accountants' independence of nonaudit services
because they share the responsibility to
assure that the public maintains confidence in the independence of accountants.
In its release proposing withdrawal of the
proxy rules, the Commission emphasized
that the independence of auditors- both in
fact and in appearance-is critical to their
role under the Federal securities laws.
Because of its responsibility and authonty
under the securities laws to assure that
accountants who practice before it are
independent, the Cornrrussion is prepared
to take further action if either the fact or
appearance of accountants' Independence
is questioned seriously in the future.
(2) Requleuon SoX-As part of the
continuing efforts to streamline the Commission's regulations, the Commission
and its staff have: (a) standardized and
centralized in SoX the Instructions for
interim financial statements in registration statements and quarterly reports to
further Simplify disclosure requirements;
(b) proposed to significantly reduce the
requirements for financial statements, such
as parent company, unconsolidated subsidiaries, etc., which supplement consolidated
financial
statements
(The
Commission adopted final rules to reduce
the number of instances where separate
financial statements are required on

November 6, 1981.); (c) revised the rules
relatIng to the detailed property, plant and
equipment schedules to require the filing
of such schedules only by capital Intensive
companies; (d) reviewed the financial statement requirements for companies In
specialized industries-insurance
companies, bank holding companies and
investment companies-and
either issued,
or will soon Issue, proposals to revise those
requirements (The Commission adopted
final rules relatIng to Insurance companies
on October 21, 1981.); (e) Issued a proposal to simplify and standardize requirements for disclosure of a ratio of eamings
to fixed charges; and (f) Issued a proposal
to simplify and Improve the registratIon
and reporting process by codifying administrative
policies
regarding
the
presentatIon of pro forma financial information
The Commission's staff believes that
these miuanves will result in substantlal improvement In S-X while reducmq
reporting burdens on registrants The staff
WIll continue to explore ways in which SOX
can be refined.
(3) ASRs- The Commission's staff has
commenced a review of the approximately
300 ASRs which have been issued by the
Commission since 1937. The objective of
this review IS to identify unnecessary, outdated or otherwise extraneous material
and to publish a codification of those
portions of the ASRs which remain relevant
to financial reporting today. This project is
expected to result in a substantial reduction
In the material that the financial community need be concerned with, and the
Inclusion of the remaining material in a
more concise and useful format which is
expected to vastly Increase its utIlity. The
staff expects to recommend that the
Commission consider the final document
during fiscal year 1982.
Although this project is in Its Initial
stages, the staff has already identified a
number of ASRs which have been rescmded recently because the policies
stated therein no longer have current

35

application or have been superseded by
other pronouncements.
(4) SASs-In January
1981, the
Commission staff published a codification
of the material included in 38 earlier SASs.
The codification represents an integrated
package of updated and indexed SASs to

36

make those staff interpretations more
useful to issuers, accountants and others.
The principal revision to the material in the
previous SASs related to deletion of
material no longer necessary because of
pnvate sector developments and Commission actions.

Investment Companies and Advisers
Disclosure Study
The Division of Investment Management
established a study group at the end of
fiscal 1979, to undertake a thorough
review of investment company disclosure
requirements under the Securities Act of
1933 (Securities Act) and the Investment
Company
Act of 1940 (Investment
Company Act). The objective of the study is
to reduce unnecessary burdens on both
the industry and the staff which may result
from present disclosure requirements.
During the 1981 fiscal year, the study
group reviewed changes In reporting
requirements for management investment
companies. On November 17, 1980, the
Commission proposed three revisions to
Form N.IQ, the quarterly reporting form
for management investment companies.F?
The major revision would shift the require'
ments for reporting changes in an invest.
ment company's portfolio securities from
a quarterly to an annual basis. The Com'
mission proposed the revisions because
(1) the staff makes little intemal use of
the quarterly information; and (2) the institutional disclosure program established
under Section 13(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)
sets appropriate disclosure requirements
for all institutions, including investment
companies.
The study group also continued its effort
to eliminate duplicative reporting requirements in documents sent to existing shareholders and potential investors. On July 8,
1981, the Commission adopted uniform
requirements for the contents of and
periods to be covered by financial state.
ments included in shareholder reports
and prospectuses in (or annual updates of)
management investment company registration staternents.P'
As a result, management investment

companies can prepare a single set of
uniform updated financial statements that
can be used in both the prospectus and the
annual report to shareholders. In addition.
open-end
management
investment
cornparues, at their option, can either
incorporate financial statements included
in any shareholder report by reference
into the prospectus, or transmit a currently
effective prospectus as the equivalent of
a shareholder report. The Commission
adopted these changes to: (1) reduce the
costs incurred In preparing and trans'
mitting essentially duplicative financial
information; and (2) provide an opportunity
for open-end management investment
companies to reduce the length of their
prospectuses or eliminate separate preparation of periodic reports.
Rule 465 under the Securities Act
became effective in October 1980. This
rule permits most post-effective amendments filed by open-end management
Investment companies and unit investment trusts, other than insurance company
separate accounts, to become effective
automatically, without affirmative action on
the part of the Comrnissron or its staff.
Amendments that merely register additional shares, or that are filed to update the
issuer's prospectus and do not discuss any
material events in its operations, can
become effective either immediately or on
a date chosen by the registrant within 20
days of the date of filing. NI other amend.
ments become effective on the 60th day
after filing, Including those that discuss
matenal events in investment company
operations. The rule was adopted to accomplish two goals. First, it should elirninate staff review of purely routine filings.
thereby enabling the Division to concentrate its resources on those filings which
need the review process in order to Insure

37

complete disclosure. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, it should permit registrants to assume greater responsibility for
their compliance
with the disclosure
requirements of the Federal securities
laws. In this regard, since the rule was
adopted, over half of the post-effective
amendments subject to its provisions have
been filed under the provision permitting
immediate effectiveness.
The study group is considering a
number of other proposals including the
possibility of simphfying the disclosure
contained in Investment company pro'
spectuses. The goals of such simplificabon
would be to make disclosures easier for
investors to understand and to reduce the
costs and burdens of preparing and
distributing prospectuses.

Investment Company Act Study
In 1978, the Division established the
Investment Company Act Study (the
Study) to review the Investment Company
Act and the rules, regulations and administrative practices under it, with a view
towards Simplifying and reducing the
burden of regulation upon the investment
company industry, to the extent practicable, consistent with the protection of
investors. Through its rule making proposals to the Commission, the Study has
advocated a more efficient regulatory
system which enhances the everslght
responsibilities of investment company
directors and concomitantly
minimizes
Commission involvement in investment
company operation. The recommendations of the Study have generally taken two
forms:
(1) replacing
administrative
review by the Commission's
staff of
proposed investment company activities
with rules establishing general critena
under which certain activities are permissible; and (2) refining the Investment
Company Act's broad statutory prohibitions by interpretation so as to permit
activities otherwise prohibited under conditions which preserve the underlying

38

purpose of the regulatory provision.
Consistent with the purposes stated
above, during the fiscal year the Commission adopted rules which:
(1 ) exclude from the defimtion of investment company and hence from regulation
under the Investment Company Act,
certain prima facie investment companies
which are primarily engaged in a non.
investment company business.P'
(2) temporarily deem certain transient
investment companies not to be investment companies for purposes of the
Investment Company Act;l32
(3) deem certain subsidiaries of operating corporations not to be investment
companies for purposes of the Investment
Company Act;133
(4) exempt the purchase or sale of
certain securities between an investment
company and an affiliated person which
is so affiliated solely because of having
a common investment adviser, common
officers and/or common directors;l34
(5) permit use of fund assets to finance
distribution of fund shares;135and
(6) require that investment companies
develop
codes of ethics goveming
purchases
or sales by investment
company insiders of the same securities
held or to be acquired by the investment

cornpany.P"
The Commission also proposed rules
developed by the Study to resolve several
longstanding issues. First, the Commission
proposed Rule 3a4 which would provide
a ..safe harbor" for certain" mini-account"
services. These accounts are offered by investment advisers in the form of individual
accounts, but may be operated, in practice,
more like investment companies. The
proposed rule would deem investment
management
services providing
their
clients with individualized treatment not to
be investment companies for purposes of
the Investment Company Act137
The Commission also proposed Rule
which would exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities
Act, interests and participations issued in

180

connection Withthe tax-qualified retirement
plans commonly know as "H.R. 10" plans.
Because H.R. 10 plans are not entitled to
the exemption from registration available
to the tax-qualified retirement plans of
certain employers, many such plans have
applied for and received exemptions from
such
registration
requirements.
The
proposed rule would obviate the filing of
many such applications.l38

Legislation
The Commission, consistent with its
deregulatory objectives, participated in
the development of the legislation which
resulted in the enactment of the Small
Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980.
That legislation, through the addition of
Sections 2(a)(46) through 2(a)(48) and 54
through 65 of the Investment Company Act
and the addition of Section 202(a)(2) and
amendment of Sections 203(b )(3) and 205
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(Investment Advisers Act), was designed to
accommodate the special characteristics
of business development
companies
(also known as venture capital companies
and small business investment companies). Special regulation was created to:
(1) permit public business development
companies increased flexibility to issue
debt and other senior securities; (2) provide
incentive
compensation
to internal
management
or external
advisers;
(3) narrow prohibitions regarding transactions which involve indirectly affiliated
persons of the business development
company; and (4) clarify or change certain
other regulations which would otherwise
apply to business development companies
as closed-end investment companies.
In order to implement this legislation,
the Commission undertook several regulatory initiatives. The Commission adopted
rules that would:
(1) permit certain transactions between
a business development company, as
newly defined in the Investment Company
Act, and a company controlled by it or

certain affiliated persons of such controlled
company;I39 and
(2) permit a business development
company to acquire the securities of and
operate a wholly-owned small business
investment company.v'?
The Commission also adopted, on an
interim basis, three forms to be used
by business development companies to
notify the Commission of their status under
the Investment Company Act Form N-6F,
the notice of intent to file a notification
of election; Form N.54A, the notification
of election of business development
company status; and Form N-54C, the
notification of withdrawal of election.':" As
a part of the same-release, the Cornrmssion
also made public the views of the Division
as to: (1) the existing forms that should
be used by business development
companies to register their securities under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act;
(2) the disclosure that would be appropriate
to inform investors about the special characteristics
of business
development
companies. Finally, the Commission with.
drew two outstanding rule proposals
(Rule 3c-2 under the Investment Company
Act142 and Rule 205-3 under the Investment AdviSers Act143) because the subject
matters of those rules were comprehensively addressed by the legislation.

Investment Advisers Act Study
The Division continued its cornprehensive review of the Investment Advisers
Act and the rules, regulations and administrative practices under It, with an aim
towards determining whether the existing
regulatory structure is adequate in light
of the dramatic growth of the advisory
industry in recent years.
As a foundation for this review, the investment adviser study group is compiling a
comprehensive profile of the investment
advisory industry based upon analysis of
information filed with the Commission in
investment adviser registration applications.

39

In July 1981, the Commission published,
in question and answer format, certain
interpretive positions of the Division
regarding the revised integrated disclosure and reporting requirements for
investment advisers.l'" On the same date,
the Commission proposed certain amendments to these requlrernents.!"
The
revised disclosure and reporting requirements, which became effective on July
31, 1979, and the interpretive release and
proposed amendments were based on
experience with the revised requirements.
The proposed revisions would substantially
reduce the burden of compliance with
these requirements
for a significant
number of investment advisers byeliminating the requirement that these advisers file
an unaudited balance sheet with the
Cornrnissron with their registration
application.
In August
1981, the Commission
published the views of the staff regarding
the applicabihty of the Investment Advisers
Act to financial planners, pension consultants, and other persons who, as an
integral component of other financially
related
services, provide
investment
advisory services to others for cornpensation.l46 The statement of staff VIews
generally sets forth long-standing inter.
pretive positions of the staff as to the circumstances under which persons providing such services would be investment
advisers under the Investment Advisers Act
and thus subject to the registration requirements of the Act.

Significant Applications and
Interpretations

Heizer Corporation-On July 7, 1981,
the Commission granted an application,
under Section 57 (aX4) of the Investment
Company Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder,
to Heizer Corporation, a business development company. This order was the first to
be granted by the Commission pursuant to
the Small Business Investment Incentive
Act. The order granted to Heizer Corpora40

tion permitted it to provide for its officers
and employees a Simplified Employee
Pension Plan, qualified under Section
408(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Commission
granted the application
noting that the pension plan is subject
to the fiduciary requirements and selfdealing prohibitions of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
and the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Commission also placed weight on the fact
that Section 408(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code was enacted by Congress to provide
small businesses with a less burdensome
and expensive alternative to the establishment of a pension plan qualified under
Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Investment Company Institute-On
January 23, 1981, the staff advised the
Investment Company Institute that it would
not recommend that the Commission take
any enforcement action if an investment
company purchased certificates of deposit
issued by members of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation
having a level of assets less than the
specified minimum
amount of assets
required by the investment company's
investment policy. The staff recommended
this no-action position, subject to certain
conditions, in order to remove impediments preventing investment companies
from investing in certificates of deposit
of small banks and savings and loan
associations.
Walter Untermeyer, Jr.-On January
14, 1981, Walter
Untermeyer,
Jr.
(Untermeyer), a shareholder of Fidelity
Daily Income Trust (the Fund), filed an
application requesting an order of the
Commission determining that two of the
disinterested trustees of the Fund are
controlled by and interested persons of the
Fund's investment adviser. The named
trustees, the Fund, and the investment
adviser opposed
the Commission's
exercise of jurisdiction over the application,
contending that essentially the same issue

was raised in a shareholder derivative suit
that Untermeyer had filed against the Fund
in the United States DIstrict Court of
Massachusetts alleging that the Fund had
paid excessive fees to the adviser.
After considering briefs subrrutted by
Untermeyer, the Trustees, the Fund, the
investment adviser, and the Division In
this matter, the Cornrrussion decided to
accept jurisdiction over the application.
The Commission held that, since the deter.
mmation sought in Untermeyer's apphcation would not necessanly be decided in
the course of the district court's disposition of the issues raised in Gnterrneyer's
lawsuit, the doctrine of comity did not require the Commission to defer to the court,

Institutional Disclosure Program
The Commission's
institutJonal dis.
closure program, adopted pursuant to
Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act, has
been in operation for over two years, Under
the program, money managers that fall
within the definition of an "Institutional
investment manager" contained in Section
13(f) (5) of the Exchange Act, and that
meet certain critena set out In Rule 13f.1
under the Exchange Act, file reports on a
quarterly calendar basis on Form 13F.
Among the institutional investment man.
agers that typically meet the requirements
of Section 13(f) and file Form 13F reports
are investment advisers, banks, and In'
surance companies. Those managers reo
quired to file Form 13F reports disclose
certain equity holdings of the accounts
over which those managers exercise investment discretion. This year over 900 institutional investment managers have reported
on Form 13F secunty holdmqs which total
almost $500 billion dollars.

Form 13F reports are made available to
the public at the Commission's Public Reference Room promptly after filing. Also
available for public inspection at the Public
Reference Room are two tabulations of the
information contained In Form 13F reports
filed with the Commission. The first of the
tabulations includes a listing, arranged
according to the individual security held,
showing the number of shares of that security held and the name of the money manager reporting the holding. The second
tabulation is a summary listing, also
arranged according to the individual security, showing the number of shares of that
security reported by all institutional investment managers filing reports. The tabulations are normally available between ten
days to two weeks after the end of the 45day period for filing Form 13F reports for a
particular calendar quarter.
Both tabulations are produced by an independent contractor selected through the
competitive bidding process. The contractor provides its services to the Com'
mission without charge, and is required to
make a variety of specified tabulations available to the public at reasonable prices within 10 days after receipt of the reports. The
Independent contractor also produces and
offers for sale to the public a magnetic
tape containing the Information included in
the two tabulations.
Form 13F reports are not required to be
filed in machine readable form. The Com.
mission decided not to adopt such a form
of reporting after receiving public com.
ments in 1979 and determining that managers would find it unduly burdensome to
employ uniform computer systems for the
purpose of filing Form 13F in machine
language.

Enforcement Program
The disclosure requirements of the
Federal secunties laws, includinq the issuer
registration and reporting requirements,
are aimed at maintaining high standards of
integrity In United States secunties trading markets. Stnct requirements imposed
on market professionals, such as brokerdealers and Investment advisers, are likewise designed to assure that Investors may
rely on the integrity of securities transactions. It is the task of the Cornrmssion's
enforcement program to assure that these
high standards of integrity are in fact adhered to. To do this, the Cornrrussion
maintains a surveillance of the secunties
markets. Its pursuit of violations of the
Federal securities laws is intended both
to provide remedial relief in particular
situations and to deter others who rmqht
otherwise be tempted to engage In similar
violations.
The Commission's enforcement program aims at maximizing the lirruted resources available to It in maintaining a
strong and effective presence in those
areas WIthin its jurisdiction, Substantial
efforts are devoted to co-ordinating enforcement activities with self-regulatory
organizations and state and other Federal
agencies. In addition, civil damage actions,
which have the effect of supplementing the
Commission's enforcement efforts, are
brought by private parties based upon VIolations of the Federal securities laws.
The enforcement actions described In
this section are illustrative of trends in
enforcement activities encountered In the
past year. They also indicate the rnaqrutude
of the Commission's enforcement reponsibilities and the variety of Cornrrussion
responses adapted to the needs of particular situations.
Set forth below is, first, a summary of the
sanctions and remedies available to the

Commission in dealing WIth enforcement
matters. (Table 33, "Types of Proceedmqs", outlines In detarl vanous types of proceedings which the Comrnissron
may
pursue.) Following this is a summary of
some of the SIgnificant enforcement
actions brought in the 1981 fiscal year.

Sanctions and Remedies
The Federal secunties laws provide
adrrunistrative, civil and cnrrunal remedies
for violatlons of those laws. Sanctions In
administrative proceedings for mdlviduals
subject to the Cornrmssion's regulatory
jurisdiction may range from the irnposinon of a censure to the barring of a secunties
professional from engaging In
business In the industry. Issuers of secuntres subject to the penodic reporting
provisions of the Federal secunties laws
may be subject to proceedings under
which the Comrrnsslon may find that they
have failed to comply WIththose provisions
In this type of proceeding the Commission
may order such issuers to comply with
those provistons upon such terms and
conditions as it may specify. The CIvil
remedy usually available to the Com.
mission IS the entry of a Federal court
ordered injunction barring future VIolations.
In addition, courts often enter orders pro.
vidIng for other equitable relief, such as
disgorgement of profits qained from VIolative actrvmes, restitution, or the appointment of special agents or trustees to
manage or monitor the use of corporate
assets. Criminal sanctions Include fines
and Imprisonment
The enforcement provisions of the Federal securities laws are primarily remedial
in nature, and In litigating and settling
proceedinqs the Cornrmssion makes every
attempt to prevent a recurrence of VIolative activity and to rectify the result of past

43

violations. Examples of some types of relief
obtained are discussed in the summaries of
selected cases which follow. In fiscal 1981 ,
Commission actions resulted in the dis.
gorgement or restitution of over $30
million.
In the majority of its cases, the Com.
mission is able to settle with respondents or
defendants on terms which secure neeessary and appropriate remedial relief.
Generally, respondents or defendants who
consent to such settlements do so without
admitting or denying the factual allegations
contained in the Commission's complaint
or order for proceedings. Unless otherwise
noted, in the discussion of the illustrative
cases which follows, it should be assumed
that settlements achieved were upon that
basis. In addition use of the phrase, violations of the Federal securities laws, includes allegations of both direct violations
and the aidmg and abetting of such viola.
tions.

Insider Trading
The Commission monitors, investigates,
and, where appropriate, brings enforcement actions in cases involving the purchase or sale of securities by persons in
possession of material, non-public informabon. The Commission works closely with
the reqrstered securities exchanges and the
National Association of Securities Dealers
(NASD) in uncovering and developing
such cases.
During the past year, many of the insider
trading cases initiated by the Commission
involved trading in non-public mformation
conceming tender offers or other potential
changes in control of an issuer. Several
actions also involved the misuse by professionals of non-public information.
SEC v. FinAmerica Corporation and
Jorge E. Csrniceror" - This action, alleging violations of the antifraud provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), was filed against FinAmerica
Corporation, the then largest shareholder
of Riggs National Bank of Washington,
D.C., and Jorge E. Camicero, president of
44

FinAmerica, who was at that time also a
director of the bank. The complaint alleged
that while nonpublic negotiations were
being held conceming the sale (at a substantial premium) of Riggs stock held by
FinAmerica and others, the director pur.
chased Riggs stock, recommended the
purchase of Riggs stock to others, and
attempted to include the stock purchased
by himself and others in the negotiated
sale. The court enjoined the defendants
and ordered disgorgement
of profits
amounting to $150,000.
SEC v. Banca Della Svizzera ltaliana,
March 27, 1981, the Commission filed a complaint against Banca
Della Svizzera ltaliana (Banca), Irving Trust
Company and "certain purchasers of call
options for the common stock of St. Joe
Minerals Corporation" (Purchasers). The
complaint alleged that defendant Pur.
chasers had violated the antifraud and
tender offer provisions of the Exchange Act
by purchases of call options for the common stock of St. Joe Minerals Corporation
(SJO) based on material nonpublic information conceming a tender offer for
SJO by a subsidiary of Joseph E. Seagram
& Sons, Inc. The alleged purchases were
made by defendant Banca, a banking institution located in Switzerland. The complaint alleged that over 1,000 option con.
tracts for over 100,000 shares of SJO stock
were purchased, and that the increase in
price of SJO stock upon the announcement of Seagram's tender offer resulted
in a profit to the purchasers of over $1
million.
The court imposed a Temporary Restraining Order freezing $2 million of the
assets of Banca and Purchasers. At the end
of the fiscal year, litigation was continuing.
SEC v. Daniel H. O'Connell, Arthur D.
Tenners'-« The Commission filed a complaint against Daniel H. O'Connell and

material, non. public information without
disclosing such information.
The court entered final judgments of per.
manent injunction against O'Connell and
Tanner and ordered them to disgorge profits of $17,800 and $32,375, respectively,
which were derived from the purchase of
Catalina common stock. This matter was
referred to the Commission by the market
surveillance staff of the NASD.
SEC v. Howard L. Davidowitzl50The
Commission filed this complaint against
Howard L. Davidowitz, a former principal
in the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney,
Chairman of the firm's Retail Industry Com.
mittee and National Director of its Retail
Consulting Group. The complaint alleged
that Davidowitz violated the antifraud pro.
visions of the Exchange Act by the pur.
chase and sale of common stock of Drug
Fair, Inc. based on non-public information
concerning the proposed merger of Drug
Fair and Gray Drug Stores, Inc. This in.
formation was allegedly obtained in connection with services performed by Ernst &
Whinney for Gray Drug Stores, Inc., relating to the planned merger.
Davidowitz's purchase and sale of stock
of Drug Fair, Inc. resulted in a net profit of
over $45,000. He was enjoined by the court
and ordered to disgorge that profit.
SEC v. Frank H. Wyman; SEC v. Frederick Wyman, JP51-ln this case the Commission filed two separate complaints

alleging violations of the antifraud pro'
visions of the Exchange Act based on trading on non-public information obtained,
directly or indirectly, from a paralegal
employee of a New York law firm. In each
instance, the non-public information concemed proposed tender offers by clients
of the firm. The defendant in the first action
was a pnvate investor. In the second action
the defendant was a former registered representative of a broker-dealer firm.
In the first action, the Commission
alleged that the defendant traded on
material non-public Information relating
to the interest of Blue Bell, Inc. In making
a tender offer for Jantzen, Inc. In that case
the court entered an order of permanent
injunction, and ordered disgorgement of
over $99,000.
In the second action, the Commission
alleged that the defendant traded on
material non-public information relating to
the interest of Phillips Petroleum Co. in
making a tender offer for the stock of
Crown Zellerbach Corporation. The Commission also alleged that, by disclosing
such Information to the defendant, the
paralegal had breached a duty to her em.
ployer law firm and its client, Phillips
Petroleum Co., to keep such information
confidential. The court entered an order
of permanent injunction against the defendant.
In announcing each action, the Commission acknowledged the assistance provided to the Commission staff by the Stock
Watch Division of the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE) during each investigation.
SEC v. Carlo M. F1orentino152-On
September 23, 1981, the Commission
filed a complaint against Carlo M. Florentino, alleging violations of the antifraud
provisions of the Exchange Act. Florentino

and a former associate of two other New
York law firms.
The Commission's complaint alleged
that commencing on or about October II,
1977, Florentino effected transactions in

45

the securities of certain publicly held com.
panies while in possession of material non.
public information which he had obtained
in confidence relating to, among other
things, the possible acquisition of these
companies through tender offer or merger
transactions. The Commission alleged that
as a result of such transactions, Florentino
realized a net profit of approximately
$450,000, that Florentino effected these
transactions while associated with two law
firms, and without following various polIcies and procedures of those law firms.
At the end of the fiscal year, litigation was
conbnuing.

Changes in Corporate Control
In recent years there has been a signifi.
cant increase in corporate mergers and
acquisitions, and in the novelty of techniques used to accomplish these trans.
actions. Maintenance of the confidence of
investors in making decisions conceming
investments in companies engaged in
such transactions depends upon assuring
full, fair and timely disclosure of such transactions. Commission actions in this area
are aimed at assuring investor protection as
mandated by the Federal securities laws.
DISCUSsedbelow are examples of Commission actions seeking sanctions against
false and misleading disclosure in Com.
mission filings relating to tender offers,
proxy contests, and "going private" trans.
actions.
SEC v. El Dorado International, Inc.,
Dei/ O. Gustafson, et al.153- The Com.
mission filed a complaint against EI
Dorado Intemational, Inc., Deil O. Gustafson, Roger F. Newstrum, InnTemational,

Corporation (CFC) alleging violations of
the antifraud provisions of the Federal
securities laws. In addition, the Commission alleged that EI Dorado and certain
other defendants violated the reporting
and recordkeeping provisions of the Ex.
change Act.

46

The Commission alleged that, from
September 1978 to June 1979, the de.
fendants engaged in a scheme under to
which InnTemational attempted to merge
with EI Dorado through an exchange of
InnTemational stock for EI Dorado stock,
resulting in the control of EI Dorado passing to Gustafson; that Gustafson diverted
$1,960,000 of EI Dorado's funds by causing the advance of such funds to Gustaf.
son, CFC, InnTemational and Conquistador for the benefit of Gustafson and hIS
related corporations; that advances of
certain funds from EI Dorado to InnT emational and Conquistador, and certain ections taken toward effecting the attempted
merger of InnTemational and EI Dorado,
occurred without prior approval from the
Nevada gaming authorities and in violation
of the Nevada gaming laws; and that the de.
fendants made, or facilitated the making of,
numerous false and misleading representations and disclosures In filings WIth the
Commission, to EI Dorado's board of
directors and shareholders, to the public
and others in furtherance of such scheme.
The court entered final judgments of
permanent injunction against the defendants. The court ordered Conquistador, or
Gustafson, if Conquistador was unable, to
reimburse EI Dorado the sum of $83,781
for expenses incurred in connection with
matters alleged in the Commission's com.
plaint. (It was represented that over $2
million had already been repaid to EI
Dorado.) The court also, among other
things, ordered Gustafson and Newstrum

shareholders of C&R, and that a principal
purpose of the tender offer was to allow
these shareholders to dispose of at least
70,000 shares of C&R stock at a price
above the prevailing market price. It was
also alleged that C&R did not disclose that,
in connection with the tender offer, bonuses were to be paid to these two shareholders, and that these bonuses totalling
$198,000 siqruflcantly affected the earnings per share and book value of C&R
stock. The complaint also alleged that on
three occasions the prior counsel for C&R
had advised the company that the proposed transaction raised issues of corporate waste and possible breach of fiduciary
duties.
The court ordered entry of a final judgment of permanent mjunction against
C&R and ordered it to comply WIth its

Diagnostic Data, Inc. (DOl), "DOl Shareholders for Action" (Dissidents), Gerry
L. Dagess, an officer of 001, and Robert C.

In the Matter of Tidelands CapitaL
Corporetion't'>- The Cornrnissron in.
sbtuted proceedings against Tidelands
Capital Corporation (TCC) under Sec.
tion 15(c) (4) of the Exchange Act to de.
termine whether TCC failed to comply with
Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the acquisition of an affiliated
life insurance company, Westem Resources Life Insurance Company (WRL),
by one of TCe s wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Among other things, the Commission
found that TCC failed to make the required
filings and disclosures conceming the
acquisition of WRC, a transaction in which
cash was paid to affihated shareholders of
WRL and common stock to unaffiliated in.
vestors. The Commission determined that,
as a result, the investing public and
the unaffihated shareholders of WRL were
not provided information

among other things, a requested valuation
and a discussion in reasonable detail of
the matenal factors upon which TCC deter.
mined that the transaction was fair to unaffiliated security holders of WRL and the
weight assigned to each such factor.

of the Exchange Act; comply with its
undertakings to establish procedures to
ensure future compliance with Section
13(e); and comply with its undertaking to

Among other things, the cor-iplaint
alleged that Litton did not have adequate
grounds for deferring, for financial reporting purposes, $128 million of excess costs
incurred in connection with two com.
mercial shipbuilding contracts awarded in
1968. It was alleged that such deferral was
inappropriate in light of the nature of the
excess costs, the lack of accounting
records sufficient to segregate start-up
costs from contract operating costs, and
the lack of assured revenues against which
to absorb the costs. The complamt also
alleged that losses incurred in connection
With a shipbuildmq contract for the U.S.

50

Navy, which rose from approximately $75
million in 1973 to approximately $500
million in 1978, should have been recognized prior to 1978. At that time, Litton provided for a pretax loss of $200 million as a
result of a settlement with the Navy, which
settlement, according to Litton, contained
incentive provisions which significantly reduced the loss.

permanent mjunction and also ordered
Litton to comply with certain undertakings
made by the company. The first undertaking provided for audit committee review,
for a penod of three years, of cost deferral
and revenue recogmtion determinations

Regulated Entities
Ensuring compliance with the Federal
securities laws by regulated entities is one
of the most important objectives of the
Commission's enforcement program. The
major regulated entities include brokerdealers, investment advisers and investment companies, as well as self-regulatory
organizations such as the registered
national securities exchanges and the
NASD.
In fiscal 1981, cases involving brokerdealers constituted almost half of the 68
administrative proceedings brought by the
Commission, These proceedings the great
majority of which are conducted by the
Commission's regional offices, are effective in obtaimng compliance with applicable statutory provisions or Commission
rules and in establishing high standards
of conduct on the part of broker-dealers.

First Independent Stock Transfer Agent,
Inc. (FISTA), a Denver, Colorado securities

president of FISTA, alleging violations of
the recordkeeping and reporting provisions
of the Exchange Act in connection with the
tumaround
requirements
imposed on
transfer agents for all secunties classified
as routine items. The complaint also alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of
the Federal securities laws in connection
with the purchase and sale of the securities
of various Issuers for which FISTA was the
transfer agent.
Among other things, the complaint
alleged that FISTA and KIrchner failed
to disclose to shareholders, prospective
shareholders and issuers of such securities,

SEC v American
Birthright
Trust
Management
Coo, Inc; et al_l7I- The
Commission filed a complaint against
American Birthright Trust Management
Co., Inc. (ABTM), a Florida investment
adviser, Richard J. Sluggett, ABTM's
founder, president and principal shareholder, Richard S. Freedman, ABTM's ex-

ecutive vice-president, and various other
defendants, some of whom served as
directors or trustees of two investment
companies for which ABTM acted as investment adviser.
The Commission alleged that all defendants violated the requirements imposed on directors by the Investment Company Act, that ABTM breached the fiduciary
duties imposed on fund advisers by that
Act; and thatABTM, Sluggett and one other
defendant violated the antifraud provisions
of the Securities Act and the disclosure provisions of the Investment Company Act.
The Commission's complaint principally
involved the compensation paid to ABTM
by the funds for advisory and related services. It was alleged that the compensation
paid to ABTM by the funds was excessive in
light of the services actually performed by
ABTM, and that most of the advisory
services provided to the funds had been
provided by a "sub-adviser" retained by
ABTM, rather than by ABTM itself. For
1978 and 1979, the aggregate fees paid
to ABTM pursuant to the advisory and service contract, based upon one percent of the
average net asset value of each fund, exceeded $2 million. Dunng the same period,
ABTM paid the "sub-adviser" approximately $125,000.
The complaint also alleged, among
other things, that the defendant director/
trustees approved the advisory contracts
with ABTM without requesting information
which was reasonably necessary to
evaluate such contracts.
The court entered judgments of permanent injunction against all defendants.
Among other things, it also ordered ABTM
to pay $465,000 to the two investment
companies, and it ordered ABTM, Sluggett
and Freedman to make all efforts to ensure
that the boards of the funds include a
majority of disinterested director/trustees
with no previous affiliation with any of the
defendants; an independent counsel will be
appointed to assist the disinterested
director/trustees in their duties and responsibilities; the disinterested director/
trustees, with the assistance of the in-

dependent counsel,v 1y' review the advisory
and service contract, ~ with ABTM and
thereafter renew, tern 'inate, or seek to
renegotiate such contracts to the extent
they deem appropriate; ;ABTM, Sluggett
and Freedman will maintah'i documents reflecting investment recornrnendatrons,
research and analysrs, and t)le independent counsel reviews of the recordkeeplnq
systems of ABTM.

Hot Issues Market
During the past two years. the Com-

53

rrussion has becon ~ concemed with a hot
issues market 10 cated primanly in the
Denver, Colorad<jJ region. ThIs hot issues
market has beerj charactenzed by the promotion and ~,ale of highly speculative
stocks in mitital offerings for a rnlrurnal
pnce, followed by extremely active trading
and rapid I,:>rice increases in the aftermarket. The securities, which are usually
traded over-the-counter, have been primarily securities of companies involved in
energy development and production.
In the Matter of SynthetIC Fuels, Inc.173
- The Commission Initiated a proceeding
pursuant to Section B(d) of the Securities
Act, to determine whether a stop order
should be issued suspendmg the effectiveness of the registration statement of an
offenng of securities of Synthetic Fuels,
Inc. The registration statement represented
that 42 percent of the $4.12 million of
net proceeds of the offering was to be
used to construct a plant in Rupert, Idaho,
to produce denatured ethanol for use in
making gasohol. The Commission found,
among other things, that the reqistration
statement, which contained numerous ref.
erences to the proposed construction
of the plant, farled to disclose: the fact
that studies were still underway, the results
of which would help determine whether the
proposed plant would be built; the plans
for use of the net proceeds earmarked
for the plant If that plant were not constructed; and the fact that this portion of the offermg was in effect a "blind pool."
The Commission
entered and irnmediately withdrew its stop order against
the registration statement based on the
undertaking of Synthetic Fuels, lnc., which
the Cornrmssion accepted, to deliver a
copy of the corrected prospectus to all
persons who, to its knowledge, received
copies of the previous misleading prospectus, as well as to any purchaser, 72
hours prior to sendmg a confirmation to
such purchaser.
SEC v. The Investment Bankers, lnc., et
al.I~4-The Cornrmssion filed a complaint
against Investment Bankers, Inc. (lBI) a
54

Denver, Colorado
broker-dealer,
its
president and a director and office manager alleging violations of the registration,
antifraud and broker-dealer recordkeeping
provisions of the Federal securities laws.
The complaint
alleged, among other
things, that IBI, which underwrote a public
offering of 20 million shares of Chipola Oil
Corporation common stock at 10 cents per
share, dominated, controlled and artifically
inflated the price of Chipola Oil in the
trading market. The complaint also alleged
that, as a result of its violative activities, IBI
was insolvent, owed over $5 million to
public investors, and had a net capital
deficiency of over $6 million.
Upon the filing of the complaint, the
court approved a Stipulation and Order
which provided that IBI would not engage
in further business. The Commission also
suspended over-the-counter trading in
Chipola stock for a ten day period.

Foreign Issuers
Over the past 1B months a dramatic increase has been noted in the number of
foreign issuers whose securities are traded
in the United States. Most of these issuers
are natural resource companies located in
Australia and the westem provinces of
Canada, and the trading market in their
securities closely resembles that of the
domestic hot issues market. This trading
activity is marked by dramatic upward price
and volume movements shortly after trading commences and in the absence of
accurate and adequate corporate disclosure.
Along with participating in a review of the
regulatory framework applicable to securities of foreign issuers and related tradmg markets, the Commission staff has con.
suited and cooperated with officials of
vanous foreign govemments, as well as
domestic self-requletory organizations, in
order to attempt to provide co-ordinated
remedial action in appropriate cases. In
addition, the Commission has pursued
several enforcement actions in this area,
one of which is discussed below.

In the Matter of Ferrovanadium Corporation, N.L175- The Commission instituted administrative proceedings against
Ferrovanadium Corporation, N.L., pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act.
Simultaneous with the Institution of the proceedings, the Commission announced a
I Oday suspension in the over-the-counter
trading of the securities of, and the American Depositary Receipts issued against the
securities of, Ferrovanadiurn pursuant to
Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act,
The Commission took these actions
based upon allegations that Ferrovanadium had failed to comply with the registration and reporting provisions of the
Exchange Act. The Commission found,
among other things, that Ferrovanadium
had: stated that it owned mineral deposits
which contained "proven reserves" of 27
million tons when Ferrovanadium had insufficient basis for such claim; stated that
it owned mineral deposits which contained
60 million tons of "inferred reserves" when
Ferrovanadium had Insufficient basis for
such claim; and presented financial statements which did not Include sufficient
detail conceming deferred mining exploration costs, and the company's pohcy
regarding future amortization of such
costs, and otherwise failed to meet applicable requirements.
The Commission ordered Ferrovanadium to comply with its undertakings to,
among other things: comply with the registration and reporting provisions of the
Exchange Act; use its best efforts to distribute copies of this Order to all beneflcial
and record owners of the secunties of, or
American
Depository Receipts issued
against the securities of, Ferrovanadium
who are either residents or citizens of the
United States; appoint an agent for service
of process in the United States for Ferrovanadium; retain and maintain independent counsel in the United States not
unsatisfactory to the Commission's staff to
advise Ferrovanadium with respect to its
future filings with the Commission and to
advise the company with respect to com-

pliance WIththe Federal securities laws; and
cause any future geologic, feasibility and
mining studies, prepared with respect to
any properties In which Ferrovanadium has
an interest, to Include findings In accordance with applicable Cornrnission standards.

Distribution Schemes
A variety of schemes have been used to
avoid registering public offerings of
securities with the Commission, and such
schemes often involve purported claims of
exemptions under the securities laws.
Discussed below is an example of a
scheme to use the bankruptcy laws to sell
stock Into the market which was restncted
from being sold to the pubhc without compliance with the registration and disclosure
requirements of the Federal secunties laws.
SEC v. Sam S. Brown, Jr., and Hentage
Investment Group, Inc.J76- The Commission filed a complaint seeking to enjoin Sam S. Brown, Jr., of Atlanta, Georgia,
and Heritage Investment Group, Inc.,
located In Atlanta, Georgia, which IS
wholly owned by Brown, from further violations of the registration, antifraud, and
broker-dealer registratJon provislons of the
Federal secunties laws.
The complaint alleged that Brown and
Heritage had embarked upon a scheme to
purchase a financially troubled business,
acquire options to purchase unregistered
stock issued by public companies, transfer
the options to the financially troubled company, cause the troubled company to file
for bankruptcy and petition the bankrputcy
court for permission, pursuant to Federal
bankruptcy law, to sell the stock underlying the options without registration
under the Securities Act. If the court had
approved the petition, the bankrupt entity
would have exercised the options and sold
the underlying stock to the general public,
using the proceeds from the sale of the
stock to pay for the stock. The Commission
alleged that the principal purpose of this

55

scheme was to evade the registratIon
requirements of the Securities Act and
thereby realize a profit equal to the differ'
ence between the pnce of restricted stock
and registered stock of the same issuer and
class.
Brown and Hentage attempted to
accomplish this scheme through a bankruptcy proceeding initIated and pursued
by a subsidiary of Heritage. After the Com'
mission intervened in the bankruptcy pro'
ceeding and opposed the petition to sell
unregistered securities, the petition was
Withdrawn and the bankruptcy proceedmq
was terrrunated.
The complaint also alleged that, in the
process of acquiring the options to purchase restricted stock, Brown and Heritage
made false and misleading statements to
the option sellers concerning the purpose
of the purchases and the means by which
the purchase would be financed. Finally,
the complaint alleged that Brown and
Heritage engaged in the business of buying
and selling securities for their own
accounts as a part of a regular business
without registration as a securities dealer
under the Exchange Act
Final judgments of permanent injunction were entered against the defendants.
The Commission acknowledged the co.
operation of the Director of the Alabama
Securities Commission in promptly bring'
Ing this matter to the Commissron's ettention and in providing valuable assistance.

Municipal and Government
Securities
Municipal
securities Include bonds
issued by state and municipal governments
as well as industrial development bonds
issued by authorities which do not have
taxing powers. Over 38,000 entities may
Issue bonds which are tax-tree and exempt
from the registration provisions of the
Securities Act
Government securities
trading includes government and govern.
ment guaranteed securities, such as for'

56

ward contracts for securities guaranteed
by the Government National Mortgage
Association (GNMA).
Trading in these securities has increased
significantly in recent years. While the
Securities Acts Amendments
of 1975
added
registration
requirements
for
municipal
broker-dealers and created
the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking
Board, the trading markets for these
securities have historically been unrequlated markets, and subject to potential trading abuses. Due to the continuation of
questIonable issuance and trading practices in this area, the Commission's en.
forcement interest has also continued.
Sec v. Calhoun County Medical Fecitity, Inc, et al. 117_ The Commission
filed a complaint against Calhoun County
Medical Facility, Inc., Bullington-Schas &
Co., lnc., a broker-dealer registered with the
Commission, and certain other defendants
alleging violations of the antifraud pro.
visions of the Securities Act in connection
with the offer and sale of $1.8 million of
first mortgage revenue bonds to finance
the acquisition of the Calhoun County
Hospital in Calhoun County, Mississippi.
The complaint alleged, among other
things, that annual financial statements
concerning the past operations of the
hospital, which indicated an inability to
service the bond offering, were not in.
cluded in the offering circular. Rather, pro
forma financials were included without
discussion of the significantly divergent
prior financial history.
The court entered final judgments of per.
manent injunction against the defendants.
One defendant, a practicing attorney who
served as bond counsel to the offering, was
also ordered to comply with his under.
takings concerning procedures to be
followed in connection with future bond
issues.
In a related proceeding, the Commission
ordered administrative proceedings, pur.
suant to Sections 15(b) and 19(h) of the Ex.
change Act, against Bullinqton-Schas Co.,
Inc., its president and an employee, all of

whom were defendants in the injunctive
proceeding. The Order for Proceedings
alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, and the
failure by the president of Bullington-Schas
& Co., Inc. to reasonably supervise other
employees In connection with the offer and
sale of Calhoun County Medical Facility,
Inc. revenue bonds. The firm was censured
and ordered to comply WIth its undertaking
to institute and maintain adequate due
diligence and compliance procedures. The
individual respondents were suspended
from association WIth any broker-dealer,
and were ordered to comply with their
undertakIngs to engage in a course of
study for municipal bond princtpals.'?"
The Commission also ISSUeda report,
pursuant to Section 2I(a) of the Exchange
Act, in which it discussed the role of the
attomey who, acting as bond counsel to the
underwriter of the Calhoun County Medical
Facility, Inc. bond offering, rendered an
opinion on the offering circular for that
offering. The Cornrrussion concluded that
the attorney's conduct, without havmq conducted any inquiry of his client as to the
underlying facts on which his opinion was
predicated, failed to satisfy applicable

standards.l'"
In the Matter of Bevill, Bresler [;
Schulman, lnc., et allBO-On December
12, 1980, the Commission ordered the institution of public admimstrative proceedings, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and
19(h) of the Exchange Act, against Bevill,
Bresler & Schulman, Inc., a registered
broker-dealer located in Newark, New
Jersey, two unregistered corporate affiliates, the firm's president, two former
supervisors, a trader, and twelve former
salesmen. The Order for Public Proceedings alleged VIolations of the antifraud and
broker-dealer bookkeepmq provisions of
the Federal securities laws. The Order alleged that in addition to makIng misleading
statements concerrnnq, among other
things, the nature and risks of trading In
forward transactions In govemment securities, certain of the respondents caused

unauthorized trades, engaged In so-called
adjusted trading, induced and approved
unsuitable transactions in U.S. Government issues and guaranteed securities. The
Order also alleged failures to supervise on
the part of certain respondents.
The Commission, upon entering findings of the alleged VIolations, censured the
firm and its affiliates and ordered varying
sactions against the individual respondents, including suspensions and bars
trom serving in a supervisory capacity. The
Comrnission ordered the firm and its
affiliates to comply with their undertakings
to refrain from engaging In foward transactions in government securities for 60
days; refrain from opemng any new branch
offices for SIX months; and undertake a
thorough review of compliance procedures
and the implementation thereof.
SEC v. Cantor Fitzgerald Agency Corp ,
et al.181-On October 29,1980, the Commission filed a complaint alleging that
Cantor Fitzgerald Agency Corp. and certain
present or former officers and directors
VIolated the antifraud provisions of the
Federal securities laws in connection with
transactions in U.S Govemment guaranteed securities, including GNMA and
Federal Home Loan Mortgate Corporation
(FHLMC) securities.
The Commission alleged, among other
things, that certain defendants caused
Cantor to enter into numerous adjusted
trades with several thrift Institutions, including savings and loan associations and
at least one credit union, and that Cantor
falsely confirmed purchases of GNMA and
FHLMC securities from customers at
above-market prices without disclosing
that such purchases were conditioned
upon contemporaneous sales to such
customers of like securities at abovemarket prices. These transactions were
allegedly used to defer recognition of
losses which occurred when the market
prices of the securities held by or committed to be purchased by customers declined, in the hope that such market prices
would rise and eliminate or reduce cus57

torners' losses, The Commission further
alleged that in many instances Cantor also
required customers to pay fees to cover
any loss to Cantor on such transactions,
and that such fees were falsely stated to be
refundable,
Anal judgments of permanent mjunc.
non were entered against defendants.
Cantor was also ordered to submit for the
approval of the Commission staff a plan
to distribute any remaming net assets
and to make a full and complete account.
ing to the Cornrnission staff when the
staff deemed appropriate.

Energy and Tax Benefit Related
Cases
Due to the tax consequences of certain
investments such as those In energy-reo
lated products or real estate, a multi-billion
dollar market exists for tax shelter securities. This market provides many opportumties for abuses which threaten the Integnty of the securities markets. These
abuses may take the form of misappropriation and misuse of assets by insiders and
promoters
and rmsrepresentatron
of
material facts to investors.
The Commission has uncovered significant abuses, including the sale of unregistered secunties masquerading as taxshelter programs, which have resulted in
the commencement of enforcement actions.
Investors In these offerings may be con.
tacted initially in connection with nationWide, long-distance telephone solicitation
campaigns. The offerings often are the
subject of fraudulent solicitation state'
ments. Individuals are often persuaded to
make an Investment on the basis of false
statements or omissions
conceming,
among other things: the amount of bUSIness to be conducted by the Issuer; the
risks associated with the investment; the
experience of the issuers' principals; and
the use of investors'funds. One of the major
inducements to investors is the purported
availability of special tax benefits.

Related Party Transactions
Adequate disclosure to investors requires that investors be fully apprised of the
use of corporate funds. Fundamental to
the relationship between an investor and
management is the expectation that an
issuer's assets will be used for the benefit
of the Issuer and not for the personal enrichment of the manager.
Use of the issuer's assets in transactions
with management or other related parties,

however reasonable and appropriate, must
be fully disclosed. Though issuers are
generally aware of the requirements to
fully disclose related-party matters, problems have arisen in instances in which
members of management have attempted
to conceal their personal enrichment resulting from such transactions.
SEC v. Crown Cork [; Seal Co., Inc.I88The Commission filed a complaint against
Crown Cork & Seal Co., Inc. alleging viola.
tions of the antifraud, reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the Exchange Act in
connection with payments of cash and
loans to and for the benefit of Herbert G.
Paige, an officer of General Cinema Corporation, responsible for can and bottle
cap purchases from Crown Cork and
other suppliers. The alleged transactions
included payments totalling about $5.9
million, loans totalhng $1.75 million, and
the financing of the purchase of an airplane. The Commission alleged, among
other things, that Crown Cork, which recorded certain payments as payments
to General Cinema for competitive allowances, should have known, and was reck.
less in not knowing, that the payments
were for the benefit and use of Paige.
The court entered a final judgment of
permanent injunction, and ordered Crown
Cork to comply with undertakings regarding the maintenance of certain procedures
relating to: verification of the status of recipients of competitive allowances or
similar payments; authority of the recipient
to receive the payments; receipt and form
of delivery of the payments; and customer
approval of loans or extensions of credit
to officers, directors, employees or agents
of the customer. Crown Cork also made
undertakings conceming, among other
things, the composition of the audit committee of its board of directors, and a
review and investigation to be conducted
by the audit committee of matters alleged
in the complaint
In a separate action, the Commission
filed a complaint against Paige and Pasha
Service Corporation, which was alleged-

Iy formed and controlled by Paige, alleging
violations of the antifraud reporting and reo
porting provisions of the Exchange Act in
connection with these transactions. As of
the close of the fiscal year, this action remained in Iitigation.189
SEC v. Herbert F. Hewettl90- The Commission filed a complaint against Herbert F.
Hewett of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,
alleging violations of the antifraud proVIsions of the Federal securities laws. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Hewett, In
his IRA and Keogh accounts, owned certain
certificates of deposit ISSUedby Guaranty
Trust Company, Ponca City, Oklahoma,
and that he sold those certificates of de.
posit to Guaranty with knowledge of
Guaranty's precarious financial condition
and prior to the disclosure of such information to Guaranty's other investors. The
court ordered Hewett to comply with his
undertaking not to violate the antifraud
provisions of the Securities Act and to pay
to Guaranty's court-appointed trustee the
sum of $12,155.84, representing the pro.
ceeds that he received from the sales of the
certificates of deposit
In the Matter of Michigan ttetione! Corporationl91- The Commission instituted a
public administrative proceeding, pursuant
to Section 15(c)(4) of the Exchange Act,
to determine whether MIchigan National
Corporation (MNC) had violated the reo
porting provisions of the Exchange Act in
connection with the disclosure of sale and
leaseback transactions with related parties
since MNC became a public company In
1972. The Commission found, among
other things, that MNC had failed adequately to disclose all of the circumstances under
which its subsidiaries engaged in the practice of selling bank premises to, and leasing
them back from, certain officers and
directors of MNC including its president
and chief executive officer and MNC subsidiary banks and their affihates.
The Commission found that none of the
disclosures over the years conveyed
adequate information
conceming
the
circumstances involved in the transactions.

61

The Commission also found that in certain
years MNC failed adequately to disclose:
the terms of the purchases and leases; that
certain properties were bought from the
MNC banks; that almost all were sold either
to related parties or persons who had prior
business relationships with MNC subsidiary
banks; and that other MNC banks financed
several of the purchases. MNCs dis.
closures did not adequately discuss the
benefits to the related parties in these
transactions, including the customary con.
sequences of sale-leaseback transactions
to the MNC banks or to the related parties.
Further, the Commission found that MNC
indicated that the terms of the transactions
were comparable to arm's-length transactions when, in fact, there was no evidence
that the MNC banks made any attempt to
determine whether the related parties received terms more favorable to them than
the MNC banks would have had to give had
they made an effort to market the sale.
leaseback packages to unaffiliated persons. Also, while MNC disclosed that the
banks engaged in leasebacks to avoid fixed
assets limitations, it did not disclose that
other options were available to the banks
to avoid the limitations but were not pur-

sued.
The Commission ordered MNC to comply with various undertakings, includmg
the establishment of a committee of the
board of directors to review these transactions and to direct an independent consultant to prepare a report concerrung
them; to publish a summary of the report
and the review committee's recommendations in MNCs next proxy statement; and
to review disclosures conceming related
party transactions over the next five years.

The Foreign Conupt
Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 [Sections 13(b)(2), 30A and 32(c)
of the Exchange Act) was signed into law in
December 1977. That Act prohibits issuers
from, among other things, corruptly mak-

62

ing payments or gifts to officials of foreign
govemments in order to induce such
officials to use either their authority or influence in order to assist the Issuer in
obtaining or retaining business. The Act
also requires issuers to make and keep
accurate books and records and to devise
and maintain systems of internal accounting controls which provide reasonable
assurance that certain statutory objectives
are met.
In fiscal 1981, five injunctive actions
brought by the Commission included
allegations of violations of Section 13(b)
(2) of the Exchange Act (the recordkeep109 and intemal controls provisions) in
addition to violations of the antifraud
provisions of that Act. Three of these actions (SEC v. Crown Cork and Seal, SEC v.
El Dorado tnternetionel, lnc., and SEC v.
World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd.) are
discussed elsewhere in this report. Summarized below is an action brought by the
Commission alleging violations of the antibribery provisions.
SEC v. Sam P. Wallace Company, lnc.,
et a[.192-The Commission filed a complaint against Sam P. Wallace Company,
Inc., Robert D. Buckner, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of
Wallace, Alfonso A. Rodriguez, Executive
Vice President and a director of Wallace,
allegmg violations of the antifraud, reporting, proxy and antibribery provisions of the
Exchange Act. The complaint alleged that,
for a penod from about April 1980 to April
1981, Wallace, Buckner and Rodriguez
made payments from corporate funds of
at least $1391 million to a foreign official
to aid Wallace in procuring and maintaining a contract m a foreign country. The
court entered judgments of permanent
injunction against Wallace and Rodriguez.
The court also ordered certain ancillary
relief, including the appointment of a
special committee to investigate and report
on matters alleged in the complaint and
other matters. As of the close of the fiscal
year, the action was pending against Buckner.

Criminal Reference and Co-ordinatlon
with Other Authorities
As demonstrated in various actions discussed above, the Commission both
maintains its own intellIgence capabilitIes
and works closely with other Federal
agencies and foreign and local authorities
In order to share informatIon and coordinate activities of mutual concern.
The Commission maintains particularly
close liaison with the Department of
Justice, the various U.S. Attorney's offices
throughout the country, other law enforcement authorities, as well as certain state
regulatory agencies such as the Gaming
Commissions for the States of Nevada
and New Jersey in dealings with organized
crime, a major focus of the Commission's
enforcement activities. Such matters involve entities and areas in which persons
reputed to be associated with organized
crime are believed to be involved, and may
involve persons who have committed
prior violations of the Federal securities
laws or situations in which the suspected
violative conduct is particularly egregious.
An example of this co-ordination was the
conviction, this past year, of a witness In
a private Commission investigation for givIng perjured testimony to the Commission
staff.193 Subsequent to his testimony, but
pnor to the indictment, the Commission
had instituted a CIvil injunctive action
alleging that this witness and others had
manipulated the market price of the stock
of Micro-Therapeutics, Inc. As of the close
of the fiscal year, the injunctive action remained in Iitigation.l94
In fiscal 1981, the Commission referred investigative files, or granted access
to them, to the Department of Justice and
other agencies in over 80 cases.
In the area of civil cooperation, along
with numerous other actions resulting
from the co-operative efforts of various CIvil

law enforcement officials and the self-regulatory organizations, in fiscal 1981, the
Commission brought its first injunctIve
action jointly with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This
case is discussed further below.
SEC & CF7C v. T&D Management
Company, et a1195- The Commission,
acting jointly WIth the CFTC, filed a complaint against T&D Management Company, a registered commodity trading
advisor and commodity pool operator in
Provo, Utah, and the pnncipals and sales
manager of T&D.
The Cornrnissron's complaint alleged
that the defendants violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the Federal
securities laws In connection with the
issuance of notes and investment contracts of T&D to raise funds for T&D's
trading in comrnodmes futures contracts.
The CFTC alleged that defendants engaged in a course of business in violation
of the antifraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act applicable to commodity pool operators and commodity
trading advisors.
The complaint alleged that the defenddants made/numerous
rrusrepresentations to investors, including: false statements of the combined assets of T&D and
its principals, and false statements that
one T&D principal had experienced profits
averaging 65 to 70 percent for each of the
last eight years; that a portion of investor
funds would be held separately in money
market funds; that investments in T&D did
not Involve a high degree of risk and were
guaranteed against loss; and that the investors' retums would be paid from tradIng profits, when in fact there were no profits and Interest payments to investors
came from, money currently being invested.
Final judgments of permanent injunction were entered against the defendants.

Other Utigation and Legal Work
The Commission, through Its Office of
the General Counsel, participates m a sub.
stantial amount of litigation m addition to Its
enforcement actions. This litigatIon includes appellate cases before the Supreme
Court and Federal courts of appeals, where
the Commission appears as a party or as
amicus curiae, and district court litigation
where the Commission, its Commissioners, or its employees are party defendants.
Commission litigation, whether as a party
or as amicus, often involves questions of
great significance conceming the proper
interpretation and scope of the Federal
securities laws. The Commission's pettierpation in this litigation has served to
strengthen the investor protectIons afford.
ed by the securities laws and the enforce'
ment and regulatory programs It has under.
taken to achieve that goal. The Office of
the General Counsel is also involved in important legislative and regulatory work. The
following is a summary of some of the important actions which were litigated in the
past year.

Scope of the Antifraud Provisions
The antifraud provisions of the Federal
securities laws are the principle statutory
basis through which the Commission
seeks to protect the public against de.
ception in securitIes transactIons. The
proper scope of these statutory provisions
is a matter of continuing importance to the
Commission's litigation efforts.
During the past year, the Supreme Court
decided Rubin v. United States, a criminal
case in which the Commission worked
closely with the Department of JustIce. In
Rubin, the Court held that a pledge of
securities is a sale under Section 17(a) of
the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act),
which is the general antifraud provision of

the Act. Thus, the Court held that Section
17(a) affords protectIon against deceptIon
which occurs in the pledge of securities.
The Court noted that this result is consistent With the purpose of SectIon 17(a)to protect agamst fraud and aid the flow of
information in the public dissemination of
securities.
The question of what instruments are
securities withm the meaning of the Federal
securities laws is critical to the Cornrnission's enforcement and regulatory pro.
grams because the existence of a security
is an essential predicate to the Com.
rnission's junsdictIon. Accordmgly, during
the past year, the Commission participated
as amicus curiae in several private actions
mvolving issues with respect to the scope
of the definition of a security. Two of these
cases, Weaver v. Marine Bank, and
Schutte v. Bank of Miami, raised the issue
of whether a certificate of deposit may be a
security subject to the antifraud provisions
of the Federal securities laws.
Schutte involved certificates of deposit
issued by an off-shore bank that was operating Illegally in the United States. The district
court had ruled that they were not securities
Within the meaning of the Federal securities
laws because they offered only a fixed reo
tum. In its bnef before the Umted States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the
Commission urged that the district court
erred m focusmg on the presence of a
fixed versus variable retum, and that debttype instruments like those in Schutte are
subject to the Federal securitIes laws if
they are offered to the public as invest.
ments. The Fifth Circuit, accepting the
Commission's position, reversed the decision of the district court and remanded for
a determination of whether the certificates
of deposit were issued in an investment
context.

65

Unlike the situation in Schutte, where
Federal bankmq regulation was not present, the certificate of deposit at issue in
Weaver was Issued by a State chartered
bank that was insured by the Federal DePOSIt Insurance Corporation. The Umted
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had ruled that the certificate of dePOSItwas a security because It was the functional equivalent of a long-term bond or
note issued by the bank. The Cornmission
participated m a joint amicus brief before
the Supreme Court with Federal bank regulatory agencies urgmg that, where a
certificate of deposit IS issued by a federally regulated and insured bank, the context
of the transaction requires that the anti.
fraud provisions of the Federal securities
laws not apply. At the close of the fiscal
year, this case was awaitinq oral argument
before the Supreme Court.
Securities and Exchange Commission
v. The International Mining Exchange, a
Commission enforcement action brought
in the Umted States Distnct Court for the
Distnct of Colorado, also involved the
scope of the definition of security. The
Comrrussion alleged that the defendants
were VIolating the reqistratron and anti.
fraud provisions of the Federal secunties
laws in connection WIth the sale of gold
investment programs, which the complaint
alleged were secunties m the form of in.
vestment contracts The programs, which
purportedly involved the sale of interests in
Alaskan gold mming claims In conjunction
WIth contracts to arrange for the flnancinq
and development of those claims, were represented as providinq profits both from
gold mming and from related tax deductions amounting to 500 percent of the in.
vestor's out-of-pocket investment. The
district court granted the Commrssion's
motion for summary judgment, concludmg
that the interests involved are securities and
that the promised tax benefits may be
VIewed as gIving rise to an expectation of
profits where they result from the pro.
rnoter's managenal efforts.
In another case lnvolvmq the defimtion

66

of a security, the Commission filed a brief
amicus curiae in Newkirk v. General
Electric Corporation. The district court
had ruled that an employee's interest in a
voluntary, contributory, defined benefit
pension plan was not a security. The Commission on appeal urged that such an interest was a security subject to the antifraud provisions. The case was settled,
however, prior to oral argument before the
United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit.
In Pittsburg Terminal Corp. v. Baltimore
& Ohio R.R., the Commission submitted a
brief as amicus curiae to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, addressing several significant legal
issues under the antifraud provisions. The
Commission took the position that a holder
of a convertible debenture, although not
actually selling or purchasing that debenture during the relevant time period, never.
theless had standing to bnng a damage action for violations of Section lO(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ex.
change Act), which prohibits the use of
manipulative or deceptive devices in con.
nection with the purchase or sale of a
security. The Commission based its position on the ground that a convertible
debentureholders' right to convert into another security is a contract to purchase a
security subject to the protections of Section 10(b).
The Commission also took the position
in Pittsburgh Terminal that a company
with publicly traded convertible debentures
has a duty under its listing agreement
with the New York Stock Exchange to give
holders of those debentures advance
notice that a dividend will be paid on its
common stock, even though the common
stock is privately held, because the convertible debentureholders would share in
the dividend if they converted their debentures to stock prior to the time the dividend
IS declared. Finally, the Commission took
the position that, while a defendant's reliance on advice of counsel may, under
some circumstances, be a relevant factor in

determimng whether a defendant acted
with the requisite SCienter or constitute a
mitIgating factor which the court may consider in determining
the appropnate
remedy for a violation of Section 10(b),
such reliance does not negate the violation or preclude a finding that the defendant acted with scienter where the evidence shows that the defendant knew that
his deceptive conduct would mislead investors. At the close of the fiscal year, this
case was pending before the Third Circuit.
Finally, In SEC v. Sheldon Moss, the
United States Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit affirmed the Middle District
of North Carolina's order holding Sheldon
Moss in Civil contempt for failure to comply with a consent decree entered in a
Commission injunctive action alleging that
Moss and others had violated the anufraud and registratIon provisions of the
Federal securities laws, and requinng disgorgement of $4,500,000 of Moss' 111gotten gains. Moss failed to deposit the
$4,500,000 In the registry of the district
court for distribution to those who invested
In his schemes, and sold assets WIthout
prior court approval, contrary to the terms
of the consent judgment. The distnct court,
not believing Moss' claim that he was indigent at the time, held him in crvrl contempt
and ordered him committed until he complied with the disgorgement order. The
Fourth Circurt affirmed the contempt order,
agreeing with the Commission that there
was no ment to Moss' claim of mdiqency,
and that the district court did not abuse its
discretion In ordering that Moss be committed until he purges himself of contempt
by complying with the terms of the judgment. When Moss completes his present
criminal sentence, he will be entitled to a
fresh review of the issue of hrs ability to
comply with the consent order

Standard of Culpability

Gnder the Antifraud Provisions
In a related area, the issue of scienter
continued to play an important role in the

Commission's litIgatIon during the past
year. This issue was presented In the
proceedings on remand In Aaron v. SEC,
in which the Supreme Court had ruled In
1980 that the Commission must prove
scienter under Section 17(a)(l) of the
Secunties Act, and Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,
but not under Sections 17(a)(2) and 17
(a)(3) of the SecuntJes Act. The Supreme
Court, while reservmq a decision on the
question of whether scienter encornpasses reckless behavior, remanded the
case to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit for a determination
of whether an injunction was properly
entered by the distnct court.
On remand, the Commission urged that
the scienter standard should be construed to include reckless conduct, but that
the district court's finding of scienter was
fully supported by the record even under a
knowledge or Intent standard The Second
Circuit did not decide whether recklessness sufficed to establish scienter; holding
that there was no baSISfor disturbing the
finding of the district court that Mr. Aaron's
misconduct was intentional.

Private Rights of Action
An Important aspect of the Commission's amicus cunae parucipation IS
that of assuring availability to Injured parties
of pnvate causes of action under venous
provisions of the Federal secunties laws.
Such actions provide a vehicle through
which Injured Investors can obtain redress for violations of the secunties laws.
Moreover, Since the Commission can bring
only a limited number of enforcement
actions, and normally does not recoup Investor losses in those actions, pnvate
actions must serve as a necessary supplement to Commission enforcement actions.
The Commission has long recogmzed
that denvative actIons-the pnvate actions
brought on behalf of a corporation by one
of Its shareholders-are
an Important
means by which investors protect them-

67

selves from violations of the Federal
securities laws. Accordingly, the Com'
rrussion participated arrucus curiae in
three cases last year in which derivative
actions had been terminated as a result of determinations by a corporation's
directors that It was not in the best interest
of the corporation for the shareholder
suit to be maintained. In each case the
district court deferred to the business judgment of the directors and dismissed the
suit
In Grossman v. Johnson, the plaintiff, an
investment company shareholder, brought
suit under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment
Company Act), which provides an express
cause of action against an investment company's investment adviser and others for
breaches of fiduciary duty that result from
the charging of excessive advisory fees.
The plaintiff also alleged that the adviser
and the company's directors had violated
other provrsions of the Act by failing to
recapture excessive
underwriting comrnissrons, discounts and spreads paid by
the company.
Based on the language of the statute, the
purposes underlymg Section 36(b), the
legIslative history of the provision, the
structure of the Investment Company Act,
and pnor cases which had considered the
Issue, the Commission urged the United
States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
to hold that an action brought under Section 36(b) may not be terminated by a
business judgment determination made by
the investment company's board of directors, The Cornrmssion argued that a contrary result would destroy the mechanism
which Section 36(b) provides for shareholders to challenge the determination
made by these same directors as to
whether the advisory fee is appropnate.
With respect to the plaintiffs allegations
of VIolations of other provisions of the Act,
the Commission argued that, under the
Supreme Court's decision m Burks v.
Lasker, a court may give effect to the
directors' business Judgment decision to

68

terminate the action only if such a result
would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act.
Accordingly, the Commission urged that
the Court should not defer to the directors'
business judgment unless the corporation
meets the burden of showing that: the
directors were truly independent and
capable of rendering an unbiased decrsion on behalf of the corporation; they
were fully informed of the facts relevant
to their decision: and their decision was
objectively reasonable. At the close of the
fiscal year, this case was pending before the
FIrst Circuit.
In Abramowitz v. Posner and Maldonado v. Flynn, the Commission urged that
the same three tests (independence, fully
Informed and objectively reasonable)
should be applied in evaluating business
judgment decisions by directors to terminate denvative actions alleging VIolations
by directors of Sections lO(b) and 14(a)
of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and
14a-g thereunder. Both cases were pendIng before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit at the close of
the fiscal year.
Secondary hability under the antifraud
provisions of the Federal secunties laws is
another important area which the Commission addressed as amicus curiae during the past year. In Sharp v. Coopers &
Lybrand, an action under Section 1O(b) of
the Exchange Act, the Cornrnissron filed a
bnef In the United States Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit urging that an accounting firm may be held liable in a private
action for damages, pursuant to the common law pnnciple of respondeat superior;
for the fraudulent conduct of an employee.
The Third Circuit had previously indicated
that this common law principle of secondary liability would generally be inapphcable
In secunties fraud actions, but had held
that the pnnciple was appiicable in cases
mvolvmq broker-dealer firms in view of the
stnct duty of supervision Imposed on those
firms. The Thrrd Circuit in Sharp extended
its broker-dealer exception to accounting

firms on the ground that accounting
firms, like broker-dealers, are under a
duty to supervise their employees.
Another area addressed by the Commission as amicus curiae involved the
issue of whether remedies available under
Sections lO(b) and 18(a) of the Exchange
Act are mutually exclusive. In Wachovla
Bank & Trust Co. v. tieuonet Student
Marketing Corporeuon; the United States
Court of Appeals for the Distnct of
Columbia Circuit agreed with the Commission's position that these remedies
are not mutually exclusive. The Court
rejected defendants'
arguments
that
the Implied remedy under Section lO(b) is
not available to purchasers of securities
and that this remedy does not apply to
Initial offerings of securities The Court
relied on a decision in Rossv. A. H. Robins
Co., In which the Cornrrussion previously
participated amicus cunee; arguing that
Congress could not have intended that
express remedies for particular misconduct would have such a broad pre.
elusive effect.

Federal Court Jurisdiction
Over Foreign Defendants
The Commission participated amicus
curiae in Lebman v. ASEA, which involved the circumstances under whrch a
foreign individual or entity may be sub.
ject to SUit under the securities laws In a
Federal district court. This issue IS of
significance to private parties and the Com'
mission's
own enforcement
program
where securities transactions involve both
foreign and domestic elements,
In Lebman, a United States Magistrate
had ruled that a foreign corporation was
not subject to suit unless the corporation
had certain minimum contacts With the
state in which the district court IS located.
The Commission filed a brief in the United
States District Court for the Western District
of Texas urging that a Federal court has
jurisdiction over alien defendants In a
securities law action if the defendant has

the requisite contacts Withthe United States
as a whole, regardless of the defendant's
contacts with a particular state. The district
court adopted the Commission's position

Standard of Proof in
Enforcement Proceedings
The question of which standard of
proof should be utilized In Comrrnssion
Injunctive actions and administrative pro.
ceedings-the
higher "clear and convmcmq evidence" standard or the "preponderance of the evidence" standardwas another Important subject of litigation
dunng the last year. In February 1981, the
Supreme Court handed down its decrsion
In Steadman v SEC, in which It held,
in accordance with the Commission's
argument, that the standard of proof for
adjudicating administrative proceedings
before the Commission is prescribed
by Section 7(c) of the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA), and that that standard is the one traditionally utilized in CIVIl
court cases-a
preponderance of the
evidence. Because the Court based ItSdecision upon the language and legislative
history of the APA, which governs adrrunistrative proceedings before all Federal
agencies, ItS reasoning should apply with
equal force to a Widevanety of adjudicatory
proceedings before the Commission and
other aqencies. In support of Its decisron,
the Supreme Court m Steadman also Cited
the Commission's long-standmg practice
of imposing sanctions m administrative
proceedings on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence standard.
In addition, the Court stated that, In
prescribmg standards for adjudicatory
proceedmgs In Section 7( c) of the APA, as
in prescribing standards for rulemakmg
proceedmgs In Section 4 of the APA, Con.
gress had established the "rnaxrmurn pro.
cedural requirements" that it was willing
to have courts impose upon agencies,
citing Its earlier decision In Vermont
Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council. Inc. The
Court's explicit extension of the Vermont

69

Yankee principle is likely to have a significant impact on court review of administrative adjudications made by the Commission and other agencies.
Subsequent to the Supreme Court's
decision in Steadman, the United States
Court of Ar-peals for the Fifth Circuit, In
Huddleston v. Herman [;. MacLean, held.
among other things, that the standard of
proof In private damage actions for violations of Section 1O(b) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 should be that of clear and
convincing evidence rather than the preponderance of the evidence. The Commission, concerned that the ruhng might
be extended to Commission injunctive
actions. filed a brief amicus cunae in the
Huddleston case urging rehearing on that
issue. as well as certain other Issues. Subsequent to the filing of the Commission's
bnef in Huddleston,
the Fifth Circuit
decided SEC v. First Financial Group of
Texas, lnc., holding that the Commission
need prove an Injunctive case under Section l Otb) and Rule lOb-5 only by the preponderance of the evidence. Also of note in
this case, although not related to the issue
of the proper standard of proof, was the
Fifth Circuit's rejection of First Financial's
arguments concerning the lack of jurisdiction of the district court to appoint a receiver because of the prior filing of a petition in bankruptcy. The court held that
appointment of a receiver was necessary
ancillary relief to the Commission's Injunctive action to enforce its regulatory
powers and thus was exempted from the
automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act.

Scope of Commission's
Investigatory and
Enforcement Authority
The proper scope of the Commission's
investigative and enforcement authority
has been litigated in the past year. For
example, in SECv. McGoffcertain persons
engaged in the publishing
business
challenged the Commission's authority to

70

enforce a subpoena issued in a Commission investigation. The district court
had upheld the subpoena, but permitted
the defendants to withhold documents relating solely to editorial policy or news
gathenng.
The Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit rejected the respondents'
contention that the Commission's subpoenas impinged on their First Amend.
ment freedoms as newspaper publishers
and should therefore be judged under the
strict scrutiny standard. Instead, the Court
noted that newspaper publishers. like
other business enterprises. are subject to
laws of general applicability such as the
Federal securities laws. The Court cited
the traditional standard that administrative
subpoenas should be enforced where the
subpoena demands are reasonably relevant to an inquiry within the lawfully
authorized powers of the agency, point.
ing out that the Commission had shown
a "substantial relationship" between the
information it sought and a significant
govemmental interest. The Court concluded that appropriate accommodation of the
respondents' First Amendment interests
was achieved by the district court's order.
The Court also ruled that the respondents were not entitled to discovery into
the Commission's deliberative process in
conducting the investigation because they
had failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances which would justify a departure from the usual rule that subpoena enforcement proceedings are summary in
nature. The decision of the Court was left
standing by the Supreme Court, which
denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.
In SEC v. Zale Corporation, the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit ruled, in accordance with the position urged by the Commission, that the
district court erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment in
a Commission injunctive action on the
ground that there was no reasonable likelihood of future violations by those in'
dividuals. The district court had assumed.

for the purposes of its ruhnq, that the defendants had committed the alleged VIolations, and only a change in employment by
one of the defendants and an outstanding
consent decree against a corporation had
been offered to demonstrate that it was
unlikely that the defendants would commit
further violations of the securities laws.
In reversing the distnct court, the FIfth
Circuit stated that these factors did not
entitle the defendants "to judgment as a
matter of law given the court's assumption that both engaged in serious, recurrent wrongdoing and that triable issues
of fact remainl ed J .... " Moreover, the Court
pointed out that "the Comrrussion is entitled to prevail when the inferences flowing
from the defendants' prior illegal conduct, viewed in light of present circumstances betoken a 'reasonable likelihood'
of future transqresslons," Accordingly, the
Court reversed and remanded the case
to the district court for further proceedings.
In SEC v. Wheeling-Pittsburg Steel
Corp; a divided en bane Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit, overtuming a decision
by a three-judge panel of that Court,
determined that the district court had made
inconsistent findings when it held that the
Commission was acting in good faith in investigating Wheeling-Pittsburg, but declined to enforce the Commission's subpoena on other grounds. The case was remanded for further factual findmgs conceming the events surrounding the commencement
of the investigation and
whether it was initiated at the request of
a politically motivated United States
Senator or based upon an independent
evaluation of the facts by the CommissionAfter the case was retumed to the district
court, the Commission advised the court
that it was withdrawing the subpoena, and
the action was dismissed as moot

Scope of Commission's Authority
Onder The Holding Company Act
Two similar cases, both entitled Herring
v. SEC, challenged the Commission's

authorization of the sale of securities by a
holding company or its subsidianes. The
cases were brought by the same persons in
the United States Courts of Appeals for
the DIstrict of Columbia Circuit and the
Eleventh Circuit, seeking to overtum the
Cornrnissron orders involved on the basis
of challenges to certain aspects of a holding company's construction program. In its
briefs, the Cornrrussion urged that the
Holdmg Company Act does not confer
upon the Cornmissron authority to prevent
a holding company or Its subsidraries from
selling their securities because the company's construction program ISalleged to
be excessive in light of the anticipated
consumer demand for electric power. In
addition, the Cornrnission urged that It had
no obligation under the National Environmental Policy Act to prepare an environmental impact statement before permitting a holding company or Its subsidianes to
sell securities. At the close of the fiscal
year, these cases were pending.

Reporting Violations
In Hinkle Northwest, Inc. v. SEC, a
broker-dealer contested sanctions imposed by the Commission upon findmgs of
violations of the recordkeeping, net capital
and reportIng provisions of the Federal
securities laws. HInkle was the purchaser in
two reverse repurchase agreements in
which it used the credit of one of its clients,
a bank On appeal, Hinkle claimed that it
did not own the securities, but rather that
the bank did. Thus, it would not have been
under any recordkeeping, net capital or
reporting obligations related to these
secunties. The Umted States Court of
Appeals for the Nmth Circuit affirmed the
Cornrnissron's order, holdmg that Hinkle
had the right to sell the securities and that
it took the nsk for profit or loss; this,
it found, constituted ownership, The Ninth
Circuit also held that it was not necessary
to demonstrate evil intent to prove willful,
ness (a prerequisite to the imposition by
the Commission of a sanction m an adrrun71

istrative proceeding),
but that such
standard would be satisfied by a showing of
conscious, intentional action.

Exhaustion of Remedies
Important policy considerations support
judicial
non-interference
with pending
administrative proceedings, since such in.
tervention can deny an agency the
opportunity to correct its own mistakes,
apply its expertise, prove to be unnecessary
in the long run, or delay resolution of the
question In issue. In SEC v. G.c. George
Securities, Inc; the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed
with these considerations and ruled that the
distnct court had erred as a matter of law
when it concluded that it had no jurisdiction
to enjoin a pending Commission administrative proceedmq. The respondents in
the adrnmistrauve proceeding had been
defendants in a concluded civil action
previously filed by the Commission, In
which the parties had entered into a stipulation providing, In part, that any stipulation and undertaking approved and ordered by the district court would not be used
as the baSIS for an administrative action
affecting any of the defendants. The Ninth
Circuit based its determinations on ItS
conclusion that: when the Commission
filed its injunctive action, it conferred
jurisdiction on the Court; in its order the
court retained jurisdiction to enforce the
stipulation; and the district court had
authority to consider the appellants' request under the All Writs Act, which allows
Federal courts to issue writs necessary or
appropriate to their jurisdiction,

Tender Offer Uligation
In 1981, the Commission has continued
a high level of participation In litigation concerning the effect of the Commission's
tender offer rules on state takeover statutes.
The Commission has participated amicus
curtae or as a party in a number of these
lawsuits, which generally arise in the con.
text of hostile takeover attempts. Some of

72

these suits focus upon the preemptive
effect of Commission Rule 14d-2(b) under
the Exchange Act (the rule conceming the
early commencement
date of a tender
offer) on state law provisions requiring ex.
tended precommencement
delay. Rule
14d-2(b) requires a tender offer to commence shortly after a public announcement of its material terms. It was designed
to thwart a developing practice by which
bidders would make public announce.
ments about their offers without actually
commencing these offers for purposes of
the Wilhams Act, which contains vanous
provisions designed to afford investors pro'
tection in tender offer situations.
The Commission recognized when it
adopted Rule 14d.2(b) that it might con.
fhct WIth certain state laws, and in litigation the Cornrnissron has supported the
position of tender offerors challenging
these laws as unconstitutional when they
do conflict. However, the Commission has
also recognized that states may have a valid
Interest in regulating tender offers for truly
local cornparues, and It has therefore
supported the efforts of state securities
laws administrators
to harmonize the
operation of their statutes with Rule 14d.
2(b).
In actions in which the Commission has
participated and where a court has reached
the merits of the substantive preemption
issue, the results have been uniformly
favorable for the Commission. In particular,
in Canadian Pacific Enterprises (U.S.),
Inc. v. Krouse, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio held
that Rule 14d-2(b) was a valid exercise of
the Commission's
broad rulemaking
power and preempted the provisions of ~e
Ohio takeover statute requiring pubhc
announcement of a takeover bid at least 20
days before it is made.
In James Edgar v. MITE Corp., the
Commission submitted a brief amicus
curiae before the United States Supreme
Court raising the question of whether state
law provisions, which require advance
disclosure of tender offers and empower a

state securities administrator to pass on
the substantive fairness of the terms of a
tender offer, VIolate the Supremacy and
Commerce Clauses of the United States
Constitution by, respectively, conflictmg
with the purposes of the Wilharns Act and
imposmg a burden on interstate commerce not outweighed by local interests.
The Commission also submitted a bnef
amicus cunae in Kennecott Corp. v.
Smith, before the United States Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. Kennecott
involves the issues of whether the heanng,
withdrawal, and proration provisions of the
New Jersey takeover law frustrate the
Federal scheme for tender offer regulation
and thus violate the Supremacy Clause,
and Impose imperrmssible burdens on
interstate commerce in violation of the
Commerce Clause. Noting that the New
Jersey WIthdrawal and proration provrsions
differ from those prescnbed by other states
as well as the Federal penods set by the
Cornrmssion, the Cornrrussron contended,
among other things, that exposure to
divergent state proration and withdrawal
penods encumbers the planning and ex.
ecution of tender offers, constituting a
burden on interstate commerce. The Comrrussion further argued that the existence of
differing State withdrawal and proration
periods precludes the apphcation of a
smgle national standard to transactions
that are nation-WIde m scope
Finally in Osofsky v. Zlpf, the Comrmssion participated emtcus cunae before
the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second CirCUIt. This case presented
the Issue of whether shareholders, who
ceded control of their company as a result
of alleged rrusrepresentions concernmg
the value of the consideration they would
obtain in a merger to take place after
successful completion of a tender offer,
had stated a claim for damages under the
Exchange Act The defendant m the case,
the successful tender offeror, had rep'
resented that shareholders would receive
a certain price in the merger, but the
plaintiffs alleged that the defendant m-

tentionally paid a lesser amount upon
consummation of the merger.
The district court held that the shareholders were precluded by the "actual
damage" hrmtations of Section 28(a) of the
Exchange Act from recovering any
damages because they had not alleged
that the shares they gave up were worth
more than the consideration they received.
It also ruled that the shareholders may not
obtam damages amounting to the difference between what It was represented they
would receive in the merger and what they
actually received,
The Commission was concerned that
the drstnct court's ruhng would insulate
from pnvate redress certain types of
proxy and tender offer VIolations, particularly m those situations where a substantial
premium ISoffered over market value. In its
bnef, the Comrrussion urged reversal of
the distnct court's decision. The Second
CirCUIt agreed with the Commission's
positlon, holding that, under the actual
damages hrmtation of Section 28(a),
shareholders may recover non-speculative
damages based upon the value of the consideranon that was represented as commg
to them m the merger, when those
damages can be estabhshed WIth reasonable certamty.

Regulatory Utigation
Chicago Board of Trade v. SEC, pendmg In the United States Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit, raises Significant
Issues of junsdictional allocation between
the Commission and the Comrnodity
Futures Tradmg Cornrnission (CFTC). This
case challenges the authority of the Com'
rmssion to approve and supervise the tradmg of options on securities guaranteed
by the Government National Mortgage
AsSOCIatIon (GNMA), when such trading
takes place on a national secunties ex.
change. In its brief, the Commission
stated that a national securities exchange IS
authonzed to provide a market for trading
of all types of secuntles and that the Com'

73

mission is empowered under the Exchange
Act to oversee such trading. The Commission urged that GNMA securities, although exempted from registration reo
quirements under the Exchange Act and
the Securities
Act, are nonetheless
securities, and that options on GNMA
securities
are, themselves,
separate
securitres. The Commission
further
urged that nothing under the Com.
rnodity Exchange Act (CEA) diminishes its
authority
under the securities laws
over the trading of GNMA options, even
though the CEA may permit the trading of
futures on GNMAs on boards of trade sub.
ject to the oversight of the CFTC.
The Commission explained in its brief
that options and futures are legally distinct
forms of trading, and that the lImited grant
of jurisdiction to the CFTC extends to
futures tradmq, not options trading, of
GNMA securities. The Commission con.
tended that this conclusion is reinforced
by provisions in the CEA which explicit.
Iy preserve the junsdrction of the Com'
mission over secunties trading (except to
the extent that futures trading is involved)
and which expressly remove "govemment
securities' and "security fights" from the
coverage of the CEA, except to the extent
that they are the subject of futures trading
on a board of trade
The Comrrussion
also partrcipated
amIcus cunae In the Umted States DIstrict
Court for the Distnct of Columbia In A. G.

74

Becker v. Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, which raised the
question of whether a bank may underwrite
"third party" (i.e. non-bank) commercial
paper, in view of the ban under the GlassSteagall Act against bank underwriting of
..securities."
The Cornrnission
in its
amicus memorandum
urged that the
Glass-Steagall Act and the securities laws
should be viewed as complementary
pieces of legislation, and that undefined
terms in the Glass-Steagall Act should
generally be construed together with the
definitions contained
in the contemporaneously enacted Securities Act. Be.
cause commercial paper is encompassed
by the defimtion of ..security" under the
latter statute, the Comrrussion asserted that
commercial paper should be deemed to
be a "security" for purposes of the GlassSteagall Act as well. If any of the restrictions
under the Glass-Steagall Act are to be revised (Including the strict prohibition
against bank underwriting of corporate
securities), the Commission urged that this
task, which raises fundamental public
policy issues, is better left to the Congress,
not the courts. The district court In A. G.
Becker found that commercial paper is
a ..security" under the Glass-Steagall Act,
and, although not decidinq what activity
would constitute "underwriting," agreed
that any easing in the stnct statutory hrmtations against bank underwriting must be
left for Congress to decide.

Public Utility Holding Companies

Composition
Under the Public Utility Holdmg Com.
pany Act of 1935 (Holding Company Act),
the Commission regulates interstate public
utility holding company systems engaged
In the electric utility business or m the
retail distribution of gas. The Commission's
junsdictron also covers the natural gas
pipeline cornparnes and non utility com.
panies which are subsidiaries of registered
holdmq companies
There are presently 13 reqrstered holding companies WIth aggregate assets, as
of June 30,1981, of $57 billion. Total holdIng company system assets increased
$4.5 billion In the twelve.month penod
ended June 30, 1981. Total operating
revenues, as of June 30, 1981, were
$26.5 billion, a $4.5 billion increase over
the previous year. In the 13 systems, there
are 58 electric and/ or gas utility sub.
sidiaries, 61 nonutihty subsidiaries and 19
inactive companies, or a total of 155
system cornparnes, including the top
parent and subholdmq companies Table
38 in the Appendix lists the systems and
Table 39 lists their aggregate assets and
operatinq revenues

Financing
During fiscal year 1981, approximately
$3.3 billion of senior secunties and common stock flnancmq of the 13 registered
systems was approved by the Cornrrussion.
Of this amount, approximately $2.3 bilhon
was lonq-term debt financmq, and over
$1 billion was for equity flnancinq, These
amounts represent a 12.4 percent de.
crease In lonq-term financmq over fiscal
year 1980, and an 11.1 percent increase
in the sale of common and preferred stock.

In addition, the Commission approved over
$7.1 bilhon of short-term debt financmg
and $278 million of pollution control
fmancmg for the registered holding
company systems. The short-term debt
amounted to approximately 45 percent
more than the $4.9 bilhon authonzed In
fiscal year 1980. Table 40 In the Appendix
presents the amount and types of securities
issued by holding company systems pursuant to the Holdmg Company Act.

Exemptive Rules Adopted
The Commission, through the exercise
of Its statutory rulemakmg power, has
attempted to allay the concerns ex.
pressed by gas and electric utihties that
their partrcrpation In certain types of JOint
ventures would make their activmes sub.
ject to the Holding Company Act. On
November 19, 1980, the Commission
adopted Rule 16196 to facihtate partrcipatron
of registered gas systems WIth companies
not subject to the Holding Company Act
in gas-related JOint ventures It exempts
certam non utility subsidianes of registered
holdmg companies, pnrnanly engaged In
the production, manufacture, transrrussion
or storage of gas, from those provisions of
the Holding Company Act that would
otherwise render them "subsidiary com.
parues," provided that no more than 50
percent of the votIng interests are owned by
one or more reqistered holdmg company
systems. In order to facrhtate jointly owned
generating facilities among electric com.
panies not subject to the Holding Company
Act, the Cornrnission, on January 13, 1981 ,
adopted Rules 14 and 15197 which exempt
certain acquisrtrons by electnc utihty companies from Cornrrussion regulatIon.

Reorganizations

and Acquisitions

Colonial Gas Energy System ReorganizatIOn-Prior
to September 9,
1977, for many years Colonial Gas Energy
System (Colonial) was an exempt holding
company under Section 3(a)(1) of the
Holding Company Act, pursuant to Rule 2.
The filing under Rule 2 exempted Colonial
and its subsidiaries until It was notified,
pursuant to Rule 6, that a substantial
issue existed as to its claimed exemption.
Notification was given because reports
filed with the Commission under the
Federal securities laws disclosed complexities in the financial structure of the
system which Impaired Colonial's ability to
raise needed capital and adversely affected
its operating subsidiaries, In order to bring
the Colonial system into compliance with
the financial standards of the Holding Company Act, Colonial and the Commission
entered into a stipulation under which
Colonial and Its subsidiaries agreed that
their financings would comply with Sections 6, 7 and 12(b) of the Holding Company Act until disposition of the exemption
application. Colonial's capitalization improved substantially, and on July 30,
1981 , the Commission authorized mergers
which would result In the termination of
Colonial's corporate existence, the combination of two operating subsidiaries into
one operatIng utility company and the
ehrninatron of the holding company.
Columbia
Gas System, Inc.-On
November 3, 1980, The Columbia Gas
System, Inc. (Columbia), a registered holding company, filed an application seeking
authorization to merge With Commonwealth Natural Resources, Inc. (Commonwealth), a holding company exempt from
the Holding Company Act pursuant to Rule
2. Columbia will be the surviving corporation, and Commonwealth's subsidiaries Will
be retained as subsidiaries of Columbia.
The City of Richmond, Virginia, intervened
In the proceeding, essentially requesting
that merger of the transmission subsidiaries of Columbia and Common-

76

wealth be made a condition to merger
of the holding companies. The Commission denied the City's request.P'
Northern States Power CompanyNorthem States Power Company (Northem States), a utility company and an
exempt holding company under Section
3(a)(2) of the Holding Company Act, has
applied for authorization on behalf of itself
and its subsidiaries, pursuant to Sections
9 and 10 of the Holding Company Act,
to acquire the shares of outstanding
common stock of Lake Superior District
Power Company (Lake Superior), a Wisconsin corporation. The acquisition would
be accomplished through an offer to
shareholders of Lake Superior to exchange
0.48 shares of Northem States common
stock for each share of Lake Superior
common stock. Northern States also requested an exemption pursuant to Section
3(a)(2) of the Holding Company Act Public
hearings were ordered and have been concluded. At the close of the fiscal year, a
decision was pending.

Fuel Programs
During fiscal year 1981, the Commission
authorized approximately $1 billion for fuel
exploration and development activities for
the holding company
systems. This
represents a 72 percent increase over
fiscal year 1980 fuel expenditures. Table
42 in the Appendix lists the authorization
by holding company system for each fuel
program.
Largely as a result of radical changes in
cost and availability of fuel, utilities have
embarked on major programs to acquire
control over part of their fuel supply.
Generally, the arrangements Involve the
formation of subsidiaries or entry into joint
ventures for the production, transportation
and financing of fuel supplies or the supply
of capital for the exploration and the
development of reserves with a right to
share in any discovered reserves. Since
1971, the Commission has authorized expenditures of over $4.2 billion for fuel pro-

grams of holding companies subject to the
Holding Company Act

Service Company Operations
At the end of calendar year 1980, there
were 12 subsidiary service companies providing managerial, accounting, administrative and engineering services to 11 of the
13 holding companies registered under
the Holding Company Act. The billings
for services rendered to the holding company systems amounted to $fi08.4 million
or 2.30 percent of the total revenues
qenerated by the electric and gas operating
utllities. The subsidiary service companies
are heavily labor-intensive, employing
over 13,000 people, and have assets of over
$303 million. Table 41 in the Appendix lists

the subsidiary service companies with billings, total assets, and total personnel.

General Public Otitities
Corporation/Three Mile Island
During fiscal year 1981, the Commission
continued to monitor the financial and
operational Impact to the General Public
Utilities (GPU) system of the March 28,
1979, nuclear accident at Three MIle
Island Unit No.2 (TMI.2). The GPU system
has estimated the cost to decontaminate
and restore TMI-2 at $1.6 bilhon over the
next six years. As of June 30, 1981, approximately $235 million of this amount had
been expended. The GPU system has $300
million of property insurance coverage for

TMI-2.

Corporate Reorganizations

Reorganization proceedings
in the
United States District and Bankruptcy
Courts are not initiated by the Commission,
but are commenced by a debtor, voluntarily, or by its creditors. Federal bankruptcy
law allows a debtor in reorganization to continue to operate under the court's protection while it attempts to rehabilitate Its
business and work out a plan to pay Its
debts. Where a debtor corporation has
publicly Issued securities outstanding, the
reorganization process may raise many
issues that materially affect the rights of
public investors. In addition, the issurance
of new secunties to creditors and share.
holders pursuant to a plan are exempt from
registration under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. Therefore, the Commission enters Its appearance and participates in corporate reorganization proceedmqs to protect the interests of public In.
vestors holding the debtor's secunties and
to render independent, expert assistance
to the courts and parties in a complex area
of law and finance.
The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978,
which became effective October I, 1979,
represents a comprehensive revision of
Federal bankruptcy law and, in particular,
of the business reorqanizauon provisions
of the prior Bankruptcy Act. The reorganization provisions of the new Bank.
ruptcy Code, set forth In Chapter 11 there.
of, will apply only to cases commenced
on or after October I, 1979. Cases commenced prior to October I, 1979, continue
under the appropriate provisions of the
pnor Bankruptcy Act
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
authorizes the Commission to enter Its
appearance in any reorganization case and
to raise, or present its view on, any issue
in a Chapter 11 case. Although Chapter

11 applies to all types of business reo
organizations, the Commission will not
consider It necessary or appropnate to
participate in every case. Many cases will
involve only small enterpnses with uncomplicated capital structures or minimal
public investor interest. In its forty years of
participation in cases under Chapter X
of the prior Bankruptcy Act, the Comrrussion generally limited ItS perticipation to proceedings in which a substantial
public investor Interest was involved.
Dunng the past fiscal year, 65 debtors
with publicly issued securities outstanding
entered Chapter 11 reorganization pro.
ceedmqs. The Commission entered its
appearance in 18 of these cases, with ago
gregate assets of $2.5 billion and 130,000
public investors. (A list of these proceedings is set forth in Table 44 In the
Appendix to this Report) In these cases the
Commission presented its views, in court
and informally in consultation with other
participants, on a vanety of Issues IncludIng: (1) conflicts of Interests of members
of creditors' and equity security holders'
committees; (2) issues concerrunq the
debtor's operations and sales of assets; (3)
the need for appointment of a trustee or
examiner to conduct an investigation into
the debtor's affairs, and to answer quesnons concerning the validrty and effect of
the terms of the securities held by pubhc
Investors, the classjfication of their claims,
and proposed treatment in reorganization
plans; (4) the adequacy of disclosure in the
disclosure statement required to be transmitted to public investors when their votes
on a plan are being solicited: (5) the reason.
ableness of fees sought by counsel and
other professionals, and (6) interpretive questions concerrunq the Bankruptcy
Code's exemption from the secunties laws.

79

The Commission continues to play a
similar role in pending reorganization
cases under Chapter X of the prior

80

Bankruptcy Act A list of these cases is
set forth in Table 43 in the Appendix to
this report.

Administration and Management

General JV\anagement and Program
Developments
As part of a continuing effort to maximize
the use of available resources, the Office
of the Executive Director provided technical assistance to several divisions and
offices during 1981. The most significant undertaking In this area was a joint
effort WIth the Divrsion of Enforcement to
upgrade management. One track of the
project addressed the operational problems which anse in the investigation
and litigation of alleged security law
violations. The second track focused
on pohcy tools designed to enable
managers to track and analyze the progress of cases and resource allocations.
Early results of this effort have been most
evident in the increased accuracy and utility
of management reports. Weekly, monthly
and quarterly reports are now available
which analyze DIvision operations from a
number of perspectives (e.g., by orqaruzation, by case classification, changes over
time, resource utilization, etc.), Technical
assistance was also provided to the Office
of the Comptroller (in their effort to
modernize financial and cash management activines), the Office of the General
Counsel (to assist in development of a
case trackIng system), the Office of the
Secretary (in the development of an
automated system to track Cornrrussion
minutes), the Office of Administrative
Services (on plan for a new buildmq and
word processing equipment speoflcations), the DIVIsionof Corporation Finance
(in development of a capacity to automatically identify delinquent filings), the Office
of Applications and Reports Services (on
several records management projects), the
regional offices (on projects involving
automated
management
information

systems) and to the Cornmission's princrpal program divisions In their effort to
comply WIththe Paperwork Reduction Act.
In additIon, as reported to Congress In
the first quarter of fiscal 1981, a major
support office reorganizatIon was Implemented by the Office of the ExecutIve
Director. The reorganization moved positions and functions to new offices, thus
preserving operating functions while
achievmq the primary goal of consohdaunq
like tasks in specifically dedicated orqanizations. The expanded Office of Consumer
Affairs and Information Services handles all
public contacts for complaints, Freedom of
Information Act requests, forms distnbution, and public reference services. The
newly delineated Office of Apphcations and
Reports Services receives, indexes, stores,
and distributes all filings and mvestigatIve
matenals and also reviews, denies, or
makes effective all applications by brokerdealers, investment advisors, transfer
agents, and municipal securities dealers.
Usmg computers and micrographics
technology, in 1981 this group indexed
some 270,000 documents of all types,
filed approximately
200,000 archival
microfiche, and reviewed over 12,000
broker-dealer and investment advisor
filings. Finally, all adrmnistrative, mali, and
messenger services were consolidated m
the Office of Adrmrustranve Services,
and the program support and review
capabrhties of the Offices of the Executive
Director and InformatIon Systems Management were upgraded.
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
made a significant Impact on the Commission durinq fiscal 1981. In Apnl, the
Office of the Executive Director organized
the Cornrnission's effort to comply with
the Office of Management and Budget
81

(OMB) directives issued under the Act The
Chairman, Executive Director, and Deputy
Executive Director were designated to
administer the Act for the Commission.
Dunng the last half of the year, the rulemaking and legal staffs of the program
divisions produced 200 packages of
materials for OMB, covering some 375
individual rules, forms, and records requirements.
Although the substantive work of the
Commission has significantly expanded in
the past several years with the growth of
the economy and under Congressional
impetus, the Commission has used technology and improved
management
practices to cope with these changes without increased staffing. Overall, 1981
witnessed a tuming point as the Commission began to take fuller advantage of
computer and micrographics technology
in program offices beyond the support
office areas, where such resources were
Initially and most widely applied. It has
been the Commission's
experience,
however, that efficiencies generated by
technology and Improved organizational
structures have been offset by the increased complexity and volume of the
Commission's
workload. Accordingly,
continued great care will need to be exercised to seek, lead, and encourage the
personnel resources of the Commission,
which in the final analysis are the heart of
the agency.

Information Systems Management
Fiscal year 1981 ended the Commission's first five year plan for its automatic data processing (ADP) program. All
basic goals were met, including the acquisition of an IBf'I\ 370 computer and a
modem teleprocessmq
system and the
consolidation or creation of central data
files in support of certain major agency
programs. During 1981, attention swung to
upgrading computer software to utilize
more efficiently the new IBf'I\ 370 computer reported in 1980. Specifically, SIX

82

new information systems were implemented, and qualitative enhancements and
modifications were made to five others. In
addition, certain standards and procedures
in the Office of Information Systems
Management (ISM) were consolidated, and
several Commission ADP facilities were upgraded as outlined below.
The new facilities include a new operating system for the IBf'I\ 370 computer,
faster regional office access to headquarters files, improved data file storage,
and newer keyboards and printers in user
offices. Security passwords were initiated
to gain control over the cost and usage of
the automated legal research service obtained under contract by the Commission,
as well as to restrict access to sensitive
mvestigatory and management files on the
Commission's computer. Additionally, the
Cornrrussion made an agreement with
another agency to obtain contingency
computer support if the Commission's
system should be unable to function when
it is absolutely needed, for example, to
process payroll data or to process statistical
or Investigatory information.
Finally, a new five year plan was an.
nounced to lay the groundwork for con.
tJnuing to enhance the utilization of the
new computer, including modernizing program software, upgrading user involve.
ment in the design and retrival of automated data files, and planning for future equipment needs. In recognition of the broad
role of ADP, and to encourage the ADP
staff to work more closely with program
dIVISIons in order to better meet Commission goals, during 1981 the Office of
Data Processing was renamed the Office of
Information Systems Management, a user
relations unit was created in ISM, and an
ISM support unit was dedicated to the Commission's new market oversight and surveillance activity.
The five information systems enhanced
during 1981 were upgraded in response to
urgent user needs In those areas where
the new IBM 370 computer and related
data management techniques could most

rapidly make a major difference to certain
computer progams that had become
seriously unresponsive due to age. The revised systems Include several that support
the Cornrnissron's data base of company
names, addresses, and filings. The data
base tracks the availability of filings on
microfiche as well as the status of filings
reviews: It also detects companies that have
failed to file required reports. The computer programs that detect rmssinq reports
had to be completely re-written to use the
new data files and to take advantage of
other computerized Information In order to
produce complete profiles of delinquent
firms. In addition, the Cornrnission's revised filings and reqistrant files on the IBM
370 mainframe computer were designed
to be updated off-line by daily tapes containing registrant and filings Index data
captured and edited by a TI 990 minicomputer.
Finally, two management
systems were upgraded with on-line capabilities to support and track preliminary
Investigations and public complaints about
reqistrants, while the Cornrrnssion's Payroll Data Entry System was gIven on-line
capabilities as well.
The new computer system so enhanced
the efficiency of the software programming staff, that six new system applications
were implemented in 1981 rn addition to
the five major revisions outlined above, The
six new applications include an on-line retrieval of Index information conceming
Cornrrussion releases published in the SEC
Docket, an analytic system to facihtate
the selective review of corporate filings
under the Securities Act of 1933 (Secunties
Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and several systems supporting
matters such as ment pay, processing of
filing fees, corporate governance analyses,
and Invoice and voucher tracking and
payment
In early 1981, the Commission signed a
major new contract to obtain micrographics and drssernination services in a
manner that serves the needs of both
the public and the Cornrmssion. Public

reference rooms in the Office of Consumer
Affairs and Information Services and in
the three major regional offices are
supported by the contractor, as are the
Commission's archival files In the Office of
Applications and Reports Services. The
latter office also supplies all documents
filmed by the contractor and acts as the
Commission's technoloqical agent WIth
respect to the contract. As a result of the
new contract, the Commission now films all
major categories of filings, applications,
notices, and amendments through a contractor who disseminates film and paper
copies to the public for set fees while also
supplying the agency with Indexed archival
and public reference microfiche. The
public film files In headquarters and major
regional offices include 30 percent more
kinds of documents than were previously
available to the public on film, the archrval
files for staff use necessarily cover VIrtually
every type of document filed WIth the
Comrnission.
Both the rrucroqraphics program and
the Commission's document control staff
require specialized computer index update
and editinq support to maintain accurate
and timely processing of filings throughout each workday and during evenings and
weekends when necessitated by registrant
filing patterns. Accordmgly, the Office of
ApplIcations and Reports Services, after 18
months of development and independent
of the mainframe computer, Implemented
during early 1981 a document mdexmq
system built around a minicomputer
dedicated to capturing and editing filIngs
index data as part of the document receipt
and distribution process administered by
that office. The TI 990 minicomputer Inter.
faces WIth the rnicroqraphrcs contractor
through the Cornrnission's mainframe
computer, to which the minicomputer
provides off-hne dally tapes for professronal
staff use. As a result, local and remote
terminals hnked to the IBM 370 mainframe
computer can respond to quenes about
filings and can also be used to request that
rrucrofiche copies of filmed documents be

83

sent anywhere in the Cornrrusslon, including regional offices.
Finally, early In the second quarter of
fiscal 1981, a computer-indexed microfiche file of all General Counsel briefs and
selected motions from 1969 forward was
produced and furnished to the Com.
mission's legal staff. The case names of the
legal briefs and the topics they include were
made part of a special index system
resident on the agency's TI 990 minicomputer. In the future it is expected that
the index will be moved to the IBM 370
mainframe computer to facilitate regional
staff access. The computenzed Index IS
used by the legal staff to determine wmch
bnefs share any legal topic of interest.
Nternatively, of course, the staff can access
the rrucroflche directly If the identity of a
desired brief IS already known. Regional
offices, the Office of the General Counsel,
and the DIvision of Enforcement cooperated in review and extractmg topics from
approximately 900 cases to build the
Initial computerized topic file. Under the
aegis of the Office of the Executive DI'
rector, the Office of Applications and Reports Services designed the computerized
topic research Index, furrnshed the minicomputer, microfilmed the briefs, gen.
erally managed the project. The Office of
the General Counsel Wlll maintain the topic
file on the minicomputer now that the baSIC
legal brief conversion has occurred.

Financial Management
In fiscal year 1981, the Comrrussion
collected $65.3 million in fees from the
registration of securities, securities transactions on national secunties exchanges,
and miscellaneous fees for filings, reports
and apphcations. The fees collected represented approximately 81 percent of the
total funds appropriated by Congress for
Commission operations.
The Office of the Comptroller continued
the Implementation of an automated in-

84

tegrated financial management system.
During the year, a new system was implemented to charge commercial long
distance telephone calls to each organization. This system elirrunated the need for
each staff member to prepare a report to
the Comptroller for each individual telephone call, which in tum eliminated
thousands of reports that had to be reconciled annually with the telephone
bill. In addition, this system resulted in a
marked decrease in the cost of commercial
calls. In a separate matter, the Office of the
Comptroller and the Office of Legislattve
Affairs shared the acquisition and use of a
timeshare package called "Legislate" to
track the status of Comrrussion-related
legislation pending in Congress. Finally,
the position! employee reporting and trackIng system (pERl'S), implemented In fiscal
1980, was enhanced to produce detailed
organization charts and summary strength
reports of the Commission, thereby siqnificantly enhancing the Commission's abihty
to manage the allocation of specific staff
resources across programs and organizations.
Initiattves intended to improve or conserve resources completed in fiscal year
1981 included issumq a comprehensive
voucher audit handbook, microfiching one
million
documents,
establishing
procedures to Implement cash management
policies
for Treasury
deposits
and
accounts receivable and payable, and
developing new performance cntena for
employees of the Office of the Comptroller.
Finally, in an effort to reduce travel costs
and save time In obtaminq airline, train
and other common carrier tickets, the
Comrnlssion is one of five agencies participating in a test to use travel agents to pro'
cure travel arrangements at no cost to the
Government, A request for proposals from
interested travel agents was issued in
September, 1981. Work on the automated
integrated financial management system
will continue to fiscal year 1982.

Internal Audit
The Office of Intemal Audit within the
Office of the Chairman completed its first
full year of operation In fiscal 1981, during
which the Office reached its authorized
strength of a director, two auditors, and a
secretary. The audit staff provides independent feedback to the Chairman on
intemal controls and the progress of operations in achieving the Commission's longterm management goals. During the year,
the Office issued six reports covering
such diverse topics as data processing
risk assessment and a review of the irnprest fund. In addition, a major audit of the
Commission's equal employment opportunity complaint processing system was
initiated
and largely completed
in
fiscal 1981. The audit was intended to
identify strengths and weaknesses in the
complaint handling system and to correct
whatever deficiencies were noted. At year's
end, major reports in process include
reviews of the payroll system, telecommunications, and cash management

Personnel Management
DUring fiscal 1981, the Commission
continued to devote substantial efforts to
the implementation of the Civil Service Reform Act The new performance appraisal
system, described in last year's annual
report, was approved by the Office of Personnel Management and implemented by
the Commission. Merit pay employees,
comprising about 25 percent of the Commission's workforce, were the first to be
brought under the new system; by March
1981 all such employees were covered.
Simultaneously, work was begun on the
task of implementing
performance
appraisals for the approximately 1,400
employees not covered by merit pay. The
performance appraisal system was implemented for non-merit pay employees
on July 1, and all employees are now
operating under the new system. Evaluation of the performance appraisal system
will begin upon completion of the first
rating cycle in October of 1981.

Another major undertaking concems the
merit pay program developed by the Com.
mission, approved by the Office of Per.
sonnel Management,
and modified
Govemment-wide by the General Account.
ing Office. Upon becoming operational in
October 1981 , the first actual performance
ratings made under the new performance
appraisal system will be used as the
basis for pay adjustments, and will link
pay, other than cost of living allowances,
to the performance of each covered employee. Approximately 450 Commission
employees will be covered by merit pay:
specifically, 97 percent of grade GS-15
employees, 90 percent of grade GS-14
employees, and 10 percent of grade GS-13
employees.
Computer programs were developed to
calculate merit pay pools as well as Individual merit pay adjustments for each
employee covered by merit pay. Additionally, computer support will monitor the
operation of the system, evaluate Its
effectiveness as a management tool, and
ensure compliance with legal requirements.
The merit pay effort underwrote other improvements to the Commission's management of personnel resources. In particular,
ment promotion procedures and documentation were dovetailed with the Com.
mission's incentive award program so that
merit pay measures and appraisals of
employee performance and contributions
could be used to provide for greater flexibility, accuracy, and speed in recognizing
valuable employees.
The Commission's upward mobility program (INTERSECT) continued to be a very
successful program with a high degree
of management support and acceptance.
Over the past three years, twenty-two Intems have moved Into the mainstream of
their organizations in a varity of occupations,
including
paralegals, financial
analysts, compliance examiners, and computer programmers. There are five intems
in the 1981 INTERSECT program, all of

85

whom are scheduled to complete their
developmental assignments within the next
year.
Other mitlatrves begun in previous years
were earned foreward and expanded. An
aggressive attorney recruitment program
remains one of major significance, particularly as salary levels offered in the private
sector continue to rise more rapidly than
those in the Federal service. A Job Fair,
concentratIng on recruitment of minority
attorneys, generated substantIal interest
and resulted in 13 persons being hired
during the year. An affirmative action pro.
gram for the 87 persons at the Cornrrussron
who have idenufied themselves as having
some degree of handicap also continued to
be of major interest, The program includes
sign language classes and TDY telephones
for the deaf, braille in halls and elevators
for the blind, ramps and other aides for
wheelchairs, and orientation sessions for
managers in the Commission and other
aqencres, Fmally, similar to ItS earher
authonty for accountants and secunties
compliance examiners, the Commission
obtained from the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) the authority to recruit
and hire flnancial analysts without screen.
ing byOPM.

Equal Employment

Opportunity

The Equal Employment Opportunity
Office (EEOO), also within the Office of
the Chairman, developed an affirmative
action plan under guidelines prornulqated by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission's
(EEOC) Management
Directive 705 and as mandated by
Section 717 of Title VlI of the Civil RIghts
Act of 1964, as amended.
In part, because of this effort, the total
number of female and minority employees
in the work force at the Commission in.
creased 6.36 percent, even though a hiring freeze existed during the greater
part of fiscal year 1981.
The DIrector of Equal Employement
Opporturuty contmues to chair the SEC.

86

Securities Industry Committee for Equal
Employment Opportunity, organized in
1976. The Committee meets quarterly
to promote equal employment opportunities for minorities and females in the
securities industry. During fiscal year 1981,
the Committee again awarded four $1,000
one-tirne scholarships and one, four year
scholarship in the amount of $6,600 to
mmonty students interested in pursuing a
career in the securities field. This is the
fifth year for the scholarship program.
Annual observations and programs with.
in the Commission were developed and
conducted for Asian and Pacific American
Hentaqe Week, National Secretaries Week,
Women's Week and Hispanic Week.
A sexual harassment training program
was also developed as part of the Com.
rrussion's prevention of sexual harassment
in the work force plan. Approximately 125
employees m the Washington, D.C. area
completed an eight hour program during
May and June. This program will be con.
tinued during fiscal year 1982, and most
reqional offices will be included.

Consumer Affairs and
Information Services
During the 1981 fiscal year, the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act
(PA), public reference and publications
functions were merged into the Office of
Consumer Affairs, which was redesignated
as the Office of Consumer Affairs and
Information Services. The organizational
change was made to provide one-stop
service for public inquiries, investor com.
plaints, requests for publications, reproductions of filings and FOIA and PA requests. The new office spearheaded several
Important projects during 1981. Working
with the Office of Information Systems
Management, it implemented a direct input
capabilIty for the computerized complaint
handlIng system so that more accurate and
timely information can be used in the regulatory and enforcement programs of the
Commission.

Regarding the Freedom of Information
Act and the Privacy Act, in early 1981 the
Commission
formalized
a procedure
whereby parties submitting information
to the Commission can request confidential treatment in the event an FOIA
request for the submitted material is subsequently filed. This procedure seeks to
ensure that providers of information have
an opportunity to appeal to the Commission any determination to release such
information. While this procedure existed
informally for a number of years, the
advent of a Commission rule and attendant
publicity caused the volume of confidential
treatment requests to increase by 100
percent over prior years. The Office of
Consumer Affairs and Information Services
worked closely with the Divisions of Enforcement and Corporation Finance, the
Office of the General Counsel and the
regional offices to implement the new procedure and related innovations necessary
in managing confidential requests and
FOIA matters.
In addition to the new treatment of confidential data, and apart from a 10 percent
increase in the volume of FOIA and PA
requests received in 1981 over 1980, the
complexity of requests grew very noticably.
The increase in complexity is a serious
development resulting primarily from more
sophisticated utilization of the Acts by
parties experienced in their usage, especially law firms involved in litigation, proxy contest or other adversary situations.
Finally, the Office of Consumer Affairs
and Information
Services processed
approximately 165,000 inquiries In the
Public Reference Branch in 1981, including
12,000 publications requests and 86,000

telephone requests. The office installed an
automatic phone sequencer in the Public
Reference Branch to end the loss of over
30 percent of telephone inquiries experienced in prior years.

Facilities Management
In fiscal 1981, following approval of the
House and Senate Public Works Committees, the General Services Administration (GSA) issued a solicitation for
proposals in order to acquire a consohdated heaquarters building for the Comrrussion, The new headquarters is planned
to accommodate
Commission
staff
currently drstributed among three buildings in Washington, D.C. The GSA received
a number of responses, selected a building
now under construction
at Judiciary
Square, and signed a lease with the building owner on August 13, 1981. Fiscal
1982 appropriations for the lease and
move were pending in Congress as of the
end of fiscal 1981. Predicated on anticipated approval by the House and Senate
Appropriations
Committees, determination of floor plans and building details began In the fall of 1981 with the expectation of movmq in the summer of
1982. The consolidation will enable the
Comrrussion to save considerable expenses for shuttle vehicles, drivers, and
duplicate copying and serving facilities.
More importantly, it IS expected that the
work of the professional staff will be significantly facilitated due to the proximity of
corporate filings records and library resources, adequate office and conference
space, centralized support services, and
greater interaction between program units
that need to work together.

total revenues In 1980. Revenues from
this source increased 42 percent over
1979, rising to $6,876 million In 1980. This

million in 1980. Interest expense mcreased
26 percent over the 1979 level, although

employee compensation and benefits" ,
which includes compensation to all employees except registered representatives,

this category. This Item, ..all other ex.
penses", rose 46 percent to $8,236 milhon
in 1980 compared to $5,655 rnilhon in
1979. As a result, pre-tax income rose 84

carrying/ c1eanng firms in 1980 suggests
that this group is a suitable proxy for the
industry.
Securities commissions accounted for
333 cents of each revenue dollar earned in
1980. Trading gains and margin interest
contributed 21.9 cents and 12.1 cents,
respectively. Together these three items
accounted for 67.3 cents of each revenue
dollar earned, a slight decline from the

1979 level of 67.7 cents. Interms of dollars,
these three items accounted for $11,973
million of the $I7,783 million of total revenues eamed by canyingJ clearing firms,
Total expenses consumed 852 cents of
every revenue dollar generated, a decrease
from 89.0 cents in 1979, as the industry's
pre-tax profit margin increased from 11.0
cents per revenue dollar to 14.8 cents.
Interest expenses accounted for 21.1 cents
in 1980, compared to 24.0 cents in 1979.
Registered representatives' compensation
amounted to 19.7 cents, and clerical and
administrative employees' expenses consumed 15.7 cents of each revenue dollar.

These two employee-related items com.
prised 35.4 cents of the revenue dollar, a
decrease of one cent from the 1979 level.In
dollar terms, registered representatives'
compensation rose 58% to $3,506 million,
and clerical and administrative employees'
expenses rose 35 percent to $2,792 million
in 1980. Together they consumed $6,298

SeJf-Reguiatory Organizations:
Revenues. Expenses and Balance
Sheet Structure
From a financial perspective, most SelfRegulatory Organizations (SROs) and their
subsidiaries fared well in 1980, due in large
part to increased trading volume. The sole
exception, the ISE, experienced negative
pre-tax income for the second year in succession. Total revenue of SROs amounted
to $368.5 million, an increase of 24 percent
over the level of 1979. Total expenses increased by only 13 percent, from $271.7
million to $307.6 million. As a result, aggregate pre-tax income soared last year, up
$35.1 million to $60.9 million.
Revenues obtained from volume-related
activities are an important component of
SROs' income. For example, commission
fees accounted for $g().7 million in 1980, or
25 percent of total SROs' revenues. Usting
and communication fees contributed another $57.8 million (16 percent) and $522
million (14 percent), respectively. The
largest increase in revenues occurred in the
"other" revenues category, which grew 138
percent to $92.0 million. As a result of this
growth "other" revenues became the most
important revenue source. This category
consists primarily of Income from interest
and investments, and its growth could be
reflective of increasing equity prices and
bond yields in 1980.
Although increasing only marginally
during the year (0.5 percent), employee
costs continued to represent the largest
component of expenses for SROs last year.
Such costs aggregated $132.8 million
during the year, or43 percent of total SROs'
expenses. Communication,
data processing and collection costs rose by 10 per.
cent to $70.6 million, while occupancy
costs declined by $33 million to $153
million. The greatest increase in expenses
was in "all other expenses," which rose by
94 percent to $50.1 million, or 16 percent of
the total.
The individual organizations are quite
different in the pattem of their income
statements and balance sheets. Financial

110

information for individual SROs is pre.
sented on the accompanying tables.
Aggregate pre-tax income of SROs expanded by 136 percent in 1980, although
this growth was not spread evenly. In dollar
terms the NYSE accounted for $15.4
million (or 44 percent) of the aggregate
increase, followed by the ASE and the
CBOE, which experienced increases of
$53 million and $5.9 million in pre-tax income, respectively.
The NYSE, with assets of slightly less
than $168.6 million at the end of 1980 has
the largest asset base among SROs. The
NYSE was followed by the MSE ($155.5
million) and the PHLX ($44.0 million). To a
large extent, the differences in cost structure and asset distribution among SROs
are a function of the market served. For ex.
ample, the NYSE is a large "auction" market, where members of the exchange
gather in a central location to effect trans.
actions. Because of this, the NYSE incurs
relatively large fixed overhead costs and
makes substantial investments in plant and
equipment In contrast, the nature of the
"dealer" market served by the NASD is
such that large fixed cost outlays for business-related property are not required.
However, no matter what the form of the
market served by an SRO, the chief component of liabilities is accounts payable.
At the end of 1980 the net worth (or
members' equity) of SROs totalled $211.1
million, an increase of 19 percent over
1979. The NYSE, with $102.5 rrullion, accounted for nearly 49 percent of total SROs'
net worth last year. The next largest SROs
in terms of net worth, the ASE and the
NASD, had 14 percent and 13 percent
shares, respectively. Since 1975 the total
net worth of SROs has grown at an average
annual rate of 10 percent
C1eanng agency revenues increased
approximately $30 million during 1980.
A large portion of this increase can be
attributed to an $18.4 million increase in
the "Interest and Other Revenues" category. This category, which consists primarilyof interest income, increased due to

an over-all rise in interest rates as compared
to the previous year. Revenues from clearing and depository seJVicesalso increased
during 1980; each rising $6.6 million and
$4.9 million, respectively. The growth in
revenue from these seJVicesis due, in large
part, to an expansion of trading volume
which occurred during the year. The additional depository revenues can also be attributed to increased bank participation.
Another factor in the rise of clearing agency
revenues was the removal of the two and
one-half year Commission moratorium on
expansion of option listings. In particular,
Options Clearing Corporation experienced
a 35 percent growth in revenues as a con-

sequenc-e of increased option trading resulting from the termination of the moratorium.
Aggregate clearing agency expenses increased by $282 million during the year.
Generally, these cost increases occurred
In categories which are sensitive to the
volume of transactions processed. For example, "Employee Costs" which includes
labor costs and associated expenses, increased $10.8 million.
In conclusion, 1980 was a year of stable
growth in clearing and depository services,
with increases in aggregate clearing agen.
cy expenses offset by increases in reve-

nues.

EXEMPTIONS
Section 12(h) Exemptions
Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act
authorizes the Commission to grant a complete or partial exemption from the registration provisions of Section 12(g) orfrom
other disclosure and insider trading provisions of the Act where such exemption is
consistent with the public interest and the
protection of investors.
For the year beginning October 1, 1980,
15 applications were pending, and an additional 13 applications were filed during the
year. Of these 28 applications, 13 were
granted and 6 were withdrawn. Nine applications were pending at the close of the

year.
The decrease in the number of applications from previous years may have resulted from the wider use of general exemptive rules.

Exemptions for Foreign Private
Issuers
Rule 12g3-2 provides various exemptions from the registration provisions of
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act for the

securities of foreign private issuers. Perhaps the most important of these is that
contained in subparagraph (b) which provides an exemption for certam foreign
issuers which submit on a current basis
material specified in the rule. Such material
includes that information about which investors ought reasonably to be informed
and which the issuer: (1) has made public
pursuant to the law of the country of domicile or in which it IS incorporated or organized; (2) has filed with a foreign stock exchange on which its securities are traded
and which was made public by such exchange and/or (3) has distributed to its security holders. Periodically, the Comrnistion publishes a list of those foreign issuers
which appear to be current under the exemptive provision. The most current list is
as of September 30, 1981 and contains a
total of 360 foreign issuers.

Section 15(a) Exemptions
The Commission received two requests
for exemption from the broker-dealer registration requirement of Section 15(a) of the
Exchange Act. The Commission denied
119

one applicant's exemption request but
granted an exemption to the National Association of Investment Clubs (NNC) in connection with its stock purchase program.
The Commission determined that an ex.
emption for NNC would be consistent with
the public interest and the protection of
investors.

Rule 101>-6 Exemptions
Exchange Act Rule 10b-6 imposes certain prohibitions upon trading in securities
by persons interested in a distribution of
such securities. During the fiscal year, the
Commission granted approximately 350
exemptions pursuant to paragraph (f) of
Rule 10b-6 under circumstances indicating
that proposed purchase transactions did
not appear to constitute manipulative or
deceptive devices or contrivances comprehended within the purposes of the rule.

FINANCIAL INSTJT(JTJONS
Stock Transactions of Selected
F'mancial Institutions
Private noninsured pension funds, open.
end investment companies, life insurance
companies and property-liability insurance
companies purchased $103.0 billion of
common stock and sold $g3.1 billion in
1980. During 1979 gross purchases and
sales by these institutions were $59.7
billion and $55.1 billion, respectively. These
laoels represent an increase of about 70
percent over 1979. An increase of similar
magnitude, 60 percent, was exhibited in the

120

market value of stock purchased on U.S.
Securities Exchanges. Net purchases rose
sharply to $g.9 billion up from $4.6 billion in
1979. The common stock activity rate rose
from 29.8 percent in 1979 to 43.1 percent
in 1980. (Activity rate is defined as the average of gross purchases and sales, annualized, divided by the average market value
of holdings.)
Open-end investment companies again
had the highest activity rate for the year,
593 percent, increasing from 44.5 percent
in 1979. The second highest activity rate,
49.4 percent, was exhibited by separate
accounts of life insurance companies.
Separate accounts are held apart from gen.
eral accounts of life insurance companies,
and investments of up to 100 percent in
equities are allowed by law.
Purchases and sales by foreign investors
established new highs in 1980, rising to
$403 billion and $35.0 billion, respectively,
and resulted in net acquisitions of $5.4
billion. These figures compare to year
earlier purchases of $22.6 billion, sales of
$21.0 billion, and net acquisitions of $1.6
billion.
Revisions have been made in the rnethodology by which estimates are obtained
for common stock transactions of private
noninsured pension funds and propertyliability insurance companies. Revisions
have been made to the 1979 and 1980 data
and are presented along with unrevised
data for 1973.1977. Due to these revisions,
data for 1979 and 1980 are not comparable with the data for earlier years.

Stoekholdings

of Institutional

Investors and Others
At year-end 1980. the ten major categories of institutional investors listed in the
accompanying table held a combined total
of $519.9 billion in total corporate stock
outstanding (common and preferred stock
combined). This represented a 27.9 percent gain from the $406.4 billion in stocks
held a year earlier by these investors compared to the 33.6 percent growth of stock
held by all investors. Thus, the share of total
stock outstanding that was held by these
institutional investors dropped from 34.5

percent to 33.0 percent during calendar
1980. The value of stockholdings of other
domestic investors (primarily individuals
but also including broker<lealers and other
institutional investors not shown separately) rose 38.2 percent in 1980. At $938.9
billion, stockholdings of other domestic
investors accounted for 59.7 percent of
total stock outstanding at year-end 1980.
compared to 57.7 percent a year earlier.
Foreign investors held 73 percent of total
stock outstanding as of December 31,
1980, down from 7.8 percent a year earlier.

Private Noninsured Pension
Fund Assets
At the end of 1980, total assets of private
noninsured pension funds were $256.9
billion at book value and $2972 billion at
market value. These figures represent in.
creases of $33.4 billion and $72.0 billion,
respectively, over totals at the end of 1979.
The most important explanatory factor in
the growth of pension fund assets during
the year was a large increase in holdings of
common stock. At book value, common
stock holdings rose by $175 billion to
$1285 billion, an increase of 15.8 percent
The market value of common stock hold'
ings grew to $174.4 billion, gaining $51.7
billion or 42.1 percent (It should be borne
in mind that common stock prices rose
considerably during 1980. E.g., the Stan.

.Stock Exchange Composite Index in.
creased by 23.8 percent and 242 percent,
respectively.) Other categories of assets
which grew substantially during 1980 were

128

U.S. Government securities (increasing by
$5.8 billion at book value and $4.8 billion
at market value), and Corporate and Other
Bonds (increasing by $4.4 billion at book
and $8.7 at market).
The composition of assets of private non.
insured pension funds has changed con.
siderably in the past seven years. Viewed at
book value, the most important shift has
occurred with respect to common stock
holdings. In 1973, common stock holdings
accounted for 63.7 percent of total assets;
however, this percentage declined steadily,
reaching a trough of 49.1 percent in the
second quarter of 1979. Since that time
common stocks have gradually increased
in importance, to 50 percent of total assets.
U.S. Government securities have grown
significantly as a percentage of the aggregate portfolio, from 35 percent in 1973 to
11.0 percent in 1980. The importance of
Other Assets has virtually doubled since
1973 to 8.4 percent of total assets, perhaps
an indication of diversification into newer
forms of investments.

Purpose and Type of Registration
Effective registrations for cash sale for
the account of issuers amounted to $91.9
billion, or 64 percent, of all $144.0 billion
of effective reqistrations in fiscal year 1981.
Some $61.0 billion of these effective registrations (42 percent of all registrations)
were intended for immediate offerings
rather than for extended or other types of
offerings, a slight decline ($743 million or
1 percent) from the $61.7 billion of such
registrations in the previous fiscal year.
Offerings by business to the general public
totalled $57.2 billion in fiscal year
1981, a decline of $839 million (1 percent)
from the $58.0 billion of such offerings in
fiscal year 1980. Of this amount, debt
securities accounted for $302 billion (53
percent), preferred stock $2.4 billion (6 percent) and common stock $24.6 billion (43
percent). Cash rights offerings (offerings
to security holders) came to $656 million in
fiscal year 1981, a decline of $1.1 billion
(62 percent) from the $1.8 billion of such
offerings In fiscal 1980. Cash offerings by
foreign govemments in fiscal year 1981
totalled $3.1 billion, an increase of $1.2
billion (65 percent) from the $1.9 billion
of such offerings in fiscal year 1980.
In fiscal year 1981, another $30.9 billion
of securities (21 percent of all registrations)
were registered for cash sale for the
account of the issuer in extended and
similar types of offerings other than those
for Immediate cash sale. Securities register.
ed for the account of issuers other than for
cash sale (in conjunction with exchange
offers, for example) amounted to $493
bilhon in fiscal year 1981, 34 percent of all

142

registrations. Registration of securities
for secondary offerings (for the account of
selling security holders rather than issuers)
amounted to $2.9 billion (2 percent) of all
registrations in fiscal year 1981. Of these
registrations for secondary offerings, $1.7
billion (59 percent) were in conjunction with cash sales and $12 billion
(41 percent) were for other types of offerings such as exchange offerings.
In fiscal year 1981, debt securities were
primarily registered for cash sale to the
general public in immediate offerings for
the account of issuer ($302 billion, 72
percent of total debt registrations of $422
billion). Registrations of other types of
securities, however, were more evenly
divided between registrations for immediate cash sale and registrations for
other types of offerings. All registrations of
preferred stock of $5.4 billion were principally divided between those for immediate
cash sale for the account of issuer ($2.5
billion, or 45 percent of preferred stock
registrations) and registration for other
than cash sale for the account of issuer
($2.9 billion, or 54 percent of all reqistrations of preferred stock). All registrations of
common stock ($96.5 billion) were principally divided among registrations for
immediate cash sale for the account of
issuer ($252 billion, or 26 percent of all
common stock registrations), registrations
for extended cash sale for the account of
issuer ($24.0 billion, or 25 percent of all
common stock registrations) and registrations for other than cash sale for the
account of issuer ($44.4 billion, or 46
percent of all common stock registrations).
Note: 1980 figures have been revised.

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceeding
As the table reflects, the secunties
laws provide for a wide range of enforcement actions by the Commission. The
most common types of actions are in.
junctive proceedings instituted in the
Federal district courts to enjoin continued

98

or threatened securities law violators, and
administrative proceedings pertaining to
broker-dealer firms and/or individuals as.
sociated with such firms which may lead
to various remedial sanctions as required
In the public interest When an injunction
is entered by a court, violation of the
court's decree is a basis for criminal con.
tempt against the violator.

Trading Suspensions
During fiscal 1981, the Commission
suspended trading in the securities of 23
companies, two less than the 25 trading
suspensions in fiscal 1980 and equal to the
23 trading suspensions in fiscal 1979. In
most instances, the trading suspension was
ordered either because of substantial
questions as to the adequacy, accuracy
or availability of public information con.
ceming the company's financial condition
or business operations, or because transactions in the company's
sec unties
suggested possible manipulation or other
violations.

Foreign Restricted list
The Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign Restricted List which is
designed to put broker-dealers, financial
institutions, investors and others on notice
of unla\\lful distributions of foreign securities in the United States. The list consists
of names of foreign companies whose
securities the Commission has reason to
believe have been, or are being, offered for
public sale in the United States in violation of the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act The offer and
sale of unregistered securities deprives investors of all the protections afforded by
the Securities Act, including the right to
receive a prospectus containing the
information required by the Act While
most broker-dealers refuse to effect transactions in securities issued by companies
on the Foreign Restricted List, this does
not necessarily prevent promoters from
illegally offering such securities directly to
investors in the United States by mail, by
telephone, and sometimes by personal
solicitation. The total number of corpora.
tions on the list is 99.
During the past fiscal year, one corporation, Rancho San Rafel, SA, was added to
the Foreign Restricted Ust.
Information came to the Commission's
attention that Rancho San Rafel, SA. of
Costa Rica was soliciting investors in the

United States to purchase its securities.
Since no registration statement has been
filed nor become effective pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 with respect to these
securities, their offer and sale may be in
violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act
of 1933.
The complete hst of all foreign corporations and other foreign entities on the
Foreign Restricted List on September
30, 1981 is as follows:

year 1980 fuel expenditures. The following
table lists the authorization by holding com.
pany system for each fuel program.
Largely as a result of radical changes in

Corporate Reorganizations
During the fiscal year the Commission
entered 18 reorganization cases filed
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code

public investors. Including the new cases
the Commission was a party in a total of 35
Chapter 11 cases durinq the fiscal year. The
stated assets of the companies involved
in these cases totaled approximately $3.95
billion and their indebtedness of about
$4.1 billion. During the fiscal year 12 cases

160

involving assets of $250 million and llabilities of $210 million were concluded
either through confirmation of a plan of
reorganization, liquidation or dismissal,
leaving 23 cases in which the Commission
was a party at year-end.
