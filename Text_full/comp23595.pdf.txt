Case No. 2:16-cv-1664

ZACHARY BROOKE ROBERTS, an
individual,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), alleges as follows:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1.

Between December 2011 and July 2012 (the “relevant period”), Encore

Acceptance I, LLC (“EAI”), a Nevada limited liability company then owned and controlled by
Defendant Zachary Brooke Roberts, raised approximately $1.72 million through the sale of

1

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 2 of 17

promissory note securities to a group of approximately 18 investors for use in connection with an
online payday lending business operated in partnership with The Chippewa Cree Tribe of the
Rocky Boy’s Reservation, Montana (the “Tribe” or “Tribal”), a federally-recognized Native
American tribe. In furtherance of a fraudulent scheme, neither EAI nor its representatives (which
included Roberts) informed investors that certain persons and entities affiliated with EAI were
then and had previously been making payments to certain members of and officials of the Tribe,
and that the existence of these payments, if discovered by the Tribe and deemed by them to be
improper or fraudulent, could materially threaten the safety, security, and return of the investor
funds. What statements EAI did make to investors were incomplete and materially misleading.
2.

By engaging in this conduct, as further described herein, EAI and Roberts

violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and
Rule 10b–5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b–5].
3.

In the alternative, as the individual controlling EAI during the relevant period,

Roberts, pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)], is liable for EAI’s
violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b–5 thereunder.
4.

Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Roberts may continue to violate

Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b–5
thereunder.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
5.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d) of the

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(d)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange

2

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 3 of 17

Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)] to enjoin such acts, practices, and courses of business, and
to obtain disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, an officer and director bar,
and such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and appropriate.
6.

EAI and Roberts, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instruments of

transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the
conduct alleged in this Complaint.
7.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22

of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v] and Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa].
8.

Venue in this District is proper because Roberts is found in, inhabits, and/or

transacted business, including through EAI, in this District, and because one or more acts or
transactions constituting the violations occurred in this District.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
22.

At some point during early 2010, Roberts was introduced to the Tribe and, in

conjunction with Broome, Mazzara, and, possibly, other associates (collectively, the “Encore
associates”), came to an agreement with the Tribe to advise and manage the Tribe’s then nascent
entry into the online payday lending industry via the Tribe’s newly formed FACR subsidiary
(which, as described above, subsequently included a subsidiary of its own: FACR1).
23.

The entity via which Roberts and the other Encore associates provided advisory

and management services to FACR was ESC, which was ostensibly owned and managed by
Broome.
24.

To govern the new advisory and management relationship, ESC, the Tribe, and

FACR entered into a Management Agreement dated October 22, 2010.
25.

Among other things, the Management Agreement contained provisions

prohibiting ESC from interfering in Tribal affairs (§ 8.2), making payments to members of Tribal
government (§ 8.4), and restricting Tribal members’ ability to possess financial interests in
FACR or ESC (§ 8.6).
26.

Sometime during early 2011, the Tribe was approached by and entered into

6

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 7 of 17

negotiations with Think Finance, Inc., a large Texas-based lender that controlled a significant
loan portfolio and which sought to have the Tribe become a business partner with it in regard to
the loan portfolio. Roberts and the other Encore associates assisted the Tribe in performing due
diligence on the new business opportunity, and the Tribe eventually utilized its Plain Green
entity to pursue the business opportunity with Think Finance. This business venture, due to the
size of the loan portfolio, was expected to be lucrative and to generate significant cash flow for
the Tribe through Plain Green.
27.

The Encore associates sought compensation from the Tribe in the amount of

$15,000.00 for their due diligence work on the Think Finance proposal and a retainer equal to
10% of the future gross income of Plain Green in exchange for providing ongoing advice to the
Tribe in regard to the Think Finance‒Plain Green business venture.
28.

This compensation proposal was not accepted by the Tribe.

29.

During May 2011, an amended Management Agreement (dated April 14, 2011)

was executed between ESC and FACR. This amended agreement, in addition to increasing
ESC’s share of FACR’s profits to 49% from 40%, also introduced language that had the effect of
providing ESC with a significantly expanded revenue pool over which it could assert its
management fee claims.
30.

While the original Management Agreement pertained only to FACR and

subsidiaries thereof, the amended agreement pertained to “one or more instrumentalities and
commercial subdivisions of the Tribe” and included “FACR and any other entity formed by the
Tribe to undertake business of the type conducted by FACR.” ESC’s objective in executing the
amended Management Agreement was to obtain a share of the expected profits from the Think

7

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 8 of 17

Finance – Plain Green business venture.
31.

Around the same time that the amended Management Agreement came into being,

Roberts and/or one of the other Encore associates also created a new Fee Agreement among ESL,
several of the Tribe’s lending businesses (including FACR and Plain Green but specifically
excluding FACR1, as to which ESC continued to assert a claim to 49% of the profits pursuant to
the amended Management Agreement), and, ostensibly, the Tribe itself.
32.

Pursuant to the Fee Agreement, which was supposedly executed on June 1, 2011,

but was more likely executed in late July 2011 and also contained one or more forged signatures
on behalf of the Tribe’s entities, ESL became entitled to receive 15% “of all Gross Revenues in
the course of their [(i.e., various of the Tribe’s lending entities, including those created
subsequent to the date of the agreement)] online lending business[es] in perpetuity for as long as
the Tribe or its lending entities receive revenue from lending activities.”
33.

As for the reason for the new Fee Agreement, Roberts, in connection with an

arbitration proceeding between ESL and the Tribe et al., testified that ESC, apparently in view of
the terms of the amended Management Agreement, believed it possessed exclusive management
rights over the Tribe’s lending business activities, and this exclusivity entitled ESC to 49% of the
Tribe’s profits derived from Plain Green’s activities.
34.

Recognizing that seeking to take 49% of the Tribe’s profits derived from Plain

Green—a business that was established before the Management Agreement was amended to
include the purported exclusivity provisions—was, as Roberts testified in connection with the
aforementioned arbitration, “just too much to expect,” Roberts and the other Encore associates
instead decided to seek 15% of the Tribe’s profits via the Fee Agreement (in addition to the 49%

8

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 9 of 17

ostensibly granted to them on FACR1’s profits pursuant to the terms of the amended
Management Agreement).
35.

Roberts and the other Encore associates initially were unsuccessful in having their

proposed Fee Agreement adopted and implemented by the Tribe and its various lending
businesses.
36.

Roberts and the other Encore associates only achieved success in having their

proposed Fee Agreement adopted and implemented by the Tribe once they enlisted the services
of Eastlick and reached an agreement through him to pass through one-third (⅓) of ESL’s
expected receipts under the proposed Fee Agreement to Ideal Consulting, a shell entity then
believed by Roberts and the other Encore associates to be owned in equal shares by Rosette and
Morsette, both of whom were then senior officers of FACR and Plain Green in addition to being
members of the Tribe.
37.

For his services, Eastlick is also believed to have secured an unwritten agreement

with Roberts and the other Encore associates to receive, via another shell entity, Trio Consulting,
20% of ESL’s remaining two-thirds (⅔) of its anticipated receipts received under the Fee
Agreement.
38.

Consistent with these agreements, banking records of ESL show that, between

September 2011 and July 2013, a total of $1,157,476.37 was paid by ESL to Ideal Consulting,
and a total of $463,748.09 was paid by ESL to Trio Consulting. Additionally, on or about August
5, 2011, a wire in the amount of $50,652.40 was received by Ideal Consulting from an entity
named Worldwide Portfolio Management, LLC, which shares the same physical address as
numerous other entities affiliated with Roberts.

9

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 10 of 17

39.

During the period when the amended Management Agreement and the Fee

Agreement were put into effect, Roberts and the other Encore associates continued to move
forward with establishing the FACR lending business.
40.

Needing additional capital to fund FACR after funding from a Salt Lake City,

Utah-based private fund proved insufficient, Roberts caused EAI to offer and sell promissory
notes to investors.
41.

The EAI promissory notes issued and sold to investors are securities.

42.

Between December 2011 and July 2012, EAI offered and sold, via Roberts and at

least one other individual, approximately $1.72 million of high-interest (24%) promissory note
securities to approximately 18 investors via a private placement memorandum (the “PPM”)
which contained various information about EAI and the planned use of investor funds in
connection with FACR and its subsidiary, FACR1.
43.

EAI failed to disclose in the PPM, and Roberts and the other EAI promissory note

salesman failed to orally disclose to investors, information concerning (a) the payments ESL
made and was continuing to make to Ideal Consulting and to Trio Consulting, (b) the
agreements, written or otherwise, pursuant to which those payments were being made, (c) the
identities of the individuals behind Ideal Consulting and Trio Consulting and the nature of the
relationships between those individuals and the Tribe, (d) the close association between Roberts,
EAI, ESC, ESL, and EAL, (e) that such payments by ESL to Ideal Consulting and to Trio
Consulting (along with an ownership interests in ESC that Eastlick obtained in connection with
certain loans he made to EAL) violated the terms of the Management Agreement and the
amended Management Agreement (e.g., §§ 8.2, 8.4, and 8.6) and would be deemed to be an

10

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 11 of 17

instance wherein “…[ESC], or a principal, director or officer of [ESC], has committed an act of
personal dishonesty or breach of fiduciary duty to [FACR] that results or was intended to result
in a personal profit to [ESC]” (§ 9.3 [Termination for Cause] of the Management Agreement and
the amended Management Agreement), and (f) that if the Tribe/its entities terminated the
amended Management Agreement and ceased to continue to do business with ESC, such an
action would materially threaten the safety and viability of the investors’ EAI promissory note
investments as their return was significantly dependent upon the continued existence of a
harmonious business relationship between ESC, the Tribe, and the Tribe’s FACR and FACR1
entities.
44.

There is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would have considered

the omitted information material in deciding whether or not to invest in the EAI promissory note
securities.
45.

EAI was under a duty to disclose this information to investors and potential

investors in view of the materiality of the information and EAI’s fiduciary or agency
relationship, course of prior dealings, and attendant circumstances such that investors had placed
trust and confidence in EAI.
46.

In addition to these omissions, EAI engaged in one or more misstatements of

material fact or omissions to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
not misleading.
47.

In the PPM, EAI and Roberts stated to investors that: “Our ability to make the

required payments under the [terms of the promissory notes] is directly related to [FACR (or
FACR1)]’s and [ESC’s] ability to successfully operate an Internet-based consumer lending

11

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 12 of 17

business.”
48.

This statement, and the explanation that followed it in the PPM, were materially

misleading because they failed to also inform investors that EAI’s ability to make the required
payments was also, as developments have shown, directly related to the Tribe not terminating its
business relationship with ESC upon discovery of the payment scheme described herein.
49.

The EAI PPM also stated to investors that: “Debt instruments bearing high

interest rates, such as the Loan, are often associated with ponzi [sic] schemes, particularly in the
payday loan business… We have no evidence that [FACR (or FACR1)] or [ESC] is, or would be,
involved in such a scheme; however, fraud is common in situations in which notes with high
rates of interest are issued and in the payday loan industry. Noteholders of [EAI] may lose some
or all of its [sic] investments because of fraud or other illegal practice by [FACR (or FACR1)],
[ESC] or an affiliate.”
50.

This statement was materially misleading because it failed to disclose the

existence of the payment scheme discussed herein that was operational before this statement was
provided to investors via the PPM (i.e., the alleged fraud was an actuality and not a potentiality).
51.

The EAI PPM also stated to investors that: “Additional risks and uncertainties not

presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
operations and your investment.”
52.

This statement was materially misleading because existence of the payment

scheme described herein and the likely result of its potential discovery by the Tribe was a risk
known to EAI and to Roberts that could not credibly be deemed immaterial.
53.

Following the Tribe’s discovery of the payment scheme described herein and the

12

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 13 of 17

consequent termination by it of its business relationship with ESC, EAI and Roberts misled and
lulled the EAI promissory note investors by stating to them, via an Information Statement, that
the business disruption was due to a change in Tribal leadership.
54.

The Information Statement failed to disclose the existence of the payment scheme

described herein. As such, it was materially misleading and made in furtherance of EAI’s and
Roberts’ fraudulent scheme.
55.

EAI, via its and Roberts’ fraudulent omissions, misstatements, and scheme, thus

improperly obtained at least $1,719,832.50 in investor funds.

[15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]
56.

The Commission re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every

allegation in paragraphs 1-55, inclusive, as if they were fully set forth herein.
57.

By engaging in the conduct described above, Roberts, in the offer or sale of

securities by the use of means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate
commerce or by use of the mails, directly or indirectly, employed a device, scheme, or artifice to
defraud; obtained money or property by means of one or more untrue statements of a material
fact or omissions to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and engaged in transactions,
practices, or courses of business which operated as a fraud or deceit upon the purchasers of the
EAI promissory note securities.
58.

Roberts, acting through EAI, intentionally or recklessly engaged in the fraudulent

13

Case 2:16-cv-01664 Document 1 Filed 07/14/16 Page 14 of 17

or deceitful conduct described above.
59.

By reason of the foregoing, Roberts violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act

[15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate Section 17(a) of the Securities
Act.
Second Cause of Action
Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b–5(b) Thereunder
[15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b–5]
60.

The Commission re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every

allegation in paragraphs 1-55, inclusive, as if they were fully set forth herein.
61.

By engaging in the conduct described above, Roberts, in connection with the

purchase or sale of a security, and while making use of means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce or of the mails, employed a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; made one or more
untrue statements of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; and engaged in an act, practice, or course of business which operated as a fraud or
deceit upon one or more persons.
62.

Roberts, as the sole person that controlled EAI, was the maker of the one or more

untrue statements of a material fact or omissions to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.
63.

Roberts, acting through EAI, intentionally or recklessly engaged in the fraudulent

or deceitful conduct described above.
64.

By reason of the foregoing, Roberts violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act

14

65.

The Commission re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every

allegation in paragraphs 1-55, inclusive, as if they were fully set forth herein.
66.

During the relevant period, Roberts was the sole person who controlled EAI.

67.

Pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)], every person

who, directly or indirectly, controls any entity liable under any provision of the Exchange Act or
of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same
extent as such controlled entity to any person to whom such controlled person is liable (including
the Commission), unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or
indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.
68.

Roberts did not act in good faith and directly induced the act or acts constituting

EAI’s violations of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder.
69.

By reason of the foregoing, and in the alternative to his direct violations of the

Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder described above, Roberts violated Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b–5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §
240.10b–5] through his control of EAI and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate Section
