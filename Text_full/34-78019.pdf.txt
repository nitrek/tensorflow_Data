In the Matter of the Application of
ERIC DAVID WANGER

ORDER DIRECTING
THE FILING OF BRIEFS

Eric David Wanger has applied for Commission "review and reduction or cancellation of
a FINRA sanction posted on FINRA's BrokerCheck website." On May 31, 2016, FINRA filed a
copy of the index to the record in the matter, pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 420(d).1
The posting at issue concerns BrokerCheck's description of a Commission order that
"barred [Wanger] from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal
securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating
organization . . . with the right to apply for reentry after one (1) year . . . ."2 The BrokerCheck
website states that Wanger has been "permanently barred . . . from acting as a broker and
investment adviser, or otherwise associating with firms that sell securities or provide investment
advice to the public."3 Wanger claims that the BrokerCheck posting "alter[s] the SEC Bar Order
and re-interpret[s] the words . . . that now perforce has permanently blocked Respondent[] of his
right to seek employment . . . ."
At this time, the Commission requests the views of the parties as to the preliminary
matter of whether the Commission has jurisdiction to review Wanger's application pursuant to
Section 19 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.4
