Order Directing Appointment
of Tax Administrator

By order dated March 23, 2005, the Commission ordered respondent Putnam Investment
Management, LLC (“Putnam”) to pay disgorgement and a penalty. Pursuant to that order, on
March 28, 2005, respondent Putnam paid a total of $40,000,001 of disgorgement and penalty to
the Commission (the “Distribution Fund”). Under the Internal Revenue Code and related
regulations, the Distribution Fund constitutes a Qualified Settlement Fund (“QSF”).1 The
Commission has solicited proposals from several tax firms, and has determined that Damasco &
Associates, located in San Francisco, California, is best suited to act as tax administrator in this
proceeding.
Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED that:

1

A.

Pursuant to Rule 1105(a) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, Damasco & Associates be appointed as tax administrator
(the “Tax Administrator”) for the QSF with limited authority and power to: (1)
act as the administrator for tax purposes for the qualified settlement fund
(“QSF”); (2) prepare, sign, and file the necessary tax returns and tax-related
documents for the QSF; (3) obtain the necessary tax-related documents and
identifiers, such as an employee identification number, on behalf of the QSF; (4)
perform other tax-related and reporting duties on behalf of the QSF as required
by Department of the Treasury regulations relating to QSF administrators; and
(5) communicate on behalf of the QSF on matters set forth in this paragraph.

B.

The bond requirement of Rule 1105(c) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund
and Disgorgement Plans is waived for good cause shown, specifically, as further

Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 468B(g); related regulations, 26 C.F.R. §§ 1.468B-1 through
1.468B-5.

described below, because the Tax Administrator shall never have custody or
control of the QSF;
C.

The Tax Administrator shall submit, at least 30 days prior to any date on which a
tax payment is required on behalf of the QSF, or as soon as is practicable,
documents showing the amount necessary to satisfy the tax liability of the QSF as
well as all other documents supporting such amount. The Tax Administrator shall
submit such documents to the Respondent, with a copy to the Commission staff
member assigned to this proceeding. The Respondent shall pay the amount of the
documented taxes to the Tax Administrator by check or wire transfer. The Tax
Administrator, in turn, shall be responsible for paying the taxes to the IRS and the
relevant state taxing authority, if any, on behalf of the QSF.

D.

The Tax Administrator shall comply with all reporting requirements applicable to
a qualified settlement fund as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.468B1(a), as amended, and shall file on a timely basis all required federal, state, and
local tax returns, and shall contemporaneously provide copies of such filings to
the assigned Commission staff member.

E.

The Tax Administrator shall keep records and bill each QSF for the services
provided to it. Each bill shall be reviewed by the assigned Commission staff
member. The Tax Administrator will submit the bill to the Respondent for
payment by check or wire transfer. The fees billed shall be as agreed upon in the
Tax Administrator’s engagement letter accepted by the Commission on March 8,
2005.

By the Commission.

Secretary
