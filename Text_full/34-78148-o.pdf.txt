Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
June 24, 2016

In the Matter of
BREITLING ENERGY
CORPORATION,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Breitling Energy Corporation
("BECC”) (CIK No. 0001229089) because of questions regarding the accuracy of assertions by
BECC, a Nevada corporation whose principal place of business is listed as Dallas, and by others,
in public reports filed with the SEC and press releases concerning, among other things: (1) the
company’s assets; (2) the company’s business transactions; and (3) the company’s current
financial condition. BECC’s common stock is quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets
Group, Inc. under the ticker symbol BECC.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.

THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT, on June 24, 2016 through 11:59 p.m. EDT, on July 8, 2016.
By the Commission.
