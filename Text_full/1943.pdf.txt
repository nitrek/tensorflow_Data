PART I
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
GENERAL SCOPE OF REGISTRATION

REQUIREMENTS

UNDER THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

The Securities Act of 1933 provides for full disclosure of pertinent information
regarding securities public~
offered for sale in interstate commerce or through the
mails, but does not confer upon the Commission the power to approve or pass upon the
merits of aQY security.
The Act is also designed to prevent misrepresentation, deceit
and other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities.
Issuers of securities to be
publicly offered and sold in interstate commerce are required to file registration
statements with the C~ission.
These registration statements must contain specified
information on the proposed offering and are available for public inspection.
An integral part of the requirements of each statement is a prospectus setting forth in condensed or summarized form the more essential information contained in the registration
statement.
The Act provides that the prospectus must be made available to all prospective purchasers of the security.
The Commission's registration and examination procedures, and its power to issue stop-order proceedings to suspend the effectiveness of
the registration statement have been described in previous annual reports.
NEW RULES, REGULATIONS

AND FORMS FOR REGISTRATION

UNDER THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 19.33

A material simplification of forms and reporting requirements under the Securities
Act of 1933 was effected during the past fiscal year in connection with a general p. ogram which is discussed in the following section.
General~lification
of registration and re~rting requirements under various
Acts.-The
C~sion
announced on December TIr," 19, "bl a comprehensivesIiiiplification
of a number of registration and. reporting requirements under various Acts which it administers, particularly the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the Public Utility Holding Compav Act of 1935, and the Investment Company Act of 1940.
These changes incorporated many of the suggestions received from representatives of the
securities industry which had been under consideration for some time. The Commission's
study leading to these c~es
was accelerated by the proposed revision of its proxy
rules, announced at the same time, and discussed elsewhere in this report. Subsequent
experience shows that this general streamlining and coordination of registration and
reporting forms has resulted in considerable savings of paper work without material
lessening of the protection to investors afforded by the statutes. The principal revisions are:
1. A new general form has been adopted for registration of commercial and industrial companies under the Securities Act of 1933, permitting the filing of the
prospectus as a principal part of the registration statement, thus eliminating
much. duplication between the prospectus and the registration statement proper.
2.

A registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 becomes a
basic document under the simplification program so that securities covered by
the statement ~
 be listed on a stock exchange by filing copies of the registration statement.
If a company is required to file annual reports with the
Commission, these reports may consist principally of copies of its registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, its annual report to stockholders,
or a thirteen-months' prospectus.
One result is that a company's ~al
report
to stockholders, its prox,r statement and its annual report to the Commission
may, if the company- so elects, be substantially the same document.

3. A number of changes have been effected in the requirements for financial statements designed to simplif'y the presentation
discussed in more detail infra.

S.

The Annual Supplement FormUSSfor registered holding companies has been revised to eliminate 23 out of a total of 42 items or sub-d, tams and 6 ou:t of a
total of 13 exhibits or sub-exhibits.
In addition, mau;r of the remaining
items and instructions
thereto have been amendedto decrease the quantity of
1n!"ormati01!l
required.

6.

Two skeleton forms have been adopted for the use of public

utility
holding
companies registered under the Public utility
Holding CompanyAot of 1935 in
filing annual reports under Sections 13 and 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. These forms permit such companies to file copies of their annual
supplements in lieu of furnishing th~ information required in. the forms heretofore used by such corporations.
However, such companies must file the
financial statements required by Form 10-K and the financial statements must
be prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X.

The new program also includes simplified forms for the registration
of securities
of closed-end and open-end managementinvestm.ent companies and unit investment trusts
which permit suoh companies to file a registration
statement consisting of little
more
ithan a pro8f)ectus.
The use of the new forms included in the silup1ification program is entirely' permissive, except that the new Form U5Sunder the Public utility Holding CompanyAct of
1935 is intended to supplant the existing form until f'urther notice.
Any" companymay
use them or may follow the procedure heretofore in effect.
The Commissionpointed out
in its announcementthat it will give careful consideration to any- criticisms
or suggestions nth regard to the use of the new forms.

These are described later in this report.

Rttles goverJ!!ng exempt issues aaended.-Regu1.ation A was amendedto clartl'y the
circumstances under 1d1ich it is available far the exemption frOJl.the Securities Act of
1933 of an issue of securities which nae once been effectively' registered under that
Act. Schedules A to F prescribed by Rule 330 of Regulation B "Irere amendedby el:Uninating the requirement that information regarding the maximum offering price be disclosed,
and by sub5ti tuting in the appropriate schedules the requirement of statements of the
aggregate tl'WIlberof oil and gas interests offered for sale, and of the percentage of
production which will be ownedby the operating lessee or lessees, unencumbered, upon
completion of the sale of the issue offered.
The Commissioneliminated the r.equiremant of a statement of the maximum offering
price fram the schedules beeanse it had been informed that salesmen have somet:iJnesused
such statement as a representation to invest<trs of a value approved by the COIIIIl1ssion.
The only f'unc1iion of this requirement was to disclose to the COIIlIIlission
that the aggregate offerinR price did not exceed $100,000. The action taken makes no change in the
Rules, and all the conditions upon which the exemption is based, including the $100,000
limitation,
remain unchanged.

DISCLOSURES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION
As in previous years, through its examination procedure the Commission secured
fair and accurate disclosure of material information required in registration statements and prevented the use in many of these documents of information which was Misleading and inaccurate.

STOP-oRDER POWER NOT USED DURING YEAR
For the first time in the 10-year history of the administration of the Securities
Act of 1933, during the entire fiscal year there occurred no instance wherein the sale
of securities was prohibited by the Commission through the issuance of a stop or refusal order.

of the offering.

to show

314 sets of so-called l3-months prospectuses were filed pursuant to Section 10 (b)
(1) of the Act.
Thus during the past fiscal year there were filed in the aggregate 545 additional prospectuses of these 3 classes.
At the sametime, 113 supplementary statements of actual offering price were filed
as required by Rule 970; and there were 20 instances where registrants voluntarily
filed supplemental financial data.
SECURITIES
EFFECTIVELY
REGISTERED
During the fiscal year ended June 30, J.943, 123 statements covering 189 issues of
securities of an aggregate value of $659,480,000were effectively registered under the
Securities Act of 1933. Registrations were heaviest toward the end of the period, nth
the final six months accounting for about 68 percent of the mnn.berof issues and 72
percent of the value. Those registered for sale for accounts of the issuers (primary
distributions) amountedto $485,928,000, of 1Ihich 3.8 percent was to be paid for cost
of flotati on. The major element in reported cost of flotation was compensation to distributors, amountingto 3.2 percent of gross proceeds. other expenses amountedto only
0.6 percent.
A breakdownof the major componentof compensation to distributors and a comparison
nth preceding years for comparable categories of securities indicates that there has
been a gradual diJninution in this major item of cost.

Although the rate of compensationrose in 1943 for the aggregate of bonds registered for

The net proceeds accruing to the issuers after payment of cost of notation aggregated $467,609,000. The principal applications of these net proceeds were planned as
follows: 61 percent for the retirement of indebtedness and preferred stock; 2.3percent
for purchase of securities for investment and affiliation,.
mostly the former; 9 percent
for increase of working capital; and 5 percent for expansion of plant and equipment.

Registrations by-financial and investment companies amountedto $117,072,000 or 24 percent of the total.
This
was the highest proportion accounted,for by this group in ~ fiscal year except one.
Manufacturing companies and transportation and communication companies accounted for unusually low proportions, 18 percent and 2 percent respectively.

Detailed statistics on securities effectively registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 are given in Appendix -'fables1 and 2 and on all new issues offered for cash
sale in the United States (including those exempt from registration) in Appendix Tables
3 and 4.
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Commission's statutory power to exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933 security issues up to and including $100,000, and its procedures and rules established thereunder, were described in its Seventh Annual Report,
pages 175-179. In connection with such exempt issues, there were filed with the Commission during the past fiscal year a total of 353 Letters of Notification, pursuant to
Regulation A, and 74 amendments thereto, representing an aggregate offering price of
$17,986,987. That part of these offerings which related to oil and gas leases and securities of companies engaged in various phases of the oil and gas business accounted
for 54 of these Letters of Notification with an aggregate offering price of $1,062,724.
At the same time there were received and examined 532 Offering Sheets, pursuant to
Regulation B, and 504 amendments to such Offering Sheets, relating to fractional undivided interests in oil and gas rights with an aggregate offering price of
$12,B66,457.72. The following table indicates the action taken with respect to these
Offering Sheets:

amounts of 3,627 on Form I-G and 1,361 on Form 2-G.
INVESTIGATION OF OIL AND GAS SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS
During the year investigations were conducted with respect to a total of 187 oil
and gas properties or proposed securities offerings. Where these investigations show
evidence of a violation of the criminal provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the
results are transmitted by the Commission to the Department of Justice, and criminal
proceedings are instituted in the discretion of the Attorney General of the United
States. In the event such proceedings are instituted, the Commission's attorneys and
engineers Who participated in the investigation leading up to the proceedings assist
the United States attorneys in the preparation of the cases for pres\::ntationto the
grand jury and for trial.

The Commissionduring the past fiscal year brought a IlUJIlberof actions, either to
enjoin violations of the registration
or fiaud provisions of the Se-curitiee Act of 1933
or to enforce compliance with subpoenas, where attempts were made to camoufiage the real
nature of the transactions
by making it appear that the subject matter of the sale was
real or personal property and hence not a security SUbject to the Act.

for the registration
of securities on exchanges and the Commission'sprocedure in examining applications and reports for compliancewith the requirements of Sections 12 and
13 of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934. It maybe noted that those provisions in
general seek to make available to the public information regarding the condition of companies whose securities are traded on any national securities exchange and to keep such
information up-to-date.

AND FORMS FOR REGISTRATION

OF SECURITIES

ON EXCHANGES

Revisions of ~

~.-When
the Commissionannouncedon December18, 1942, a
comprehensivestmplification of registration and reporting requirements under various
Acts 'administered by it, which is discussed above, it also announceda revision of
certain of its rules applicable to all solicitations of proxies, pursuant to Regulation X-14, after January 15, 1943. The principal changes are S1.ttIlIIlarized
below:
1. More extensive information must be given on the compensationand dealings of
corporate managers, as well as a brief statement of the principal occupation
of all directors and a resume of the business experience of new candidates.
2.

Regular annual reports to stockholders must accumpanyor precede proxy statements. These annual reports to stockholders are not considered part of the
proxy material and need not be officially filed with the Commission.

3.

Stockholders making proposals for action which are opposedby managementmust
be given not more than 100 words in the proxy in which to state their position,
provided the security holder gives the managementreasonable notice of his
intention.

4.

The exemption previously granted corporations making proxy solicitations
out use of the mails or interstate commercewas abolished.

5.

An exemption from the rules was provided for certain types of solicitations

with-

through newspaper advertisements.
The additional information required about managementincludes a list of all directors and officers, except officers (not directors) receiving less than $20,000 a year,
together with a statement of the amountsreceived in cash as well as under pension or
option plans.
Information must also be given under the revised rules showingall loans
to of'ficers and directors not madein the ordinary course of business, together with a
brief description of all material transactions of officers and directors and their associates with the companyor its subsidiaries.
The Commissionhad previously authorized its staff to circulate the proposed revisions to its proxy rules for commentsand suggestions. The revisions madeby the Commission take into consideration the commentsthus received. On the other hand, a number
of the suggestions proposed by the staff were not adopted. Theywere: (1) that information of the type submitted in an annual report to stockholders including financial
statements be -included in the pr~
statement; (2) that minority stockholders be given
an opportunity to use the management'sproxy material in support of their own nominees
for directorships;
(3) that persons soliciting proxies be denied the right to obtain
discretionary authority where security holders have not markedballots-while
this propos~ was not adopted, a requirement of a clearer statement concerning the solicitation

of discptionary authority was included in the new rules; and (4) that compensation of 

officers who are not directors and who receive $20,000 or less be reported. 


The Coumission subsequently made public exerpts from letters of the Director of the 

Corporation Finance Division to officprs of corporations who had asked for interpreta- 

tions of certain provisions of the amended proxy rules. These interpretations are 

available in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 3385, February 17, 1943. 


The amendments of the Commission's proxy rules caused considerable discussion. 

Bills were introduced by lkpresentatives Wolverton and Boren designed to reinstate the 

rules as they had existed before the revision. Hearings on these bills were c~menced 

in June of 1943 before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. The 

hearings are presently in adjournment. 

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS 

The Commission's Regulation X-14, adopted pursuant to the provisions of three of 

requires that certain information be made available 

the statutes administered by it,
by companies to their security
whose proxies, consents, or authorizations are 

solicited. 

During the year the Ccmmission received and examined both the preliminary and de- 

finitive material thus required with respect to 1,427 such solicitations. In addition, 

307 items of amendatov or supplemental soliciting material were received and examined. 

The Commission also continued its practice of furnishing every assistance to persons 

who desired to obtain in advance of the filing date informal opinions or suggestions as 

to the preparation of required material. 


Rule requiring report upon settlement -of nar contract renegotiations.-Rule X-13A-6,
which remires the f i l w of a current re~orton ~-on
the occurrence of suecified
events, ;as amended in relation to companies having war cbntracts subject to renegotiation proceedings under Section 403 of the Sixth Supplemental National Defense Appropriation Act, as amended, so as to require a report upon the settlenent of any such proceedings. No report is required, however, if effect was given to the settlement in the
most recerrtly filed financial statements or if financial statements for the period
covered by the settlement have not been filed. In the latter case, it is assumed, of
course, that effect will be given to the settlement when financial statements for the
period are filed.
Tfie financial instructions for a number of the annual report forms m r e amended 

where necessary to clarify the applicability of Regulation S-X thereto; and Rule 

X-3A12-1, no longer harlng practical application to the situation it was designed to 

relieve, was repealed. 

STATISTICS OF SECURITIES REGISTERED ON EXCHANGES 

Up to and including June 30, 1943, 2,965 issuers had filed a total of 5,651 appli- 

cations for registration of securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act 

of 1934 and a total of 33,122 annual and current reports under Section 13 of the Act. 

As of June 30, 1943, the registration of the securities of 2,244 of the issuers was in 

effect, and the registration of the securities of the remining 721issuers had ceased 

to be effeotive.

More detailed statistics of securities registered on exchanges are contained in
Appendix Tables 7-13, inclusive.
TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION UNDER SECTION 19 (a) (2)
There were pending at the beginning of the year 3 proceedings instituted under
Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which empowers the Commission,
after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, to deny, to suspend the effective
date of, to suspend for a period of not exceeding l~ months, or to withdraw, the registration of a security, if it finds that the issuer has failed to ccmply with any provision of th~ Act or the rules and regulations thereunder; and 16 proceedings were instituted during the year. The Commission ordered the secuxities of 11 of these issuers
withdrawn and the proceedings with respect to securities of two issuers dismissed; and
sU: proceedings were pending at the close of the year.
The withdrawal of registration was ordered in 10 of these cases because of the comp~IS
failure to file the annual report required under the Act, and, in one case, involving Class "A" stock of Associated Gas and Electric Camp"any,y because of "false and
misleading" statements found by the Commission in the application for registration and
certain annual reports filed by the company. With that exception and one other involving a medium-sized brewery concern, the companies whose securities were thU1'withdrawn
from registration were small organizations consisting for the most part of inactive
mining companies.
WITHDRAWAL OR STRIKING OF SECURITIES FROM LISTING AND
REGISTRATION ON NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES
During the year ended June 30, 1943 there were filed with the Commission under Section 12 (d), by issuers or exchanges, applications -tor the withdrawal or striking of 56
issues from listing and registration on national securities exchanges. At the beginning
of the year applications for the removal of 10 issues were pending. During the year the
Commission granted applications involving 41 issues, dismissed without prejudice an applicat-10n involving 1 issue, and permitted an application involving 1 issue to be withdrawn. Applications for the removal of.23 issues were pending as of June 30; 1943.
During the year the Commission received from national securities exchanges certifications of removal involving 105 issues stricken from listing and registration because
of payment, redemption, or retirement.

AMENDMENT OF RULE X-12D2-2 (a)
Rule X-12D2-2 (a) was amended during the year to permit an exchange to remove, by
certification> without the necessity of application and hearing, the entire class of a
registered security when the instruments representing the security come to evidence
other securities, as for example in an exchange or substitution resulting from a stock
split-up, recapitalization, or merger.

-12UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES

ON NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES

On June 30, 1943, 1,560 stock and 217 bond issues had unlisted trading privileges
on the registered exchanges, counting each issue once ir it enjoyed the privilege on
one such exchange, twice if on two such exchanges, etc. The distribution of this count
among exchanges is shown under Column U of Appendix Table 13.
These totals included 1,295 stock and 186 bond issues under Clause (1), 260 stock
issues and 1 bond issue under Clause (2), and 5 stock and 30 bond issues under Clause
(3), of Section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The distribution of
this count of issues under Clauses (2) and () among exchanges is shown in Appendix
Table 14.

y

The total under Clause (1) shows a reduction of 46 stock and 6 bond issues since
June )0, 1942, and a reduction of 379 stock and 406 bond issues (including 100 stock
and 199 bond issues formerly on the New York Real Estate Exchange) since June 30, 1937,
following upon the substantial reduction prior to that date discussed on pages 17-18 of
the Third Annual Report of the Commission.
This reduction is in line with original
as to this type of issue on exchanges.
expectations

y

Counting each issue but once, regardless of the number of registered exchanges
upon which it has unlisted trading privileges, the total is 1,027 stock and 217 bond
issues, as shown in Appendix Table 10. In particular, the exclusion of this duplication among exchanges reduces the count of 260 stock issues under Clause (2) to 155, the
latter figure being the precise number of issues currently "admitted to unlisted trading
under that Clause. Many of the net 160 stock and 31 bond issues admitted to unlisted
trading privileges under Clauses (2) and (3) are of companies whose issues, or whose
predecessors' issues, were admitted to trading upon the applicant exchanges in the past.
Many of the issues under Clause (1) and all of those under Clause (2), are listed
and registered on some registered exchange other than that upon which they enjoy unlisted trading privileges.
Exclusion of such listed issues leaves a residue of issues
which have only an unlisted exchange status. This residue includes 474 stock and 163
bond issues under Clause (1), and 5 stock (all preferred stocks) and 30 bond issues
under Clause (3), representing a total of 479 stock and 193 bond issues, as shown in
Columns (2) and (4) of Appendix Table 10. This total shows a reduction of 258 stock
and 357 bond issues since June 30, 1937.
An application by the Chicago Rivet and Machine Company for the termination of unlisted trading privileges in its Cammon Stock, $4 Par Value, on the New York Curb Exchange 2/ was denied by the Commission during the past fiscal year
The Exchange,

y.

1/ Clause (1) covers continuance

of privileges enjoyed prior to March 1, 1934; Clause
(2) covers extension of the privileges to issues listed on some other registered exchange; Clause (3) covers extension of the privileges to issues in respect of which
there is available from a registration statement and periodic reports filed pursuant
to the rules and regulations prescribed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 information substantially equivalent to that available
on listed issues.
In Clause (3) cases the statute requires the imposition of such
terms and conditions as will subject the issuer, its officers, directors, and principal stockholders to duties substantially equivalent to those which would arise if the
security were fully listed and registered, except where the public interest and the
protection of investors would nevertheless best be served by extension of the privileges.
In addition, under Clauses (2) and (J), certain conditions as to public distribution and public trading activity in the vicinity of the exchange must be
satisfied.

which permit unlisted trading were 56 and 4 respectively, on June 30, 1943. The stock
issues included 53 under Clause (1) and 3 under Clause (2) of Section 12 (f) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934.

SPECIAL
OFFERING
PLANS
On February 6, 1942;1the Commissionamendedits Rule X-IOB-2to permit special
offerings of blocks of stock on national securities exchanges where such offerings are
effected pursuant to a plan filed with and declared effective by the Commission,as related on page 9 of the Eighth Annual Report.

Pursuant to the amendment,three exchanges adopted special offering plana I the
NewYork Stock Exchange, the NewYork Curb Exchange, and the San Francisco Stock Exchange. Briefly, these plans are exchange rules permitting the specfal, offering of a
block of stock through the facill ties of the exchange and during the regular trading
session when the regular market on the floor is believed incapable of assuring absorption of the block within a reasonable period of time and within a reasonable range of
prices.
The offering is made at a fixed price which is set within the frameworkof the
existing auction market. Membersacting as brokers for public buyers are paid a special
commission by the seller which ordinarily exceeds the regular commission. Buyers obtain stock lfithout pa;ying any commission.
Special offerings on national seuuri ties exchanges numbered105 in the year ended
June 30, 1943. Of these, the NewYork Stock Exchangeaccounted for 93, with a total of
1,402,.612 shares offered and 1,376,418 shares sold, the latter having a market value of
$38,342,-000 and affording revenue to buyer-s" brokers which totaled $717,000. On the New
York Curb Exchangethere were 10 special offerings totaling 50,661 shares, while the
42,311 shares sold were valued at $693,000 and carried total commissions for buyers'
brokers of nearly $18,000. The San Francisco Stock Exchangehad two special offerings

The special offering plans of the three exchanges competeto somedegree with
secondary distributions of exchange stocks effected over the counter after the close of
the exchange session - so-called "twil.i..gh:t offerings n • Secondary distributions approved by the exchanges numbered101 in the year ended June 30, 1943. They covered
4,830,698 shares of stock with a value ~ 1129,370,000. Those appr-oved by the NewYork
Stock Exchangetotaled 39, with a total. ~ 2,480,236 shares valued at $61,<;95,000. New

$65,252,000. other exchanges approved.22, covering 122,684 shares valued at $2,123,000.
SPECIAL STUDIES

The Commission'sstaff continued ita study of the problems of the regional exchanges which it undertook in the preceding fiscal year, and continued its study of
characteristics
of over-the-counter markets in exchange stocks, both, however, on a
sCDe1lhatcurtailed basis owing to loss of BIIlchof the personnel originally engaged in
'this ...ork.

PEGGING, FIXING,

AND STABILIZING

OF SECURITIES PRICES

Dllring the fiscal year ended June 30, 1943, the COIIIIIlission
continued the administration of (a) Rule X-17A-2,which requires the filing of detailed reports of all transactions incident to offerings in respect of which a registration statement has been
.tiled under the Securities Act of 1933where any stabilizing operation is underlaken to
.tacilitate the offering; and (b) Regulation X-<)A6-1,governing stabilizing transactions
tn. securities registered on national securities exchanges effected to facilitate
offerings of securities so registered in which the offering prices are represented to be "at
the JDarket"or at prices related to market prices.

Out of a total of 150 registration statements filed under the Securities Act of
1933 durirJi the past fiscal year, 69 contained a statement of intention to stabilize to
facilitate
the offerings covered by such registration statements. Because of the fact
that a registration statement in somecases covers more than one offering, there were a
total. of 77 offerings of secur1ties in respect of which the statement required by Rule
82!7 of the Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act of 1933 was madeto the effect
that a stabilizing operation was intended to be undertaken. Stabilizing operations were
~

conducted to facilitate
42 of these offerings.
In the case of bonds, public
o.tferings of $142,750,000 principal amountwere stabilized.
Offerings of stock issues
aggregating 2,658,344 shares and having an aggregate estimated public offering price of
167,703,875 were also stabilized.
Of the 42 stabilizing operations commenced
during the
past fiscal year, 35 had been completed and notices of termination of stabilization
filed nth. the Commissionand the remaining 7 were still in progress as of the close of
the fiscal year.
Also during the past. fiscal year, 7 notices of intention to st.abilize were filed
with. the Commissionon FormX-9A6-1pursuant. to the provisions of Rule X-9A6-3. The
offerings described in these notices, to ,facilitate'which stabilizing operations were
cODducted,involved stock issues aggregating 1,873,309 shares having an aggregate
initial public offering price of $25,826,310.
EXCHANGES REGISTERED AND EXEMPTED FROM REGISTRATION
During the past fiscal year there was no change in the number (19) of exchanges
registered with the Commissionas national securities exchanges. The Seattle Stock
EXchangesuspended operations as of October 1, 1942, for an indefinite period, or until
the membersshould feel that the fa~ilities'of
said exchangewould again be needed; this
reduced the numberof active exemptedexchanges to five.

held that the firm's sales of securities to certain customers at prices bearing no

respect to the market prices, were fraudulent under 17 (a) of' the Securities Act and
Section 15 (c) (1) of' the Securities Exchange Act, and ordered that its registration

-

- 19 business as Lawrence R. Leehy & Co.!/
Leeby had engaged in the practice of selling
oil royalties to customers at prices as high as 150% over his concurrent cost. The two
principal customers were women who were not well versed in investment matters and who
depended exclusively upon Leeby's advice in all their securities transactions and relied
upon him to act in their best interests at all times.
This is the first proceeding involving pricing practices in oil royalties.
While
the Commission's order revoking registration was based on the finding that Leeby, in his
transactions with two women customers, was charged with the high fiduciary duties of an
agent and that he violated these obligations repeatedly in taking secret profits at the
expense of these customers and in acting in his own interest which was clearly in conflict with theirs, the Commission also determined that the duty of fair dealing rests
on a dealer in oil royalties as it does on dealers in the more conventional types of securities.
In long series of cases the Commission has held that a dealer in securities
impliedly represents that he will treat all customers fairly, that he will not exploit
their inexperience in securities matters or their reliance upon his integrity and that
the price at which he sells a security to a customer is a fair one in, relation to the
prevailing market.
A finding that any such representation is false is a finding of
fraud. Since with respect to oil ra,ralties there is no market such as exists for corporate securities, it was necessary to resort to other tests to determine the fairness
of retail prices charged for oil royalties and the Commission toncluded, with certain
reservations, that "the least required of a dealer by the standards of fair dealing is
that, unless special circumstances appear, he must charge a price bearing a fair relationship to the current wholesale price". The Commission held that in charging retail
prices having no fair relation to the curr-ent wholesale prices, without disclosing the
magnitude
of his mark-ups, Leeby omitted to disclose material facts necessary to make
his general representation as a dealer not misleading and that his conduct operated as
a fraud on his customers.
The proceeding is also noteworthy because of related action by the Commission
eliminating the disclosure of the maximum offering price from the offering sheets required under Regulation B. 2/ It was Leehy's practice to charge the maxilIlum offering
price in sales to customers,;"his defense being that this was the common practice among
oil royalty dealers.
He dealt with his customers as though the maxinnnn offering price
were an established price to the public. Such practice is obviously in disregard of
the purpose of the maximum offering price, for its sole intended function is to determine whether the offering price of the entire issue is wi thin the $100,000 exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. In order, therefore, to
prevent misuse of the maximum offering price in the future, the Commission amended Rule
330 of Regulation B, striking the statement of the maximum offering price from the disclosures required.

In the Matter

of W. K. Archer and Co.

After extended hearings In the Matter of W. K. Archer and Co., the Commission on
June 13, 1942 issued its findings and opinion and ordered revocation of the registration of this firm. The Commission held that certain of the firm IS activities were
fraudulent under Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act and Section 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act, and that it had also violated Sections 7 (c) (2) and 15 (b) of
the Securities Exchange Act. On petition for review the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals, Eighth Circuit, on FebruaI"J 15, 1943, sustained the Commission's findings and

 20In the Matter of Guaranty Underwriters,

Inc.

On August 7, 1942, the Commissionordered that proceedings be held on the qllestion
of revocation of the broker-dealer registration
of Gaaranty Underwriters, Ina. and on
the question of suspension and expulsion of this fina from.maDlbershipin the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Ino. HeariDgs were cODIIlenced
on August 20, 1942, and
on the following day the comp~ purported to withdraw its registration
aDd consented to
revocation of its registration.
The Commissiontook the consent under advisement and
1llovedto proceed with the hearing.
The COIIlp~ then made several. attempts by court action to stop the hearing.

Y

1. The first
action, before Judge Waller of the tJn1ted States District Court for
the Southern District of Florida, sought to enjoin Edward C. Jolms~; the ee-d.ssion1s
trial examiner from holding further heariDgs lUlder the C~ssion'
s order.
The action
was dismissed on the ground that the Circuit Court of Appeals had exclusive ju:ri.sdiction
to review orders of the Commission. 2/ The eClDp8.DY" appealed to the Circuit Court of
Appeals, Fifth Circuit, but later withdrew the appeal after stay of the hearing pending
appeal had been denied both by Judge Waller and by one of the Circuit Court judges.
2. On the day the Commission's hearing was to be reSlPiledthe ccmlp8!lT,without
notice to the Camn1ssionor the trial examiner, obtained an ex
order i'I'cB Judge
McNeill of the Circuit Court of the Fourth Judicial Circuit Of
e tate o£ Florida
which purported to restrain the examiner and the individual COJIIIId.ssioners
of the Securities and Exchange Commissionfrom proceeding nth the hearing.
The CCBd.8sion then
brought suit, before Judge Waller of the United States District Court, to eDjoin the
enforcement of Judge McNeill's order; this was dismissed on the ground that section 265
of the Judicial Code prohibits federal courts ftoca enjoining state court proceedings.
However, a writ of prohibition was obtained in the Sa:pI8Il8Court of Flonda against
Judge McNeill on the ground that he was without jurisdiction.

3. The companythen petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, to

This action was dismissed
on the ground that the Commissionhad not yet issued a reviewable order.

4. The next action was before Judge Akerman, United states District Court for the
Southern District of Florida, from whomthe companyobtained, without netdce to the CODlmission or the examiner, a second exJarte

RULE X-17A-5
Daring t;he SUJIIIler
of 1942, at t;he request; of representatives
of the industry, the
Commissionundertook to assist in formulating a form of uniform f"inancial statement to
be used by all brokers engaged in the securities industry for reporting their financial
condition to regulator,y bodies such as the Commission,the various state securities
commissions, national securities exchanges, and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. The demand:Corsuch a uniform statement camefrom the industry because
regulator,y bodies used different forms and different approaches for the purpose of
obtaining financial. inf'ormation concerning brokers and dealers comingunder their jurisdiction.
It was the consensus of everyonewho worked on the subject that the most
feasible way to get a unif'01'IIl statement would be for the COIIIIIlission
to promulgate a rule
and adopt a form lIhich others might -a'Lso adopt. The Commission'srepresentatives engaged in extended conferences lIith representatives of the various state securities commissioners, the Rational Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the national securities
exchanges and the Investment Bankers ASBociation, and succeeded in clearing a form of
financial report which was satisfactory to these agencies and organizations.

In November,1942, the Camnission announcedthe adoption of Rule X-17A-5pursuant
to which registered brokers and dealers, membersof national securities exchanges and
brokers and dealers -.ho transact a business through the mediumof a memberare required
to file each year, beginning in 1943, a report of financial condition. About 1,000 reports were filed fran January 1. to June 30, 1943.
RULE
X-15C3-1
On October 29, 1.942, in announcing its dedsion not to approve the proposal of the
National Association of"Securities Dealers for an amendmentto its by-laws which would
have established certain m:1n:i.DmJR net capital requirements for membersof that aSBociation, the Commissionannounced the adoption of its cnmrule, X-15C3--1,requiring every
registered broker and dealer to maintain net capital of not less than 5%of its aggregate indebtedness. However, the e:Cfective date of this rule was deferred pending the
adoption of appropriate definitions of net capital and aggregate indebtedness.

JJ

In November1.942, the CCJIIIlission'sstaff drafted propt>seddefinitions of aggregate indebtedness and net capital. which, in accordance with established policy, were
submitted to the stock exchanges, state regulatory bodies, accounting societies and
membersof the industry for their camnent. Following commentsreceived from these
various groups, it was decided that no definitive action should be taken until the subject had been studied in the light of the financial statements filed pursuant to Rule
X-17A-5.

NATIONAL
SECURITIES
ASSOCIATIONS
The National, Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)continued, during the
year under review, as the only national securities association registered as such with
the Canmission under the Maloney Act. Membershipdeclined from approximately 2,593 on
June 30, 1942 to approximately 2,227 on June 30, 1943.
ENFORCEMENT
ANDDISCIPLINARY
ACTIVITIES
During 1943 the NASDexamined the business practices of its entire membership by a
uniform questionnaire system. Each memberwas required to submit, at a date chosen by
the Association, a transcript
of fifty consecutive retail sales to customers, certain
types of transactions and transactions in certain types of securities
being specifically
excluded. The returns were used for research purposes and were also individually considered by the appropriate District Business Conduct Camnittee to detennlne whether they
supplied any basis for disciplinary
action agadnsf the unidentified member.'
The installation
of this new method of inspection resulted in a temporary lag in the Associaticn's enforcement program. Nevertheless, in the year endedjJune 30, 1943,
:!Uty-three fO!"lJlalcomplaints against memberswere disposed of. These arspositions included sixteen expulsions, five suspensions, sixteen fines, various lesser penalties.,
and six withdrawals and eight dismissals of complaints.
Included in these disciplinary
actions were nine complaints which had their origin in facts disclQ:Jed in the course of
broker-dealer inspections by the Commission's staff, lfhich facts bad been referred to
the Association for appropriate action.
Fifteen of the fifty-three
cases had been
passed on by the National Business Conduct Connnittee of the Board of Governors acting
as an appellate body.

After disciplinary
decisions by the NASDagainst some seventy

for alleged violations of the resale price maintenance provisions embodied in
the syndicate agreement, the CCIIUIlission
on its own motion called certain of these cases
for review. y
The Gamnission had under advisement as of J1Dle30, 1943 the record of a private
hearing in the first case of its kind, that of a memberwho had appealed to the CoIImis-'
sion for review of an adverse disciplinary decision by the NASD. Another such appeal
was pending before the COIID1lission
on June 30, 1943 but was subsequently withdrawn, without being perfected.
AMENDMENTS TO RULES

Substantial revision of 'existing By-Laws, Rules of Fair Practice and Code of Procedure became effective August 21, 1942, after the membership had voted approval and the
Commissionhad not disapproved.
These amendments, with one exeption, were non-cOntroversial in substance, and made changes for simplicity or to cla.ri..f'y ambiguities.
One
such proposal, however, which also had membership approval, lrOUldhave established-as
a
cond1.tion to membership a mini.!num capital requirement of $5,000 for finns handling
customers' funds or securities

it admitted that when it had been presented for informal consideration no objection
had been raised by the Commissionor its staff.
The COlIIIIlission
at the same time

The Association also made a substantial revision in the method used to compute
dues and assessments.
In lieu of a classification

a three-factor method wa.s substituted.
All firms, regardless of size or activity,
were assessed a basic lllembershipfee of $.30plus $.3 for each full time employee. In
addition, ~derwriters
were assessed .01%of underwriting participations
in excess of
$100,000. A maximum fee of $5,000 per memberremained effective as did a fee of $10

PART III
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

INTEGRATION AND CORPORATE SIMPLIFICATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS
New and significant advances were made, during the past fiscal year, in the enforcement of the integration and corporate simplificaticn provisions of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act (Sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) respectively). The pattern of
enforcement has now reached the stage where the cO'"Jletion of the task of conforming the
various public utility holding company systems to he standards of Section 11 is in
sight. An encouraging development has been the a1-~arent recognition by holding company
executives of the practical business advantages of compliance with the Act and the increasing cooperation that has developed in the formulation and filing of plans for
carrying out the requirements of the Act.
In the year enc' id June 30, 1943, the Commission instituted eight additional Section 11 (b) (1) and 19 Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings and at the close of the year 80
such proceedings were pending, 29 under Section 11 (b) (1) and 51 under Section 11 (b)
(2). These 80 proceedings involve practically all of the 52 public utility holding
company systems registered under the Act, although they do not necessarily cover all of
the Section 11 problems existing in such systems. Hearings have been completed in 21
of the pending Section 11 (b) (1) cases and in 35 pending Section 11 (b) (2) cases.
The records in nearly all of the remaining cases are approaching completion. As of
November 1, 1943, final orders have been entered covering all or a major part of the
issues involved in 21 Section 11 (b) (1) cases and in 26 Section 11 (b) (2) cases.
In steadily increasing numbers, the holding companies are filing applications and
plans under Section 11 (e) and other appropriate sections of the Act to comply with
Section 11 (b) and a large number of appli~ations and plans for complete or partial
compliance with Section 11 have been or are being consummated. The consummation of each
such case is usually the culmination of many months of detailed analysis and .fact-finding, generally involving complex issues. The momentum of bringing these proceedings to
a successfUl conclusion will increase at an accelerated rate because both the industr,y
and the Commission are now in a position to realize upon the time and effort already
expended.
The filing, approval and consummation of these plans are major achievements in the
financial and structural reorganization of the American utility industr,y. In th~ years
to come, a financially sound utility industry will be a source of strength and a stabilizing influence for the whole econo~.
While there has been a steady improvement in
the financial condition of a substantial part of the operating utility industry since
enactment of the statute, a great many companies continue to be handicapped either by
their own corporate structures or by the existence above them of uneconomic and unwieldy
superstructures. The Commission has progressed so far in the task of unraveling burdensome complexities in holding company systems that there is a reasonable prospect of substantially completing the task in the near future. The experience of the Commission
shows that the problem of undoing the speculative excesses of the 1920's can be solved
only by constructive and forward-looking action. Steps already taken and yet to be undertaken to achieve corporate simplification and integration will result in a healthy
utili ty industry, will protect investors, and will encourage the flow of new money into
the industry, thus strengthening this important segment of our national economy.
In considering the progress that has been made in the financial and corporate reorganization of holding company systems, it is helpful to recall the poor financial
condition of a large portion of the industry when the Commission commenced its duties
under the Act. From September 1, 1929 to April 15, 1936, 53 holding companies went into
receivership or bankruptcy. These companies had a funded debt of $600,000,000, unfunded
debt of $230,000,000 and preferred and common s.ocks of $860,000,000. An additional 23
holding companies were forced to default on interest or offer readjustment or extension

- 25 plans.
These companies had a total funded debt of $320,000,000, unfunded debt of
$15,000,000, and preferred and cOlIIIIlon
stocks of $200,000,000.
Thirty-six operating
public utility
companies (all of them Bubsidiaries of holding companies) went into
receivership or bankruptcy, with total funded debt of $220,000,000, unfunded debt of
$17,000,000, and preferred and commonstocks of $108,000,000.
In addition, 16
operating cOlllPaniesdefaulted on interest or-offered readjustment or extension plans;
these companies had debt of $120,000;000, and $32,000,000 of stocks.
Thus the holding and utility
companies 'Whosepoor financial condition had reached the breaking
point had approximately .2,750,0009000 of securities in the hands of the public.
As of December31, 1938, holding companies registered under the Holding Comparr,y
Act had outstanding $2,450,000,000 of preferred stocks.
Of this total, more than half,
or $1,400,000,000, 1Rl8 in arrears in dividends, the total accumulated arrearages being
some $363,000,000.
Even JII81'IiY utility
operating companies were so overcapitalized that
they could not meet their preferred dividends.
Of $1,750,000,000 of preferred stocks
of operating companies, approximately $500,000,000 were in default, the arrearages
aggregating $148,000,000.
Of course both the industry and the Commissa-on
have been
'Workingactively to correct this situation.
Substantial progress has been made in
cleaning up the problem of arrearages and unsound capital structures.
Not only have
many companies been reorganized under the procedures made possible only by Section 11,
but, as indicated above, the Commissionand the companies are n~'Win a position,
through the vast amount of 'Workthat has been done, to bring to a successful conclusion pending reorganization proceedings involving some of the lJOrst situations in the

industry.

Section 11 proceedings involving each of these major holding companysystems at the
close of the past fiscal year follows.

Electric Bond and Share is the largest system registered under the Holding Company
Act. The parent, Electric Bond and Share Company(Bondand Share), controls five major

American Gas and Electric Company(American Gas), American Power and Light Compal'liY"
(ADm1.canhElectric Power & Light Corporation (Electric),
and National Power & Light
Company(National).
On :M~ 9, 1940, the Commissioninstituted
Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings with regard to Bond and Share am certain of its subsidiaries.
Thelorder outlined a series
of complex issues to be resolved including the question of the necessity of continuing
the existence of one or more of the main Bub-holding companies. On August 23, 1941, the
Commissionfound that National served no useful function, that it served as the central
tier in a pyramid that enabled Bond and Share to control the National system with practically no investment, and that it violated Section 11 (b) (2) because it constituted an
undue and unnecessary complexity in the Bond and Share system. As a result, National
was ordered to dissolve. ~
 Considerable progress has been made in getting National's
affairs in shape for liquIdation.
As a preliminary step, cash on hand was used to retire all bonds. The next step lIaS to eliminate the preferred stock. The major part of

The Commissioninstitut~d a Section 11 (b) (2) proceeding directed to Penns,ylvania
Power &: Light Companyon July 25, 1941 2/ but agreed to hold it in abeyance after National's president testified
that the uttimate objectives sought by the Commission
could best be accomplished, after National had disposed of its various portfolio assets,
by a large contribution of cash from National to Penns,ylvania
On August 5, 1942
the Commission,acting under Section 11 (c), granted National an extension of one year
from August 22, 1942 for compliance with the order of dissolution but conditioned its
action upon National's filing plans for resolution of the voting power and accounting
problems of its subsidiaries.
National filed such plans which were later amended. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year the plan for Carolina Power & Light Company'

On August 22, 1942, Amerlcan and Electric were ordered dissolved. 6/ These two
companies appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit which
heard argument on the petitions on June 1, 1943.
The COJIIIJ1ission
instituted proceedings under Section 11 (b) (2) and various other
se-ctions of the Act directed to American and its subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (Florida), on July 10, 1941. Issues were raised as to the distribution
of voting
power amongthe security holders of Florida, the existence of large amounts of writeups in its accounts, and the validity and rank of the $22,000,000 of its debentures
held by American. On September 17, 1941 respondents fHea a refinancing plan, in part
to meet the allegations in the CommissionJsorder for hearing.
The matters were consolidated and hearings were held. After the end of the fiscal year the record was
closed and briefs and requested findings of fact were submitted. Prior to the final
determination of the matter by the Comission, however, .Americanand Florida submitted
amendmentsto theit' previous proposal.
The proposal as so amended, which provided for
substantial adjUstments to the accounts of Florida, the surrender by American to Florida
as a capital contribution of $17,000,000 of the debentures held by it and certain other
securities,
and the retirement of all publicly-held securities at their contract prices
from treasury cash and the proceeds of issuance of new securities,

The United Gas Improvement

Company

The Commission instituted proceedings with regard to The United Gas Improvement Compa~ (D.G.I.) and its cubsidiarie~, pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1), on Narch 4, 1940. !I
Pursuant to a request by U.G.I., the Commission issued, on January 18, 1941, a statement
of tentative conclusions as to the application of the provisions of Section 11 (b) (1)
to the holding company system of D.G.I. in which it stated tentatively that the system's
single integrated public utility system was composed of the electric properties of its
subsidiaries in the Pennsylvania-Delaware-Maryland
area. 2/ Divestiture orders were
issued on July 30,1941 and Uay 7, 1942 21 based upon this-interpretation.
U.G.I. appealed these orders to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
The Court sustained the orders in a unanimous decision on November 17, 1943.
After argument before the Court but before its decision, D.G.I. and its subsidiary,
Philadelphia Electric Company, filed applications under Section 11 (e) for the purpose
of enabling the U.G.I. holding company system to effect partial compliance with Section
11 (b). ~
The plan provided for the distribution to D.G.I.'s preferred and common
stockholders of $30,600,000 in cash and substantially all its stockholdings in Philadelphia Electric and Public Service Corporation of New Jersey, two subsidiaries with
combined assets of $1,200,000,000.
The plan was filed in December 1942, was approved
by the Cormnission March 18, 1943 5/, by the common stockholders April 19, 1943, and was
declared effective as of June 18,-1943.
By effecting the retirement in this manner of
its preferred stock, D.G.I. made possible the further distribution of investments or
cash to its common stockholders. ij
Immediately prior to the filing of the plan, the market price of U.G.I. common
stock was about $4 per share and, like many other holding company stocks, represented a
considerable discount from the interest of each holding company share in the market
value of the underlying investments.
The coromon stock rose to $6 per share immediately
after the filing of the plan, and just before the distribution of the securities to
stockholders on August 19, 1943, it sold at $9-7/8 per share. As noted, the plan provided for the transfer to stockholders of direct ownership in the two principal subsidiaries of U.G.I., eliminating the interposition of the holding company, with its
attendant complexity and large expense.

The Commission, on September 4, 1941, instituted a Section 11 (b) (1) proceeding
with regard to the Trustees of Associated Gas and Electric Corporation (Agecorp) who
controlled, directly or indirectly, 175 subsidiaries of which 68 were public utilities
as defined hy the Act.
The Trustees stated that their aim was to create out of the
system four groups of properties to be disposed of as units in the liquidation of
Agecorp.
One of these four groups of properties is located in Florida and Georgia,
while the other three are in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

11

On August 13, 1942, the Commission issued an order requiring the Trustees to divest
themselves of all interest in a long list of utility and non-utility companies, reserving for future consideration questions relating to the composition of the groups of
properties as single integrated systems, additional systems, and permissible non-utility

of NewYork under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act.
On June 4, 1943, Utilities
Employees Securities Compa.ny(Uesco), a subsidia.ry of
Ageco and Agecorp, entered into an agreement with the Trustees of .Agecoand Agecorp,
Gengas, Associated Utilities
Corporation, NewEngland Gas and Electric Association, and
Trustees under Pension Trust Agreementdated December14, 1937, as maended, .for the
voluntary liquidation_and dissolution of Uesco. Uesco was an investment cagpan;y, being
at the same time the largest single creditor of the estates of Ageco and Agecorp. It
had been organized by HowardC. Hopsonin 1931 as an investment meditml ror employees or
the companies in the Associated system. The investment of the employees was largely
through coerced salary deductions, and system operating, companies were al.so cmnpelled. "to
make contributions.
The plan filed under Section 11 (e) or the Act provided ror setting
up voluntary pension funds by the various system companies, paying or! employee and certain other security holders, and evolving a mechanismfor participation

The suit in the rederal court involved an
accounting for alleged profits received by Negea in, and resulting from, the transrer or
certain stock and indebtedness of Electric Associates, Inc. from Agecorp to Negea in

were consolidated with a Section 11 (e) plan by order dated July 14, 1942. 2/ The plan
involved, among other things, the sale by Columbia Oil & Gasoline Corporation (Columbia
Oil), a subsidiary of Columbia, of its interest in Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company
(Panhandle), the transfer of its five oil and gasoline subsidiaries to Columbia Gas and
the liquidation of Columbia Oil. The Commission in an order
and opinion
dated
October 2, 1942, approved the plan. On Harch 23, 1943, the United states Circuit Court
of Appeals, Third CirCUit, affirmed the Commission's order
and six days later the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered its order approving
the plan. 6/ Columbia's relationships with certain of its su~sidiaries had invoved it
in a long series of legal difficulties.
Among other results, consummation of Columbia's
plan had the effect of divorcing Panhandle from the Columbia system, a step which the
Commission had found to be necessar,y to effectuate the provisions of Section 11 (b)
(1), extricated some of the companies and other interested parties from problems which
they faced under the anti-trust laws and terminated a complex tangle of private

mission for further investigation
of certain alleged rights of action of IRES against

Under the standards of
Section 11, its liquidation was necessary and was ordered by the Commission.8/ The
companysubsequently filed a number of applications covering action necessary-to accomplish liquidation,

It will be noted that 223 electric, gas and non-utility subsidiary companies with
total assets of approximately $3,233,000,000 have been divested in this period. This
includes 92 electric utility companies with total assets of $2,749,000,000, 60 gas
utility companies with total assets of $342,000,000 and 71 non-utility companies with
total assets of $142,000,000. Most of the electric utility companies and substantially
all the gas and non-utility companies were divested for the purpose of, or with a view
to, meeting "the integration requirements of-Section 11.
Of the total number of these divested companies, 187 cQMP,anies,with total assets
of $1;879,000,000, are no longer subject to the Holding Company Act and 36 companies,
with total assets of $1,354,000,000, are still subject to the Act by reason of their
relationship to other registered holding companies.
In addition to the divestment of companies, as such, the tables show that 60 other
subsidiary companies have sold parts of their electric, gas and non-utility properties'
for a total consideration of $89,000,000. The greater part of these properties are no
longer subject to the Act.
Reference is made to Appendix Table 17 which lists the subsidiar,yutility and nonutility companies, the control of which must be divested by their respecti~e parents
under Section 11 (b) (1) orders outstanding as of November 15, 1943. By virtue of these
orders, 14 holding company systems must divest themselves of their control over 211 subsidiary companies having aggregate total assets of $3,368,000,000.
In a number of holding company systems, there are holding companies which are merely
pyramiding devices and perform no useful function. Many of these have already'been
ordered dissolved after appropriate Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings. Table IS in the
Appendix lists the holding companies which are subject to dissolution or liquidation
under Section 11 (b) (2) orders outstanding as of November 15, 1943. The tabulation includes 14 holding companies and shows that 10 of these companies have 159 utility or
non-utility subsidiaries with total assets of approximately $2,600,000,000.

-44There liaS a sharp increase over last year of the percentage of total financing
comprising securities issued in exchange for other securities and in connection with
reorganizations.
The percentages in question rose from 9.'$ to 35.4% and !"romo.~
to 22. S% , respectively.
A corresponding increase' occurred in the proportion of total.
financing represented by commonstock, the proportion in 1943 being 45.9% as contrasted
nth 10.5% in 1942. These increases are the direct result of refinanciDgfl ste-rtng rrca
Section 11 proceedings.
.
Continued progress was madeduring the past fiscal year in strengthening the fiDlincia1 structures of public utility
operating companies and their parent holdiDg cc:wpan1es.
The manner in which that has been accomplished in other years has been set forth in previous annual reports of the Commission(See, for example, the Seventh Annual. Report,
pages 90-98).
In passing on refinancing cases which camebefore it, the Commissiongave further
indication that it has not established a rigid formula for determining initial allowable
limits of senior securities for public utility
operating companies. The ea..tssion's
policy in this regard has heretofore been set forth in its opinion in the El Paso case
early in 1941, where it was specifically stated that financial problema "must, of
course, be considered in the light of the circumstances surrounding the particular
transaction and we make no attempt here to lay downa hard and fa~t rule. II
In those
cases in Whichit has not been feasible to limit senior securities initially
to confor..
to long-range conservative standards of finance, it has been the CommisSion'spoliCT
to require the inclusion of safeguards lWhichnll
result in the achievement of such 0bjectives over as short a period of time as possible.

!I

Speaking generally, the improvementin public utility
capital structures, .mtiODBd
above, has resulted from debt reduction, madeeither at the t:1me a refunding took place
or, lWherethat was impracticable, by provision for the retirement of debt through siDking fund or serial debt retirement programs, from the elimination of -.rite-ups~ 1'ra. increased provision for depreciation both as to current accruals and existing reserves,
from improved mortgage indenture provisions, from the el:iJrlnation in 1II&DiY' instances or
preferred stock dividend arrearagea, and from the inclusion in corporate char1iers of
improved protective provisions with respect to preferred stock. All this has been accompaniedby a substantial decrease in the burden of interest on :fUnded debt and preferred stock dividend. requirements.
Competitive Bidding
During the past fiscal year an additional $140,582,128 of securities were sold at
competitive bidding pursuant to Rule U-50, lIhich prescribes public invitation of seal.ed
bids in connection with the sale of securities by registered public utility' holding
companies and their subsidiaries.
This brings to $570,681,134 the total amouut thus
sold from May7, 1941, the date on which the rule became effective, to July 1, 1943.
The rule permits exemption from competitive bidding under specified or apprOpriate circumstances. A number of such exemptions have been granted since the rule was adopted.

These ,savings are
~n addf.tdon to those preV10usly reported.
Certain principles and standards as to holdang comp~,
set;ice ~ompany and operating company relationships were crystallized in
the ColumbJ.a EngJ.neerJ.ng COrporation case. The findings and opinion in this case
(Holding Company Act Release No. 4166) established the following principles:
(1)

No operating company should be charged or have allocated to it, directly or
through the redium of a service company or by any other arrangement, including treasurer's or agent1s account, split-check system
or other devices any
portion of the salaries or expenses of any person or p~rsons who are holding
company officers or employees, or Whose functions relate primarily to the
functions of supervision of the holding company system and review of the actities of operating companies, their officials and staffs.

(2)

A corollary to the above principle is that no holding company officer or
person or perscns whose functions relate primarily to the holding cOmpany
functions of supervision of the holding company system and review of the activities of operating companies, their officials and staffs, should receive any
compensation or reimbursement of expenses from any operating company directly
or through a service company or any other arrangement including treasurer1s
or agent1s account and split-check systems.

(3)

Each service company should confine itself to functions which the operating
subsidiaries cannot perform as efficiently and economically themselves.
These
services should be :imited to services of an Iloperating naturell as distingu~shed from managerial, executive, or policy-forming functions.

These principles are directed towards preventing costs attributable to holding company functions from being passed on to operating companies by any means or device.
Following the termination of the Columbia Engineering Corporation case, proceedings
were initiated w:1.h respect to Cities Service Company, its two pUblic utility subsidiary
holding C'''''''''::.r-.ies,
and four system mutual service companies. y' The respondents indicated that they would comply with the Columbia principles, and after the close of the
fiscal year they submitted proposals which the Commission approved. y The system's
revised servicing methods substantially reduced service charges to the system's utility
operating companies.
A similar result was achieved in the American Gas and Power Comand in the American Water Works and Electric Company system after appropany system
priate action by the COIIDJlission.

y

The case concerning American Water Works and Electric Company, et al, was initiated
at the request of the New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners.
The holding company and two of its subsidiary service companies had been rendering services for a
charge to system water operating companies.
At the joint hearing held in Newark, New
Jersey, respondents proposed a comprehensive reorganization of their system servicing
arrangements to meet the issues raised by the New Jersey Board and the Commission. 21

In August 1940 the Public Service Commission
of the State of Vermont requested a similar investigation of the central servicing
arrangements in the New England Power Association system resulting in a complete reorganization of the system1s central servic~ng arrangements, with substantial savings
to the Vermont operating companies and other system operating companies.

-46This proposed plan was reviewed at subsequent hearings at 'Whichthe Conn~cticut and
Pennsylvania state utility
commissions were also represented.
As a result of this
cooperative proceeding, substantial annual savi~

of the '38rvicing activities
for foreign subsidiaries in the Electric Bond &nd Share
Comp~ system (Holding OompanyAct Re1ttase No. 4070) and the abandomnent of system
service arrangements in the Associated Gas and Electric Companysystem. With respect
to the latter,
the technical staff of the system service companyformed an independent

"the companies in the Associated ~tem will be on a competitive basis with other independent service companies. The remaining case involved a complete reorganization of

PARTICIPATION

OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS

UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
SUMMARY
OFACTIVITIES
The Commissionacti~ly
participated during the fiscal year in 139 reorganization
proceedings involving the reorganization of 168 companies (139 principal debtor corporations and 29 subsidiary debtors). 1/ The aggregate stated assets of these 168 companies
totalled $2,046,442,000, and their-aggregate indebtedness was $1,319,058,000. For the
first time the cases closed exceeded the new cases in which the Commissionfiled a notice of appearance, there baving been 29 cases closed and 16 new cases in which the Commission filed a not~ce of appearance.
As of JUne 30, 1943 the Commissionw~s actively engagE~qHin
Jft6'I~organization proceedings involving the reorganization of 129 companies (~rincipal
debtor corporations and 19 subsidiary debtors).
The aggregate
stated assets of these 129 companiestotalled $1,745,156,000, and their aggregate indebtedness was $1,103,698,000. AppendixTable No. 17 classifies these debtors, together
with their assets and indebtedness, according to their respective industries, while
AppendixTable No. IS classifies them according to the size of their total indebtedness.

V

With respect to the 16 new cases in 1thich the COIIIIIlission
participated during the
year, its notice of appearance was filed at the request of the judge in two proceedings,
wh11e in the remaining 14 cases the Commissionentered its appearance upon the approval
by the judge of the CCIIIIIIli.ssion's
motion to participate.
Of these 16 newproceedings,
14 were inat itued under Chapter X and two under section 77B. The debtors involved in
these 16 proceedings had aggregate stated assets and aggregate indebtedness of apprOXimately $93,777,000 and $'70,693,000, respectively.
THE CCllMISSION

AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

There-have been no significant changes in the past fiscal year in the policies or
practices of the Commissionin perfonning its functions under Chapter X. Five years of
experience by the Conunission,the Federal courts and attorneys with the operation of
Chapter X have produced a substantial numberof precedents on nearly all important procedural and interpretive questions.
Fromthis store of experience through participation
in ma.Dy" cases, the CODIIlission
has continued to afford substantial aid to parties, referees, special masters., and jUdges whofrequently call upon the Commissionfor advice
In this manner, the Commissionhas encouraged the development of uniand suggestions.
formity in the interpretation
of Chapter X and in the procedure thereunder. This work
has also been of value in saving the court officers and parties to the proceeding much
of the tUne, effort and expense that would be entailed in handling such questions ~

~.
In addition, the Commissionhas continued, primarily through the method of informal suggestion and conference, to call to the attention of parties to the proceeding
8Dy'violations or lack of caupliance nth the procedural provisions of Chapter X,thereby avoiding teclmical and delaying objections at a later date.
It is, however, particularly with respect to substantive matters that the Conunission has concentrated its efforts thrau.ghout the year. It has given increasing attention 81Il0Dg other things to proposed corporate charters, by-laws, trust i1l.dentures, and
similar instrmnents so that the rights of investors will be clearly defined and appropriately protected after the reorganization proceedings are consummated,
Here, too, the

contains a complete list of reorganization proceedings in which the
COIlI11lission
participated as a party during the year ended June 30, 1943.

~
 U~der Section 265a of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended,the Commissionrec€ives copies
of every petition for reorganization filed under Chapter X and copies of other
specified documents filed in the proceedings.

and, where these methods have proved inadequate, the questions requiring revision have
been brought to the attention of the court. At the same time the CoImrrl.ssion
has continued its efforts to assist the parties and the courts ~
 achieviDg equitable, financially sound, expeditiou.s and econanic readjustments by f'ilrnisb1ng detailed studies of
econanic factors affecting the debtor and competitive conditions arf"ectmg its particular

PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

UNDER CHAPTER X

The Act requires as a condition to confirmation of a plan of reorganization that
the judge be satisfied that the plan is fair, eqllitable and feasible-. The CO!1B1m1a&tlan
of a plan which meets these requirements is the main objective of arsy reorgani.zation proceeding. It may be recalled that the C<IIIIIlission'
s primary function under Chapter X 16
to aid, the court in securing this objective.
In regard to appraisals of the fairness of plans, certain basic legal princip1.es
consistently urged by the CommissionUDderChapter X are now firmly established as a result of the SupIemeCourt decisions in the Los Angeles Lumber
and the Consolidated
Rock Products
cases. These principles require that a plan provide f'ul1 cClllpensatory
treatment for c1a1m.sand interests of creditors and stockholders according to their
legal and contractual Priority either in cash or new securities or both.

y

y

,
r

.

The requirement of feasibility
relates to the economic soundness or workability of
the proposed financial structure.
For that reason, in evaluating the feasibility
of a
plan, the COIIIDlission
has been particularly concerned with the adequacy of working capital, the relationship
of funded debt or capital structure to property values, the ~
quacy of corporate earning power in relation to interest and dividend charges, and the
effect of the proposed new capitalization upon the company'sprospective credit.
A frequent obstacle to the adoption of a feasible plan arises lIhen the parties to
the proceeding, in order to effect tax savings, rei'use to reduce an excessive indebtedness even where a failure to do so lIOUldresult in an unsound capital structure.
Nevertheless, the :fUll protection of
holders demand-sthat the capital structure
shall not be so inflated as to hampersubsequent operations or compel reaort to another
reorganization.
It is also of paramount concern to the Comm1.ssion
that the -new~
lB
ties shall not by their terms or otherwise be deceptive to subsequent parcbaser-s.
the light of the prior history of companies in reorganization, it is clear that the ~
mission's insistence that plans should complywith reasonable standards '(4 t'easibllity
is fully justified.
Thus, of the new cases in which the Commissionparticipated dur1ng
the fiscal year 1942, 17 of a total of 34 cases (or 50%)had previously been in reorganization, and, during the fiscal year 1943, 7 aut of 16 such cases (or about 44%) had a
siJD:ilar history.

ADVISORY REPORTS ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION
Under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, a-s amended,the ee-dssion "'11&7 - subJdt
formal advisory reports on plans of reorganization referred to it by the coarts-. The
purpose of an advisory report is to provide an ilIIpartial surve;y aDd critique O't tbe
plan not only for the use of the judge in determining whether ar not to apprO"l8the
plan but also for the assistance or security holders in reachiDg the4r deci.s1.onwith
regard to the acceptance or rejection of the plan.

Railway Company,and a1so d. sUJ:plef'lentaladvisory report in the proceeding involving
the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Compa?yin which an initial
advisory report had
previously been filed.
APPEALS

Although the Commissionmay not appeal in a proceeding under Chapter X, it may
participate in appeals taken by others, and it took part in 12 such appeals decided by
the court during the past fiscal year. Questions raised and decided in 5 of these cases
are indicated below.

y

In In re Plankinton Bldg. Co.,
an appeal was taken from an order in a proceeding
under Chapter X for the reorganization of Plankinton Building Company,which had some
years before gone through a Section 77B reorganization.
The order denied participation
in the Ctmpter X reorganization to holders of bonds of the debtor's predecessor corporation who had not exchanged their old bonds for securities of the present debtor in the
prior 77B proceeding. The Commissionurged that the old borldhclders were entitled to
participate as creditors in the Chapter X proceeding since their claims had been listed
by the Section 77B trustee as fixed, liquidated in amount and not disputed, and had been
so allowed in the 77B proceeding. The Circuit Court of Appeal.sfor the Seventh Circuit
upheld this position and reversed the order of the District Court.

31

the CODIIIlission
In Brook1}n Trust Companyv , R. A. Security Holdings, Inc.,
urged that Congress intended to give persons, holding claims only against the property
of the debtor, the r i.ghi, to file an involuntary petition under Chapter X and that the
institution
of such proceeding did not deprive the debtor of property without due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment
of the Constitu::'ion. The District Court sustained this position and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.

2./

In In re CuyahogaFinance Co.,
there was involved the question whether the
Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction in a Chapter X proceeding to determine in a summary
action set-offs agafnsf the debtor I s obligation to a pledgee creditor, where such
creditor had possession of the assets and where it declined to file a claim or otherwise
consent to the jurisdiction
of the court. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit held, as urged by the CommissioTl,that the District Court had properly exercised
in that case.
summaryjurisdiction

Y

In In re Cosgrove-MeehanCoal Corporation, et al.,
the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit upheld the contention of the Commissionthat Section 2.49of the
Bankruptcy Act which prohibits an allowance of compensation to those parties who purchase or sell claims against or stock of the debtor while acting in a representative
capacity applies also to a person who traded in the debtor's securities prior to the
reorganization proceeding while he was a memberof a bondholders' committee.

'i/

In Abramsv , Cleveland Terminals Building Compan;y- the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit affirmed an order of the court below which accepted the recommendation of the Commissionwith respect to an application of attorneys for. allowances based
upon services rendered in the reorganization proceedings, which recolllJflendation
urged a
reduction of the amount sought from $172,000 to $18,000.

PART V
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE TRUST INDENTURE

ACT OF 1939

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, note~debentures,
and similar
securities publicly offered for sale, sold, or delivered after sale through the mails
or in interstate commerce, except as specff'Lca'l ly exempted by the Act, be issued under
an indenture which meets the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with
the Commission.
The provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939 are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933
of such securities to be issued under a trust indenture shall not be permitted to become effective unless the indenture qonforms to the specific statutory requirements expressed in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The indenture is automatically "qualified"
when registration becomes effective as to the securities themselves.
I

'

With one minor exception, no changes were made during the year in the Canmission' s
rules and regulations under this Act. Rule T-7A-4 was amended merely to change the
hour from which the time of the effective date of applications is computed from 4:30

 52PART VI

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940
During the past fiscal year the CODRissionin its administration of' the IDYestaent
CompanyAct of 1940
concerned itself' primarily nth:
(1) the registration
of cc:apanies subject to the Act; (2) the disposition of applications filed pursuant to tbe
provisions of the Act; (3) the p~tion
of rn1.es prescribing the type of periodic
information and reports required to be tiled with the Cem.dBsionand the type ot information and reports required to be transmitted to securi.ty holders, and (4) the prOJllUlgation of rules and forms to enable 1iIvestaent cCllpanies to use their registration
statements under that Act as a basis for effecting registra.tiOll ot their secur1.ties
under the Securities Act of 1933, thus avoiding a duplicatiOll in registration
statements and of' etfort and expenses upon the part of' :invest.mt c<llp&Dies.

!I

pursuant to Section 8 (a)
Vost imestment cOlllpaniesregistered with the C~sion
of the Act during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1941. However, 1.4 cOlllp8lliesfiled
notifications
of registration
during the past fiscal year.
TIro of these 14 c<mIpan1es
were organized during the fiscal year and the others had not registered previously,
either because they- claimed an exemption f'r0lll the provisions of the Act or tor some
other reason.
Fran the effective date of the Act to the close of the last fiscal year 481 investment cClllpaniesof all types had registered under the Act. Ninety-one of these companies
by the close of the last fiscal year had for one reason or another ceased to be investment companies, so that at the close of the fiscal year 390 investment compan1.es-.ere
registered with the Commissionunder the Act. The total assets of these cClllpan1eswere
well in excess of two billion dollars at the close of the fiscal year.
Doring the preceding fiscal year the C<aDission adopted rules -.blch permit investment C<JRR8nies to file copies of information already filed under other 'Acts administered
by the CouRission in lieu of registration
statements under -the Investment CaIpaD;y Act
of 1940, and thereby gave effect to the directive of the Congress as set forth in Section 8 (c) of the Act. The ee-ission
also prOJllUlgatedseveral rules and f01'JllB
UDder
which :investment companies are enabled to use their registration
statements filed lIDder
the Iuvestm.ent CompanyAct of 1940 as the basis for registration mider the Securities
Act of 19J3. The purpose of these new rules and. forms was to e1iJrinate duplication ot
filings under the various Acts of'material already filed under one Act. In this connection the COllllllis~ion
praaulgated Font 5-4 under the Securities Act ot 19J3 for registJ:ation UDder that Act by closed-end JIaD8geDlent

for unit investment trusts and other types of investment companies.
The annual report forms are designed to bring up to date, as of the close of each
fiscal year of the registrant,

its detailed registration statement.
During the past fiscal year 215 annual reports and 9ll quarterly reports were filed
by registered investment companies of all types.

Section 24 (b) of the Act requires the filing with the Commission,within ten days
after the use thereof, of copies of the full text of all sales literature employedby
various types of investment companiesregistered under the Act. Daring the past fiscal
year 1,069 pieces of sales literature were filed with the Commission.
Section 30 (d) of the Act provides that every registered investment compa:ny
shall
retransmit to its st.ockholdara, and file with the Commission,at least semi~y,
ports contai nj ng certain prescribed information and financial statements. During the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1943, 1,078 periodic reports to security holders were filed
with the Commission.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION UNDER THE VARIOUS STATUTES
LI'lIGATI(Il

Cirll. Proceedings
At the beginning o£ the fiscal year ended June 30, 1943, 11 civil proceed.iDgB instituted by the Commissionwere pending; during the year, the Commission1nstituted 37
additional proceedings, including 28 injunctive actions brought against 71 persons to
restrain them f'rClJl fraud:u1ent and othe7wise illegal practices in the sale of securities.
Of' this total of 48 proceedings, 26 were disposed of' during the fiscal year, including
23 eas-es which resulted in the entry of injunctions against 54 persons. Twenty-two
civil proceedings were pending at the end of the year.
Since its
and disposed o£
individuals.

inception, the ComII:ission
bas instituted
a total of 471 cirtl. proceedings
455. Permanent injunctions have been obtained against 994 firms and

Data nth respect to civil cases and appellate proceedings, including a brief de.,.
scription of all civil proceedings camnencedor pending during the fiscal year and their
status at the close of the year, together with all cMminal proceedings, are included in
Append1x Tables 20 to 30. SaBe o£ the more important of these civil cases haTe been
8UIIIIR&1"ized
in the preceding parts of tlris report.
Criminal Proceed1ngs
The statutes a.dmin:iBtered by the Cc.rlssion provide for the tranSll:ission to the Department of Justice of evidence o£ violations of the cl"im1naJprorlrlOI18 of those
statutes.
The Attorney General determines 1rbetber criminal proceed.iDgB 8ba11 be 1mrtituted.
It is the COIIIIission's policy to make a thorough inTestigation of' alleged. dolations bef'ore referring a ease to the Department of Justice, and to f'arnish to the Department the results of such inwstigat10ns as in the GaIII:1ssion's opinion appear to warrant
prosecution.
Thereaf'ter, if' criminal proceedings are instituted;
the m.eabersof the Ccamission's staff who participated in the investigation assist the united States attorneys
in the preparation of the cases far the grand jury and for trial, and in the writing of'
briefs on appeal.
During the fiscal year the enforcement of the federal securities laws became increasingly important by reason of the continued rise in national income, the accelerated
acCUllUlationof savings, and the CUlc<Ditant scarcity of consumer goods. In the absence
of vigorous policing activities,
eccmadc conditions such as these would be highly
favorable to the operation of' :f'raudDlent securities promotions.
During a period of war lIben industrial activity is greatly expanded, lIhen indi"rlctual
savings are at a high level and when liar bond selling campaigns introduce security investments to m:1llions of new investors, conditions are conducive to an increase in
fraudulent securities practices.
The C~ssion
is, therefore, applyiDg extra and 1musual vigilance to prevent a rise in fraudulent securi-ties activities.
So f'ar as 1M are
able to -discover they have been held in check.
Up to July 17 1943, a total. of' 2,223 defendants have bee!l indicted in cuee c:bn'8loped by' the Ca-ission.
DIJr1Dg the past year indictments were returned aplDat 189 defendants.
CoDvictions have been obtained against 1,013
defendan1is. M these, 126
def'endant8 were convicted dariDg the past year. This includes t1m def'endmta held in
crSminaJ c<miJeBptf'or vio1at1Dg deczees of' 1njuncticm obtained in aC'tions proeecuted by'
the Ca.1ssi.cm.. Of' these convicted defendants, almost two-th1rds had pleaded pUty or
no de.f'enae. 0Dl7 one-third
tba defendants stood trial.

Includes an adjUstaent of' conv1.ctims

tar prior years reported late.

- 58 During the past fiscal year, in over 98%of the cases developed by the Commission,
the main defendants either were found guilty by a jury or pleaded guilty or no defense.
If minor defendants
are included, the figures for the year are 126 convicted and 13
acquitted.
In almost one-third of the cases disposed of during the past year, the indictment was returned and the case tried within the same fiscal period.
The nationwide character of the COJIDllission'
s investigations is shownby the fact
that during the past year, as in previous years, the investors affected resided in each
of the forty-eight states.
Cases were instituted or tried in approximately forty of the
federal district
courts.
The status of all of the cases pending during the year and the major events in each
of the cases are set forth in Appendix Table 23. Most of the cases fell into the following general classifications:
frauds on the part of certain broker-dealers,
industrial
loan companyfrauds, stock market manipulations, miscellaneous investment companyfrauds,
vending machine promotions, whiskey warehouse receipt promotions, exploitation of natural resources, and promotions of inventions. :
An unusually high number of small loan companies were involved in the cases prosecuted during the year. They were U. S. v ; Dewitt T. Simpson, ~ al (Standard System
Investment Corp., Savannah, Georgia:r;tJ. S. v, Jesse MiChaer- (Industrial Loan Company,
Inc., Columbus, Ohio); U. S. v , Carl A:-5Chroeder, et al (Continental Finance Company,
Jersey City, NewJerseyT;U. S. v. Charles R. Beall;-etal
(Carolina Industrial Securities Corp., Columbia, South Carolina); U. S. v , CliftoilM. Bisele, et al (Southeastern
Industrial Bankers, Inc., District of Columbia); U. S. v , Joseph M. LYdon;et al (Brokers
Acceptance Corp., Boston, Massachusetts).
The first of these cases is illustrative
of some of the practices.
Standard System
was a holding companylIhich had obtained control of a number of industrial loan companies operating in various cities in Georgia. Prominent business and professional men
who were not aware of the schemewere persuaded to serve on the board of directors,
thus
furnishing Standard System with a respectabje facade. ActUally, control of the corporation was exercised by Dewitt T. Simpson, Alonzo P. Ricks and Edward W. Brandon, who paid
dividends out of capital, made fictitious
book entries, and acted freely with the corporate funds.
They were indicted in February, 1943 in Savannah, Ga., for violations
of
the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and for other statutory offenses.
All were convicted, and varying prison terms were imposed.
Charges of frauds by broker-dealers and stock market manipulation charges figured
prClllinently in the cases prosecuted during the year. The manipulation cases were U. s.
v. NormanW. Minuse, et al (Trading on the NewYork Curb Exchange in the stock of Tastyeast, Inc.); U. 57
RaymondR. Taylor (Trading on the Detroit Stock Exchange in
v, EdmondB. Bronson, !!:.!! (Trading over-thethe stock of Midweit'"'I'brasive Co.); ~.
counter in the stock of Bagdad Copper Corp.); U. S. v, Heog: Lieberman, at al (Trading
on the NewYork Stock Exchaz\gein the stock of Julian & Ko enge, Inc.). --

v:-

In the first
of thes-e cases, NormanW. Minuse and Joseph E. H. Pelletier were canvicted of conspiracy to violate the anti-manipulation provisions of the Securities Elcchange Act of 1934. The defendants were charged with operating a stock "jiggle" in the
Class A capital stock of Tastyeast, Inc., a security listed on the NewYork Curb Elcchange, and during the period of their activities
the price of Tastyeast had risen tr<lll
1-5/8 to 4-1/8. The proceeding during the fiscal year constituted the second trial for
the defendants, a prior conviction for the same offense having been reversed on appeal.
A second appeal is pending.

Frauds perpetrated by broker-dealers on their customers were involved in U. S. T.
Russell W. McDermott, Indianapolis, Indiana; U. S. v. Ray O. Braden, et al., ParkersbUrg, West V!iiiriia; U. S. v , E. E. Morrison,etal.

 59In the McDermottcase, one o-r the most 1JJIportant decided during the year, the constitutionality
of the margin requirement provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 was upheld by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Ci1"cuit. The determinati.QJ1is also notewort.by because it is the first court case predicl'I.ting fl-aud on excessive trading by a broker in a customer's discretionary account. In 1939, the CClllllission
learned of the 1mpending dissolution of a Chicago stock brokerage firm, and reports -.ere
received of irregularities
in the firm.s Indianapolis office.
An investigation
followed,
and it'ft8
discovered that Russell W. McDermott"manager of the Indianapolis office, had
been pUty of serious violations of the margin rules, by means of a deceptive system of
"kited- checks and "free-riding. II He had also engaged in certain fraudulent practices.
1'be ~t
Court of Appeals sustained his conviction (131 F. (2d) 313 (C.C.A. 7, 1942»,
end certiorari was denied by"the U. S. Supreme Court (318 U. S. 765).

The )(~OA
Bond
case was the first instance of a conviction for hypothecatiOD at casCierB' securit: es in contra.vention of Section 8 (c) of the Securities ExcbaDge Act of 1934. E. E. Morrison and H.

v. Albert:""Jartis (J>arldiigMeter Corp.;-creveland, Ohio).
In the usual vending machine case, the promoter undertakes to sell vending machines
to the investor under an a+rangement whereby"the investor will :iJmnediatelylease the
machine back to the pranoter, who is to operate it for the new omer on a profit-sharing
basis. Thereafter" periodic payments, purporting to be profits, are made to the investor. Actually", such payments are made out of capital.
The purpose is to induce the
pv.rcbase ot additional machines. This fraudulent pattern was the subject of the indict1II8D.t
in the l.eT1ne case, lIhich involved the sale of cigarette and peanut vending maohines. Addition81. frauds were a+so charged. One of the de:fendants" Alfred D. Cohen"
bas been cOD.T1ctedand sentenced on a plea of guilty.
The others are awaiting trial.
The C~sion
IS interest
in these cases arises from the fact that the transactions,
under the Securities Act of 1933, are essentially securities investments rather than
aere sales o:f personal property.
Vining cC8p~
stocks were often involved in the fraud cases.
In a number of these,
the securities 1191"8 sold by residents of Canada operating from across the border without
cc.pliance nth the statutes of this country. The Commissionhae been cooperating with
the State Department and the Department of Justice in efforts to obtain ratification
of
a pending treaty with Canada in order to permit extradition from Canada of those who
'Violate oar securities
laws and other cognate statutes.
The treaty was ratified by the
lJDited states Senate in 1942.

Ettect of the 'War
One of the most fJlportant problems con:froDt1ng acCO\Ultants during the past year
bas been 'tbat of detendn1ng too proper approach to be taken toward the special uncertainti.es which are inherent in the presentati.on of rmanci.al. statements under existing
wartble conditions.
Accountants have been obllged to f'ace situations
in which the entire business dane is novel, is subject to abnontal business and economic risks, and is
cODducted UDder novel legal. and contractual arrangements of uncertain incidence.
The Canm:ission has cooperated with the accounting prof'ession and with particular
registrants
in 8."q)lor1ng these prob1e.s aDd m developing appropriate techiques, procedures, and interpretations
for deallDg with thea.
cae of' the most iIDpartant and perT8Sive of these uncertainties
has resulted :trca ~he statutor,y provision f'tir_ the re-negotiat1on of war contracts of' ~n18S
eugaged in war prodaction.
The CCIIIIIliss10n
has
:!ollowed a pollCT of requesting that the .tblanc1al statements of' registrants
disclose
the pertinent
.tacts aboat the c~'s
position with respect to renegotiation.
In addition the ee-:ission,
during the past;J88l", aaended 1ts requirements ~or filing interla

These
amendments, announced in Accounting Series Release No. 43., were predicated em the belief
that the segregation of original cost, historical
cost and other components of book
amounts of utility plant is, in the light of present trends- of rate regulation, of great
concern to investors.

More general questions of accountdng princjplee or practices were dealt 'With in several releases issued during the past year in the Accounting Series.
Release No. 45
dealt with the accounting treatment to be accorded premiumspaid upon the redeJDPtion of
preferred stock. This release, issued on June 21, 1943, concluded that such premiums
should ordinarily be charged to earned surplus.
Subsequently a cOllllllitteeof the American
Institute
of Accountants raised a number of objections to the position taken. TheS'eobjections, which were first urged as to prel1ll1nary drafts of the release, are nevertheless being given further consideration by the Caamrl.ssion. Release No. 35 dealt with the
proper disclosure to be given in financial statements to provisions and conditions that
l1Jnit the availability
of surplus for dividend purposes. Release No. 36 discussed the
treatment by an investment compan,yof interest collected on defaulted bonds applicable
to a period prior to the date on which such bonds and defaulted interest were purchased,
while Release No. 38 discussed the proper accounting treatment of the post-war refUnd of
federal excess profits taxes provided for in Seotion 250 of the Revenue Act of 1942.

CONFIDENTIAL

TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS,

REPORTS,

OR DOCUMENTS

The Commissionhas power, as described in its Seventh Annual Report, page 234, and
previous annual reports, to provide for the confiden,tial treatment, upon application by
registrants,
of information corrtadned in reports, applicationa, or documents such as
prospectuses, proxy statements and registration statements, requi.1"edto be filed under
a number-of the acts which it administers.
In addition, as set forth in the Eighth Annual Report, page 6, rules have been
adopted by the Commissionpursuant to the securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Public utility Holding Com:p&V"
Act of 1935.which provide
for the amission or confidential treatment, either on the COIIDIissionlsown1Il0tionor
upon application, of any such information which is inconsistent with the standards
of the Code of wartime Practices promulgated by the United States Office of Censorship. Since copies of the documents filed with the COIIIIIIission
under Sections 12 and
13 of the Securities Exchange Act at 1934, the not inconsiderable TolUll1e
and the
nature of which are indicated earlier on this report, must also be filed with the securities exchanges, the Cammission bas continued. to obtain the cooperation of the exchanges in temporarily wi t~old.ing If'r0lll public inspection their copies of these documents until the COIIIIDission
has completed its preliminary examination of this material
and the exchanges have had an opportunity to delete fr(lll a.rq documentsuch information
as is specifically
authorized or directed by the CCBIIlission. nmediatly thereafter
these documents are made available for public inspection.
Wb1l.ethe general type of
ini'ormation 1fh1ch the Office of Gensorship in the Code of wartime Practices d8ell&adversely to af'f'ect the -war program and which thus, under the CaDission J s additional
rules, is to be omitted or treated confidentially in doewaent. fUed under the three
statutes mentioned above, was summarizedin-Securities Act of 1933 Release NO'.27S1,
membersof the Commission's staff have rendered eYery possible' usistance to registrants,
in advance ot filing dates, in the preparation of docuaents in accordance with th9 objectives sought by these rules.

and transferred to a new division known as the Corporation Finance Division. The personnel and !"unctions of t-he Investment Advisers Section of the Investment CompaDY'Division were transferred to the Trading and ExchangeDivision. A certain portion of the
investigative
and interpretative
staff of the Legal Division were transferred to the
Counsel's Office of the Corporation Finance Division. Twonew organizational ,units
were created, i. e., the Solio1tor's Office and the Opinion Writing Office. The remainder of the personnel of the Legal Division was transferred to those offices.
The immediate effects of this were substantial moneysavings in that it was then
possible to abolish manyvacant positions lfithout impairment to the CODIII11ssion'
s work.
During the fiscal year, turther savings of man-powerresulted because the new arrangement of divisions and offices allowed greater use of experienced supervisors and keypersonnel and provided for the consolidation in one division of certain examination and
analytical work that previously had been performed in three divisions.
