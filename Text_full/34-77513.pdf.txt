In the Matter of the Application of

ORDER EXTENDING TIME
IN WHICH TO FILE BRIEFS

For Review of Disciplinary Action Taken By
FINRA

Applicant has requested, for reasons stated in his motion, a two-week extension of
time within which to file his brief in support in this matter, which was due April 4, 2016.
Counsel for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) does not object to his
request. Extensions of time are disfavored. Given the circumstances, it appears
appropriate, however, to grant Applicant’s request. Therefore,
It is ORDERED that the time for filing Applicant’s brief in support is extended to
April 18, 2016. FINRA’s brief in opposition is due May 18, 2016, and any reply brief is
due June 1, 2016. No further extensions will be granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
