SEC Temporarily Suspends Registration Exemption of Regulation A Issuer
September 16, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had
temporarily suspended the registration exemption of a California-based issuer that had failed to
file a required annual report under amendments to Regulation A.
Amendments to Regulation A, which the SEC adopted in 2015 and are often referred to as
Regulation A+, provide for two tiers of registration exemptions: Tier 1 for offerings up to $20
million and Tier 2 for offerings up to $50 million. A Tier 2 issuer is subject to greater
requirements than a Tier 1 issuer. Among other things, a Tier 2 issuer is required to file annual
reports on Form 1-K for the fiscal year in which it became qualified and every fiscal year
thereafter. A Tier 2 issuer may only sell securities if it has filed the required annual filings. As
part of its annual report on Form 1-K, a Tier 2 issuer must include audited financial statements.
Rule 258 under Regulation A authorizes the Commission to temporarily suspend the Regulation
A exemption of an issuer if it has reason to believe that a term, condition or requirement, such as
the requirement to file an annual report, has not been complied with.
According to the SEC’s temporary suspension order, Med-X, Inc. filed an offering statement
with the SEC in August 2015 to register a Tier 2 offering. SEC staff qualified the offering
statement in November 2015, and Med-X was required to file its first annual report on Form 1-K
by no later than April 30, 2016. To date, Med-X has not filed any such annual report.
This is the SEC’s first temporary suspension order under the amendments to Regulation A.
