In the Matter of
PETER B. MADOFF

ORDER VACATING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING
ORGANIZATION AND MUNICIPAL ADVISOR BARS
Peter Madoff seeks to vacate an administrative bar order dated July 26, 2012 (“bar
order”) to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization (“NRSRO”) and as a municipal advisor.1 The NRSRO and municipal advisor
bars imposed on Madoff were based solely on conduct occurring prior to July 22, 2010, the
effective date of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.2
Accordingly, in our discretion, we vacate the bar order to the extent that it prohibits Peter Madoff
from associating with any NRSRO and as a municipal advisor, but otherwise leave the bar
unchanged.
By the Commission.

Secretary
