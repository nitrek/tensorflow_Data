INTRODUCTION
On July 21, 2010, the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. 9 This legislation

was enacted to, among other things, promote the financial stability of the United States by
improving accountability and transparency in the financial system. 10 Section 939A of the DoddFrank Act requires each Federal agency, including the Commission, to review any regulation
issued by such agency that requires the use of an assessment of the creditworthiness of a security
or money market instrument and any references to or requirements in such regulations regarding
credit ratings. 11 The section further provides that each such agency shall “modify any such
regulations identified by the review . . . to remove any reference to or requirement of reliance on
credit ratings, and to substitute in such regulations such standard of creditworthiness as each
respective agency shall determine as appropriate for such regulations.” 12

DISCUSSION
A.

Background

Prior to and after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission has taken a number
of steps toward removing references to credit ratings from its regulations under the federal
securities laws. 13 These steps include a 2011 proposal to remove references to credit ratings of
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSROs”) from certain rules under the
Exchange Act relating to broker-dealer financial responsibility (Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, and
Form X-17A-5, Part IIB), confirmations of securities transactions (Rule 10b-10), and
distributions of securities (Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M). 14 Today the Commission is
adopting amendments to remove references to credit ratings in the broker-dealer financial
responsibility and confirmations of transactions rules. In doing so, the Commission considered
its prior actions in this area. Regarding its proposal to remove credit ratings from its rules under
13

See, e.g., Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange Act Release No. 34616 (Aug.
31, 1994), 59 FR 46314 (Sep. 7, 1994) (soliciting comment on, among other things, whether references to

Regulation M applicable to distributions of securities, the Commission is currently reviewing
comments and considering alternatives and intends to address this proposal separately. 15 In
taking these actions, the Commission has carefully considered the eleven comment letters it
received in response to the proposing release, 16 five of which discussed the proposed
amendments to the broker-dealer financial responsibility rules, 17 and four of which discussed the
proposed amendments to the confirmations of transactions rule. 18
A number of other federal agencies have also taken action to implement section 939A of
the Dodd-Frank Act, including regulations proposed or adopted by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, 19 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 20 the National Credit

Regulation M is a set of anti-manipulation rules designed to preserve the integrity of the securities market
by prohibiting activities that could artificially influence the market for an offered security. See 17 CFR
242.100-105. The rules include an exception for nonconvertible debt securities, nonconvertible preferred
securities, and asset-backed securities that are rated by at least one NRSRO in one of its generic rating
categories that signifies investment grade. See 17 CFR 242.101(c)(2); 17 CFR 242.102(d)(2).

In 1975, the Commission adopted the term nationally recognized statistical rating
organization as part of amendments to the broker-dealer net capital rule (“Rule 15c3-1”). 26 The
Commission’s initial regulatory use of the term was intended to provide a method for
determining net capital charges on different grades of debt securities under Rule 15c3-1. 27 Rule

15c3-1 prescribes a net liquid assets test that is designed to require a broker-dealer to maintain
sufficient liquid assets to meet all obligations to customers and counterparties and have adequate
additional resources to wind-down its business in an orderly manner without the need for a
formal proceeding if the firm fails financially. 28 Among other things, Rule 15c3-1 requires
broker-dealers to maintain specified minimum levels of net liquid assets, or net capital. 29 In
particular, it requires that a broker-dealer perform two calculations: (1) a computation of the
minimum amount of net capital the broker-dealer must maintain; 30 and (2) a computation of the
amount of net capital the broker-dealer is maintaining. 31 The minimum net capital requirement
is the greater of a fixed-dollar amount specified in the rule or an amount determined by applying
one of two financial ratios. 32
In computing net capital, a broker-dealer must, among other things, make certain
adjustments to net worth, including deducting illiquid assets, taking other net capital charges, and
adding qualifying subordinated loans. 33 The amount remaining after these adjustments is
defined as tentative net capital. 34 The final step in computing net capital is to take prescribed
percentage deductions (“haircuts”) from the mark-to-market value of proprietary positions (e.g.,
securities, money market instruments, and commodities) that are included in the broker-dealer’s
tentative net capital. 35 The haircuts are designed to account for the market risk inherent in these

positions and create a buffer of liquidity to protect against other risks associated with the
securities business. 36
Rule 15c3-1 prescribes differing haircut amounts for a variety of classes of securities. 37
The rule also contains catchall provisions to account for securities that are not included in the
specified classes of securities. 38 Generally, the catchall provisions impose higher deductions
(15% or 40% of the mark-to-market value of the positions) than the haircuts applicable to the
specifically identified classes of securities. 39 Further, if a security does not have a ready market,
it is subject to a 100% deduction from net worth. 40
Prior to today’s amendments, commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock
rated in higher rating categories by at least two NRSROs were included in the classes of securities
that had lower haircuts than securities subject to the catchall provisions. 41 Specifically, to qualify
for this treatment, among other things, commercial paper needed to be rated in one of the three

See, e.g., Uniform Net Capital Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 13635 (June 16, 1977), 42 FR 31778 (June
23, 1977) (“[Haircuts] are intended to enable net capital computations to reflect the market risk inherent in
the positioning of the particular types of securities enumerated in [the rule.]”); Net Capital Rule, Exchange
Act Release No. 22532 (Oct. 15, 1985), 50 FR 42961 (Oct. 23, 1985) (“These percentage deductions, or
‘haircuts’, take into account elements of market and credit risk that the broker-dealer is exposed to when
holding a particular position.”); Net Capital Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 39455 (Dec. 17, 1997), 62 FR
67996 (Dec. 30, 1997) (“Reducing the value of securities owned by broker-dealers for net capital purposes
provides a capital cushion against adverse market movements and other risks faced by the firms, including
liquidity and operational risks.”) (footnote omitted).

40

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vii). The term ready market is defined in Rule 15c3-1 as “a market in which
there exists independent bona fide offers to buy and sell so that a price reasonably related to the last sales
price or current bona fide competitive bid and offer quotations can be determined for a particular security
almost instantaneously and where payment will be received in settlement of a sale at such price within a
relatively short time conforming to trade custom.” 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(11).

41

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(E), (F), and (H). Generally, the haircut requirements in Rule 15c3-1
prior to today’s amendments were based on the practice of many NRSROs having at least eight categories
of ratings for debt securities, with the top four ratings commonly referred to in the industry as investment
grade.

7

highest rating categories by at least two NRSROs, 42 nonconvertible debt needed to be rated in
one of the four highest rating categories by at least two NRSROs, 43 and preferred stock needed
to be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two NRSROs. 44 Broker-dealers
were not required to take as large a haircut for commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred
stock meeting these rating conditions because the securities were considered to be less volatile in
price than securities that were rated in lower rating categories or were unrated.
The Commission proposed to remove references to credit ratings in the provisions of
Rule 15c3-1 establishing lower haircuts for higher rated commercial paper, nonconvertible debt,
and preferred stock and to substitute an alternative standard of creditworthiness as a condition for
qualifying for the lower haircut treatment. 45 The proposed amendments retained the non-credit
rating conditions for these classes of securities to apply lower haircuts. Under the proposal, a
broker-dealer would have been permitted to apply the lower haircuts for commercial paper (i.e.,
between zero and ½ of 1%), nonconvertible debt (i.e., between 2% and 9%), and preferred stock
(i.e., 10%) if the position had only a minimal amount of credit risk as determined by the brokerdealer pursuant to written policies and procedures the broker-dealer established, maintained, and

42

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(E). The amount of the haircut ranged from 0% to ½ of 1% depending on
the time to maturity of the commercial paper. Id. Additional conditions to qualify for this treatment were
that the commercial paper had a maturity at date of issuance not exceeding nine months exclusive of days
of grace, or any renewal thereof, the maturity of which was likewise limited, and a fixed rate of interest or
been sold at a discount. Id.

43

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F). The amount of the haircut ranged from 2% to 9% depending on the
time to maturity of the nonconvertible debt security. Id. Additional conditions to qualify for this treatment
were that the nonconvertible debt security had a fixed rate of interest, a fixed maturity, and did not trade
flat and was not in default as to principal or interest. Id.

44

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(H). The amount of the haircut was 10%. Id. Additional conditions to
qualify for this treatment were that the preferred stock ranked prior to all other classes of stock of the same
issuer and was not in arrears as to dividends. Id.

enforced to assess creditworthiness. 46 Consequently, to use these lower haircuts for commercial
paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock, a broker-dealer would have been required to
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures designed to assess the credit
risks applicable to the position and, based on this process, would have had to determine that the
investment had only a minimal amount of credit risk. 47 A broker-dealer would have been
required to take a larger deduction, normally the 15% “catchall” haircut, on its proprietary
positions in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock if the firm did not have
procedures to assess the creditworthiness of the class of security or money market instrument or
determined its position was not of minimal credit risk. 48 Moreover, if an issuance of commercial
paper, nonconvertible debt, or preferred stock did not trade in a ready market, the broker-dealer
would continue to apply a 100% haircut – meaning that the broker-dealer could not include the
value of the security in its net capital. 49
In the proposing release, the Commission identified the following factors a broker-dealer
could consider, to the extent appropriate, when assessing credit risk for purposes of determining
whether an issuance of commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, or preferred stock was of
minimal credit risk: (1) credit spreads; (2) securities-related research; (3) internal or external
credit risk assessments; (4) default statistics; (5) inclusion in an index; (6) priorities and
enhancements; (7) price, yield and/or volume; and (8) asset class-specific factors. 50 The
Commission stated that the list of factors was not intended to be exhaustive nor mutually

exclusive and that the range and type of specific factors considered would vary depending on the
particular securities that were reviewed. 51
In addition, each broker-dealer would have been required to preserve for a period of not
less than three years (the first two years in an easily accessible place) the written policies and
procedures that the broker-dealer established, maintained, and enforced for assessing credit risk
for commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock. 52 Broker-dealers would have
been subject to this requirement in the broker-dealer record retention rule (Rule 17a-4), which
the Commission proposed to amend in conjunction with the rulemaking. 53

Comments

Five commenters responded to the Commission’s request for comment on the
amendments to Rule 15c3-1. 54 One additional commenter – writing about section 939A
generally – supported the goals of section 939A to provide incentive for more information and
diligence for investors and to increase competition in the credit rating agency industry but also
cautioned that implementation of section 939A could be confusing to smaller banks and
investors. 55 Two commenters raised concerns generally about replacing credit ratings with a
more subjective standard of creditworthiness. 56 Three other commenters suggested
modifications to the Commission’s list of factors that a broker-dealer could consider when

assessing creditworthiness under the proposed minimal amount of credit risk standard. 57
Commenters also generally supported the Commission’s proposal that broker-dealers document
and retain their policies and procedures for assessing a position’s creditworthiness to determine
whether it is of minimal credit risk. 58
Among commenters raising concerns about the Commission replacing credit ratings with
a more subjective approach for determining haircuts, one commenter stated that the proposal
contains an inherent conflict of interest, is complicated, and would disproportionately burden
smaller firms. 59 This commenter also stated that the Commission’s proposal could result in
inconsistent net capital treatment across broker-dealers absent a mandatory list of factors or an
objective standard that a broker-dealer could apply when determining net capital haircuts – “[f]or
example, one firm may determine a security qualifies for a 9% haircut, while another might
determine the haircut for the same security is 15%.” 60 This commenter also has concerns that a
subjective approach would reduce liquidity, increase volatility, and could increase costs for
issuers of securities. 61
The second commenter expressed concern that Commission and self-regulatory
organization (“SRO”) examiners would “second guess” a broker-dealer’s policies and procedures
and analysis under the new standard and that examiners should, instead, focus on the
reasonableness of the policies and procedures. 62 This commenter also requested that examiners

58

See Barnard Letter, at 2; Better Markets Letter, at 6-8.

59

Bond Dealers Letter, at 2. This commenter argued that the proposed amendments disadvantage smaller
broker-dealers that lack the necessary internal resources to determine creditworthiness and, as a result, will
be unable to apply reduced haircuts.

avoid duplicating the work of other regulators who have already considered the adequacy of a
broker-dealer’s policies and procedures for assessing the creditworthiness of securities
positions.63
Regarding the Commission’s proposed list of factors that broker-dealers could consider
when assessing creditworthiness under the minimal amount of credit risk standard, one
commenter recommended that the Commission require broker-dealers to consider certain
mandatory factors and suggested they be codified in the final rule. 64 In contrast, another
commenter did not believe that factors should be codified in the rule. 65 Another stated that a
broker-dealer’s assessment of a security’s creditworthiness should be based on “hard” factors,
such as credit spreads and default statistics, rather than “soft” factors, such as securities-related
research. 66
One commenter requested that “term to maturity” and “concentration of credit risk” be
included as factors that a broker-dealer could consider in assessing whether a position is of
minimal credit risk. 67 Another suggested that a broker-dealer’s policies and procedures for
assessing creditworthiness under the proposed standard be permitted to take into account the
“size of the [broker-dealer’s] position and the purpose for which the position [was] acquired or
held by the broker-dealer.” 68 This commenter also stated that a broker-dealer’s obligation to
monitor credit determinations should be based on factors such as the volatility of business

One commenter suggested that a broker-dealer be allowed to rely on a parent’s or an
affiliate’s credit determination. 70 Another stated that, to promote regulatory and market
transparency, a broker-dealer that develops internal credit ratings should be required to compare
its ratings to an external benchmark, such as NRSRO ratings, market data, or other credit
information sources. 71 Another stated, however, that a broker-dealer should be prohibited from
considering internally or externally developed credit ratings as part of its credit risk assessment
process and that permitting such use would conflict with section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act. 72
Commenters generally supported the Commission’s proposal that broker-dealers
document their policies and procedures for determining creditworthiness under the minimal
amount of credit risk standard. 73 One commenter suggested that such documentation be
maintained indefinitely. 74 Another stated that the Commission should require a broker-dealer to
maintain a record for each assessment of creditworthiness under the standard. 75 Another stated
that the Commission should only require the retention of records for determinations of credit risk
when a broker-dealer is engaged in “sophisticated credit analysis.” 76 This commenter stated that
a broker-dealer should not be required to document its credit analysis with respect to a position if

Final Rule

The Commission is amending Rule 15c3-1 to remove references to NRSRO credit ratings
in the provisions establishing lower haircuts for commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and
preferred stock. The Commission is adopting amendments to these provisions with
modifications from the proposal, discussed below, to address issues raised by commenters.
Under the final amendments and consistent with the proposal, when a broker-dealer
applies haircuts for commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock that have a ready
market for purposes of its net capital computation, it will have the option of: (1) using the firm’s
own written policies and procedures to determine whether the security has only a minimal
amount credit risk and, if so, applying the appropriate lower haircut if it meets the other
conditions prescribed in Rule 15c3-1; or (2) applying the greater deduction applicable to the
position, such as the 15% haircut under the catchall provision in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(J) of Rule
15c3-1. 78 Commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock without a ready market
would continue to be subject to a 100% haircut. 79
Unlike the objective approach of using NRSRO credit ratings, the minimal amount of
credit risk standard is a subjective approach because it allows broker-dealers in the first instance
to determine through their credit assessments whether a lower haircut is applicable to a given
position. Further, whereas the rule prior to today’s amendments required that commercial paper,
nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock be given high credit ratings by an NRSRO before a

reduced haircut is permitted, the minimal amount of credit risk standard provides flexibility to
broker-dealers by allowing them to rely on a variety of factors, both objective and subjective, in
assessing the credit and liquidity risks associated with their proprietary commercial paper,
nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock positions. However, the Commission does not intend
for the new standard to result in a more liberal requirement that broadens the scope of the rule by
allowing more positions to qualify for the lower haircuts. 80 The Commission notes that credit
ratings and market data (such as credit spreads and yields) can serve as useful benchmarks for
evaluating whether a broker-dealer’s policies and procedures, as applied to the minimal amount
of credit risk standard, are increasing the types of commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and
preferred stock positions to which it applies the lower haircuts as compared to the eliminated
NRSRO credit rating standard.
The Commission is amending paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(E) of Rule 15c3-1 (relating to
commercial paper haircuts), paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(F)(1) and (c)(2)(vi)(F)(2) of Rule 15c3-1
(relating to nonconvertible debt haircuts), and paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(H) of Rule 15c3-1 (relating to
preferred stock haircuts) by replacing references to NRSRO credit ratings with the alternative
minimal amount of credit risk standard. 81 Consistent with the proposal, the final rule provides
that a broker-dealer may apply the lower haircuts applicable to commercial paper (i.e., between
0% and ½ of 1%), nonconvertible debt (i.e., between 2% and 9%), and preferred stock (i.e.,
80

As noted above, to qualify for the lower haircuts under the NRSRO credit rating standard being replaced
today, commercial paper needed to be rated in one of the three highest rating categories by at least two
NRSROs, nonconvertible debt needed to be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two
NRSROs, and preferred stock needed to be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two
NRSROs. For an example of one NRSRO’s definitions of its four highest credit rating categories, see
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Definitions for long-term issuances available at
http://img.en25.com/Web/StandardandPoors/Ratings_Definitions.pdf. Information about the credit rating
categories of all the NRSROs can be obtained through the Forms NRSRO they file with the Commission
and make publicly available. Links to these forms are available at

10%) if the security has only a minimal amount of credit risk. 82
The Commission has made several modifications to its proposed rule text. First, the
Commission has re-structured the rule by adding new paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(I) to specify
requirements for the policies and procedures a broker-dealer must establish, document, maintain,
and enforce for purposes of assessing whether a position has only a minimal amount credit risk
under paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(E), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(1), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(2), and (c)(2)(vi)(H). 83 Under the
proposal, each of the paragraphs (i.e., paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(E), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(1), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(2),
and (c)(2)(vi)(H)) separately provided that a broker-dealer must determine whether a position has
only a minimal amount of credit risk pursuant to “written policies and procedures the brokerdealer establishes, maintains, and enforces to assess creditworthiness.” 84 Consistent with the
proposal, each paragraph still requires that the security or money market instrument have only a
minimal amount of credit risk before the lower haircut may be applied; however the reference to
policies and procedures in each paragraph has been removed. Instead, new paragraph
(c)(2)(vi)(I) of Rule 15c3-1 requires the broker-dealer to establish, document, maintain, and
enforce policies and procedures to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of each security or
money market instrument that are reasonably designed for the purpose of determining whether
the position has only a minimal amount of credit risk. 85 Securities or money market instruments
assessed to have only a minimal amount of credit risk also must meet the other non-credit rating
conditions prescribed in Rule 15c3-1 in order to apply the lower haircuts under paragraphs

(c)(2)(vi)(E), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(1), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(2), or (c)(2)(vi)(H). 86
Under the final rule, new paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(I) of Rule 15c3-1 provides that in order to
apply a deduction under paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(E), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(1), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(2), or
(c)(2)(vi)(H), the broker-dealer must assess the creditworthiness of the security or money market
instrument pursuant to policies and procedures for assessing and monitoring creditworthiness
that the broker-dealer establishes, documents, maintains, and enforces. 87 The Commission added
the word “monitoring” to clarify that, after the initial determination by a broker-dealer, a position
must continue to have only a minimal amount of credit risk in order to remain qualified for the
lower haircut and that monitoring must be done in accordance with the firm’s policies and
procedures. Under Rule 15c3-1, a broker-dealer must at “all times” have and maintain an
amount of net capital that is at least equal to the minimum amount of net capital required by the
rule. 88 Consequently, the broker-dealer must monitor its securities and money market instrument
positions in order to ensure that it is applying the appropriate haircuts to those positions. For
example, under the NRSRO credit rating standard being eliminated today, a broker-dealer
needed to monitor whether the positions it held continued to have the required credit ratings to
apply the lower haircuts because credit rating agencies may adjust (e.g., downgrade) their credit
ratings. The same is true under the new minimal credit risk standard because the

86

Paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(E) of Rule 15c3-1, as amended, retains the non-credit rating conditions that the
commercial paper must have a maturity at date of issuance not exceeding nine months exclusive of days of
grace, or any renewal thereof, the maturity of which is likewise limited, and a fixed rate of interest, or be
sold at a discount. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(E). Paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(F) of Rule 15c3-1, as
amended, retains the non-credit rating conditions that the nonconvertible debt security must have a fixed
rate of interest, a fixed maturity, and not be traded flat or in default as to principal or interest. See 17 CFR
240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F). Paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(H) of Rule 15c3-1, as amended, retains the non-credit rating
conditions that the preferred stock must rank prior to all other classes of stock of the same issuer and not be
in arrears as to dividends. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(H). See also 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vii)
(establishing a 100% deduction for securities for which there is no ready market).

creditworthiness of a security or money market instrument can change over time and,
consequently, a position that has only a minimal amount of credit risk at one point in time may
not retain that status.
In the proposing release, the Commission requested comment on how often a brokerdealer should be required to update its assessments. 89 The Commission received one comment
in response to this request. 90 The commenter stated that the frequency of review “should be a
function of a number of factors, including, e.g., the size and purpose of the broker-dealer’s
position in the fixed-income security, the volatility of business conditions within the relevant
industry, the amount of fixed-income securities issued, and the frequency with which the
securities trade.” 91 The Commission generally agrees with the commenter that the frequency of
review should depend on a variety factors such as those identified by the commenter. However,
as discussed above, the requirement for a broker-dealer to maintain its required minimum
amount of net capital is moment-to-moment. Consequently, a broker-dealer’s policies and
procedures for assessing whether an issuance of commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, or
preferred stock has only a minimal amount of credit risk must include a process that is designed
to ensure that its credit determinations are current, and address the frequency with which the
broker-dealer reviews and reassesses its credit determinations. For example, a broker-dealer’s
policies and procedures could require more frequent reassessments in the case of securities or
money market instruments that are close to the line between having only a minimal amount of
credit risk and having a greater level of credit risk or that are subject to macroeconomic
conditions or issuer specific events that could have an impact on credit risk. In addition, a higher

haircut must be taken when a security or money market instrument no longer has only a minimal
amount of credit risk. The Commission expects that a broker-dealer’s process for monitoring its
credit determinations will be customized to the size and activities of the firm to ensure that it
maintains the required amount of net capital at “all times.” 92
The Commission also modified the proposed rule text relating to policies and procedures
by including in new paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(I) of Rule 15c3-1 the qualifier that the policies and
procedures must be “reasonably designed” for the purpose of assessing creditworthiness. 93 As
noted above, one commenter raised a concern that Commission and SRO examiners would
“second guess” broker-dealer credit assessments and stated that the regulatory focus on
compliance with the rule should be on the “reasonableness” of a firm’s policies and procedures
for assessing creditworthiness. 94 The Commission agrees that the starting point for reviewing
whether a firm is in compliance with the amendments should be to evaluate the reasonableness
of the firm’s policies and procedures in light of the firm’s circumstances (e.g., the size of the
broker-dealer and the types and sizes of the positions typically held by the broker-dealer). In this
regard, the policies and procedures must specify with sufficient detail the steps the broker-dealer
will take in performing a credit assessment so that Commission and SRO examiners can evaluate
them.
However, the Commission also modified the final rule to add new text that provides that
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed “should result in assessments of
creditworthiness that typically are consistent with market data.” 95 In particular, this standard for

evaluating the reasonableness of a broker-dealer’s policies and procedures will require examiners
to compare market data (e.g., external factors such as credit spreads or yields) with the brokerdealer’s determinations that a security or money market instrument has only a minimal amount
of credit risk. This provision is designed to address concerns raised by commenters that the
proposed minimal amount of credit risk standard was too subjective. 96 Commenters raised
concerns about requiring the use of a subjective standard because, among other things, it presents
an inherent conflict of interest, is complicated, could reduce liquidity, and could result in
uncertainty on the part of market participants. 97 Requiring a broker-dealer’s policies and
procedures to produce credit risk determinations that typically are consistent with market data
should mitigate concerns about potential consequences of the subjectivity inherent in the final
rule. Furthermore, as explained throughout this release, a broker-dealer can make its credit risk
determination pursuant to policies and procedures that specify the use of a small number of
objective factors and, if a broker-dealer avails itself of this option, it should help the brokerdealer create a less-complicated methodology that aligns with market data, therefore easing the
concerns of commenters.
Notwithstanding the reasonableness of a broker-dealer’s policies and procedures,
examiners may still question a broker-dealer’s credit risk determination, and are particularly
likely to question a determination related to large concentrated positions or that is not consistent
with market data. In addition, if a broker-dealer incorrectly determines pursuant to paragraph
(c)(2)(vi)(I) of Rule 15c3-1 that a security has only a minimal amount of credit risk, the brokerdealer could be in violation of Rule 15c3-1 to the extent the appropriate larger haircut would put

20

the broker-dealer below the required minimum amount of net capital. 98 Thus, a broker-dealer
would need to be able to support each credit determination it makes in the context of a
Commission or SRO examination. If the broker-dealer’s determination that a position has only a
minimal amount of credit risk is not consistent with market data, that result would not
necessarily be dispositive that the position is not entitled to the lower haircut. However, the
broker-dealer would have a high burden to demonstrate to examiners that the position has only a
minimal amount of credit risk.
When assessing whether a security or money market instrument has only a minimal
amount of credit risk for purposes of Rule 15c3-1, a broker-dealer could consider pursuant to the
policies and procedures it establishes, documents, maintains, and enforces the following factors,
to the extent appropriate:
•

Credit spreads (i.e., whether it is possible to demonstrate that a position in commercial
paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock has only a minimal amount of credit risk
based on the spread between the security’s yield and the yield on Treasury or other
securities, or based on the spreads of credit default swaps that reference the security or
money market instrument);

•

Securities-related research (i.e., whether providers of research about securities or money
market instruments believe the issuer of the security or money market instrument will be
able to meet its financial commitments, generally, or specifically, with respect to
securities or money market instruments held by the broker-dealer);

•

98

Internal or external credit risk assessments (i.e., whether credit assessments developed

Calculating a haircut incorrectly also could cause the broker-dealer to file incorrect reports with the
Commission under Rule 17a-5. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5 (requiring broker-dealers to periodically file
financial reports that, among other things, contain computations of net capital).

21

internally by the broker-dealer or externally by a credit rating agency, irrespective of its
status as an NRSRO, express a view as to the credit risk associated with a particular
security or money market instrument of the issuer thereof);
•

Default statistics (i.e., whether providers of credit information relating to securities or
money market instruments express a view that specific securities or money market
instruments (or their issuers) have a probability of default consistent with other securities
or money market instruments that have only a minimal amount of credit risk);

•

Inclusion in an index (i.e., whether a security, money market instrument, or the issuer of a
security or money market instrument, is included as a component of a recognized index
of instruments that have only a minimal amount of credit risk);

•

Enhancements and priorities (i.e., the extent to which a security or money market
instrument is covered by credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization and reserve
accounts, or has priority under applicable bankruptcy or creditors’ rights provisions);

•

Price, yield and/or volume (i.e., whether the price and yield of a security or money
market instrument or a credit default swap that references the security or money market
instrument are consistent with other securities or money market instruments that the
broker-dealer has determined have only a minimal amount of credit risk and whether the
price resulted from active trading); and

•

Asset class-specific factors (e.g., in the case of structured finance products, the quality of
the underlying assets).
The Commission does not intend this list of factors to be exhaustive or mutually

exclusive. For example, other factors may be appropriate for assessing creditworthiness and, in
particular, whether a position has only a minimal amount of credit risk.
22

As noted above, several commenters identified additional factors that they believe would
be appropriate for purposes of assessing whether a security or money market instrument has only
a minimal amount of credit risk and one commenter suggested making certain factors
mandatory. 99 Some of these factors, such as the term to maturity of the security or money
market instrument, are already factored into Rule 15c3-1 and therefore do not need to be
specifically added to the list. 100 The Commission does not believe other factors should be added
because the list is not meant to be exhaustive and broker-dealers should tailor their policies and
procedures for assessing credit risk to their particular circumstances and specify in their policies
and procedures those factors they deem appropriate, which may include factors that are not on
the list above. 101 In addition, the Commission recognizes that a broker-dealer’s policies and
procedures may specify the use of different factors, different sets of factors, or different
combinations of factors depending on the characteristics of the security or money market
instrument being assessed, the amount of time the broker-dealer intends to hold the position, and
the size of the position, among other things. Further, the Commission does not expect that in
order for a broker-dealer’s policies and procedures to be “reasonably designed” that they must
specify the use of every factor, or any particular factor, on the list. Certain factors, such as credit
spreads, may not be applicable for bonds that are thinly traded. Thus, mandating that factor, or
any other factor, would not necessarily help a broker-dealer make a creditworthiness
determination. Instead, each broker-dealer should analyze its unique situation when designing its
99

the nature of the issuer, the terms of the security, and the financial and regulatory context in which the
issuer is operating); Id. at 3 (“the use of credit spreads and/or inclusion of an index should be the objective
standard used to determine creditworthiness of these securities”); CFA Institute Letter, at 4 (suggesting the
addition of “term to maturity” and “concentration of credit risk” as factors on the list).

policies and procedures, including, for example, its size, the amount of proprietary trading by the
broker-dealer in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock, and the size and
characteristics of the positions the firm typically holds, among other things.
Under the amendments, a broker-dealer must apply a higher deduction, such as the 15%
“catchall” haircut, on a proprietary position in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and
preferred stock if the firm determines the security has more than a minimal amount of credit risk
or the firm opts not to have policies and procedures to assess the creditworthiness of the class of
security or money market instrument. 102 Moreover, if the commercial paper, nonconvertible
debt, or preferred stock held by the broker-dealer does not trade in a ready market, the brokerdealer must apply a 100% haircut irrespective of the firm’s credit risk determination. 103
Under today’s amendments, and consistent with the proposed amendments, a brokerdealer must preserve for a period of not less than three years, the first two years in an easily
accessible place, the policies and procedures that the broker-dealer establishes, documents,
maintains, and enforces for assessing and monitoring the credit risk of commercial paper,
nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock. This requirement is codified in new paragraph (b)(13)
of Rule 17a-4. 104

102

See paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(I) of Rule 15c3-1, as amended; 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(J). If a broker-dealer
chooses to apply the net capital deduction under paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(J) of Rule 15c3-1 instead of making
an assessment of the creditworthiness of each security, the broker-dealer will not be required to have
policies and procedures to assess a security’s creditworthiness for purposes of applying the haircuts
prescribed in paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(E), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(1), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(2), or (c)(2)(vi)(H) of Rule 15c3-1.

103

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vii). As noted above, the term ready market is defined in Rule 15c3-1 as “a
market in which there exists independent bona fide offers to buy and sell so that a price reasonably related
to the last sales price or current bona fide competitive bid and offer quotations can be determined for a
particular security almost instantaneously and where payment will be received in settlement of a sale at
such price within a relatively short time conforming to trade custom.” 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(11).

104

See paragraph (b)(13) of Rule 17a-4, as amended.

24

The amendments do not require a broker-dealer to maintain a record of each of its credit
risk determinations for purposes of Rule 15c3-1. 105 However, a broker-dealer would need to be
able to support each of its credit risk determinations both for internal risk management purposes
and in the context of a Commission or SRO examination. A broker-dealer should maintain
documentation of its credit risk determinations for this purpose. Alternatively, a firm that
maintains or can access the data, information, and inputs used to make a credit risk determination
could be in a position to replicate the original credit risk determination using the same process,
information, and inputs employed to make the original determination. 106 For example, if a
broker-dealer uses market data to assess creditworthiness, it should be able to access information
showing the data as of the date the credit risk determination was made. 107 A broker-dealer that
uses a model with multiple inputs should be able to replicate the model output upon request or
maintain a record of the model output as of the date of the original credit risk determination.
The Commission recognizes that requiring a broker-dealer to make and maintain a record
of each credit risk determination, as suggested by one commenter, 108 may help facilitate
examinations of broker-dealers, but the Commission believes at this time that requiring brokerdealers to maintain a record of every credit risk determination could be burdensome in light of
the benefits expected to be obtained. For example, a broker-dealer may make multiple
determinations while assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of a particular security. If

105

Paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 17a-4 provides, in pertinent part, that a broker-dealer shall preserve for a period of
not less than three years (the first two years in an easily accessible place) all trial balances and
computations of aggregate indebtedness and net capital (and working papers in connection therewith). See
17 CFR 240.17a-4(b)(5). Working papers relating to credit risk determinations made for the purposes of
computing net capital under Rule 15c3-1 will need to be preserved under this provision of Rule 17a-4. Id.

106

See SIFMA Letter, at 22.

107

Although not required by today’s amendments, a broker-dealer could choose to keep a record of the market
data it used to make the creditworthiness determination.

108

See Better Markets Letter, at 7-8.

25

the broker-dealer reaches the same result time after time showing that the security in question
has only a minimal amount of credit risk, the benefits of keeping every determination for three
years, when the broker-dealer has the ability to replicate the relevant determination for an
examiner, could create costs that provide little benefits, given the examiner will have access to
the replicated credit risk determinations. Furthermore, if market data and other external factors
(e.g., external credit assessments and analysis), strongly support the broker-dealer’s assessment
that a security has only a minimal amount of credit risk, retaining a record of the credit risk
determination may not provide any incremental benefit to examiners. A broker-dealer that can
replicate through application of its policies and procedures its original analysis to explain the
basis of a credit risk determination should be in a position to demonstrate to examiners whether it
is following its policies and procedures, and whether those policies and procedures are
reasonably designed and effective in producing credit assessments that typically are consistent
with market data.
The Commission is cognizant of the potential conflict of interest inherent in a
requirement that relies to some extent on the subjective judgment of the broker-dealer to
determine whether a lower haircut should apply to a commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, or
preferred stock position, as noted by some commenters. 109 For example, a broker-dealer may
want to hold securities with higher yields to earn more interest but at the same time apply lower
haircuts to the positions to increase its net capital. This could bias the broker-dealer’s credit
assessment towards finding the security has only a minimal amount of credit risk. As an initial
matter, if a broker-dealer incorrectly determines a position has only a minimal amount of credit
risk and applies a lower haircut, it could lead to the firm failing to maintain the minimum amount

109

26

of required net capital in violation of the rule. As discussed above, the final rule provides that
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed should result in assessments of
creditworthiness that typically are consistent with market data. 110 This provides objective
benchmarks (i.e., market data) to use to evaluate the broker-dealer’s policies and procedures. If
a broker-dealer has policies and procedures in place that are reasonably designed under the rule,
and those policies and procedures are followed, the potential for bias to be a part of the
assessment process should be mitigated. The Commission also expects that this potential
conflict of interest will be mitigated by the Commission and SRO examination process, during
which Commission and SRO examiners will review the reasonableness of broker-dealers’
policies and procedures, the assessments that result from those policies and procedures, and the
firms’ adherence to the policies and procedures. 111
The Commission also is aware of the likelihood that broker-dealers may reach different
conclusions when assessing whether a particular position has only a minimal amount of credit
risk, 112 or may reach conclusions that are contrary to market data. The Commission expects that
Commission and SRO staff will examine for these types of differences and raise questions when
a broker-dealer consistently determines that positions have only a minimal amount of credit risk
notwithstanding the fact that external benchmarks (e.g., market data) in the factors listed above
indicate otherwise. A determination that a position has only a minimal amount of credit risk that
is contrary to some market data points and factors would not necessarily mean that the brokerdealer has failed to comply with the rule, but the broker-dealer would have a higher hurdle to

110

See paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(I) of Rule 15c3-1, as amended.

111

As noted above, broker-dealers that do not keep detailed records of their credit risk determinations can

overcome to demonstrate that its credit risk determination is correct. The Commission also notes
that if a broker-dealer determines that a security or money market instrument has only a minimal
amount of credit risk when the position actually does not meet that standard, and applies a lower
haircut, the broker-dealer’s net capital may be less than its minimum net capital requirement in
which case the broker-dealer would be in violation of the rule. 113
The Commission understands, as noted by commenters, that the amount of resources
broker-dealers can allocate toward making assessments of creditworthiness for purposes of Rule
15c3-1 will differ across broker-dealers and expects that this difference will be reflected in the
policies and procedures for assessing creditworthiness established by the firms. 114 For example,
a small broker-dealer may not have the resources to support a credit risk department comprised
of analysts that perform internal credit assessments. In this case, the firm may establish a
process for assessing creditworthiness that relies more on external factors, such as credit spreads,
default statistics, and credit analysis. A broker-dealer with a large portfolio of debt securities
may instead use an internal approach for assessing creditworthiness, which takes into
consideration a multitude of factors, such as default probabilities, expected and unexpected
losses, time effects, default correlations, and loss distributions, among other things. The
Commission also anticipates that some broker-dealers, particularly those that hold few positions,
may elect not to devote resources toward performing credit risk analysis and maintaining policies
and procedures, and instead will apply a greater haircut to their proprietary positions in
commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock, as permitted by the rule.
Finally, as discussed above, a broker-dealer (rather than its parent or an affiliate) must
113

As noted above, applying an incorrect haircut also could cause the broker-dealer to file incorrect reports
with the Commission under Rule 17a-5. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5 (requiring broker-dealers to periodically
file financial reports that, among other things, contain computations of net capital).

establish, document, maintain, and enforce the policies and procedures for assessing whether a
position has only a minimal amount of credit risk. 115 This does not mean that a broker-dealer
cannot incorporate into its own policies and procedures the credit policies and procedures used
by its parent or an affiliate. However, the broker-dealer must establish, document, maintain, and
enforce its own policies and procedures and apply them itself in making creditworthiness
determinations. It may not simply rely on determinations made by its parent or an affiliate.

Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1
i.

Proposal

Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1 permits broker-dealers to employ a standardized theoretical
option pricing model to determine a potential loss for a portfolio of listed options positions and
related positions to compute a single haircut for the group of positions. 116 Under Appendix A, a
broker-dealer groups the options and related positions in a portfolio and stresses the current market
price for each position at various equidistant points along a range of positive and negative
potential future market movements, using an approved theoretical option pricing model that
satisfies certain conditions specified in the rule. 117 Positions that have more potential price
volatility must be stressed across a wider range of positive and negative potential future market
movements than positions with lower price volatility. 118 For example, a broker-dealer other than
a non-clearing option specialist or market maker must employ a range of potential future market
movements for major market foreign currencies of (+/-) 6%, whereas the range for all other

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1a(b)(1). Broker-dealers also may elect a strategy-based methodology. See 17 CFR

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1a(b)(1). Presently, there is only one theoretical options pricing model that has been
approved for this purpose.

foreign currencies is (+/-) 20%. 119 Thus, major market foreign currency options receive more
favorable treatment than options on all other currencies when using theoretical option pricing
models to compute net capital deductions.120
Prior to today’s amendments, the rule defined the term major market foreign currency to
mean “the currency of a sovereign nation whose short term debt is rated in one of the two highest
categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and for which there is
a substantial inter-bank forward currency market.” 121 Further, the rule provided that “the European
Currency Unit (ECU) shall be deemed a major market foreign currency.” 122
With respect to the definition of major market foreign currency, the Commission
proposed to remove the phrase “whose short-term debt is rated in one of the two highest
categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.” 123 The proposed
change would modify the definition to include foreign currencies only “for which there is a
substantial inter-bank forward currency market.” 124 The Commission also proposed to eliminate
the specific reference in the rule to the European Currency Unit (“ECU”), which was the only
currency explicitly identified in the rule as a major market foreign currency for the purposes of
Appendix A. 125 As the Commission stated in the proposing release, because of the establishment
of the euro as the official currency of the euro-zone, a specific reference to the ECU was no

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1a(b)(1)(iii)(B) through (C). A broker-dealer that is a non-clearing option specialist

necessary, as it is a foreign currency with a substantial inter-bank forward currency market. 127
ii.

Comments

The Commission received two comment letters in response to its request for comment. 128
One commenter supported the proposed definition of the term major market foreign currency,
stating that “the proposed definition is sufficient to allow broker-dealers to determine what
currencies are ‘major market foreign currencies.’” 129 Both commenters stated that the
Commission should create a list of major market foreign currencies and update it periodically to
clarify the new definition in Appendix A. 130 One commenter suggested that if the Commission
chooses not to create a list of major market foreign currencies, it should propose an alternative
measure of creditworthiness and define the term as one where the currency is issued by a nation
whose sovereign debt presents “minimal credit risk.” 131
iii.

Final Rule

For the reasons described below, the Commission is adopting the amendments to
Appendix A as proposed. 132 Specifically, the Commission is removing from the definition of
major market foreign currency the phrase “whose short-term debt is rated in one of the two

highest categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.” 133 The
change modifies the definition to include foreign currencies only “for which there is a substantial
inter-bank forward currency market.” 134 Also, the Commission is eliminating the specific
reference in the rule to the ECU, which was identified, by rule, as the only major market foreign
currency for the purposes of Appendix A. 135 As the Commission noted in the proposing release,
specific reference to the ECU is no longer needed because the euro has been established as the
official currency of the euro-zone. 136 Further, the specific reference to the euro is not necessary
as it is a foreign currency with a substantial inter-bank forward currency market, consistent with
the rule as amended.
In order to retain a degree of flexibility, the Commission is not codifying in the rule a list
of currencies that meet the definition of major market foreign currency though some commenters
requested such a list. However, broker-dealers may treat a foreign currency as a major market
foreign currency for the purposes of Appendix A if the currency is a major foreign currency for
purposes of applying a 6% (rather than 20%) haircut under Rule 15c3-1. Currently, under a staff
interpretation, broker-dealers are subject to a 6% (rather than 20%) unhedged currency risk
exposure haircut on foreign currency balances and positions in the euro, the British pound, the
Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the Japanese yen. 137 The Commission believes the staff

interpretation identifies currencies that all meet the definition of major market foreign currency
for the purposes of Appendix A as they all have a substantial inter-bank forward currency
market. Consequently, broker-dealers may treat these currencies as major market foreign
currencies under Appendix A. By treating these currencies as major market foreign currencies,
the haircuts applicable to foreign currencies under Rule 15c3-1 are more closely aligned with the
haircuts applicable to options on the same foreign currencies under Appendix A. 138 Given this
interpretation identifying certain foreign currencies that meet the definition of major market
foreign currency, the Commission believes it has addressed the concern raised by one commenter
that, in the absence of a list, the Commission should define the term as one where the currency is
issued by a nation whose sovereign debt presents minimal credit risk. 139
c.

Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1
i.

Proposal

Certain broker-dealers (“ANC broker-dealers”) are approved by the Commission to use
internal value-at-risk (“VaR”) models to determine market risk charges for proprietary securities
and derivatives positions and to take a credit risk charge in lieu of a 100% charge for unsecured
receivables related to OTC derivatives transactions. 140 Specifically, under Appendix E to Rule

138

Treating the option consistently with the instrument underlying the option is supported by Appendix A.
For example, under Appendix A, the range of potential future market movements that must be employed
for a portfolio of equity positions with a ready market is (+/-) 15%. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1a(b)(1)(iii)(A).
Under Rule 15c3-1, the haircut that must be applied to an equity security with a ready market is 15%. See
17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(J).

139

See Better Markets Letter, at 9.

140

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(7); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1e. As part of the application to use internal models, an
entity seeking to become an ANC broker-dealer must identify the types of positions it intends to include in
its model calculation. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1e(a)(1)(iii). After approval, an ANC broker-dealer must
obtain Commission approval to make a material change to the model, including a change to the types of
positions included in the model. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1e(a)(8). An ANC broker-dealer must maintain
minimum tentative net capital of at least $1 billion and minimum net capital of at least $500 million. See 17
CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(7)(i). The Commission has proposed raising these requirements to $5 billion and $1
billion, respectively. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers

33

15c3-1, ANC broker-dealers are permitted to add back to net worth uncollateralized receivables
from counterparties arising from OTC derivatives transactions (i.e., they can add back the
amount of the uncollateralized current exposure). 141 Instead of the 100% deduction that applies
to most unsecured receivables under Rule 15c3-1, ANC broker-dealers are permitted to take a
credit risk charge based on the uncollateralized credit exposure to the counterparty. 142 In most
cases, the credit risk charge is significantly less than a 100% deduction, since it is a percentage
of the amount of the receivable that otherwise would be deducted in full. ANC broker-dealers
are permitted to use this approach because they are required to implement processes for
analyzing credit risk to OTC derivative counterparties and to develop mathematical models for
estimating credit exposures arising from OTC derivatives transactions.
Under Appendix E, the credit risk charge is the sum of three calculated amounts: (1) a
counterparty exposure charge; (2) a concentration charge if the current exposure to a single
counterparty exceeds certain thresholds; and (3) a portfolio concentration charge if aggregate
current exposure to all counterparties exceeds certain thresholds. 143 The first component of the
credit risk charge is the counterparty exposure charge. 144 The exposure charge for a given
counterparty (other than a counterparty that is insolvent, in a bankruptcy proceeding, or in
default of an obligation on its senior debt) is the credit equivalent amount of the ANC broker-

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1e(c); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(7). The Commission has proposed narrowing this

commercial end users arising from security-based swaps (i.e., uncollateralized receivables from other types
of counterparties would be subject to the 100% deduction from net worth). See Capital, Margin, and

dealer’s exposure to the counterparty multiplied by an applicable credit risk weight factor and
then multiplied by 8%. 145 The credit equivalent amount is the sum of the ANC broker-dealer’s:
(1) maximum potential exposure (“MPE”) to the counterparty multiplied by a back-testing
determined factor; and (2) current exposure to the counterparty. 146 The MPE amount is a charge
to address potential future exposure and is calculated using the ANC broker-dealer’s VaR model
as applied to the counterparty’s positions after giving effect to a netting agreement with the
counterparty, taking into account collateral received from the counterparty, and taking into
account the current replacement value of the counterparty’s positions. 147 The current exposure
amount is the current replacement value of the counterparty’s positions after giving effect to a
netting agreement with the counterparty and taking into account collateral received from the
counterparty. 148 The counterparty exposure charge is the sum of the MPE and current exposure
amounts multiplied by an applicable credit risk weight factor and then multiplied by 8%. 149
Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1 prescribes three standardized credit risk weight factors (20%, 50%,
and 150%) for transactions with counterparties and, as an alternative, permits an ANC brokerdealer with Commission approval to use internal methodologies to determine appropriate credit
risk weights to apply to counterparties. 150 A higher percentage credit risk weight factor results in
a larger counterparty exposure charge amount. Prior to today’s amendments, ANC brokerdealers were permitted to use NRSRO credit ratings or internally derived credit ratings to
determine the appropriate risk weight factor.

The Commission proposed removing paragraphs (c)(4)(vi)(A) through (c)(4)(vi)(D) of
Appendix E, which specify the appropriate risk weight factor of counterparties based on NRSRO
credit ratings. 151 Consequently, under the proposal, an ANC broker-dealer would need to
determine credit risk charges using internal credit ratings or to take a 100% capital charge with
respect to the exposure to the counterparty. 152 By removing the option to use NRSRO credit
ratings, a broker-dealer that applies to use the approach set forth in Appendix E would need to
describe how it will determine the applicable counterparty credit risk charge based on internal
credit ratings as part of its initial application to the Commission. 153
ii.

Comments

The Commission received two comments in response to its request for comment. 154 One
commenter supported the proposed removal of NRSRO credit ratings as an option but raised two
concerns. 155 The commenter stated first that an internal model may not take into account
concentration of risk with a specific counterparty, and second that ANC firms will apply low risk
weights to all but the most illiquid instruments. 156
Another commenter suggested that the factors listed in the proposing release with respect
to determining creditworthiness under Rule 15c3-1 should become part of Appendix E. 157 This

determination should be explicitly stated in the rule. 158
iii.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting the amendments to Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1 as
proposed. 159 The amendments remove paragraphs (c)(4)(vi)(A) through (c)(4)(vi)(D) of
Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1, which specify the appropriate risk weight factor based on NRSRO
credit ratings. 160 By removing the provisions utilizing NRSRO credit ratings, the final rule
requires an ANC broker-dealer to determine the appropriate risk weight factor using internal
credit ratings or to take a 100% capital charge with respect to the exposure to the counterparty. 161
All ANC broker-dealers calculate credit risk charges using internal credit ratings (rather
than using NRSRO credit ratings approach) or take a 100% capital charge with respect to the
exposure to the counterparty risk. 162 Consequently, removing the option to use NRSRO credit
ratings will not have an immediate effect on these broker-dealers. A broker-dealer that applies to
become an ANC broker-dealer will need to describe how it will determine internal credit ratings
for the purpose of determining the applicable credit charges for counterparty risk in its
application to the Commission.
In taking this action, the Commission has considered the views of commenters 163 and
determined that whether a model adequately considers risks associated with a counterparty or a

specific instrument is a concern that should be addressed during the initial review of the ANC
broker-dealer’s model, as well as during the monitoring and examination of the firm. 164 The
amendments also do not incorporate the minimal amount of credit risk standard from Rule 15c31 into Appendix E, as suggested by one commenter. 165 This standard is replacing a binary
NRSRO credit rating standard under which the application of a lower or higher haircut amount
depends on whether the commercial paper is rated in the top three rating categories and the
nonconvertible debt and preferred stock is rated in the top four rating categories. Consequently,
a given instrument either meets the requirement to apply a lower haircut amount or is subject to
the higher amount. The NRSRO credit rating standard in Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1 is not
binary in that there are three different credit risk weights (20%, 50%, and 150%) that are
determined by three different levels of credit rating: the two highest rating categories; the third
and fourth highest rating categories; and below the fourth highest rating. Thus, the minimal
amount of credit risk standard would not be a suitable replacement for the NRSRO credit ratings
standard because the minimal amount of credit risk standard, as drafted for Rule 15c3-1, would
apply only to the second gradation (the third and fourth highest rating categories). 166
In addition, as stated throughout this release, the Commission has determined not to
mandate that a broker-dealer use any specific factor in its credit analysis. Consequently, the
Commission does not believe it would be appropriate to codify the list of factors in the rule as
suggested by one commenter.

Similar to ANC broker-dealers, a type of limited purpose broker-dealer that deals solely
in OTC derivatives (an “OTC derivatives dealer”) is permitted, with Commission approval, to
calculate net capital using internal models as the basis for taking market risk and credit risk
charges in lieu of the standardized haircuts for classes of positions for which they have been
approved to use VaR models. 167 Specifically, under Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1, OTC
derivatives dealers are permitted to add back to net worth uncollateralized receivables from
counterparties arising from OTC derivatives transactions (i.e., they can add back the amount of
the uncollateralized current exposure). Instead of the 100% deduction that applies to most
unsecured receivables under Rule 15c3-1, OTC derivatives dealers are permitted to take a credit
risk charge based on counterparty factors and concentration charges. 168 In most cases, the
counterparty factors and concentration charges are significantly less than a 100% deduction,
since the charges are a percentage of the amount of the receivable that otherwise would be
deducted in full. OTC derivatives dealers are permitted to use this approach because they are
required to implement processes for analyzing credit risk to OTC derivative counterparties and to
develop mathematical models for estimating credit exposures arising from OTC derivative
transactions.

167

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(5); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1f. As part of the application to use internal models, an
entity seeking to become an OTC derivatives dealer must identify the types of positions it intends to
include in its model calculation. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1f(a)(1)(ii). After approval, an OTC derivatives
dealer must obtain Commission approval to make a material change to the model, including a change to the
types of positions included in the model. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-f(a)(3). OTC derivatives dealers are
exempt from certain broker-dealer requirements, including membership in an SRO (17 CFR 240.15b9-2),
broker-dealer margin rules (17 CFR 240.36a1-1), and application of the Securities Investor Protection Act
of 1970 (17 CFR 240.36a1-2). OTC derivatives dealers are subject to special requirements, including
limitations on the scope of their securities activities (17 CFR 240.15a-1), specified internal risk
management control systems (17 CFR 240.15c3-4), recordkeeping obligations (17 CFR 240.17a-3(a)(10)),
and reporting responsibilities (17 CFR 240.17a-12). They are also subject to alternative net capital
treatment (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(5)). See 17 CFR 240.15a-1, Preliminary Note. The minimum net capital
requirements for an OTC derivatives dealer are tentative net capital of at least $100 million and net capital
of at least $20 million. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(5) and (c)(15).

168

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1f(d); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(5).

39

Under Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1, OTC derivatives dealers are required to deduct from
their net capital credit risk charges that take counterparty risk into consideration. 169 This charge
has two parts and is computed on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis. First, for each
counterparty with an investment or speculative grade rating, an OTC derivatives dealer must take
a net capital charge equal to the net replacement value in the account of the counterparty (“net
replacement value”) multiplied by 8%, and further multiplied by a counterparty factor. 170 As
part of this deduction, the OTC derivatives dealer must apply a counterparty risk weight factor of
either 20%, 50%, or 100%. 171 Prior to today’s amendments, the counterparty risk weight factor
(i.e., 20%, 50%, or 100%) was determined using either NRSRO credit ratings or the firm’s
internal credit ratings. 172
The second part of the credit risk charge consists of a concentration charge that applies
when the net replacement value in the account of any one counterparty exceeds 25% of the OTC
derivatives dealer’s tentative net capital. 173 The concentration charge increases in relation to the
OTC derivatives dealer’s exposure to lower rated counterparties. 174 Prior to today’s
amendments, this concentration charge was also determined using either NRSRO credit ratings
or the firm’s internal credit ratings. Currently, OTC derivatives dealers do not use NRSRO
credit ratings to determine their counterparty factors and concentration charges.

173

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1f(d)(3).

174

For counterparties that are highly rated, the concentration charge equals 5% of the amount of the net
replacement value in excess of 25% of the OTC derivatives dealer’s tentative net capital. 17 CFR
240.15c3-1f(d)(3)(i). The concentration charge for counterparties with ratings among the lowest rating
categories would equal 50% of the amount of the net replacement value in excess of 25% of the OTC
derivatives dealer’s tentative net capital. 17 CFR 240.15c3-1f(d)(3)(iii).

40

The Commission proposed to amend paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii),
and (d)(4) of Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1, which permit the use of NRSRO ratings (as an
alternative to internal credit ratings) to determine an OTC derivatives dealer’s counterparty
factors and concentration charges. Because the proposal would eliminate the option to use
NRSRO credit ratings, a broker-dealer that applies to become an OTC derivatives dealer and
operate under Appendix F will need, as part of its initial application, to request Commission
approval to use internal credit ratings (as the option to use NRSRO credit ratings is being
eliminated). The OTC derivatives dealer would need to describe how it will determine the
applicable counterparty factors and concentration charges as part of its initial application to the
Commission.
As part of its proposal, the Commission also proposed conforming amendments to the
General Instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part IIB. This form constitutes the basic financial and
operational report OTC derivatives dealers are required to file with the Commission. Under the
heading “Computation of Net Capital and Required Net Capital,” the Commission proposed
making conforming changes to the section “Credit risk exposure.” This section instructs an OTC
derivatives dealer on how to compute the counterparty credit risk charges for purposes of the
dealer’s net capital computation. The proposed amendments to the instructions would eliminate
references to NRSRO credit ratings for purposes of determining these charges.
ii.

Comments

The Commission received two comments in response to its request for comment. 175 One
commenter suggested that the Commission require OTC derivatives dealers to use counterparty
factors similar to those proposed under Appendix E discussed above (e.g., 20%, 50% or 150%

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 76 FR at 26556.

risk weights based on internal credit ratings to determine capital deductions) and argued against
requiring OTC derivatives dealers to reapply to the Commission to use internal credit ratings. 176
This commenter also expressed concern that an OTC derivatives dealer’s internal model may not
take into account concentration of risk with a specific counterparty. 177
The second commenter suggested that the Commission “supply an appropriate alternative
standard of creditworthiness that derivatives dealers must apply” such as “an explicit set of
factors that will appropriately gauge the credit risk associated with counterparties in derivatives
transactions.” 178
iii.

Final Rule

The Commission is adopting the amendments to Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1 as
proposed. 179 Specifically, the amendments remove the use of NRSRO credit ratings from
paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), and (d)(4) of Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1,
which, prior to today’s amendments, permitted the use of NRSRO ratings when determining
counterparty credit risk and concentration charges. 180 Because the amendments remove the
option to use NRSRO credit ratings, a broker-dealer that applies to become an OTC derivatives
dealer will need, as part of its initial application, to request Commission approval to use internal
credit ratings (as the option to use NRSRO credit ratings is being eliminated). The applicant will
need to describe how it will use internal credit ratings to determine the applicable credit risk
charges for counterparty risk in its application to the Commission. The current OTC derivatives

dealers will not need to seek new approval from the Commission.181
The Commission also is adopting the conforming amendments to the General Instructions
to Form X-17A-5, Part IIB as proposed.
Consistent with the discussion above relating to Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1, the
Commission has determined that whether a model adequately considers concentration risk with a
specific counterparty is a concern that is best addressed during the initial review of, or an
amendment to, an OTC derivatives dealer’s model as well as during the monitoring and
examination of the OTC derivatives dealer. 182 Further, as stated above, the current OTC
derivatives dealers do not use NRSRO ratings to compute the credit risk and concentration
charges under Appendix F. Thus, the amendments will not impact these firms.
The Commission is not adopting an alternative standard in the rule, such as the minimal
amount of credit risk standard. As discussed above, the minimal amount of credit risk standard
is replacing a binary NRSRO credit rating standard under which the application of a lower or
higher haircut amount depends on whether the commercial paper is rated in the top three rating
categories and the nonconvertible debt and preferred stock is rated in the top four rating
categories. Consequently, a given instrument either meets the requirement to apply a lower
haircut amount or is subject to the higher amount. The NRSRO credit rating standard in
Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1 is not binary in that there are three ranges of credit ratings to
determine the applicable risk weight factors and concentration charges: the two highest rating
categories; the third and fourth highest rating categories; and below the fourth highest rating
category. Thus, the minimal amount of credit risk standard would not be a suitable replacement
181

Currently, four firms are operating pursuant to Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1. These firms are: Credit Suisse
Capital LLC; Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P.; Merrill Lynch Financial Markets, Inc.; and Natixis
Derivatives Inc. Natixis Derivatives, Inc. filed a Form BDW on October 17, 2013.

182

See, e.g., 17 CFR 15c3-1f(a)(1)(ii); see also CFA Institute Letter, at 6.

43

for the credit risk charges required under Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1 because the minimal
amount of credit risk standard, as drafted for Rule 15c3-1, would apply only to the second range
(the third and fourth highest rating categories). 183
In addition, as stated throughout this release, the Commission has determined not to
mandate that a broker-dealer use any specific factor in its credit analysis; instead, each firm will
need to tailor its procedures for determining credit risk to the broker-dealer’s business model. 184
e.

Appendix G to Rule 15c3-1

Appendix G to Rule 15c3-1 provides that broker-dealers may use the ANC computation
only if their ultimate holding companies agree to provide the Commission with additional
information about the financial condition of the holding company and its affiliates. 185 Appendix
G is intended to provide the Commission with certain information to assess the financial and
operational health of the ultimate holding company and its potential impact on the risk exposure
of the broker-dealer. 186 Paragraph (a) of Appendix G sets forth a methodology for computing
allowable capital and allowances for market and credit risk at the consolidated holding company
level. One aspect of calculating credit risk in Appendix G provided that those firms must use
credit ratings in accordance with the applicable provisions of Appendix E. Since those
provisions in Appendix E are being deleted, the Commission proposed deleting the
corresponding references to those provisions in Appendix G. 187 Specifically, the Commission
proposed to delete references in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(F) of Appendix G that correspond to the

Appendix G that correspond to the provisions of Appendix E that the Commission is deleting as

Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3

Rule 15c3-3 (the “Customer Protection Rule”) under the Exchange Act is designed to
protect customer funds and securities held by broker-dealers. 192 To meet this objective, Rule
15c3-3 requires a broker-dealer that maintains custody of customer securities and cash (a
“carrying broker-dealer”) to take two primary steps to safeguard these assets. The steps are
designed to protect customers by segregating their securities and cash from the broker-dealer’s
proprietary business activities. If the broker-dealer fails financially, the securities and cash
should be readily available to be returned to the customers. In addition, if the failed brokerdealer is liquidated in a formal proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970,
the securities and cash should be isolated and readily identifiable as customer property and,
consequently, available to be distributed to customers ahead of other creditors. 193
The first step to safeguard customer assets under Rule 15c3-3 requires a carrying brokerdealer to maintain possession or control of all fully paid and excess margin securities of its

customers. 194 Physical possession or control means the broker-dealer must hold these securities
in one of several locations specified in Rule 15c3-3 and free of liens or any other interest that
could be exercised by a third party to secure an obligation of the broker-dealer. 195 Permissible
locations include a bank, as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act, and a clearing
agency. 196 A broker-dealer must make a daily determination of the amount of fully paid and
excess margin securities it holds for customers and compare it to the amount actually held in the
permissible locations in order to comply with this aspect of the rule. 197
The second step covers customer funds and requires that a carrying broker-dealer must
maintain a reserve of cash or qualified securities in one or more accounts at a bank that is at least
equal in value to the net cash owed to customers and the amount of cash obtained from the use of
customer securities. 198 The account must be titled “Special Account for the Exclusive Benefit of
Customers of the Broker-Dealer” (“customer reserve account”). 199 The amount of cash and/or
qualified securities that must be kept in the customer reserve account is computed pursuant to a
formula set forth in Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3. 200 Under the Exhibit A formula, the broker-dealer
adds customer credit items (e.g., cash in customer securities accounts) and then subtracts from
that amount customer debit items (e.g., margin loans). 201 If credit items exceed debit items, the
net amount must be on deposit in the customer reserve account in the form of cash and/or

qualified securities. 202 If the debits exceed credits, no deposit is necessary. Funds deposited in a
customer reserve account cannot be withdrawn until the broker-dealer completes another
computation that shows that the broker-dealer has on deposit more funds than the reserve
formula requires.
Under Note G to Exhibit A, a carrying broker-dealer may include margin collateral for
transactions in security futures products as a debit in its reserve formula computation if that
margin collateral is required and on deposit at a clearing agency or derivatives clearing
organization that meets at least one of four conditions: (1) the clearing agency or derivatives
clearing organization maintains the highest investment-grade rating from an NRSRO; (2) the
clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization maintains security deposits from clearing
members in connection with regulated options or futures transactions and assessment power over
member firms that equal a combined total of at least $2 billion, at least $500 million of which
must be in the form of security deposits; (3) the clearing agency or derivatives clearing
organization maintains at least $3 billion in margin deposits; or (4) the clearing agency or
derivatives clearing organization obtains an exemption from the Commission.
Margin collateral that is posted for customer positions in security futures products
constitutes an unsecured receivable from the clearing agency or derivatives clearing
organization. Therefore, requiring a clearing agency or a derivatives clearing organization to
meet certain minimum creditworthiness criteria before margin collateral deposited with that
entity may be included as a debit in a broker-dealer’s customer reserve formula is consistent with
the customer protection function of Rule 15c3-3 because the debit offsets any credits when
computing the customer reserve deposit requirement. Accordingly, this requirement is intended

202

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e).

47

to provide reasonable assurance that customer margin collateral deposited with a clearing agency
or derivatives clearing organization related to security futures products will be available to be
returned to the broker-dealer and, therefore, can serve as an appropriate offset to customer credits
in the reserve formula.
The Commission proposed to remove the first criterion described above (i.e., the highest
investment-grade rating from an NRSRO). 203 The criteria are disjunctive and, therefore, a
clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization needs to satisfy only one criterion to permit
a broker-dealer to treat posted customer margin collateral as a reserve formula debit. In the
proposing release, the Commission stated that the proposed amendment would not lessen the
protections for customer funds and securities. 204 While one potential criterion would be
removed, currently, only the Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC”) clears and accepts margin
on security futures products. The OCC qualifies under two of the other criteria in Note G. 205 If
at a later date another clearing entity accepts margin on security futures products, and it did not
meet one of the remaining criteria, a broker-dealer may request an exemption for that clearing
entity under Note G to Appendix A to Rule 15c3-3. 206 Thus, the proposed amendment does not
disqualify any current clearing entities, nor require a broker-dealer to obtain new clearing
memberships to comply with Rule 15c3-3.

At the end of 2012, OCC maintained $78.8 billion in margin deposits, well in excess of the $3 billion

member deposits, well in excess of the $500 million threshold set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of Note G.

The Commission may, in its sole discretion, grant such an exemption subject to such conditions as are
appropriate under the circumstances if the Commission determines that such conditional or unconditional
exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with the protection of
investors. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3a(b)(1)(iv), Note G.

Rule 10b-10
a.

Proposal

Rule 10b-10 under the Exchange Act, the Commission’s customer confirmation rule,
generally requires broker-dealers effecting transactions for customers in securities, other than
U.S. savings bonds or municipal securities, to provide those customers with a written
notification, at or before completion of the securities transaction, disclosing certain information
about the terms of the transaction. 207 This required disclosure includes, among other things, the
date, time, identity, and number of securities bought or sold; the capacity in which the brokerdealer acted (e.g., as agent or principal); yields on debt securities; and, under special
circumstances, the amount of compensation the broker-dealer will receive from the customer and
any other parties. 208 By requiring these disclosures, the rule serves a basic customer protection
function by conveying information that: (1) allows customers to verify the terms of their
transactions; (2) alerts customers to potential conflicts of interest; (3) acts as a safeguard against
fraud; and (4) allows customers a means of evaluating the costs of their transactions and the
quality of the broker-dealer’s execution.
The Commission proposed to delete paragraph (a)(8) from Rule 10b-10. 209 Paragraph
(a)(8), which the Commission adopted in 1994, requires a broker-dealer to inform the customer

209

See Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 76 FR at

paragraph (a)(9) of the rule, under which a broker-dealer that is not a member of the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation generally must disclose that fact, as paragraph (a)(8). Id. at 26564 n.89, 26576.

in the confirmation if a debt security, other than a government security, is unrated by an
NRSRO. 210 As explained when it was added to Rule 10b-10 in 1994, paragraph (a)(8) was
intended to alert customers to the potential need to obtain more information about a security
from a broker-dealer; it was not intended to suggest that an unrated security is inherently riskier
than a rated security. 211
The Commission had previously proposed, and re-proposed, the deletion of paragraph
(a)(8) from Rule 10b-10. 212 These previous proposals, however, were prompted by concerns
regarding the undue reliance on NRSRO ratings and confusion about the significance of those
ratings. Because paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 10b-10 does not refer to NRSRO ratings as a means of
determining creditworthiness, it arguably does not come strictly within section 939A.
Nevertheless, to the extent that the provision may focus investor attention on ratings issued by
NRSROs, as distinct from other items of information, the Commission believed deleting it would
be consistent with the intent of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Comments

The Commission received four comments regarding the proposed removal of paragraph
(a)(8) from Rule 10b-10. One commenter was supportive of the deletion, without providing any
additional comment. 213 Another commenter recommended that in place of the deletion, the

security.”).

proposed rules should require Rule 10b-10 confirmations to include information that would
ensure that investors understand the potential need to learn more about the debt securities that
they have acquired from their broker-dealers. 214 The commenter recommended requiring brokerdealers to inform investors that debt securities vary in terms of their creditworthiness; that
investors should understand the credit quality of the specific debt securities acquired through
their broker-dealer; and that credit quality can affect not only the value of the debt securities, but
also their liquidity and price stability. 215 In contrast, a third commenter believed that the
removal of paragraph (a)(8) serves no useful purpose, stating: “We do not see how requiring
disclosure of the absence of a credit rating in any way encourages greater reliance on credit
ratings.” 216 The commenter further recommended that if paragraph (a)(8) were deleted, the
Commission should not replace it with any further required disclosures. 217 A fourth commenter
recommended that paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 10b-10 should be retained. 218 The commenter stated
that, given that the types of securities that are unrated by NRSROs typically include small
offerings, the required broker-dealer disclosures may no longer signal to investors any need to
investigate the quality of the securities being purchased. 219 The commenter added that the
required notification that certain securities are unrated serves to encourage investors to evaluate
the securities in which they are investing without undermining the overall intent to eliminate
reliance upon ratings bestowed by NRSROs. 220

After careful consideration of the received comments, the Commission has decided to
delete paragraph (a)(8) from Rule 10b-10, as proposed. The Commission acknowledges that, to
some extent, the paragraph may have served the purpose for which it was added to the rule in
1994 by prompting investors to investigate or question a broker-dealer about the quality of
certain securities. Based on the comments received in response to the proposing release,
however, the Commission believes it is likely that the paragraph’s disclosure requirement has to
a greater extent added to investors’ undue reliance on credit ratings, and that the deletion of the
paragraph is consistent with the intent of section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to reduce reliance
on NRSRO credit ratings. In addition, requiring broker-dealers to use customer confirmations as
a means of providing investors with general information related to credit risk and debt securities
as suggested by commenters would not further paragraph (a)(8)’s purpose of flagging unrated
securities for more careful investor scrutiny. The paragraph was added to the rule to require
disclosure of information suggesting that investors may want to obtain more information about
certain unrated securities, not to “require that confirmations alert customers to the importance of
understanding the credit quality of a debt security and the impact of credit quality on the value,
resale, and price of such securities.” 221 The purpose of Rule 10b-10 is not to educate investors
about the characteristics of different kinds of securities in general, but rather, in the context of
particular transactions, convey information allowing investors to verify the terms of their
transactions, alert investors to potential conflicts of interest with their broker-dealers, deter and
prevent deceptive and fraudulent acts and practices, and assist customers in evaluating the costs

221

See Better Markets Letter, at 4.

52

and quality of services proved by broker-dealers in connection with the execution of their
securities transactions. 222
The Commission further notes, as it did in the proposing release, that after the deletion of
paragraph (a)(8), broker-dealers will not be prohibited from continuing to provide the
information currently required by paragraph (a)(8) on a voluntary basis. 223 If broker-dealers
believe that continuing to provide such information on confirmations would, for example, give
investors an incentive to carry out additional research on their debt securities, the broker-dealers
may continue to provide this disclosure at their discretion. 224 Also, in particular circumstances
they may believe that a reasonable investor likely would consider a security’s lack of a credit
rating significant.
After consideration of the comments received, the Commission is removing paragraph
(a)(8) and believes that it is unnecessary to replace the paragraph with any other disclosure
requirement. Although the Commission recognizes the potential benefit of requiring brokerdealers to remind investors of the varying creditworthiness of debt securities, the Commission
believes that such a requirement would be unnecessary given the other security-specific

See Confirmation of Transactions, at 59 FR 59613; Securities Confirmations, Exchange Act Release No.

223

See Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 76 FR at
26564. The Commission understands that, as a practical matter, broker-dealers will likely not reprogram
their systems solely to remove the information even though the legal obligation to include it has been
eliminated. Rather, it is anticipated that firms may choose to make the change at a later date as part of a
larger reprogramming initiative.

224

Based on a limited review of customer confirmations, the Commission understands that some brokerdealers currently disclose NRSRO ratings for rated securities even though this information is not required
by paragraph (a)(8).

III.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
Certain provisions of the amendments to the rules and form contain “collection of

information requirements” within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
(“PRA”). 227 The Commission solicited comment on the estimated burden associated with the
collection of information requirements in the proposed amendments. The Commission submitted
the proposed collection of information requirements to the Office of Management and Budget
(“OMB”) for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11. The titles of the
affected information collections are Rule 15c3-1 (OMB Control Number 3235-0200), Rule 15c33 (OMB Control Number 3235-0078), Rule 17a-4 (OMB Control Number 3235-0279), Rule
10b-10 (OMB Control Number 3235–0444), and the General Instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part
IIB (OMB Control Number 3235-0498). An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is
not required to respond to, a collection of information requirement unless it displays a currently
valid OMB control number.
As discussed above, the Commission received eleven comment letters on the proposed
amendments. Some of the comments in these letters relate indirectly to the PRA and are
addressed below. The estimates contained in this section do not include any other possible costs
or economic effects beyond the costs required for PRA purposes. 228

See discussion below in Section IV.D.

54

As discussed above, the Commission is adopting amendments to Rule 15c3-1,
Appendices A, E, F, and G to Rule 15c3-1, Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-4, the General
Instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part IIB, and Rule 10b-10. These amendments are consistent
with section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act.
The amendments to Rule 15c3-1, and Rule 17a-4 establish a new standard of
creditworthiness that will allow broker-dealers to establish their own policies and procedures to
determine whether a security has only a minimal amount of credit risk. If a broker-dealer
chooses to establish these policies and procedures, it would create a new “collection of
information” burden for those broker-dealers, as explained below. The amendments to
Appendices A, E, F, and G to Rule 15c3-1 and the General Instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part
IIB remove provisions permitting reliance on NRSRO ratings to calculate haircuts and credit risk
charges related to counterparties. In addition, the amendments to the Customer Protection Rule
remove one method for verifying the status of a registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing
organization under Note G to Exhibit A. Broker-dealers have to use a new method for verifying
the status of a registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization may have to
comply with a new “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA.
The Commission does not believe that the amendment to Rule 10b-10, which eliminates a
requirement that broker-dealers inform customers in transaction confirmations for debt securities
(other than government securities) if a security is unrated by an NRSRO, would change the
existing paperwork burden for Rule 10b-10.
B.

Proposed Use of Information

The written policies and procedures required by the amendments to Rule 15c3-1, and the
retention of these policies and procedures required by the amendment to Rule 17a-4, will assist

55

Commission and SRO examination staff in evaluating whether the broker-dealer has a reasonable
basis for determining if a security has only a minimal amount of credit risk. It also will assist
examination staff and the broker-dealer in evaluating whether the broker-dealer has followed
those policies and procedures when acquiring positions in commercial paper, nonconvertible
debt, and preferred stock. In addition, written policies and procedures will provide a brokerdealer’s personnel with consistent guidance on how to determine if a security has a minimal
amount of credit risk for the purposes of complying with Rule 15c3-1.
The amendment to Rule 10b-10 will eliminate a requirement for transaction
confirmations for debt securities (other than government securities) to inform customers if a
security is unrated by an NRSRO. This amendment will alter neither the general requirement
that broker-dealers generate transaction confirmations and send those confirmations to
customers, nor the potential use of information contained in confirmations by the Commission,
SROs, and other securities regulatory authorities in the course of examinations, investigations
and enforcement proceedings.

and the General Instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part IIB

The amendments to Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 17a-4 modify broker-dealers’ existing
practices to impose additional voluntary recordkeeping burdens. The amendments to Rule 15c31 replace NRSRO ratings-based criteria for evaluating creditworthiness with an option for a
broker-dealer to apply a new standard based on the broker-dealer’s own evaluation of
creditworthiness. A broker-dealer that chooses not to make such an evaluation could instead
take the higher haircuts as specified in Rule 15c3-1. A broker-dealer that chooses to evaluate the
creditworthiness of securities will have to establish, document, maintain, and enforce policies
and procedures that are reasonably designed to determine whether a security has a minimal
amount of credit risk. Broker-dealers will be required to develop (if they have not already)
criteria for assessing creditworthiness and apply those criteria to commercial paper,
nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock included in their net capital calculations.
The Commission requested comment on the PRA burden associated with its proposed
amendments to Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 17a-4. Two commenters discussed costs, although the
comments did not explicitly address the PRA. 230 One commenter stated that “[a] significant
number of large broker-dealers have sophisticated internal credit review functions” but those
broker-dealers may not “have access to internally generated analyses of all or nearly all issuers
and securities.” 231 Both commenters were concerned that the costs imposed by the proposed

230

231

57

amendments could be considerable, particularly for small and medium-sized broker-dealers. 232
One commenter noted, however, that “the burden on small and medium-sized broker-dealers
would be significantly reduced if the proposed amendment were to be interpreted . . . to permit
policies and procedures that base the credit risk analysis solely on a small number of objectively
determinable factors.” 233 The amended rule allows a broker-dealer to establish policies and
procedures customized to its size and business activities. 234 For example, a smaller brokerdealer may decide to establish procedures that use a small number of objective factors or that
default to the higher haircuts with respect to certain types of securities or money market
instruments in lieu of establishing policies and procedures to address them. Both of these
options should minimize the compliance burden on the broker-dealer. Furthermore, the
Commission believes that many of the firms that hold commercial paper, nonconvertible debt
securities, and preferred stock (or combinations thereof) have established policies and procedures
for assessing creditworthiness; broker-dealers that have not established such policies and
procedures do not typically hold large portfolios of these types of positions. 235 In addition, the
broker-dealer should be able to use its policies and procedures to replicate its credit
determinations and is not required to create and maintain records of those determinations.
Nonetheless, the Commission believes that those broker-dealers that already have policies and
procedures in place for evaluating the overall risk and liquidity levels of proprietary securities for
the purposes of Rule 15c3-1 may incur additional burdens as a result of the amendments. In

particular, the policies and procedures may need to be modified to address the particular
requirements of the amendments.
According to data collected by the Commission, of the approximately 4,462 brokerdealers registered with the Commission as of year-end 2012, approximately 434 broker-dealers
maintained proprietary positions in debt securities and took haircuts on these securities pursuant
to paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(E), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(1), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(2) and (c)(2)(vi)(H) of Rule 15c3-1. 236
The Commission estimated in the proposing release that, on average, broker-dealers would spend
25 hours developing policies and procedures or revising their current policies and procedures for
evaluating creditworthiness for purposes of the amendments to Rule 15c3-1. 237 The Commission
received no comments on this estimate. The Commission believes that this estimate is still valid,
resulting in an aggregate initial burden of 10,850 hours. 238 This estimate is based on the
Commission’s belief that many of these broker-dealers already have their own criteria in place
for evaluating creditworthiness and, therefore, most broker-dealers will only be revising their
current policies and procedures. If a broker-dealer does not have policies and procedures in
place (e.g., a small broker-dealer holding only a few debt securities) but determines to establish

236

The number of 434 broker-dealers was obtained by reviewing broker-dealer Financial and Operational
Combined Single (or “FOCUS”) Reports for 2012 year-end and then calculating how many firms reported
holding proprietary debt positions. For FOCUS Part II filers, the balances examined were “Bankers
Acceptances” and “Corporate Debt.” For FOCUS CSE filers, the balances examined were: “Money
Market Instruments,” “Private Label Mortgage Backed Securities,” “Other Asset Backed Securities,” and
“Corporate Debt.” For Part IIA filers, the balance examined was “Debt Securities.” Broker-dealers that
hold preferred stock also may hold positions in debt securities. However, because preferred stock is not a
separate line item on the FOCUS Report, broker-dealers that hold only preferred stock and no other debt
securities are not included in this estimate.

238

434 broker-dealers x 25 hours = 10,850 hours. It should be noted that this hour burden is less than the hour
burden in the proposing release. This decrease is a result of the number of broker-dealers that reported
holding proprietary debt positions on the FOCUS Report. The number decreased from 480 at 2009 year
end to 434 at 2012 year end.

59

them rather than taking the larger haircut, the Commission believes that such a firm will likely
establish less complex policies and procedures using a small number of objective factors. 239
The Commission also estimated in the proposing release that, on average, each brokerdealer will spend an additional 10 hours a year reviewing and adjusting its own standards for
evaluating creditworthiness for purposes of the amendments to Rule 15c3-1. 240 The Commission
received no comments on this estimate and believes it is still valid. As a result, the Commission
estimates that a broker-dealer will spend approximately twenty-five hours initially and ten hours
on an annual basis on its policies and procedures. Thus, the industry, as a whole, is estimated to
spend approximately 10,850 hours initially and 4,340 hours 241 annually reviewing and adjusting
its standards for evaluating creditworthiness for purposes of the amendments to Rule 15c3-1. 242
The Commission received no comments on the estimated burdens associated with the
record retention requirements arising from the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4. The
Commission continues to believe that the requirement to retain the policies and procedures for
239

See SIFMA Letter, at 18 (“the burden on small and medium-sized broker-dealers would be significantly
reduced if the proposed amendment were to be interpreted . . . to permit policies and procedures that base
the credit risk analysis solely on a small number of objectively determinable factors. . .”).

240

Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 76 FR at
26568. Although the Commission has added language to the rule to clarify that a broker-dealer’s policies
and procedures must be reasonably designed to monitor its creditworthiness determination, the duty to
monitor was required under the proposed rule and was reflected in the corresponding burden estimate. See
section II.B.1.a.iii, supra.

241

434 broker-dealers x 10 hours = 4,340 hours.

242

The Commission estimated in the proposing release that firms would use a controller to review these
standards, both initially and on an annual basis. The Commission received no comments on this estimate.
Thus, the Commission believes the per-firm costs of the controller to be approximately $10,475 initially
and $4,190 on an annual basis, for an aggregate industry cost of $4,546,150 initially and $1,818,460 on an
annual basis. For purposes of this analysis, the Commission is using salary data from the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”) Report on Management and Professional Earnings
in the Securities Industry 2012, which provides base salary and bonus information for middle management
and professional positions within the securities industry, as modified by Commission staff to account for an
1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and
overhead. Hereinafter, references to data derived from the report as modified in the manner described
above will be cited as SIFMA Report on Management and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry
2012. The Commission believes that the reviews required by the proposed amendments would be
performed by the controller at an average rate $419 per hour. $419 x 25 = $10,475 x 434 = $4,546,150;
$419 x 10 = $4,190 x 434 = $1,818,460.

three years pursuant to Rule 17a-4 would result in de minimis incremental costs beyond those
already incurred under Rule 17a-4. The three-year preservation requirement in Rule 17a-4 will
only be applicable once a broker-dealer changes its policies and procedures as the operative
policies and procedures must be documented and maintained under the amendments to Rule
15c3-1. In addition, all broker-dealers are currently required to comply with the three-year
preservation period in Rule 17a-4 for other records and should have procedures in place to
satisfy such preservation requirements.
The amendments to the appendices to Rule 15c3-1 include amendments to certain
recordkeeping and disclosure requirements that are subject to the PRA. The amendment to
Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1 removes the NRSRO reference from the definition of the term major
market foreign currency. However, the Commission does not intend to change which currencies
would meet the definition of major market foreign currency because they will still have to have a
substantial inter-bank foreign currency market. In the proposing release the Commission stated
that there would be a recordkeeping burden if a broker-dealer wanted to request that a currency
be deemed to meet the definition of major market foreign currency, by submitting such a request
to the Commission. After further review, and based on staff experience with paragraph (c)(2)(vi)
of Rule 15c3-1, the Commission believes that broker-dealers will rarely formally request in
writing that a currency be added to the list. Thus, the Commission does not believe there is a
burden associated with this amendment. 243
The amendments to Appendices E and F to Rule 15c3-1 and conforming amendments to
Appendix G would remove the provisions permitting reliance on NRSRO ratings for the
243

In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that submitting a request that a new currency met the
definition of “major market foreign currency” would take 10 hours for a total burden to the industry of
1,580 hours. See Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, 76 FR at 26568.

61

purposes of determining counterparty risk. As a result of these deletions, an entity that wishes to
use the approach set forth in these appendices to determine counterparty risks would need, as
part of its initial application to use the alternative approach or in an amendment, to request
Commission approval to determine credit charges based on internal credit ratings and make and
keep current a record of the basis for the credit risk weight applied to each counterparty.
The Commission does not believe that the removal of the option permitting reliance on
NRSRO ratings would affect the small number of entities that currently elect to compute their
net capital deductions pursuant to the alternative methods set forth in Appendices E or F.
Although the collections of information obligations imposed by the amendments are mandatory,
applying for approval to use the alternative capital calculation is voluntary. 244 To date, a total of
six entities are using the methods set forth in Appendix E, while four are using the methods set
forth in Appendix F. All of the approved firms already use internal credit ratings to calculate
market and credit risks under the alternative net capital calculation methods set forth in the
appendices or are taking a 100% charge for counterparty risk. No firms are using NRSRO
ratings to measure counterparty risk. 245 For each entity that already employs its own models to
calculate market and credit risk and keeps current a record of the basis for the credit risk weight
of each counterparty, the amendments would not alter the paperwork burden currently imposed
by Appendices E and F. Firms that have Commission-approved models to calculate market and
credit risk, but have chosen not to seek Commission approval to calculate counterparty risk
during their initial applications, can file an amendment to their applications to calculate
244

See, e.g., Alternative Net Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers That Are Part of Consolidated
Supervised Entities, Exchange Act Release No. 34-49830 (June 8, 2004), 69 FR 34428 at 34456 (June 21,
2004).

245

In the proposing release, the Commission stated that all firms have models approved to calculate
counterparty risk. Although the Commission received no comments on this estimate, upon further review
the staff has determined that although no firm is using NRSRO ratings to calculate counterparty risk, not all
firms have models approved to calculate counterparty risk (i.e., some firms take the 100% charge).

62

counterparty risk. Based on the staff’s review of how firms approved to use Appendices E and F
are calculating counterparty risk, the staff believes that of the firms that do not have models
approved to calculate counterparty risk, none would use NRSRO ratings to calculate
counterparty risk even if it remained an option. Instead, these firms would continue to take a
100% charge for counterparty risk or would amend their application if charges related to
counterparty risk increased to the point that the 100% charge was no longer economically
practical. Any PRA burdens from these amended applications are included in the PRA burden
associated with Appendix E or Appendix F. Thus, the Commission does not believe there are
any additional burdens associated with this rulemaking.
The staff estimates that three additional firms may apply for permission to use Appendix
E and one additional firm may apply to use Appendix F. However, the Commission believes,
and commenters did not contest, that there should be no additional paperwork burden on these
firms based on the amendments. Any firm that applies to use Appendices E or F to Rule 15c3-1
must submit its internal models to the Commission for approval as part of that process. These
models will calculate market risk and credit risk, including the counterparty charge, which is not
a change from the previous approval process for a firm that is applying to use Appendix E or
Appendix F. Thus, the Commission does not believe the amendments to Appendices E and F
will alter the existing paperwork burden estimates for these collections.
The instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part IIB currently include a summary of the credit
risk calculation in paragraph (d) of Rule 15c3-1f. Paragraph (d) of Rule 15c3-1f is amended to
remove that part of the credit risk calculation that is summarized in Form X-17A-5, Part IIB.
Accordingly, the Commission is adopting a conforming amendment to the form that would
remove the summary of the credit risk calculation. The Commission received no comments on

63

its estimate in the proposing release that there would be no change in the burden for the
collection of information related to the instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part IIB in the proposing
release. The summary in the instructions provides additional information for the benefit of the
filer and is not related to the information reported on the forms. Accordingly, the Commission
does not believe the amendment would result in a substantive revision to these collections of
information.
2.

Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3

The amendment to Note G to Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3 imposes additional recordkeeping
burdens on certain broker-dealers that are mandatory. Note G allows a broker-dealer to include,
as a debit in its customer reserve formula, the amount of customer margin related to customer
positions in security futures products posted to a registered clearing or derivatives clearing
organization that meets certain minimum standards that are indicia of long-term financial
strength. Prior to this amendment, clearing organizations that maintained the highest investment
grade rating from an NRSRO qualified under Note G. 246 The amendment removes this NRSRO
criterion such that firms including the debit in their reserve formula calculations must rely on one
of the remaining three non-NRSRO criterions, or seek an exemption from the Commission.
Broker-dealers are expected to ensure that any clearing or derivatives clearing organization it
posts margin to meets one of the criterions under Note G, which results in the creation and
maintenance of records of those assessments. The Commission requested comment on all

246

A broker-dealer may also include customer margin related to customers’ positions in security futures
products posted to a registered clearing or derivatives clearing organization: (1) that maintains security
deposits from clearing members in connection with regulated options or futures transactions and
assessment power over member firms that equal a combined total of at least $2 billion, at least $500 million
of which must be in the form of security deposits; (2) that maintains at least $3 billion in margin deposits;
or (3) which does not meet any of the other criteria but which the Commission has agreed, upon a written
request from the broker-dealer, that the broker-dealer may utilize. 17 CFR 240.15c3-3a, Note G, (b)(1)(ii)(iv).

64

aspects of the burdens associated with Note G to Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3 and received no
comments. The Commission estimates that approximately 72 firms would be required to comply
with the provisions of Note G as amended. 247 In the final release that added Note G to Exhibit A
to Rule 15c3-3, 248 the Commission estimated that firms would each spend approximately 0.25
hours to verify that the clearing or derivatives clearing organizations they post customer margin
to satisfy the conditions of Note G. In the proposing release for these rule amendments, the
Commission again estimated that firms would spend approximately 0.25 hours to verify that a
clearing or derivatives clearing organization satisfies the conditions of Note G. The Commission
received no comments on this estimate and believes it is still valid. The Commission therefore
estimates that broker-dealers that trade in single stock futures will spend a total of approximately
18 hours per year, initially and on an ongoing basis, to verify the status of a registered clearing or
derivatives clearing organization imposed by this amendment. 249
The Commission estimated in the proposing release that firms would spend one hour
changing their methods of determining whether a clearing or derivatives clearing organization
meets the remaining four requirements of Note G. The Commission received no comments on
this estimate and believes it is still accurate. The result is an aggregate, one-time initial burden
of 72 hours. 250

247

The number 72 comes from reviewing the members of the OCC listed in the member directory on the
OCC’s website, available at http://www.optionsclearing.com/membership/member-information/. Of the
list of 228 members, the Commission looked only at those who trade in single stock futures. Of the list of
members that trade in single stock futures, the Commission deleted any members who had the exact same
firm name but different firm numbers. This methodology is consistent with the methodology used in the
proposing release. Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, 76 FR at 26570 n.115. The Commission received no comments on this estimate.

249

72 broker-dealers x .25 hours = 18 hours.

250

72 broker-dealers x 1 hour = 72 hours. The Commission notes that this hour burden is less than the hour
burden in the proposing release. This decrease is a result of the number of OCC member firms that trade in

Rule 10b-10

In the proposing release, the Commission stated that the proposed amendment to Rule
10b-10 was not expected to result in any significant change to the cost of providing
confirmations to customers in connection with those transactions covered by paragraph (a)(8) of
the rule. 251 The Commission did not receive any comments that addressed the Rule 10b-10
amendment’s potential effects on the burden associated with generating and sending
confirmations. The Commission continues to believe that broker-dealers need not incur any new
costs if they choose not to input information that a debt security is unrated into their existing
confirmation systems. Accordingly, the Commission continues to believe that the Rule 10b-10
amendment will not result in any significant change to the recordkeeping or reporting burdens of
generating and sending confirmations, and retains this conclusion as originally proposed.
IV.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.

Overview

The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits of its rules. When engaging in
rulemaking that requires the Commission to consider or determine whether an action is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires that the
Commission consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 252 In addition, section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange
Act requires that the Commission consider the effects on competition of any rules the
single stock futures decreasing from 90 to 72. The Commission estimated in the proposing release that
firms will use a senior operations manager to review these standards. The Commission received no
comments on this estimate and believes that it is still accurate. The Commission therefore estimates that
the one-time costs of a senior operations manager to be $341 per hour, resulting in an aggregate, one-time
cost to the industry of $24,552. 72 broker-dealers x $341/hour x 1 hour = $24,552. SIFMA Report on
Management and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012.

Commission adopts under the Exchange Act, and prohibits the Commission from adopting any
rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of
the purposes of the Exchange Act. 253
In the proposing release, the Commission solicited comment on the costs and benefits of
the proposed amendments, including whether estimates of the costs and benefits were accurate
and comprehensive. 254 The Commission further encouraged commenters to provide specific data
and analysis in support of their views. 255 The Commission also requested comment on whether
the proposed amendments would place a burden on competition, and promote efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 256
The Commission received two comment letters addressing the Commission’s estimates of
the costs associated with the proposed amendments. 257 Generally, these commenters expressed
concerns that the potential costs associated with the proposed rules could be considerable. 258
While commenters stated that the costs may be high, they did not provide quantified estimates of
the costs—this reflects the fact that many of the costs and benefits of today’s amendments are
difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty, especially as practices at broker-dealers are
expected to evolve and appropriately adapt to market developments. Moreover, this difficulty is
aggravated by the fact that limited public data exists that is related to a broker-dealer’s net capital

calculation that could assist in quantifying certain costs. Consequently, the Commission has
relied on qualitative assessments of the likely costs and benefits in its analysis. As discussed
throughout this release, the Commission has modified the amendments being adopted today in a
way that it believes will help to minimize costs to broker-dealers. A number of costs and
benefits that are related to the rules being adopted today are discussed below.
As discussed above, the amendments to Rule 15c3-1, Appendices A, E, F, and G to Rule
15c3-1, Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-4, the General Instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part
IIB, and Rule 10b-10 implement section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act by eliminating the
reference to and requirement for the use of NRSRO ratings in these rules. The Commission
recognizes that there are additional costs associated with adopting the amendments that are
separate from the costs associated with the hour and cost burdens discussed in the PRA. The
discussion below focuses on the Commission’s reasons for adopting these amendments, the
affected parties, the impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, and the costs and
benefits of the amendments as compared to the baseline, described below, and to alternative
courses of action.
B.

Economic Baseline

The regulatory changes adopted today amend requirements that apply to broker-dealers
registered with the Commission. However, security issuers, NRSROs, non-NRSRO credit rating
agencies, and other providers of credit risk analysis as well as a broker-dealer’s customers and
counterparties could all be affected by the amendments. The discussion below characterizes the
economic baseline against which the costs and benefits, as well as the impact on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation, of today’s amendments are measured. It includes the
approximate numbers of broker-dealers that would be directly affected by today’s amendments

68

and a description of the relevant features of the economic and regulatory environment in which
the various impacted parties operate. The economic baseline being used for this analysis is the
economic and regulatory framework in existence just prior to the adoption of today’s
amendments.
The regulations that are affected by today’s amendments include Rule 15c3-1, which
provided prior to today’s amendments, among other things, that a broker-dealer could apply a
lesser capital charge (e.g., less than the 15% catchall charge) for commercial paper,
nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock if the instrument is rated in the higher rating categories
by two NRSROs; the Appendices to Rule 15c3-1, which rely on credit ratings for calculating
haircuts or credit risk charges related to counterparties; Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3, which uses
NRSRO ratings to determine whether a broker-dealer can include customer margin for
transactions in securities futures products as a debit in its reserve formula; and Rule 10b-10,
which requires disclosing in customer confirmations of securities transactions if non-government
debt securities have not been rated by an NRSRO. The rule amendments would help to reduce
any perceived Commission endorsement of NRSROs and NRSRO ratings and reduce reliance on
credit ratings. The relevant rule amendments are described in detail below.
The broker-dealers registered with the Commission vary significantly in terms of their
size, business activities, and the complexity of their operations. For example, carrying brokerdealers hold customer securities and funds. 259 Clearing broker-dealers clear transactions as

259

Rule 15c3-1 specifies that a broker-dealer shall be deemed to carry customer or broker-dealer accounts “if,
in connection with its activities as a broker or dealer, it receives checks, drafts, or other evidences of
indebtedness made payable to itself or persons other than the requisite registered broker or dealer carrying
the account of a customer, escrow agent, issuer, underwriter, sponsor, or other distributor of securities” or
“if it does not promptly forward or promptly deliver all of the securities of customers or of other brokers or
dealers received by the firm in connection with its activities as a broker or dealer.” 17 CFR 240.15c31(a)(2)(i); see also the description of Rule 15c3-1 in section II.B.1.a.i., supra. Further, Rule 15c3-3, defines
the term securities carried for the account of a customer to mean “securities received by or on behalf of a
broker or dealer for the account of any customer and securities carried long by a broker or dealer for the

69

members of securities exchanges, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, and the OCC. 260
Many clearing broker-dealers are carrying broker-dealers, but some clearing broker-dealers clear
only their own transactions and do not hold customer securities and cash.
A broker-dealer that claims an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 is generally referred to as
“non-carrying broker-dealer.” Non-carrying broker-dealers include “introducing brokers.” 261
These non-carrying broker-dealers typically accept customer orders and introduce their
customers to a carrying broker-dealer that will hold the customers’ securities and cash along with
the securities and cash of customers of other introducing broker-dealers and those of direct
customers of the carrying broker-dealer. The carrying broker-dealer generally receives and
executes orders of the introducing broker-dealer’s customers. 262 Carrying broker-dealers
generally also prepare trade confirmations, settle trades, and organize book entries of the
securities. 263 Introducing broker-dealers also may use carrying broker-dealers to clear the firm’s
proprietary trades and carry the firm’s securities. Another group of non-carrying broker-dealers

See, e.g., FINRA Rule 4311 (Carrying Agreements). This FINRA rule governs the requirements applicable
to FINRA members when entering into agreements for the carrying of any customer accounts in which
securities transactions can be effected. Historically, the purpose of this rule has been to require that certain
functions and responsibilities are clearly allocated to either the introducing or carrying firm, consistent with
the requirements of the SRO’s and Commission’s financial responsibility rules and other rules and
regulations, as applicable. See also Notice of Filing of Amendment No. 1 and Order Granting Accelerated

effects transactions in securities such as mutual funds on a subscription-way basis. 264 Generally,
customers purchase the securities by providing the funds directly to the issuer. Finally, some
non-carrying broker-dealers act as finders by referring prospective purchasers of securities to
issuers. 265
The broker-dealer industry is the primary industry affected by the rule amendments,
although the amendments impose different requirements on different types of broker-dealers.
For example, only those broker-dealers that hold proprietary positions in commercial paper,
nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock will be affected by the amendments to Rules 15c3-1 and
17a-4, only those broker-dealers that trade in foreign currency options will be affected by the
amendments to Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1, and only those broker-dealers that clear and carry
positions in security futures products for customers will be affected by the amendment to Exhibit
A to Rule 15c3-3. The amendments to Appendices E and F to Rule 15c3-1 and the conforming
amendments to Appendix G to Rule 15c3-1 and the General Instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part
IIB will affect only ANC broker-dealers and OTC derivatives dealers. The amendment to Rule
10b-10 eliminates a disclosure requirement for broker-dealers that currently produce transaction
confirmations for debt securities other than government securities.
To establish a baseline for competition among broker-dealers, the Commission looks at
the status of the broker-dealer industry detailed below. In terms of size, the following tables
illustrate the variance among broker-dealers with respect to total capital. The information in the
tables is based on FOCUS Report data for calendar year 2012.

customer may simply fill out an application or a subscription agreement that the broker-dealer then
forwards directly to the issuer.”).

According to FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2012, there were approximately
4,462 broker-dealers registered with the Commission. Nine broker-dealers account for more
than half of all capital held by broker-dealers. Of the 4,462 registered broker-dealers, 434 firms
reported holding proprietary debt positions on their FOCUS Reports. 266 The Commission has
also estimated that there are 101 broker-dealers that trade foreign currency options and are,
therefore, subject to Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1. 267 Furthermore, there are six ANC brokerdealers (i.e., firms that operate under Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1) and four OTC derivatives
266

See section III.C., supra.

267

To arrive at this number, the Commission reviewed the members of the OCC listed in the member directory
on the OCC’s website available at http://www.optionsclearing.com/membership/member-information/. Of
the list of 228 members, the Commission looked only at those that trade in index options because members
approved to trade index options are also approved to trade such foreign currency options. Of the list of
members that trade in index options, the Commission deleted any members that had the exact same firm
name but different firm numbers. The Commission received no comments on its estimate of the number of
broker-dealers that would be affected by the amendment to Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1 in the proposing
release. See also Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, 76 FR at 26568.

dealers (i.e., firms that operate under Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1). In addition, the staff
estimates that, for reasons unrelated to the rule amendments being adopted today, an additional
three firms will apply to operate as ANC broker-dealers and one additional firm will apply to
operate as an OTC derivatives dealer. The Commission also has estimated that there are 72
firms subject to Note G to Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3. 268
The Commission also believes other parties could be affected by today’s amendments.
Under the economic baseline, issuers of securities who obtain favorable ratings from two or
more NRSROs enjoy the benefit of greater access to the capital markets because such securities
are – holding other things constant – more attractive to broker-dealers who can take lower
haircuts on such securities for the purposes of compliance with Rule 15c3-1. While the
Commission does not intend the amendments to Rule 15c3-1 to alter the scope of securities and
money market instruments that qualify for the lower haircuts, eliminating preferential regulatory
treatment of NRSRO-rated securities could affect security issuers by altering the portfolio
preferences of broker-dealers if, for example, broker-dealers establish policies and procedures
for assessing creditworthiness that produce more conservative results than the NRSRO credit
rating standard. These conservative results could cause broker-dealers to avoid holding positions
that they would have held under the NRSRO credit rating standard. Alternatively, if the policies
and procedures produce less conservative results, the amendments could alter the risk of brokerdealers’ portfolios by causing them to hold positions that they would not have held when
applying the NRSRO credit rating standard. Altering the risk of broker-dealers’ portfolios could
affect broker-dealers’ customers, counterparties, and investors, all of whom are protected by
Rule 15c3-1.

268

See section III.C., supra.

73

Finally, today’s amendments could have a significant effect on the credit ratings industry.
Currently there are ten NRSROs with the three largest accounting for the majority of all credit
ratings. 269 The favorable regulatory treatment of NRSRO-rated securities increases demand for
securities that have been favorably rated by at least two NRSROs. Eliminating this favorable
treatment may alter incentives for broker-dealers to hold NRSRO-rated securities and may
increase a broker-dealer’s use of alternative providers of credit risk analysis, which could
increase competition in the credit ratings industry.

Overview of Rule 15c3-1, Appendices A, E, F, and G to Rule 15c3-1,
Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3, the General Instructions to Form X-17A-5,
Part IIB, and Rule 10b-10 prior to today’s amendments
a.

Rule 15c3-1

As discussed above, Rule 15c3-1 prescribes minimum regulatory capital requirements for
broker-dealers. 270 Rule 15c3-1 prescribes a “net liquid assets test” designed to require a brokerdealer to maintain at all times more than one dollar of highly liquid assets for each dollar of
liabilities (e.g., money owed to customers and counterparties), excluding liabilities subordinated
by contract to all other creditors. Under the economic baseline, Rule 15c3-1 prescribed a lower
haircut to certain types of debt instruments held by a broker-dealer if the securities were rated in
higher rating categories by at least two NRSROs, since those securities typically are less volatile
in price than securities that are rated in the lower categories or are unrated. Specifically, to
receive the benefit of a reduced haircut on commercial paper, the commercial paper had to be

269

See Commission, Annual Report on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (December
2012) (estimating that as of December 2011, the three largest NRSROs accounted for approximately 96%
of all outstanding credit ratings); Commission, Report to Congress on Assigned Credit Ratings (December
2012) (estimating that as of December 2011, the three largest credit rating agencies accounted for
approximately 91% of structured product ratings).

270

74

rated in one of the three highest rating categories by at least two NRSROs; 271 to receive the
benefit of a reduced haircut on a nonconvertible debt security and preferred stock, the security
had to be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two NRSROs.272 If
securities were not eligible for the reduced haircut, they were subject to a greater haircut (e.g.,
15%), provided they had a ready market. The 15% haircut is derived from the catchall haircut
amount that applies to a security not specifically identified in Rule 15c3-1 as having an assetclass specific haircut, provided the security is otherwise deemed to have a ready market, among
other requirements. Securities without a ready market are subject to a 100% haircut.
b.

Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1

Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1 permits broker-dealers to employ a standardized theoretical
option pricing model to determine a potential loss for a portfolio of listed options positions and
related positions to compute a single haircut for the group of positions.273 Under Appendix A, a
broker-dealer groups the options and related positions in a portfolio and stresses the current market
price for each position at ten equidistant points along a range of positive and negative potential
future market movements, using an approved theoretical option pricing model that satisfies
certain conditions specified in the rule. 274 Positions that have more potential price volatility
must be stressed across a wider range of positive and negative potential future market
movements than positions with lower price volatility. 275 For example, a broker-dealer other than
a non-clearing option specialist or market maker must employ a range of potential future market
movements for major market foreign currencies of (+/-) 6%, whereas the range for all other

foreign currencies is (+/-) 20%. 276 Thus, major market foreign currency options receive more
favorable treatment than options on all other currencies when using theoretical option pricing
models to compute net capital deductions.277 Under the economic baseline, the rule defined the
term major market foreign currency to mean “the currency of a sovereign nation whose short term
debt is rated in one of the two highest categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical
rating organizations and for which there is a substantial inter-bank forward currency market.”
c.

Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1

Under Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1, ANC broker-dealers are permitted to add back to net
worth uncollateralized receivables from counterparties arising from OTC derivatives transactions
(i.e., they can add back the amount of the uncollateralized current exposure). 278 Instead of the
100% deduction that applies to most unsecured receivables under Rule 15c3-1, ANC brokerdealers are permitted to take a credit risk charge based on the uncollateralized credit exposure to
the counterparty. 279 The credit risk charge is derived, in part, by using an applicable credit risk
weight factor. 280 Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1 prescribes three standardized credit risk weight
factors (20%, 50%, and 150%) and, as an alternative, permits an ANC broker-dealer with
Commission approval to use internal methodologies to determine appropriate credit risk weights
to apply to counterparties. 281 Under the economic baseline, ANC broker-dealers were permitted
to use NRSRO credit ratings or internally derived credit ratings to determine the appropriate
credit risk weight factor.

Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1 and Form X-17A-5, Part IIB

Under Appendix F to Rule 15c3-1, OTC derivatives dealers are required to deduct from
their net capital credit risk charges that take counterparty risk into consideration. 282 As part of
this deduction, the OTC derivatives dealer must apply a counterparty risk weight factor of either
20%, 50%, or 100%. 283 In addition, OTC derivatives dealers must take a concentration charge
where the net replacement value in the account of any one counterparty exceeds 25% of the OTC
derivatives dealer’s tentative net capital. 284 Under the economic baseline, the counterparty risk
weight factor (i.e., 20%, 50%, or 100%) was determined using either NRSRO credit ratings or
the firm’s internal credit ratings. 285 The concentration charge also was determined using either
NRSRO credit ratings or the firm’s internal credit ratings.
e.

Appendix G to Rule 15c3-1

Appendix G to Rule 15c3-1 provides that broker-dealers may use the ANC computation
only if their ultimate holding companies agree to provide the Commission with additional
information about the financial condition of the holding company and its affiliates. 286 Paragraph
(a) of Appendix G sets forth a methodology for computing allowable capital and allowances for
market and credit risk at the consolidated holding company level. Under the economic baseline,
one aspect of calculating credit risk in Appendix G provided that those firms must use credit
ratings in accordance with the applicable provisions of Appendix E

77

Rule 15c3-3 is designed to protect customer funds and securities held by brokerdealers. 287 In general, Rule 15c3-3 requires a broker-dealer to take two steps. First, a brokerdealer must maintain possession or control of all fully paid and excess margin securities of its
customers. In this regard, a broker-dealer must make a daily determination in order to comply
with this aspect of the rule. Second, the broker-dealer must make a periodic computation to
determine how much money it is holding that is either customer money or money obtained from
the use of customer securities (“credits”). From that figure, the broker-dealer subtracts the
amount of money that it is owed by customers relating to customer transactions (“debits”). If the
credits exceed the debits after this “reserve formula” computation, the broker-dealer must deposit
the excess in a customer reserve account. If the debits exceed credits, no deposit is necessary.
Funds deposited in a customer reserve account cannot be withdrawn until the broker-dealer
completes another computation that shows that the firm has on deposit more funds than the
reserve formula requires.
Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3 prescribes the formula that a broker-dealer must use to
determine its reserve requirement. Under the economic baseline, Note G to Exhibit A provided
that a broker-dealer could include margin required for customer transactions in security futures
products as a debit in its reserve formula computation if that margin is on deposit at a clearing
agency or derivatives clearing organization that: (1) maintains the highest investment-grade
rating from an NRSRO; (2) maintains security deposits from clearing members in connection
with regulated options or futures transactions and assessment power over member firms that
equal a combined total of at least $2 billion, at least $500 million of which must be in the form of

78

security deposits; (3) maintains at least $3 billion in margin deposits; or (4) obtains an exemption
from the Commission. 288
g.

Rule 10b-10

Rule 10b-10, the Commission’s customer confirmation rule, generally requires brokerdealers effecting transactions for customers in securities, other than U.S. savings bonds or
municipal securities, to provide those customers with a written notification, at or before
completion of the securities transaction, disclosing certain information about the terms of the
transaction. 289 This required disclosure includes the date, time, identity, and number of
securities bought or sold; the capacity in which the broker-dealer acted (e.g., as agent or
principal); yields on debt securities; and, in some circumstances, the amount of compensation the
broker-dealer will receive from the customer and any other parties. By requiring these
disclosures, the rule serves a basic customer protection function by conveying information that:
(1) allows customers to verify the terms of their transactions; (2) alerts customers to potential
conflicts of interest; (3) acts as a safeguard against fraud; and (4) allows customers a means of
evaluating the costs of their transactions and the quality of the broker-dealer’s execution. Under
the economic baseline, Rule 10b-10 required a broker-dealer to inform the customer in the
confirmation if a debt security, other than a government security, is unrated by an NRSRO.
C.

Effect on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

The amendments adopted today have the potential to affect competition, efficiency, and
capital formation. This section discusses what the Commission believes to be potential effects

79

across three groups of market participants: (1) broker-dealers, (2) security issuers, and (3) issuers
of credit ratings. 290
1.

Effects on the Broker-Dealer Industry

Under the economic baseline, all broker-dealers employ a uniform standard – an NRSRO
credit rating – to determine whether a position in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, or
preferred stock is entitled to a lower haircut for purposes of Rule 15c3-1. Today’s amendments
eliminate this uniform standard and require that broker-dealers develop internal policies and
procedures for determining whether these types of positions have only a minimal amount of
credit risk and, therefore, are entitled to the lower haircut. As one commenter noted, “the cost
and complexity of developing a credit evaluation infrastructure covering many issuers and
securities may be beyond the means of many broker-dealers.” 291 Also, as the FOCUS Report
data for calendar year 2012 makes clear, the majority of broker-dealers are small (with capital
less than $500,000). 292 As noted by several commenters, any new regulatory requirement with
significant fixed costs has the potential to disadvantage small and medium-sized brokerdealers. 293 Such disadvantages could result in increased concentration in the broker-dealer
industry.
However, the Commission does not intend or expect broker-dealers to individually
duplicate the function of credit rating agencies. To do so would require broker-dealers,
particularly small and medium sized broker-dealers, to incur significant expense, potentially
reducing competition in the broker-dealer industry and harming economic efficiency through
290

291

Although this section IV.C. of the release focuses on these three groups of market participants whose
businesses may be more directly impacted by the final rules, the impacts on other participants are discussed
elsewhere in the release. See, e.g., section IV.D., infra.
SIFMA Letter, at 18.

292

See section IV.B., supra.

293

80

duplication of effort. 294 Instead, the Commission expects that today’s amendments will create
opportunities for NRSROs, non-NRSRO credit rating agencies, and other providers of credit risk
analysis to offer products and services that facilitate compliance with today’s amendments.
Although broker-dealers with large portfolios of debt securities and well-developed credit
analysis capabilities may prefer to use an internal credit risk function for assessing
creditworthiness, it will not be cost effective or practical for other broker-dealers to support an
internal credit risk department comprised of analysts who perform internal credit assessments.
These broker-dealers may instead establish a process for assessing creditworthiness that relies
more on external factors, such as external credit assessments and market data, and that process
will be evaluated for reasonableness in light of the firm’s circumstances (e.g., the size of the
broker-dealer and the types and sizes of the positions typically held by the broker-dealer). The
Commission also anticipates that some broker-dealers, particularly those with minimal
proprietary positions in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock, will choose
to devote no resources toward credit risk analysis and to maintenance of policies and procedures,
and instead will apply a greater haircut to their proprietary positions as permitted by the rule. 295
Based on these considerations, the Commission does not believe that the burden of
complying with today’s amendments will result in significant changes to the competitive
structure of the broker-dealer industry in general, nor to the small subset of broker-dealers with
positions in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt, and preferred stock that are directly affected
by today’s amendments.

294

See generally SIFMA Letter, at 11.

295

Although this approach would decrease the firm’s direct cost of complying with the rule amendments, it
would increase the amount of capital the broker-dealer is required to maintain to comply with Rule 15c3-1,
increasing the indirect compliance costs.

81

In addition to the aforementioned potential direct effects on efficiency and competition,
today’s amendments may affect economic efficiency indirectly by altering the net capital levels
in the broker-dealer industry. A broker-dealer that elects to take a higher haircut rather than
make a credit risk determination or one that overestimates the credit risk in its position will
reserve more net capital than is required by Rule 15c3-1. This could affect the broker-dealer’s
ability to hold (or add to) its positions. Conversely, some broker-dealers may underestimate the
credit risk of their positions. Indeed, broker-dealers have an incentive to underestimate credit
risk in order to apply the lower capital charge. Such a determination could have a potential
impact on the firm’s ability, if it experiences financial difficulties, to be in a position to meet its
obligations to customers, investors, and other counterparties and generate resources to winddown its operations in an orderly manner without the need of a formal liquidation proceeding,
with attendant costs. Increasing discretion in assessing creditworthiness for purposes of Rule
15c3-1 can facilitate such underestimation of credit risk. The Commission believes that this
represents a significant risk in today’s amendments. Broker-dealers whose internal evaluations
typically are inconsistent with market data likely will need to spend more time addressing
examiners’ concerns regarding the reasonableness of their policies and procedures and the
accuracy of their determinations that a security or money market instrument has only a minimal
amount of credit risk; a broker-dealer’s desire to avoid these costs may help mitigate the brokerdealers’ incentives to underestimate credit risk.
2.

Effects on Security Issuers

Today’s amendments could impact capital formation by altering the set of securities that
qualify for preferential treatment under Rule 15c3-1. Under the economic baseline, issuers of
commercial paper, nonconvertible debt securities, and preferred stock who obtain favorable

82

ratings from two or more NRSROs benefit from having lower haircuts apply to their issuances.
Consequently, these issuers may have greater access to the capital markets, while issuers without
such a rating may have more limited access. The regulatory preference for NRSRO-rated
securities also benefits issuers who can afford to have their securities rated by NRSROs, and
discourages broker-dealers from considering all the relevant credit risk factors when making
portfolio decisions. By eliminating the regulatory preference for NRSRO-rated securities,
today’s amendments could alter the set of securities qualifying for lower net capital charges,
which would affect broker-dealers’ portfolio preferences. For example, the amendments could
increase access to capital markets for smaller issuers whose commercial paper, nonconvertible
debt securities, or preferred stock have only a minimal amount of credit risk, but for whom the
costs of obtaining an NRSRO rating is potentially prohibitive. Such changes could increase
competition among issuers for capital and improve the efficiency of the capital allocation
process.
While it is the intent of the Commission that today’s amendments not alter the quality of
assets that qualify for the lower haircut, it is nonetheless a possibility that the policies and
procedures that broker-dealers establish will change the risk and/or net capital levels of brokerdealers. Changes or perceived changes to the amount of net capital being held by a broker-dealer
could have negative repercussions on confidence in broker-dealers’ financial position among
their customers, counterparties, and investors. These impacts on confidence could disrupt the
orderly functioning of the markets – for example, by encouraging counterparties to reduce their
exposures to broker-dealers in response to uncertainty about broker-dealers’ financial positions –
and thereby harm the capital formation process.
3.

Effects on the Credit Ratings Industry

83

Finally, today’s amendments could have an effect on competition in the credit rating
agency industry with consequences on economic efficiency. Currently there are ten NRSROs
with the three largest accounting for the majority of all credit ratings. As noted earlier, the
favorable regulatory treatment of NRSRO-rated securities increases demand for securities that
have been rated by at least two NRSROs. Eliminating this favorable treatment may increase
broker-dealers’ use of alternative providers of credit risk analysis, which could increase
competition in the credit rating agency industry. Furthermore, to the extent that NRSRO ratings
are biased, as some have argued, additional competition among credit rating providers could help
expose any such biases and increase incentives for NRSROs to produce accurate ratings.
Reducing the emphasis on NRSRO ratings also could adversely affect the quality of
NRSRO ratings. Currently, the importance attached to NRSRO ratings may impart franchise
value to the NRSRO’s ratings business. Eliminating references to NRSRO ratings in certain
federal regulations could reduce these franchise values and mitigate NRSROs’ incentives to
produce credible and reliable ratings. Moreover, the Commission recognizes that the elimination
of the required use of credit ratings in the specified Commission rules and forms may reduce the
incentive for credit rating agencies to register as NRSROs with the Commission and thereby be
subject to the Commission’s oversight and the statutory and regulatory requirements applicable
to NRSROs. To the extent that the quality and accuracy of NRSRO ratings is adversely affected,
negative impacts on the capital allocation process and economic efficiency could result.
D.

Costs and Benefits of the Rule Amendments
1.

Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 17a-4
a.

Benefits

84

The Commission requested comment on all aspects of the benefits associated with the
amendments to Rule 15c3-1, the appendices to Rule 15c3-1, and Rule 17a-4, and received no
comments. The Commission believes that one of the primary benefits of the amendments being
adopted today is reducing potential undue reliance on NRSRO ratings that could be caused by
references to NRSROs in Commission rules. Significantly, the Commission believes that
eliminating references to NRSRO ratings in its rules would remove any appearance that the
Commission has placed its imprimatur on such ratings. The Commission, however, also
recognizes that credit ratings provide useful information to institutional and retail investors as
part of the process of making an investment decision.
The Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 15c3-1 and its appendices, as well
as the conforming amendment to Rule 17a-4, will encourage a more complete assessment of the
credit risks associated with securities held by broker-dealers. As the NRSROs themselves have
stressed, NRSRO ratings are a one-dimensional measure that summarizes the likelihood that an
obligor or financial obligation will fail to repay investors in accordance with the terms on which
they made their investment and investors’ expected recoveries in the event of such a failure. 296
The simplicity of a one-dimensional measure is both its major advantage and its main limitation.
For comparing securities with similar risk profiles, one-dimensional credit ratings are a useful
summary measure. However, for securities with different risk profiles, such ratings can obscure
important information about underlying differences in risk, such as time effects, default
correlations, and the shape of loss distributions. The Commission expects that the amendments

adopted today will encourage broker-dealers to incorporate this additional information in their
credit risk evaluation process.
Many broker-dealers already conduct their own risk evaluation. As one commenter noted
“[a] significant number of large broker-dealers have sophisticated internal credit review
functions.” 297 However, for those broker-dealers that do not currently have their own means of
evaluating risk for purposes of the amendments to Rule 15c3-1, the approach being adopted
today will allow them to incorporate various observable factors and external information sources
in their new risk evaluation processes, which will lead to a better understanding of the risks
associated with those securities.
b.

Costs

The Commission recognizes, as a result of today’s amendments, that broker-dealers may
incur additional costs associated with performing a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of
the debt securities they own. The Commission received two comments on the costs associated
with the proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-1. 298 As stated above, one commenter noted that
“the cost and complexity of developing a credit evaluation infrastructure covering many issuers
and securities may be beyond the means of many broker-dealers.” 299 Another commenter
worried that “the cost to comply may be prohibitively high for the smaller or middle-market
broker-dealers.” 300 As has been noted above, the Commission does not intend or expect brokerdealers to individually duplicate the function of credit rating agencies. Thus, the Commission
believes that the costs of compliance with the amendments to Rule 15c3-1 and its appendices, as

well as the conforming amendment to Rule 17a-4, would be minimal for the “significant number
of large broker-dealers” that have a “sophisticated internal credit review function” for net capital
purposes. 301 Of the approximately 434 broker-dealers that hold proprietary debt positions, the
Commission recognizes that the level of sophistication varies widely. The broker-dealers with
less sophisticated internal procedures for analyzing credit risk may incur costs to establish and
develop procedures that would be used to assess financial instruments for the purposes of
determining whether the lower haircuts could appropriately be applied. However, the
Commission believes that because the determination of a minimal amount of credit risk will vary
among firms, and because broker-dealers may create policies and procedures using a small
number of objective factors and external assessments, firms will be able to keep costs lower than
if they were mandated to create policies and procedures based on numerous specified factors. 302
There will be minimal costs associated with the amendments for firms that use Appendix
A to Rule 15c3-1. The amendment to the definition of major market foreign currency is not
intended to change the foreign currencies that currently receive lower haircuts under the rule.
Therefore, the Commission does not believe there will be any costs associated with the
amendments.
Firms that use Appendices E and F to Rule 15c3-1 already undergo an approval process
to use internal credit ratings to determine credit risk charges for each counterparty. Any new
firms that apply to use either Appendix E or Appendix F will not incur any separate costs as a
result of the amendments. Currently, firms that apply to use these appendices must have their

301

SIFMA Letter, at 11.

302

See SIFMA Letter, at 18 (“we believe the burden on small and medium-sized broker-dealers would be
significantly reduced if the proposed amendment were to be interpreted . . . to permit policies and
procedures that base the credit risk analysis solely on a small number of objectively determinable
factors . . .”).

87

internal models approved by the Commission prior to using their selected appendix. Although
the Commission will have to assess the firm’s process for determining internal credit ratings, this
step will not cause broker-dealers who are applying to use these appendices to incur any
additional costs. Furthermore, because the firms currently using these appendices have
traditionally used models to compute capital charges, as opposed to NRSRO ratings, these firms
will not incur any additional costs by complying with the amendments.
2.

Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3
a.

Benefits

The Commission requested comment on all aspects of the benefits associated with the
amendment to Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3 and received no comments. The amendment eliminates
a criterion that qualified the debits at a clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization if it
was assigned the highest credit rating given by any NRSRO. Broker-dealers instead will be
required to look to two other criterions based on financial metrics.
b.

Costs

The Commission requested comment on all aspects of the costs associated with Note G to
Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3 and received no comments. The total cost of compliance with Note G
to Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3 will be minimal as the removal of the NRSRO credit ratings
criterion from Note G is neither intended nor expected to change current security futures
margining practices by broker-dealers. As stated in the PRA section, the Commission anticipates
that a broker-dealer will incur a one-time cost to verify that a clearing or derivatives clearing
organization meets the requirements of Note G. If a broker-dealer is currently using one of the
non-NRSRO criterions, it will not incur any one-time costs.

88

3.

Rule 10b-10
a.

Benefits

The Commission believes that the amendment to Rule 10b-10 will benefit investors. As
explained previously, the existing requirement to inform customers if a debt security, other than
a government security, is unrated by an NRSRO may have the unintended effect of suggesting
that rated securities are inherently better or less risky than unrated debt securities. The
Commission believes that the existence of a rating should not give an investor extra comfort
regarding the risks associated with the rated security. The amendment, by removing paragraph
(a)(8)’s requirement to disclose whether certain securities are rated by an NRSRO, should help
avoid promoting excessive reliance on NRSRO ratings. It also should help encourage investors
to view NRSRO ratings as only one of multiple types of information relevant to evaluating credit
risk. This in turn should help investors make more informed decisions regarding investments in
debt securities.
b.

Costs

As stated in the proposing release, the Commission does not expect the amendment to
result in any significant changes in the costs associated with Rule 10b-10. Broker-dealers will
continue to generate transaction confirmations and send those confirmations to customers, and
the amendment is not expected to change the cost of generating and sending confirmations.
Moreover, the Commission believes that broker-dealers may not incur costs if they choose not to
input information that a debt security is unrated into their existing confirmation systems.
As stated above, the Commission acknowledges that, in some instances, eliminating
paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 10b-10 may remove some incentive to investigate the quality of unrated
debt securities. The Commission believes, however, that any such potential cost would be

89

balanced by the benefit of encouraging investors not to rely excessively on credit ratings for
information about credit risk and to consider additional information.
E.

Alternatives
1.

Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 17a-4

In adopting the amendments to Rule 15c3-1, the Commission considered several
alternative approaches, including suggestions by commenters. The main suggestion by
commenters was to use an objective standard of creditworthiness instead of a subjective standard
of creditworthiness. 303 Specifically, one commenter suggested the use of credit spreads and/or
inclusion on an index as an objective standard. 304 Although the Commission considered these
standards, it determined the alternatives would not be practical because not all bonds are
included on an index and for bonds that are thinly traded the yield spreads could include liquidity
premia that have little relation to the credit risk of the bond, reducing the usefulness of the yield
spreads as a signal for credit risk. Furthermore, creating different standards of creditworthiness
for different securities could increase costs for broker-dealers that hold multiple types of
securities. The Commission does, however, believe that objective factors could play an
important role in determining whether a security or money market instrument has a minimal
amount of credit risk. To emphasize this point, the Commission added language to paragraph
(c)(2)(vi)(I) that was not in the proposed rule text that states that policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed “should result in assessments of creditworthiness that typically are
consistent with market data.” This language should encourage broker-dealers to review at least
one external factor, such as credit spreads or pricing, when making its credit risk determination.
In addition, assessments that are consistent with market data should take some of the subjectivity
303

See Bond Dealers Letter, at 3; SIFMA Letter, at 11.

304

Bond Dealers Letter, at 3.

90

away from each broker-dealer when making a credit risk determination. Rather than mandate a
specific set of factors that broker-dealers must use when assessing credit risk, the Commission
thought it was better to allow broker-dealers to determine what specific factors would work best
for their specific circumstances.
The Commission understands that by not mandating an objective standard to determine
the creditworthiness of a security or money market instrument there is a risk that a broker-dealer
may incorrectly assess the credit risk. Using a subjective standard also could lead to inconsistent
determinations of credit risk of the same security or money market instrument among brokerdealers. Inconsistent determinations of credit risk will lead to situations where broker-dealers
that determine the security has only a minimal amount of credit risk will apply a lower haircut to
the position than broker-dealers that determine that the security does not have a minimal amount
of credit risk. The Commission expects, however, that the risk of this occurring will be
mitigated by the Commission and SRO examination process, during which Commission and
SRO examiners will assess the reasonableness of broker-dealers’ policies and procedures for
determining net capital haircuts under the minimal amount of credit risk standard and review the
firms’ adherence to the policies and procedures. A broker-dealer will need to be able to explain
its credit risk analysis and ultimate determination to examiners as part of the examination
process. If a broker-dealer has reasonable policies and procedures in place for determining credit
risk, and those policies and procedures are followed, the potential for bias to be a part of the
assessment process should be mitigated.
The Commission also considered mandating that broker-dealers use a certain number of
factors or specific factors when making a credit risk determination. Ultimately, the Commission
decided that allowing broker-dealers to establish policies and procedures that are tailored to the

91

size and activities of the broker-dealer would keep costs down. Further, a given factor may be
appropriate only for certain types of positions and could, if applied inappropriately, lead to
inaccurate credit risk determinations. Allowing a broker-dealer the flexibility in selecting the
factors it uses to assess the credit risk of its portfolio could lead to more accurate credit risk
determinations.
In adopting the amendments to Appendices E and F of Rule 15c3-1, the Commission
considered the alternative proposed by commenters that the minimal amount of credit risk
standard be used. However, as explained earlier, the Commission does not believe such a
standard would work in Appendices E and F because the minimal amount of credit risk standard
in Rule 15c3-1 replaced a binary NRSRO credit rating standard under which the application of a
lower or higher haircut amount depends on whether the commercial paper is rated in the top
three rating categories and the nonconvertible debt and preferred stock is rated in the top four
rating categories. Thus, the instrument either meets the requirement to apply the lower haircut or
is subject to the higher haircut. The NRSRO credit ratings standard in Appendices E and F to
Rule 15c3-1 is not binary because there are three gradations for credit risk weights. Thus, the
minimal amount of credit risk standard would not be a suitable replacement. 305
2.

Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3

In adopting the amendments to Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3, the Commission did not
consider any alternatives to the proposal and did not receive comments offering any alternatives
to the proposal. The Commission could have established an alternative criterion but chose not to
because the remaining three criteria in the rule are alternatives that permit broker-dealers to meet
the objectives of the rule.

305

See sections II.B.1.c.iii. and II.B.1.d.iii., supra.

92

3.

Rule 10b-10

In adopting the amendments to Rule 10b-10, the Commission considered not deleting
paragraph (a)(8) as proposed. The Commission also considered requiring broker-dealers to
disclose alternative information relating to the credit risk of certain debt securities. The
Commission determined, however, that requiring the disclosure of alternative information
regarding credit risk associated with debt securities similar to that required by paragraph (a)(8)
would be inconsistent with the goal of reducing investors’ reliance on credit ratings. Elevating
an alternative measure of credit risk to the status now conferred upon NRSRO ratings by
paragraph (a)(8) would merely substitute one standard upon which investors may have come to
rely upon excessively for another. Prohibiting any reference to NRSRO credit ratings in
confirmations, however, would seem to go too far by preventing broker-dealers from including
information that they believe a reasonable investor would want to consider in particular
circumstances. The Commission also determined that substituting another credit risk-related
disclosure requirement for paragraph (a)(8) was unnecessary, given that credit risk information is
likely to be disclosed before a transaction for reasons independent of paragraph (a)(8), 306 and
given the other disclosures required by Rule 10b-10 in connection with transactions in certain
asset-backed securities. 307
V.

FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (“RFA”) 308 requires the Commission, in

promulgating rules, to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. An Initial Regulatory
306

See Confirmation of Transactions, at 59 FR 59617 (explaining that the information required by paragraph
(a)(8) should, in most cases, “verify information that was disclosed to the investor prior to the
transaction.”).

307

For example, in connection with transactions in certain asset-backed securities, paragraphs (a)(4) through
(a)(7) of Rule 10b-10 require disclosure of information relating to prepayment risk and yield information.

308

5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

93

Flexibility Act Analysis was prepared in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and
included in the proposing release. The Commission certified in the proposing release, pursuant
to section 605(b) of the RFA, 309 that the proposed rule would not, if adopted, have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Commission received no comments on this
certification.
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, small entities
include broker-dealers with total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than
$500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were
prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5 under the Exchange Act, 310 or, if not required to file such
statements, a broker or dealer that had total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of
less than $500,000 on the last day of the preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in
business, if shorter) and is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a
small business or small organization. 311
The amendments adopted today relating to the securities haircut provisions in Rule 15c31 and the conforming amendment to Rule 17a-4 will not have a significant economic impact on a
small number of entities. Only seven of the 434 broker-dealers that hold proprietary debt
positions are considered small for purposes of the RFA and, in the staff’s experience, brokerdealers with less than $500,000 in total capital typically hold very few proprietary securities
positions and, in particular, a small number of debt securities. Thus, there are few small entities
that will be impacted by these amendments. In addition, the amendments allow broker-dealers
that hold these debt positions, including those broker-dealers that are considered small for
309

See 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

310

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d).

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(c).

94

purposes of the RFA, to establish policies and procedures that rely on only a few factors to keep
costs low. Further, a small broker-dealer could choose to take the 15% catchall haircut instead of
establishing policies and procedures if it determines such an approach is cost-effective.
Accordingly, the amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities because even if the small entities have to change their current process,
they can do so in such a way to minimize economic impact and still comply with the rule
amendments.
The amendment to Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1 will not result in a significant impact on
small entities. Although the definition of major market foreign currency will change, the
Commission does not intend that the currencies that meet the definition of major market foreign
currency will change because the currency will still have to have a substantial inter-bank forward
currency market. Consequently, the amendments should not have a significant impact on brokerdealers, including small broker-dealers. Furthermore, the broker-dealers that operate under
Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1 generally are market makers and trading firms that are not small
entities as defined in Rule 0-10.
The amendments to the Appendices E and F to Rule 15c3-1 (which include conforming
amendments to Appendix G to Rule 15c3-1 and the General Instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part
IIB) will not apply to small entities. Appendices E and G apply to ANC broker-dealers and
Appendix F and Form X-17A-5, Part IIB apply to OTC derivatives dealers. The ANC brokerdealers and the OTC derivatives dealers are not small entities as defined in Rule 0-10.
The amendments to Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3 will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. As noted above, the OCC is the only clearing agency
that meets the criteria to qualify for the debit for purposes of the reserve computation. The fact

95

that the OCC meets the criteria to qualify for the debit is well understood among broker-dealers,
including small broker-dealers.
The amendment to Rule 10b-10 will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. While a number of the broker-dealers that effect
transactions in the debt securities currently subject to paragraph (a)(8) may be small entities, the
Commission believes that it is uncommon for small broker-dealers to issue confirmations. 312
The Commission does not have a precise numerical estimate of the small broker-dealers that
issue confirmations in connection with transactions in securities covered by paragraph (a)(8).
The Commission believes, however, that the number is unlikely to be significant. In addition,
the Commission continues to believe that the proposed amendment should not result in any
significant change to the cost of providing confirmations to customers in connection with
transactions in securities covered by paragraph (a)(8). Consequently, the Commission continues
to believe that the removal of paragraph (a)(8) from Rule 10b-10 should not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
For the reasons described above, the Commission again certifies that the amendments to
Rule 15c3-1, Appendices A, E, F, and G to Rule 15c3-1, Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-4,
the General Instructions to Form X-17A-5, Part IIB, and Rule 10b-10 will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

(I) In order to apply a deduction under paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(E), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(1),
(c)(2)(vi)(F)(2), or (c)(2)(vi)(H) of this section, the broker or dealer must assess the
creditworthiness of the security or money market instrument pursuant to policies and procedures
for assessing and monitoring creditworthiness that the broker or dealer establishes, documents,

99

maintains, and enforces. The policies and procedures must be reasonably designed for the
purpose of determining whether a security or money market instrument has only a minimal
amount of credit risk. Policies and procedures that are reasonably designed for this purpose
should result in assessments of creditworthiness that typically are consistent with market data. A
broker-dealer that opts not to make an assessment of creditworthiness under this paragraph may
not apply the deductions under paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(E), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(1), (c)(2)(vi)(F)(2), or
