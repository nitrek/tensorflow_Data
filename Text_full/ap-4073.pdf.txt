ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE
AND TO SHOW CAUSE

On July 19, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. On August 4, 2016, I issued an order finding that the OIP was served on all
Respondents, in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii) and (iv), by July 29, 2016.
Algorex Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4041, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2687. Respondents’
answers were due by August 11, 2016. Id.
Respondents have not filed answers to the OIP, did not participate in the prehearing
conference on August 11, 2016, and have not otherwise defended the proceeding. See id. At the
prehearing conference, the Division of Enforcement stated that no Respondent had
communicated with the Division. Accordingly, I ORDER Respondents to SHOW CAUSE by
August 29, 2016, why the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default for
their failures to timely file answers, participate in a prehearing conference, and otherwise defend
the proceeding. Failure to respond to this order will result in the revocation of Respondents’
registered securities. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).
