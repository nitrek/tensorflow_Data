Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. §
201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has filed with the Commission the proposed

Securities LLC and Mark Shaw. The Distribution Plan provides for the distribution of
monies to customers of BNY Mellon Securities LLC (“Mellon Securities”) harmed by:
(a) Mellon Securities’ failure reasonably to supervise, from November 1999 through
March 2008, the manager on its institutional order desk, Mark Shaw; and (b) Shaw’s
best execution fraud, in which he manipulated time delays in systems for executing
agency cross trades on a regional exchange to advantage a handful of accounts held by
individuals and hedge funds at the expense of accounts belonging to various employee
stock purchase plans, employee stock option plans, direct purchase and sale plans, and
similar plans (collectively, “Plan Customers”), and directed traders under his
supervision to do the same. On January 14, 2011, the Commission issued an Order
Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions against

1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order
against Mark Shaw (Exchange Act Rel. No. 63725).
