In the Matter of
GARY L. MCDUFF

ORDER REGARDING
TRANSCRIPT CORRECTIONS

The hearing in this proceeding took place on June 15 and 16, 2016, at FCI Beaumont,
Texas.
On August 15, 2016, Gary L. McDuff filed a letter that listed his proposed corrections to
the hearing transcript. The filed version is missing two pages; a complete version, identified by
McDuff as RX 71, was filed as an attachment to McDuff’s post-hearing brief on August 26,
2016. On August 29, 2016, McDuff filed a second letter, to which was attached an email on the
topic from Division counsel, in which Division counsel concurred with the majority of McDuff’s
proposed corrections and proposed one correction herself (with which McDuff concurred). And
on September 1, 2016, McDuff formally moved to implement his proposed transcript
corrections. This order rules on that motion. Although I too concur with most of the proposed
changes, some are not appropriate based on the context, the record, and my own recollection. In
particular, there are numerous references to “Steven Kaufman” and “Mr. Kaufman” that are
phonetically accurate but that consistently misspell the name, which is Stephen Coffman.
The following corrections (other than the spelling of Stephen Coffman’s name) are
therefore made to the hearing transcript:
