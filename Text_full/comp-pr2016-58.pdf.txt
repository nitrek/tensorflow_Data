COMPLAINT

ECFCASE

16-CV-

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") alleges the following
against defendants Andrew W.W. Caspersen ("Caspersen") and Irving Place III SPV, LLC
("Irving Place III SPV," and together with Caspersen, "Defendants"):
SUMMARY
I.

Since at least October 2015 and continuing until the present, Caspersen, a

securities professional associated with a registered broker-dealer, has solicited approximately

Case 1:16-cv-02249 Document 1 Filed 03/28/16 Page 2 of 8

$95 million in investments from two investors, offering promissory notes issued by defendant
Irving Place III SPV and carrying a 15% annual interest rate. Irving Place III SPV, however, is
nothing more than a shell entity formed and solely owned and controlled by Caspersen. It
appears to have no legitimate business. By false and misleading statements, in November 2015,
Caspersen obtained a $25 million investment, which was wired to Irving Place III SPV's bank
account. Caspersen then simply took control of the funds for his personal use. Using false and
misleading statements, Caspersen has since (so far unsuccessfully) solicited, and has continued
to solicit, at least an additional $70 million.
2.

By this action, the Commission seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten

gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

VIOLATIONS
3.

Based on the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Caspersen and Irving Place III

SPV violated Sections l 7(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. §§
77q(a)], and Section lO(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C.

§ 78j(b)] and Exchange Act Rule lOb-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.lOb-5].
NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND RELIEF SOUGHT
4.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to authority conferred by Section

20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 2l(d)(l) of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. § 78u(d)(l}], seeking to permanently enjoin the Defendants from engaging in the acts,
practices, transactions and courses of business alleged herein. The Commission also seeks a final
judgment: (i) ordering Defendants to disgorge, on a joint and several basis, all their ill-gotten
gains and to pay prejudgment interest thereon; and (ii) imposing civil money penalties pursuant
to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)] and Section 2l(d)(3) of the Exchange

2

Case 1:16-cv-02249 Document 1 Filed 03/28/16 Page 3 of 8

Act (15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)].
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
5.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, Sections

20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), and 77v(a)] and
Sections 21(d), 2l(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].
6.

Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 139l(b)(2), Section 22(a)

of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §
78aa]. A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in
the Southern District of New York. For instance, Caspersen orchestrated the illegal conduct
alleged herein from this district. Caspersen also resides in this district.
7.

In connection with the conduct alleged in this complaint, the Defendants, directly

or indirectly, have made use of the means or instruments of transportation or communication in,
and the means or instrumentalities of, interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of the facilities of
a national securities exchange.
DEFENDANTS
8.

Caspersen, age 39, is a resident of New York City and Bronxville, NY. Since

January 2013, he has been a managing principal of his employer, a broker-dealer registered with
the Commission. Between 2003 and 2012, Caspersen was a principal at a private equity firm
based in London, U.K. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 2002 and Princeton
University in 1999.
9.

Irving Place III SPV is a Delaware limited liability company that Caspersen

founded in 2015. Irving Place III SPV and its bank account are controlled by Caspersen.

Case 1:16-cv-02249 Document 1 Filed 03/28/16 Page 4 of 8

FACTS
10.

In October 2015, Caspersen solicited a $25 million investment from "Investor l,"

a non-profit charitable affiliate of an investment limited partnership. Caspersen offered Investor
1 a promissory note issued by Irving Place III SPV. The promissory note promised 15% annual
interest, payable quarterly, and was fully redeemable on 90 days' notice. While soliciting this
investment, Caspersen told Investor 1 that its $25 million investment would be secured by
approximately $900 million of assets of Irving Place Capital Partners III SPV.
11.

When Caspersen created his LLC, he deceptively named it Irving Place III SPV,

so that others would deem it affiliated with Irving Place Capital Partners III SPV, a legitimate
private equity fund not associated with Caspersen. Unlike Irving Place Capital Partners III SPV,
Irving Place III SPV had no legitimate business. Rather, Irving Place III SPV is only a vehicle to
solicit money from investors, and its only asset is a bank account controlled by Caspersen.
12.

To facilitate this offering, Caspersen drafted a promissory note and a security

agreement, and he apparently signed these documents on behalf of Irving Place III SPV using the
fictitious name, John Nelson. The note and agreement memorialized the offering terms of the
investment that Caspersen had solicited from Investor 1.
13.

On November 5, 2016, Investor I made its $25 million investment using wire

instructions provided by Caspersen, and transferred the $25 million to Irving Place III SPV's
bank account at Bank of America, an account controlled by Caspersen.
14.

Caspersen thereafter simply took control of these funds for his personal use.

15.

While soliciting this investment, Caspersen and Irving Place III SPV misleadingly

did not disclose to Investor 1 that: (i) they were not associated with Irving Place Capital Partners
III SPV nor were they authorized to grant a security interest; (ii) Irving Place III SPV was solely

4

Case 1:16-cv-02249 Document 1 Filed 03/28/16 Page 5 of 8

controlled by Caspersen and had no legitimate business; and (iii) Caspersen intended to use the
investment proceeds for his personal use.
16.

In March 2016, Caspersen solicited an additional $20 million investment from

Investor 1 and a $50 million investment from another potential investor. During these
solicitations, Caspersen made similar misleading representations as he had with Investor 1's $25
million investment.
17.

By this time, however, Investor 1 had become suspicious of the source of the first

interest payment received from Irving Place III SPV, and told Caspersen that it would not invest
more money and wanted to redeem its $25 million investment.

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act
(Caspersen and Irving Place III SPV)
18.

The Commission re-alleges and incorporates by reference herein each and every

allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 17 of this Complaint.
19.

From at least October 2015 to the present, Caspersen and Irving Place III SPY,

directly or indirectly, singly or in concert, by use of the means or instruments of transportation or
communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, in the offer or sale of securities, have: (a)
employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud; (b) obtained money or property by means of
untrue statements of material fact, or have omitted to state material facts necessary in order to
make statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; and (c) engaged in transactions, practices and courses of business which operated or
would have operated as a fraud or deceit upon purchasers.
20.

By reason of the foregoing, Caspersen and Irving Place III SPV have violated,

and, unless enjoined, are reasonably likely to continue to violate, Section 17(a) of the Securities
5

Case 1:16-cv-02249 Document 1 Filed 03/28/16 Page 6 of 8

Act (15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)].

SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violation of Section lO(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule lOb-5
(Caspersen and Irving Place III SPV)
21.

The Commission re-alleges and incorporates by reference herein each and every

allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 17 of this Complaint.
22.

From at least October 2015 to the present, Caspersen and Irving Place III SPV,

directly or indirectly, singly or in concert, by use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce, or of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange, in connection
with the purchase or sale of securities, have: (a) employed devices, schemes and artifices to
defraud; (b}made untrue statements of material fact, or omitted to state material facts necessary
in order to make statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; and (c) engaged in acts, practices and courses of business which operated or would
have operated as a fraud or deceit upon investors.
23.

By reason of the foregoing, Caspersen and Irving Place III SPV have violated,

and, unless enjoined, are reasonably likely to continue to violate, Section IO(b) of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule lOb-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.lOb-5].
