In the Matter of
MULTI-CORP. INTERNATIONAL, INC.,

INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
AS TO TWO RESPONDENTS
October 24, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registrations of the registered securities of Multi-Corp.
International, Inc., and Sky Harvest Energy Corp. (the Two Respondents) due to their failures to
timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.1
INTRODUCTION
On August 31, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding with an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP
alleges that the Two Respondents have securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g) and are delinquent in their periodic filings. The Two Respondents
were served with the OIP by September 8 and their answers were due September 21, 2016.
Multi-Corp. Int’l, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4190, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3612, at *1
(ALJ Sept. 23, 2016). When the Two Respondents failed to file answers, I ordered them to show
cause by October 3, 2016, why the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by
default due to their failures to file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding. Id. at *1-2. To
date, the Two Respondents have not filed answers, responded to the show cause order, or
otherwise defended this proceeding.

This initial decision does not apply to Respondent Pan American Goldfields Ltd., which
previously consented to an order revoking its securities. See Multi-Corp. Int’l, Inc., Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 78878, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3522 (Sept. 20, 2016).

FINDINGS OF FACT
The Two Respondents are in default for failing to file answers or otherwise defend the
proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, I find the following
allegations in the OIP to be true. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a).
Multi-Corp. International, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1405260, is a defaulted
Nevada corporation located in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended March 31, 2013, which reported a net loss of over $1.06 million for the prior
three months. As of August 25, 2016, the company’s common stock was quoted on OTC Link
operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (formerly “Pink Sheets”) (OTC Link), had seven market
makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
Sky Harvest Energy Corp., CIK No. 1332445, is a Nevada corporation located in Warren,
Ohio, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having
not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended May 31, 2013,
which reported a net loss of $115,841 for the prior three months. As of August 25, 2016, the
company’s common stock was quoted on OTC Link, had four market makers, and was eligible
for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, the Two Respondents
failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation
Finance requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failure to
maintain valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not
receive such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file
annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R.
§§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be
subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act
Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. See SEC v. McNulty, 137
F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). The
Two Respondents failed to file timely periodic reports and as a result violated Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.

SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
The Two Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because the
failures constitute violations of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). The Two
Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file periodic reports.
See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at
*20 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS
1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008). The Two Respondents are also culpable because they failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance, and were therefore
on notice, even before the OIP issued, of their obligation to file periodic reports. See ChinaBiotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4,
2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even without proof that a respondent was aware
of its reporting obligations). Finally, the Two Respondents have not answered the OIP,
responded to the show cause order, or otherwise participated in the proceeding to address
whether they have made any efforts to remedy their past violations. They have also made no
assurances against further violations.
For these reasons, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke
the registrations of each class of the Two Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrations of each class of registered securities of Multi-Corp. International, Inc., and Sky
Harvest Energy Corp. are REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Commission Rule of Practice 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of
3

the initial decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct
a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a
petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a
manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
