File No. 3-16509

In the Matter of
EDWARD M. DASPIN, a/k/a “EDWARD (ED) MICHAEL”;
LUIGI AGOSTINI; and
LAWRENCE R. LUX

PROTECTIVE ORDER

After finding Edward M. Daspin in default, I ordered the Division of Enforcement to file
a motion for sanctions by April 6, 2016, allowed Daspin to file an opposition by April 27, and
the Division a reply by May 9. Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3713,
2016 SEC LEXIS 1000, at *6 (ALJ Mar. 16, 2016). I noted that Daspin’s opposition could
include an inability to pay defense, which “should be accompanied by a [Form D-A].” Id. On
April 1, Daspin filed portions of that form and certain tax documents, as well as a motion which I
construe as a request that this information be subject to a protective order pursuant to
Commission Rule of Practice 322, 17 C.F.R. § 201.322.1
So construed, the motion is GRANTED. Rule 322(b) provides that “[d]ocuments and
testimony introduced in a public hearing are presumed to be public. A motion for a protective
order shall be granted only upon a finding that the harm resulting from disclosure would
outweigh the benefits of disclosure.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.322(b). Daspin’s Form D-A and attached
tax documents contain detailed personal financial information. I find that the harm resulting
from disclosure of this information outweighs the benefits of disclosure.

Daspin’s motion also requests that his medical information remain sealed. As his motion
acknowledges, his medical records and related filings are already subject to a protective order.
