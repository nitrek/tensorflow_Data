In the Matter of

ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

DANIEL CHRISTIAN STANLEY POWELL
On April 19, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Respondent was served with the OIP on May 9 and his answer was originally due May
31. Daniel Christian Stanley Powell, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3861, 2016 SEC LEXIS
1822 (ALJ May 23, 2016). On May 26, I held a telephonic prehearing conference at which both
the Division of Enforcement and Respondent appeared. Daniel Christian Stanley Powell,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3880, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1908 (ALJ May 27, 2016). Although
the parties advised that settlement discussions were ongoing, I ordered Respondent to file an
answer by June 21, and the Division to file a motion for summary disposition by July 1, in the
event no settlement occurred. Id. The parties have not indicated that any settlement has
occurred, and to date, Respondent has not filed an answer.
Accordingly, I ORDER Respondent to SHOW CAUSE by July 11, 2016, why this
proceeding should not be determined against him due to his failure to file an answer. See 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
The Division should proceed with filing its motion on July 1. In the event Respondent is
found in default, I will construe the Division’s motion as one for sanctions rather than for
summary disposition. The Division’s motion shall address what sanctions are in the public
interest and shall include a discussion of the public interest factors under Steadman v. SEC, 603
F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981), with citations to
supporting evidence. Supporting evidence should include a declaration identifying each exhibit
with a short description. In addition to the required filing with the Office of the Secretary, an
electronic courtesy copy should be emailed to alj@sec.gov in PDF text-searchable format.
Exhibits should be sent as separate attachments, not a combined PDF.
