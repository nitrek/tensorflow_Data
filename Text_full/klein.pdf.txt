BRIEF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
AMICUS CURIAE
___________________________________________
INTEREST OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
The Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency
principally responsible for the administration and enforcement of
the federal securities laws, submits this brief, amicus curiae,
to address an important question concerning liability in private
lawsuits, and possibly certain Commission actions, brought under
the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws:
Is a person who makes a material misrepresentation,
while acting with the requisite scienter, but who does
not himself disseminate the misrepresentation to
investors, and whose name is not made known to them,

only an aider and abettor of the fraud, or is that
person a primary violator subject to liability?
In the Commission's view, such a person is a primary violator of
the antifraud provisions.
The question arises because the Supreme Court, in Central
Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A.,
511 U.S. 164 (1994), ruled that private actions cannot be brought
against persons who aid and abet violations of Section 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), and Rule
10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5, but only against "primary
violators."

The Supreme Court, however, expressly stated that

persons like lawyers, accountants, bankers, or others who provide
services to the central figures in a fraud, can be liable in
private actions as primary violators, along with the central
figures, when such "secondary actors" make misrepresentations.
511 U.S. at 191.

This case involves the circumstances under

which a law firm may be deemed to have "made" misrepresentations
and thus may be adjudged to be a primary violator.
Meritorious private actions under the federal securities
laws serve an important role, both because they provide
compensation for investors who have been harmed by securities law
violations and because, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly
recognized, they "provide `a most effective weapon in the
enforcement' of the securites laws and are `a necessary

- 2 2

supplement to Commission action.'"

Bateman Eichler, Hill

Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U.S. 299, 310 (1985), quoting J.I.
Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 432 (1964).

See also Blue Chip

Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 730 (1975).

Congress,

in adopting the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
Pub. L. No. 104-67, affirmed that "[p]rivate securities
litigation is an indispensable tool with which defrauded
investors can recover their losses" and that private lawsuits
"promote public and global confidence in our capital markets and
help to deter wrongdoing and guarantee that corporate officers,
auditors, directors, lawyers and others properly perform their
jobs."

Conference Report on Securities Litigation Reform, H.R.

Rep. No. 369, 104th Congress, 1st Sess. 31 (1995).
The Commission has a further interest in this case, beyond
its implications for private actions.

Because Central Bank was a

private action, the Supreme Court did not explicitly address the
Commission's authority to bring actions against aiders and
abettors.

After Central Bank, Congress reaffirmed the

Commission's authority to bring such actions in the Litigation
Reform Act.
78t(f).

Securities Exchange Act Section 20(f), 15 U.S.C.

Nonetheless, a decision in this case delineating the

circumstances in which a person is a primary violator could
affect the Commission's litigating authority in several areas.

- 3 3

First, assuming the Central Bank holding applies to the
Commission, the courts have not resolved (except in one
circuit 1/) whether the Congressional reaffirmation of the
Commission's aiding and abetting authority is to be applied
retroactively.

Thus, it is unclear whether the Commission may

proceed against persons as aiders and abettors whose fraudulent
conduct occurred before Congress enacted the Litigation Reform
Act.

Second, the provision in the Litigation Reform Act

reaffirming the Commission's authority to sue aiders and abettors
requires a showing that the defendant provided assistance
knowingly, thus raising a question about whether the scienter
element in a securities fraud action against an aider and abettor
can be satisfied by the reckless conduct that is sufficient to
make a defendant liable as a primary violator.

Third and

finally, this case could have a bearing upon the Commission's
authority to proceed against violators of the antifraud
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq..
The Supreme Court's rejection of aiding and abetting liability
under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act could be
applied to the Securities Act as well.

The Litigation Reform

Act, however, does not give the Commission authority to proceed
against aiders and abettors of violations of the Securities Act.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
1.

The Facts

Defendant Drinker Biddle & Reath, a Philadelphia law firm,
was retained in 1992 by William Coleman, a securities salesman
with a long history of regulatory troubles and customer
complaints, to assist in setting up a brokerage firm, Mercer
Securities, Ltd.

District Court slip op. at 4-5.

The plaintiffs, who were social acquaintances and customers
of Coleman, made two series of limited partnership investments in
Mercer.

Id. at 2, 3-5.

this case.

Only the second series is at issue in

The first series, however, is relevant because it

bears on whether Drinker Biddle & Reath knew of Coleman's
disciplinary history and the customer complaints against him.
In the first series of investments, in the fall of 1992, the
plaintiffs were solicited by Coleman and invested money before
the law firm had completed the partnership agreement and
accompanying disclosure documents.

Id. at 3.

In February 1993,

Drinker Biddle & Reath completed a disclosure package for
investors that included details of outstanding state supervisory
orders and judgments entered against Coleman.

Id. at 4.

The law

firm gave the package to a principal of Mercer to give to
investors.

Ibid.

When the law firm partner handling Mercer matters learned
some months later that the disclosure package had not been given
- 5 5

to the investors, he urged Mercer officials to forward the
information to them immediately.

Id. at 5.

The plaintiffs

allege that they never received the February disclosure package.
Id. at 4.
In the fall of 1993, Coleman solicited the plaintiffs to
make further investments in Mercer.

Id. at 5.

For this second

series of investments, Drinker Biddle & Reath prepared a new
disclosure package, which the plaintiffs were given.

Ibid.

The

plaintiffs allege that the new disclosure package, unlike the
first one, did not contain information about outstanding state
supervisory orders, judgments entered, and customer complaints
against Coleman.

Id. at 6. 1/

The cover letter transmitting the

new disclosure package was signed by a Mercer principal, not by
Drinker Biddle & Reath, and the law firm's name did not appear in
the documents in the disclosure package.

Ibid.

Mercer eventually failed and the plaintiffs lost the money
they provided in the second series of investments.

Id.

The District Court's Decision

Plaintiffs allege that the second disclosure package
concealed adverse facts about Coleman, including his censure
by the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, consent orders
with Vermont and Minnesota barring him from certain brokerdealer positions, a four-year bar imposed by California
preventing him from holding any position as a broker-dealer
or investment advisor, his long history of customer
complaints of fraudulent conduct, and Mercer's agreement
with the National Association of Securities Dealers to limit
his conduct with clients. Id. at 6.
- 6 6

The district court dismissed plaintiffs' Section 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5 securities fraud claim against Drinker Biddle & Reath
because, even though the law firm had prepared documents that
were given to investors, it did not sign those documents and its
name did not appear in them.

Id. at 64-65.

The district court

noted that the plaintiffs had no direct communication with the
law firm and did not know that it was involved with Mercer.

Id.

at 65.
The district court also ruled that the plaintiffs had not
presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of
material fact as to whether Drinker Biddle & Reath had scienter.
Id. at 65-68.

3.

The Panel's Decision

A panel of this Court reversed the district court's grant of
summary judgment on the federal securities fraud claim.

The

panel noted that when the Supreme Court ruled in Central Bank
that there was no private cause of action for aiding and
abetting, it was careful to state that there could still be
liability for "secondary actors" -- i.e., "those who provide
services to participants in the securities business" (Central
Bank, 511 U.S. at 188).

Panel slip op. at 15.

Such a secondary

actor can be liable if he or she "`makes a material misstatement

- 7 7

(or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities
relies.'"

Id. at 15, quoting Central Bank, 511 U.S. at 191.

The panel held that, despite the fact that Drinker Biddle &
Reath was not identified in any of the documents that went to
investors, it could be liable because
"lawyers and other secondary actors who significantly
participate in the creation of their client's
misrepresentations, to such a degree that they may
fairly be deemed authors or co-authors of those
misrepresentations, should be held accountable as
primary violators under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5
even when the lawyers or other secondary actors are not
identified to the investors, assuming the other
requirements of primary liability are met."
Id. at 18.

When a lawyer elects to speak, the panel stated, he

or she has a duty to speak truthfully, even when speaking "behind
the scenes."

Id. at 20.

A lawyer who prepares a document

knowing that it will be given to investors "has elected to speak
to the investors, even though the document not may be facially
attributed to the lawyer."

Ibid.

In response to Drinker Biddle & Reath's argument that the
plaintiffs had not shown reliance because they did not know of
the law firm's involvement, the panel held that the federal
securities laws require a plaintiff to demonstrate "reliance on
- 8 8

the misleading statement; they do not require the plaintiff to
demonstrate that he or she relied on the defendant's role in the
preparation or dissemination of the statement."

Id. at 18

(emphasis in original).
The panel made clear that a lawyer who only provides
"substantial assistance" to a client, and who could have been
liable as an aider and abettor before Central Bank eliminated
aiding and abetting liability in private actions, would not be
liable under the panel's test.

In the panel's view, a person

"has done more than provide mere substantial assistance" when his
or her involvement was "sufficiently significant that the
[fraudulent] statement can properly be attributed to the person
as its author or co-author."

Id. at 20-21; see also id. at 22.

With respect to the law firm's scienter, the panel reversed
the district court's ruling that the plaintiffs had not presented
sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.
The panel stated that a trier of fact could reasonably find that
the law firm knew that investors never received the earlier
disclosure package that included material information about
Coleman's regulatory difficulties, and that the law firm prepared
the second disclosure package without including this information.
Id. at 24.

The panel also stated that a trier of fact could

reasonably infer from the evidence that the law firm concealed
this information so that the plaintiffs would not withdraw their
- 9 9

investments, Mercer would remain solvent, and Drinker Biddle &
Reath would not be exposed to liability as a result of "possible
oversights in [its] representation of Mercer LP."

Id. at 24-25.

ARGUMENT
I.

A RULE THAT IMPOSES LIABILITY ONLY WHEN A PERSON IS
IDENTIFIED TO INVESTORS IS INCONSISTENT WITH
CENTRAL BANK AND THE LANGUAGE OF SECTION 10(b).
The Supreme Court cautioned in Central Bank that the

elimination of aiding and abetting liability in private actions
does not mean that only the central figure in a securities fraud
is liable.

The Supreme Court stated that "secondary actors"

could be liable as well:
"The absence of § 10(b) aiding and abetting liability
does not mean that secondary actors in the securities
markets are always free from liability under the
Securities Acts.

Any person or entity, including a

lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative
device or makes a material misstatement (or omission)
on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may
be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5, assuming
all of the requirements for primary liability under
Rule 10b-5 are met.

In any complex securities fraud,

moreover, there are likely to be multiple violators
* * *."

- 10 10

511 U.S. at 191 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). 1/
The issue in this case is whether, as Drinker Biddle & Reath
contends, the phrase "makes a material misstatement (or
omission)" means that a law firm or other secondary actor can be
primarily liable for a misrepresentation only if it signs the
document containing the misrepresentation or is otherwise
identified to investors.

Drinker Biddle & Reath argues, in

effect, that even if it prepared a disclosure package for
investors that it knew was materially false or misleading, it
cannot be liable under Central Bank because the disclosure
package did not reveal its identity.

Thus, in Drinker Biddle &

Reath's view, "[p]articipation in the drafting, no matter how
significant," cannot by itself result in liability.

Rehearing

Petition at 6. 1/

3/

The phrase "employs a manipulative or deceptive device" is
from Section 10(b); the phrase "makes a material
misstatement (or omission)" follows the language of Rule
10b-5(b).

4/

In support of its position, Drinker Biddle & Reath cites,
inter alia, Anixter v. Home-Stake Production Co., 77 F.3d
1215, 1226-27 (10th Cir. 1996), and Shapiro v. Cantor, 123
F.3d 717, 720-21 (2d Cir. 1997). Rehearing Petition at 3,
5, n.3. Those cases, however, involved very different
factual situations, and therefore do not provide guidance
for this case. In Anixter, the defendant was an accounting
firm that had actually signed fraudulent documents, and
therefore was liable under any standard. In Shapiro, the
defendant accounting firm was not alleged to have been
involved in creating any misrepresentation, but only to have
been aware that its client was making a misrepresentation.
- 11 11

This view of Central Bank is incorrect.

Nothing in Central

Bank indicates that when the Supreme Court used the word "makes,"
it meant that only persons who sign documents or are otherwise
identified to investors can be primarily liable.

Indeed, such an

interpretation would be inconsistent with the language of Section
10(b), which makes it unlawful "for any person, directly or
indirectly * * * [t]o use or employ * * * any manipulative or
deceptive device or contrivance."

(Emphasis added.)

A person

who creates a misrepresentation, but takes care not to be
identified publicly with it, "indirectly" uses or employs a
deceptive device or contrivance and should be liable.
The rule Drinker Biddle & Reath proposes would have the
unfortunate and unwarranted consequence of providing a safe
harbor from liability for everyone except those identified with
misrepresentations by name.

Creators of misrepresentations could

escape liability as long as they concealed their identities. 1/
Not only outside lawyers would benefit from such a rule; others
who are retained to prepare information for dissemination to
investors, including accountants and public relations firms,
could immunize themselves by remaining anonymous.
5/

Indeed, in-

"Controlling persons" of those publicly identified as
responsible for the misrepresentation would be liable under
Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78t(a).
However, a person can be a creator of a misrepresentation
without controlling the person in whose name the
misrepresentation is issued.
- 12 12

house counsel and other corporate officials and employees could
avoid liability for misrepresentations they created, as long as
their identities were not made known to the public.

In sum, by

providing a safe harbor for anonymous creators of
misrepresentations, a rule that imposes liability only when a
person is identified with a misrepresentation would place a
premium on concealment and subterfuge rather than on compliance
with the federal securities laws.
Drinker Biddle & Reath contends that it was "the Supreme
Court's clear intention in Central Bank to adopt a bright-line
rule for imposing liability" in order to protect securities
lawyers from being named as defendants in securities fraud suits.
Rehearing Petition at 1, 6-7.

While the Supreme Court was

concerned that there should be limits on the liability of lawyers
and others who provide services to the central figures in a
securities fraud (see 511 U.S at 188-89), the bright line rule
Drinker Biddle & Reath advocates, with its resulting unwarranted
consequences, goes beyond any reasonable reading of Central Bank.
The Supreme Court did not set forth a bright line rule for
liability, much less one that turns on whether the identity of a
defendant is disclosed.

Indeed, the Supreme Court used the word

"makes" in discussing the involvement that could lead to
liability -- a word that requires further interpretation, as the
panel recognized.

Panel Slip Op. at 15 (discussing the need "to
- 13 13

clarify the circumstances under which a statement may fairly be
said to have been `made' by a secondary actor"). 1/
Drinker Biddle & Reath further contends that without a
bright-line test, lawyers will be named as defendants in every
securities fraud suit filed in this Circuit.

Id. at 6-7.

This

contention, however, fails to take into account the scienter
requirement, which gives lawyers (and other defendants)
substantial protection against frivolous securities fraud
lawsuits.

In a Section 10(b) securities fraud suit, the

plaintiff must both plead and prove that the defendant acted with
scienter, defined by this Court to mean deliberately or
recklessly.

Newton v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 135 F.3d 266,

273 (3d Cir. 1998) (en banc).
The scienter element has become particularly important at
the pleading stage of a suit in light of a key provision of the

6/

Nor did the Supreme Court forbid a fact-oriented test, as
Drinker Biddle & Reath contends, pointing to the Supreme
Court's discussion of policy arguments against such a test.
See Rehearing Petition at 6. Rather, the Supreme Court
discussed those arguments only to make the point that the
policy arguments that the Commission made in its Central
Bank brief in favor of aiding and abetting liability were
not determinative. Policy considerations, the Court stated,
could be taken into account "to the extent that they may
help to show that adherence to the text and structure would
lead to a result `so bizarre' that Congress could not have
intended it." 511 U.S. at 188 (citations omitted).
However, "[p]olicy considerations cannot override [the
Court's] interpretation of the text and structure of the
Act." Ibid.
- 14 14

Litigation Reform Act, which requires the plaintiff to "state
with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that
the defendant acted with [scienter]."

Securities Exchange Act

Section 21D(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(b)(2).

This requirement means

that a securities fraud plaintiff must state a strong and
specific case in order to avoid dismissal of his or her claim.
This protection substantially lessens the possibility that
plaintiffs will be able to bring frivolous suits against lawyers.
Moreover, the Litigation Reform Act provides for mandatory
sanctions against plaintiffs who fail to comply with the pleading
requirements.
78u-4(c).

Securities Exchange Act Section 21D(c), 15 U.S.C.

Thus, if the Court rejects Drinker Biddle & Reath's

bright line test, it is unlikely that there will be a flood of
lawsuits against lawyers in this Circuit.
Finally, Drinker Biddle & Reath contends that imposing
liability on it when the investors did not know of its
involvement in the creation of the misrepresentation would negate
the element of reliance required in a private action for
securities fraud.
is incorrect.

Rehearing Petition at 3, 6.

This contention

The reliance a plaintiff in a securities fraud

action must plead is reliance on a misrepresentation, not on the
fact that a particular person made that misrepresentation.

The

Supreme Court stated in Central Bank that liability exists where
"[a]ny person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank
- 15 15

* * * makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a
purchaser or seller of securities relies."
(emphasis added).

511 U.S. at 191

Thus, the Court placed the focus on the

misrepresentation, not on the fact that a particular person made
it.
Drinker Biddle & Reath nonetheless points to the Supreme
Court's statement that the argument made by the plaintiffs in
Central Bank "`would impose 10b-5 aiding and abetting liability
when at least one element critical for recovery under 10b-5 is
absent:

reliance.'"

Rehearing Petition at 3, quoting 511 U.S.

at 180.

This problem, it asserts, will be present unless there

is a requirement that a plaintiff rely on the person who makes
the representation.
Drinker Biddle & Reath, however, does not quote the entire
passage from Central Bank.

The Supreme Court went on to say that

"[w]ere we to allow the aiding and abetting action proposed in
this case, the defendant could be liable without any showing that
the plaintiff relied upon the aider and abettor's statements or
actions."

511 U.S. at 180 (emphasis added).

In Central Bank,

the defendant, a bank that had been the indenture trustee for a
defaulted bond issue, had not created any misrepresentations, but
had failed to update the appraisal for land securing the bonds.
The investors thus could not be said to have relied on any
misrepresentations "made" by the bank.
- 16 16

In contrast, the

plaintiffs in this case allege that Drinker Biddle & Reath
created the misrepresentations upon which the investors relied.
II.

A PERSON SHOULD BE LIABLE AS A PRIMARY VIOLATOR OF THE
SECURITIES LAWS WHEN HE OR SHE, ACTING ALONE OR WITH OTHERS,
CREATES A MISREPRESENTATION.
As we have shown in Argument I, Drinker Biddle & Reath is

incorrect in arguing that liability may be imposed only when a
defendant is identified to investors.

The correct standard, we

submit, is that when a person, acting alone or with others,
creates a misrepresentation, the person can be liable as a
primary violator -- assuming, of course, that he or she acts with
the requisite scienter.
While the Commission, as amicus curiae, takes no position as
to the truth of the allegations in the complaint, under the
Commission's standard those allegations, if proven to be true,
would establish that Drinker Biddle & Reath was a primary
violator of the antifraud provisions.
The Commission's proposed test makes clear that more than
one person may be involved in creating a misrepresentation.

As

the Supreme Court stated in Central Bank, "[i]n any complex
securities fraud * * * there are likely to be multiple [primary]
violators."

See 511 U.S. at 191.

Moreover, it would not be

necessary for a person to be the initiator of a misrepresentation
in order to be a primary violator.

Provided that a plaintiff can

plead and prove scienter, a person can be a primary violator if

he or she writes misrepresentations for inclusion in a document
to be given to investors, even if the idea for those
misrepresentations came from someone else.
Under the Commission's test, however, a person who prepares
a truthful and complete portion of a document would not be liable
as a primary violator for misrepresentations in other portions of
the document.

Even assuming such a person knew of

misrepresentations elsewhere in the document and thus had the
requisite scienter, he or she would not have created those
misrepresentations.
The test proposed by the Commission differs somewhat from
the test enunciated by the panel, which concluded that
"lawyers and other secondary actors who significantly
participate in the creation of their client's
misrepresentations, to such a degree that they may
fairly be deemed authors or co-authors of those
misrepresentations, should be held accountable as
primary violators under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5
even when the lawyers or other secondary actors are
not identified to the investor."
Panel slip op. at 18.

In the Commission's view, the panel's

phrase "significantly participate in the creation of their
client's misrepresentations" is susceptible to misinterpretation.
The phrase "significantly participate," although consistent with
responsibility for the creation of a misrepresentation, could
also be taken to encompass lesser degrees of involvement.
Drinker Biddle & Reath argues that the panel's test would make

defendants liable for conduct that is "indistinguishable" from
the aiding and abetting conduct held to be not actionable in
Central Bank.

Rehearing Petition at 2-3.

While the Commission

does not agree with this view, it recognizes some potential for
misinterpretation in the panel's formulation.

See Shapiro v.

Cantor, 123 F.3d 717, 720 (2d Cir. 1997) ("Allegations of
`assisting,' `participating in,' `complicity in' and similar
synonyms used throughout the complaint all fall within the
prohibitive bar of Central Bank.").

The Commission believes that

its proposed formulation -- "creates a misrepresentation, acting
alone or with others" -- will help to avoid this difficulty.
In sum, the word "makes" as used in Central Bank does not
have a precise meaning independent of the circumstances of the
particular case.

Drinker Biddle & Reath's test would define

"makes" as "signs."

But, as noted earlier, nothing in Central

Bank indicates that the Supreme Court meant to give such a
restrictive definition to the word, and indeed, such a definition
would be inconsistent with the "directly or indirectly" language
of Section 10(b).

The Commission believes that a test that looks

to what a secondary actor does in "creating a misrepresentation"
provides the appropriate focus for determining when the secondary
actor "makes" a misrepresentation.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission urges this Court
to hold that a person who has the requisite scienter can be
liable as a primary violator of Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder when he or she,
acting alone or with others, creates a misrepresentation, whether
or not the person is identified with the misrepresentation by
name.
