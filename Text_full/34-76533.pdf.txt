ORDER APPROVING
APPLICATION OF FUND
ADMINISTRATOR FOR
PAYMENT OF FEES
AND EXPENSES

On October 18, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Commission”) issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to
Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (“Order”)1 against two corporations, PacketPort.com, Inc. and Microphase
Corp. (“Microphase”), and five individuals, Ronald Durando (“Durando”), Robert H.
Jaffe (“Jaffe”), Gustave Dotoli (“Dotoli”), M. Christopher Agarwal, and Theodore
Kunzog (collectively, “Respondents”), for violations of the federal securities laws in
connection with a pump and dump scheme. Among other things, the Commission
ordered Respondents Microphase, Durando, Dotoli, and Jaffe to pay disgorgement
totaling $1,075,000 to the Commission. The disgorgement obligation was fully paid as

Securities Act Rel. No. 8858 (Oct. 18, 2007).

of October 15, 2008. The disgorgement paid by these Respondents, plus any
accumulated interest earned, less any taxes, fees, or expenses incurred in the
administration of the Final Plan of Distribution (“Plan”), constitutes the disgorgement
fund (“Disgorgement Fund”).
On October 6, 2011, the Commission issued an Order appointing Rust
Consulting, Inc. (“Rust”) as the Fund Administrator and setting the bond amount at
$1,075,000.2 On the same day, the Commission published the Notice of Proposed Plan
of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”).3 No comments were
received in response to the Notice. On December 12, 2011, the Commission issued an
Order Approving Distribution Plan.4
The Plan provides that the Fund Administrator shall be entitled to reasonable
fees in accordance with the cost proposal submitted to the Commission and shall be
entitled to reimbursement for reasonable costs and expenses from the Disgorgement
Fund. The fees and expenses for the administration of the Disgorgement Fund will be
paid first from interest earned on the invested funds, then, if not sufficient, from the
corpus. The Plan further required that the Fund Administrator obtain the required
bond in the amount of $1,075,000, and provided that the cost of the bond will be paid
first from interest earned on the invested funds, then, if not sufficient, from the corpus.
The Fund Administrator has submitted an invoice totaling $146,520.61 to
Commission staff that covers the period from its appointment on October 6, 2011 to
September 30, 2013. The Commission staff has reviewed the Fund Administrator’s
invoice, confirms that the services have been provided, and finds the fees and expenses
of $146,520.61 to be reasonable and in accordance with the Plan. The Commission
staff has requested that the Commission authorize the Office of Financial Management

(“OFM”) to pay the Fund Administrator’s invoiced fees and expenses of $146,520.61
from the Disgorgement Fund, and in addition to authorize OFM to pay, at the direction
of the Division of Enforcement’s Assistant Director of the Office of Distributions,
Logistics, and Services (“Assistant Director”), the Fund Administrator’s future fees
and expenses up to, but not to exceed, $25,000 per monthly invoice, so long as the
total amount paid to the Fund Administrator as of the date of the invoice to be paid
does not exceed the total amount of the cost proposal submitted by the Fund
Administrator by more than $5,000.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1105(d) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105(d),
that OFM pay the Fund Administrator’s fees and expenses in the amount of
$146,520.61. Further, OFM is authorized to pay, at the direction of the Assistant
Director, any future fees and expenses up to, but not to exceed, $25,000 per monthly
invoice, so long as the total amount paid to the Fund Administrator, as of the date of
the invoice to be paid, does not exceed the total amount of the cost proposal submitted
by the Fund Administrator by more than $5,000.
By the Commission.
