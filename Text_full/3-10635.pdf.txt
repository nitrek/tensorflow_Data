In the Matter of 

REPORT FOLLOWING 

PREHEAIUNG CONFERENCE 


TOKS INC.

On November 13, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission"),
acting pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, ordered a public hearing beginning
November 29, 2001, at 10:OO a.m., at the Commission's offices at 450 Fifth Street, N.W.,
Washington, DC 20549 to consider allegations by the Division of Enforcement ("Division") that
the registration statement filed by Toks Inc. ("Toks") on August 31, 2001, and amended on
September 7, 2001, contains untrue statements of material fact and omits material facts required
to be stated so as to make the statements presented not misleading ("OIP").
I scheduled a prehearing conference for November 26, 2001, after Ade Ogunjobi,
founder of Toks, informed me by a facsimile that a hearing on November 29, 2001, was
impossible because he had received an incomplete copy of the OIP. In response, the Division
submitted copies of certificates of service attesting to personal service of complete copies of
the OIP on both Toks and Mr. Ogunjobi, Also on November 20, 2001, the Division sent
Toks and Mr. Ogunjobi additional copies of the OIP.
Toks did not appear at the telephonic conference on November 26, 2001. Counsel for
the Division reported that Mr. Ogunjobi had left him a voice message on November 23, 2001,
saying that he would not participate in the prehearing conference. The Division requested that
the hearing proceed on November 29, 2001, as scheduled so that it could submit evidence.
including a transcription of the voice mail it received on November 23, 2001. I granted the
Division's request. Mr. Ogunjobi should be aware that failure by Toks to appear at the
hearing will almost certainly result in a ruling that is adverse to Toks.
