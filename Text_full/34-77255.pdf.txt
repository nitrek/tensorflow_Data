I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors to accept the Offer of Settlement submitted by Lazare

of Practice of the Commission, 17 C.F.R. § 201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement of these
proceedings initiated against Respondent on December 8, 2015, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order
Making Findings and Revoking Registration of Securities Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to Lazare Kaplan International, Inc. (“Order”), as set forth

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that 1 :
1.
Lazare Kaplan (CIK No. 202375) is a Delaware corporation located in New
York, New York. At all times relevant to this proceeding, the securities of Lazare Kaplan

Kaplan’s stock (symbol “LKII”) was quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink Sheets”)
operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. on an unsolicited basis only.
2.
Lazare Kaplan has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and
Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder because it has not filed quarterly and annual reports
with the Commission since the period ended February 28, 2009.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), registration of each class of Respondent’s
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be, and hereby is, revoked.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
