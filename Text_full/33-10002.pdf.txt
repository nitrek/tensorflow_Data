ORDER AND PENALTIES PURSUANT TO
SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933 AND SECTION 21C OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
AS TO MILLER ENERGY RESOURCES,
INC.

I.
On August 6, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) instituted
proceedings pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section
21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Miller Energy Resources,
Inc. (“Miller Energy” or “Respondent”).
II.
Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has
determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings
brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party and without

admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over it and the
subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this
Order Making Findings and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order and Penalties Pursuant to
Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 As To Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (the “Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
SUMMARY
1.
This case involves financial accounting and reporting fraud, as well as audit
failures, related to the valuation of certain oil and gas assets acquired by Miller Energy, an oil and
gas company headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Miller Energy purchased these assets, which
are located in Alaska, for $2.25 million in cash – along with the assumption of certain liabilities it
valued at approximately $2 million – during a competitive bid in a bankruptcy proceeding in
December 2009.
2.
The Company subsequently reported those assets at an overstated value of $480
million, and recognized a one-time “bargain purchase” gain of $277 million for its fiscal third
quarter ended January 2010 and fiscal year ended April 2010.
3.
Miller Energy failed to account for the acquisition in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805,
Business Combinations, required Miller Energy to record the value of its acquired Alaska assets at
“fair value.” However, contrary to authoritative accounting guidance, Miller Energy’s then-CFO
(“CFO”) used as fair value a reserve report that was prepared by a petroleum engineer firm using
the rules for supplemental oil and gas disclosures. As set forth in GAAP, the numbers used in
these supplemental disclosures do not reflect fair value, and the reserve report used by the CFO
expressly disclaimed that the numbers therein represented the engineer firm’s opinion of fair value.
The reserve report the CFO used also contained expense numbers that were knowingly understated
by the CEO of Miller Energy’s Alaska operations (“Alaska CEO”). In addition, the CFO double
counted $110 million of certain fixed assets that were already included in the reserve report.
RESPONDENT
4.
Miller Energy Resources, Inc. is a Tennessee corporation with its principal place
of business in Knoxville, Tennessee. It operates and develops oil and gas wells in north and south
central Alaska. The Company operated oil and gas assets in the Appalachian region of east
Tennessee until selling them in November 2014 for $3.3 million in cash. It changed its name from
The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding

Miller Petroleum to Miller Energy Resources in April 2011. Miller Energy’s securities, registered
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b), were listed on the NYSE until September 2015, when the
securities were delisted. On October 1, 2015, Miller Energy filed a voluntary petition for
reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Alaska (the “Bankruptcy Case”).
FACTS
Background
5.
Miller Energy was founded in 1967 as an oil and gas exploration and production
company, and went public via a reverse merger in 1996. Between early 2002 and December 2009,
Miller Energy’s stock price regularly traded below one dollar per share, falling to a low of $0.04
per share in December 2007. In August 2008, Miller Energy named a new CEO. Soon thereafter,
the Company began acquiring additional oil and gas properties.
Miller Energy Acquires and Overvalues the Alaska Assets
6.
In the fall of 2009, Miller Energy became aware of certain oil and gas properties in
Alaska that were in the process of being “abandoned” as part of the bankruptcy proceedings of a
California-based energy company.
7.
Unable to service its heavy debt and pay the significant monthly costs required to
operate the properties, the bankrupt entity unsuccessfully sought for almost a year to sell its Alaska
assets. Beginning in December 2008, months before it filed for bankruptcy, the former owner of
the assets, with the help of one of the world’s leading financial advisory and asset management
firms, marketed the same group of assets that Miller Energy ultimately bought to 40 potential
buyers. This process failed to attract any bidders, and the assets were auctioned by the bankruptcy
court in July 2009, with the winning bidder agreeing to a total purchase price of $8 million for the
assets. A second entity, who bid $7 million, was designated as the back-up purchaser. Neither
bidder closed.
8.
As a result, the former owner of the assets sought in August 2009, and was granted
in September, an order from the bankruptcy court allowing it to abandon title to the assets due to a
lack of interest.
9.
Due to renewed interest in the assets following their abandonment from Miller
Energy, the bankruptcy court permitted the debtor to reacquire the Alaska assets and sell them to
Miller Energy in a competitive auction for $2.25 million in cash and the assumption of certain
limited liabilities. The transaction closed on December 10, 2009.
10.
On March 22, 2010, Miller Energy filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for its
fiscal third quarter ended January 31, 2010 and reported a value of $480 million for the Alaska
acquisition, which amount was comprised of $368 million for oil and gas properties and $110
million for fixed assets. Miller Energy also reported an after-tax $277 million “bargain purchase
gain,” which boosted net income for the quarter to $272 million – an enormous increase over the
$556,097 loss reported for the same period the year before.
3

11.
As detailed below, these inflated balance sheet and income statement numbers were
repeated in numerous documents subsequently filed with the Commission.
12.
The newly-booked value of the Alaska acquisition, which resulted in a nearly
5,000% increase in Miller Energy’s total assets, had a significant impact on Miller Energy’s stock
price. On December 10, 2009, the date of the transaction, Miller Energy’s stock closed at $0.61
per share. By March 31, 2010, Miller Energy’s stock closed 982% higher at $6.60 per share.
Weeks later, its stock began trading on NASDAQ and, after moving to the NYSE a year later,
reached an all-time high price on December 9, 2013 of $8.83 per share.
13.
As described in detail below, Miller Energy materially overstated the value of its
Alaska assets by more than four hundred million dollars.
Under GAAP, Miller Energy Was Required
to Record the Alaska Acquisition at Fair Value
14.
ASC 805, Business Combinations – formerly Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) 141(R) – became effective in December 2008. Among its principal revisions,
ASC 805 requires acquisitions that result in a “bargain purchase,” e.g., entities purchased at fire
sales prices in non-orderly transactions, to be measured at fair value, with any resulting gain
recorded on the income statement.
15.
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (formerly SFAS 157), provides the framework
for measuring fair value. “Fair value” is defined in ASC 820 as “the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date.” A reporting entity must determine an appropriate fair value using one or
more of the valuation techniques described in accounting literature.
16.
ASC 820 outlines three broad approaches to measure fair value: the market
approach, income approach, and cost approach. Under the market approach, prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or
liabilities are used to measure fair value. The income approach utilizes valuation techniques to
convert future amounts to a single discounted present value amount. Finally, the cost approach is
based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the assets in service, i.e., current
replacement cost.
17.
ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entityspecific measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability.
18.
ASC 820 emphasizes that when a price for an identical asset or liability is not
observable entities should use a “valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable

4

inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs” and entities may not ignore assumptions
market participants would use.2
19.
When computing their estimate of fair value, Miller Energy and the CFO failed to
consider the existence of numerous, readily apparent data points strongly indicating that the assets
were worth substantially less than the $480 million value Miller Energy recorded. In failing to do
so, Miller Energy and the CFO materially overstated the value of the newly acquired Alaska assets.
20.
As described below, Miller Energy purported to value its Alaska acquisition using
the income approach for the oil and gas reserves and the cost approach for certain fixed assets.
The Valuation of the Acquired Oil and Gas Properties
Was Based Upon a Reserve Report, Which Does Not Represent Fair Value
21.
To record the value of the acquired oil and gas properties, Miller Energy and the
CFO requested and improperly used a reserve report prepared by an independent petroleum
engineer firm.
22.
Reserve reports are commonly used in the oil and gas industry to estimate quantities
of oil and gas (the reserves) expected to be recovered from existing properties.3 Generally, these
reports list reserves in categories based on a minimum estimated percentage probability of eventual
recovery and production, i.e., proved, probable, and possible. Information in reserve reports that
are prepared in accordance with Commission regulations is frequently used, for among other
purposes, to satisfy supplemental accounting disclosure requirements concerning estimates of

2

ASC 820 defines “unobservable inputs” as “inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information
available in the circumstances” and “observable inputs” as “inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the
reporting entity.”
3

Oil and gas reporting companies are subject to two principal authoritative pronouncements governing financial
accounting and reporting for oil and gas activities: Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X (17 C.F.R. 210.4-10), Financial
Accounting and Reporting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities Pursuant to the Federal Securities Laws and the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (“Rule 4-10”); and ASC 932-235-50-29 through 33 (formerly SFAS
19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies and SFAS 69, Disclosures About Oil
and Gas Producing Activities). ASC 932 establishes disclosure requirements for significant oil and gas activities,
including disclosure of the “standardized measure,” which is the future after-tax net cash flows discounted at 10%.
A non-GAAP measure known as “PV-10” is similar to the standardized measure but is typically presented on a
pretax basis. The FASB has noted that the standardized measure supplies investors with useful information,
however, they also noted their concern “that users of financial statements understand that it is neither fair market
value nor the present value of future cash flows. It is a rough surrogate for such measures, a tool to allow for a
reasonable comparison of mineral reserves and changes through the use of a standardized method that recognizes
qualitative, quantitative, geographic, and temporal characteristics.” Paragraph 83 of the Basis for Conclusions of
SFAS 69.

future oil and gas production. However, the numbers used in reserve reports for this purpose are
expressly not considered “an estimate of fair market value.”4
23.
Shortly after the acquisition, the CFO asked the Alaska CEO – a non-accountant
with no formal accounting training – to obtain a reserve report for the Alaska properties in order to
determine the fair value of the acquired assets to be reported on Miller Energy’s Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended January 31, 2010.
24.
On January 5, 2010, the Alaska CEO hired a petroleum engineer firm to prepare a
reserve report using a pretax present value of net cash flows discounted at 10% (“PV-10”), which,
while appropriate with further adjustments for SEC supplemental disclosures, was not indicative of
fair value.
25.
The petroleum engineer firm did not know Miller Energy intended to use the report
for fair value purposes and believed that the purpose of the report was for use as supplemental data
in the company’s SEC disclosures. Indeed, the two page engagement letter with the engineer firm
includes no language about “fair value,” “fair market value” or authoritative accounting literature.
26.
million.

The reserve report was finalized in February 2010 and reflected PV-10 of $368

27.
Upon receiving the reserve report, the CFO, without undertaking any additional
analysis, merely recorded as the fair value of the acquired oil and gas properties the sum of the PV10 estimates for 100% of the proved, probable, and possible reserves, which increased the book
value of Miller Energy’s oil and gas properties on its balance sheet by $368 million.
28.
The reserve report itself clearly stated that the numbers therein were not an estimate
of fair market value. Specifically, on page 3 of the report, it states that “[t]he discounted values
shown are for your information and should not be construed as our estimate of fair market value.”
the CFO never reviewed or questioned any of the reserve report’s assumptions or calculations, nor
did he communicate with the engineer firm about the reserve report.
29.
The use of the PV-10 numbers as fair value conflicted with contemporaneous
representations Miller Energy made to investors. Specifically, in its fiscal 2010 Form 10-K, which
was the first annual report that included the inflated values, Miller Energy expressly told investors
that “[o]ur PV-10 measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not
purport to present the fair value of our natural gas and oil reserves.” Despite that disclosure, Miller
Energy had actually used its PV-10 measure in that very same report as the fair value of its
acquired properties.

reasons.

The $368 million reserve report value did not represent fair value for several

4

See Paragraph 77 of the Basis for Conclusion of SFAS 69 (“Although it cannot be considered an estimate of fair
market value, the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows should be responsive to some of the key variables
that affect fair market value, namely, changes in reserve quantities, selling prices, production costs, and tax rates.”).

6

31.
Despite showing years of net profit that market participants would expect to be
taxable, the reserve report did not make any adjustments for income taxes.
32.
At Miller Energy’s request, the reserve report used a 10% discount rate that was
inappropriate under GAAP for determining fair value. In a discounted cash flow model, a discount
rate is used to account for the uncertainties associated with risk and the time value of money. A
discount rate is the required rate of return that an investor would demand – based on the risks
associated with the benefit stream under consideration – to induce the investor to make an
investment. By failing to consider the discount rate using assumptions market participants would
use, Miller Energy materially overstated the value of the acquired oil and gas properties.
33.
The valuation also overstated cash flows from certain categories of reserve
estimates (e.g., “probable” and “possible” reserves) by failing to apply any risk weight to such
reserves and the resulting cash flows. Given the high degree of uncertainty associated with cash
flows from these reserve estimate categories, they are required to be risk weighted in order to
reflect an appropriate valuation.
34.
The reserve report did not include amounts for certain asset retirement obligations,
i.e., the legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets.
35.
Finally, the $237 million of projected operating and capital expenses in the reserve
report, which were provided by Miller Energy and the Alaska CEO, were intentionally understated,
resulting in an overstated valuation.
36.
In fact, one petroleum engineer firm contacted but not used by Miller Energy
thought that the expected level of expenses made a significant portion of the acquisition
unprofitable. Initially, the Alaska CEO contacted the petroleum engineer firm who had previously
provided the past two owners of the properties with reserve reports, and thus had unfettered access
to past operating data, and requested a quote for “updating” a prior reserve report. That firm told
the Alaska CEO that it would not assign any value to one of the largest fields acquired, the
Redoubt Shoal field, because it was uneconomical – i.e., expected future expenses exceeded
expected future cash flows – and explained that it would not put its “name on a report that implies
value exists where it likely does not.”5
37.
The CFO was aware that Miller Energy chose the new firm because the prior firm
would not assign any value to the Redoubt Shoal field. The Redoubt Shoal field – which
represented $291 million of the $368 million in fair value recorded by Miller Energy – showed
positive future cash flows in the reserve report primarily because the Alaska CEO gave the new
engineer firm understated and unsubstantiated expense numbers. The CFO had previously been

5

Unique among the oil and gas properties purchased by Miller Energy, Redoubt Shoal is an offshore field in Cook
Inlet, Alaska, which requires the use of an offshore platform that sits in seventy feet of water, is accessible only by
boat or helicopter, and drills to depths in excess of 12,000 feet. Offshore drilling presents risks and costs not
associated with onshore operations.

7

advised by Miller Energy’s independent auditor that the lack of any controls over the Alaska
CEO’s expense estimates was a “concerning void.”
38.
Miller Energy and the Alaska CEO provided expense projections that, in many
cases, were significantly lower than past actual experience. For example, internal documents
maintained by the Alaska CEO indicate that the cost to drill a new well in the Redoubt field was
roughly $13 million. However, the Alaska CEO told the engineer firm to use a cost of $4.6 million
per well in its reserve report. And instead of using recent expense data the Alaska CEO gave the
engineer firm nearly three year old operating expense data, which he revised down on the pretext
that Miller Energy could run a leaner operation than former operators of the properties. By way of
example, the Alaska CEO told the engineer firm that the offshore Redoubt field would cost
$399,000 per month to operate when it actually cost the seller more than $600,000 per month and
when internal estimates show that Miller Energy and the Alaska CEO expected the field to cost
more than $800,000 per month once fully operational. Additionally, in some years, the report
included zero expenses for operating the facilities in Redoubt and another field.
39.
Overall, the reserve report implied operating expenses of $4 per barrel of oil
equivalent (“boe”) for all categories of reserves. That level of operating expenses was
unreasonable in light its predecessor’s actual operating expenses of $32.50/boe in 2008 and
$55.42/boe in the first half of 2009 before the wells were shut-in.
40.
By understating the expense numbers, Miller Energy overvalued its oil and gas
properties by tens of millions of dollars.
The Fair Value of the Acquired Fixed Assets Was Double-Counted and Overstated
41.
In addition to the $368 million value recorded for the oil and gas properties, Miller
Energy also erroneously recorded a separate value of $110 million for acquired fixed assets, such
as facilities and pipelines ancillary to the oil and gas reserves.
42.
In a February 8, 2010 email, the CFO informed the Alaska CEO that he needed an
amount to use as fair value for the fixed assets obtained as part of the Alaska acquisition. He noted
that, ideally, the value should be what a willing buyer would pay for the assets, but “[i]n the
absence of that, replacement values or something similar would probably work.” Two days later,
the CFO was sent an “asset replacement cost study” purportedly provided by an independent
insurance broker, which appeared to list the replacement cost for the assets as $110 million. The
“study” was dated September 5, 2008, but “revised” on February 9, 2010.
43.
Without any additional analysis, the CFO recorded the amount in the revised
insurance study on Miller Energy’s balance sheet.
44.

The recording of assets at a value of $110 million was improper for several reasons.

45.
Miller Energy’s use of the values in the insurance study resulted in counting the
value of the fixed assets twice, thereby overstating the value of such assets. The reserve report
Miller Energy relied on to value the acquired oil and gas properties used a discounted cash flow
model. Valuation specialists use such models to estimate the value of an enterprise’s “operating
8

assets” – i.e., the assets employed to generate future cash flows – by converting future benefit
streams into a net present value. In Miller Energy’s case, the fixed assets in the insurance study
were the very same operating assets that were expected to generate the future cash flows in the
reserve report. Accordingly, they should not have been separately valued.
46.
Prior to the acquisition, all of the production from the offshore Redoubt Shoal field
ran through the Osprey platform, which had no processing facilities or power generating capability
of its own. Power was sent from generators housed within the Kustatan Production Facility to the
platform via a subsea line, which was connected to an underground power grid that ran throughout
all of the acquired properties. Moreover, production from the offshore platform was sent onshore
for processing through pipes to the Kustatan Production Facility. Absent the platform, there would
have been no way to obtain oil and gas from Redoubt Shoal without incurring upfront capital
expenditures to replace the platform and its related infrastructure. Similarly, without the other
production facilities, the platform would have lacked power and somewhere to process its oil and
gas.
47.
The reserve report Miller Energy used for the valuation recognized the
interconnectedness of the properties, as it expressly listed the facilities and the offshore platform as
assets used to generate the future cash flows.
48.
In short, because the fixed assets were integral to the operations of the acquired
properties, their values were captured in the reserve report’s cash flows. Consequently, by
separately valuing the same operating assets, Miller Energy overstated the value of the Alaska
assets by as much as $110 million.
49.
The insurance study also did not reflect fair value because the version of the
insurance study used by the CFO purported to show “asset replacement cost.” Absent further
adjustments, replacement cost new does not qualify as fair value under GAAP.
50.
Miller Energy, at the direction of the CFO and the Alaska CEO, also refashioned a
preexisting insurance study to make it appear that its own value of $110 million derived from a
third party. The numbers in the fixed asset study were given to the insurance broker, and its
predecessor, by its clients (i.e., Miller Energy and the previous owners of the fixed assets) as far
back as 2007 and were used as starting points for other types of estimates, such as estimates for
possible losses resulting from fire or natural disasters. The two employees at the insurance broker
who were most familiar with the original “Loss Estimates Study,” including the engineer who
authored it, confirmed that no one at the broker ever tested or in any way double-checked the
values given to them.
51.
The CFO and the Alaska CEO knew or knowingly disregarded the fact that the
insurance study did not reflect fair value or any analysis by the insurance broker.
52.
On February 8, 2010, the Alaska CEO directed Alaska personnel to contact the
insurance broker and another oil and gas consulting company to ask them for a report reflecting
fair value or replacement cost. The insurance broker responded on February 9, and told Miller
9

Energy in an email copied to the Alaska CEO that it could not provide a report showing
replacement costs.
53.
Miller Energy also contacted a separate consulting firm and sent it the insurance
broker’s original 2008 insurance report. Late on February 8, the consulting firm informed Miller
Energy that the insurance study it sent was a “good reference” but the report did not state “value or
replacement cost.” The firm offered to conduct its own analysis, but advised that the estimate
would take “approximately 2-3 weeks to complete” and “cost around $15,000-$18,000.”
54.
Upon hearing the news that a new report might take two to three weeks, Alaska
personnel, including the Alaska CEO, called the CFO. According to one participant on this call,
the CFO said he could not wait weeks for a new report. He “needed it quickly and he needed to
base it on something . . . a professional had to sign off on it, not us, some third party. . . .” During
the call, the CFO and the Alaska CEO decided to rely on numbers in the insurance report as
replacement costs, despite the Alaska CEO having been told by the broker that it could not provide
Miller Energy with replacement costs.
55.
With the aim of making the report appear as though it reflected replacement costs,
the Alaska CEO provided a subordinate with edits to the 2008 insurance report that significantly
altered its appearance, including changing its name from “Loss Estimates Study” to “Asset
replacement cost study.” The revised report, which Miller Energy gave to Sherb & Co., omitted
the insurance broker’s methodology and analysis. As a result, the only numbers reflected in the
revised report were the ones provided to the broker by Miller Energy and its predecessors.
56.
As a result of the foregoing, Miller Energy overvalued the Alaska assets by more
than $400 million.
57.
As a result of the fraudulent valuation, Miller Energy filed with the Commission
financial reports that materially misstated the value of its assets, as follows: Forms 10-Q for the
third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and all three quarters of fiscal years 2011 through 2015; Forms 10K for fiscal years ended 2010 through 2014; the Form S-1 filed on August 8, 2010; the Forms S-3
filed on September 6, 2012 and October 5, 2012; and prospectuses filed between August 25, 2010
through August 21, 2014 pursuant to Rule 424. The fraudulent valuation also resulted in Miller
Energy filing with the Commission financial reports that materially misstated its net income, as
follows: Forms 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, all three quarters of fiscal 2011, and
the first two quarter of 2012; Forms 10-K for fiscal years ended 2010 through 2012; the Form S-1
filed on August 8, 2010; the Forms S-3 filed on September 6, 2012 and October 5, 2012; and
prospectus supplements filed between August 25, 2010 through August 21, 2014 pursuant to Rule
424. In addition, the fraudulent valuation rendered no fewer than 15 Forms 8-K filed between
March 2010 through at least December 2014 materially false and misleading.

Respondent agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and supporting material shall be
submitted to Peter J. Diskin, Assistant Regional Director, U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, 950 E. Paces Ferry Road, N.E., Atlanta, GA 30326, with a copy to the Office of
Chief Counsel of the Enforcement Division, no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the
completion of the undertakings.
67.
In determining whether to accept Miller Energy’s Offer, the Commission has
considered these undertakings.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in the Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Respondent Miller Energy cease and desist from committing or causing any
violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Sections
13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and
13a-13 thereunder.
B.
Respondent Miller Energy shall pay a civil money penalty in the amount of
$5,000,000. In the event Miller Energy’s Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the payment
of such $5,000,000 civil penalty shall be accomplished by the Commission having an allowed
general unsecured claim in Class 4 of the Plan in the amount of $5,000,000 and such claim shall be
paid consistently with the payments made to Miller Energy’s other general unsecured creditors in
Class 4 pursuant to the terms of the Plan. In the event the Bankruptcy Case is dismissed without
the confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court in the Bankruptcy Case of either (i) the Plan, or (ii) any
other plan of reorganization for Miller Energy that treats the Commission’s $5,000,000 civil
penalty as a general unsecured claim consistently with other allowed general unsecured claims
against Miller Energy, then such civil penalty shall be paid by Miller Energy directly to the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the following installments: (i) $625,000 within five
business days of the termination of the Bankruptcy Case, and (ii) three installments of $1,458,
333.33 each due no later than the first, second and third annual anniversary of the entry of the
Order, respectively. The Commission may distribute civil money penalties collected in this
proceeding if, in its discretion, the Commission orders the establishment of a Fair Fund pursuant to
15 U.S.C. § 7246, Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. The
Commission will hold funds paid pursuant to this paragraph in an account at the United States
12

Treasury pending a decision whether the Commission, in its discretion, will seek to distribute funds
or, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3), transfer them to the general fund of the United
States Treasury. If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31
U.S.C. §3717, and the entire outstanding balance of civil penalty, plus any additional interest
accrued pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, shall be due and payable immediately, without further
application.
Any payment made outside of the Bankruptcy Case must be made in one of the following
ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3)

Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Miller Energy Resources, Inc. as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these
proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Peter J. Diskin,
Division of Enforcement, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 950 East Paces Ferry Road,
N.E., Atlanta, GA 30326-1382
D.
Regardless of whether the Commission in its discretion orders the creation of a Fair
Fund for the penalties ordered in this proceeding, amounts ordered to be paid as civil money
penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all
purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty,
Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor Action it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor
shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any
part of Respondent’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any
Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30
days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this
action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such
a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the
amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related
Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of
13

one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.
By the Commission.
