PROCEEDINGS, PURSUANT TO SECTION
21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A
CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER

In the Matter of
GlaxoSmithKline plc,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against GlaxoSmithKline plc (“Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth
below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that
Summary
A.
These proceedings arise out of GSK’s violations of the internal controls and
recordkeeping provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”) [15 U.S.C. §
78dd].
B.
Between at least 2010 and June 2013, employees and agents of GSK’s China-based
subsidiary and a China-based joint-venture engaged in various transactions and schemes to provide
things of value to foreign officials, including healthcare professionals (“HCPs”), in order to
improperly influence them and increase sales of GSK products in China.
C.
This misconduct was facilitated in part by the use of collusive third parties that
ostensibly provided legitimate travel and other services. The funds used for the improper
inducements were frequently obtained under the guise of, and falsely recorded in GSK’s books and
records as, legitimate travel and entertainment expense, marketing expense, speaker payments,
medical associations payments, and promotion expense. Throughout this period GSK failed to
devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls and lacked an effective anticorruption compliance program.
D.
The deficiencies in GSK’s internal accounting controls and compliance program
also led to instances of similar improper conduct in connection with sales in other countries in
which GSK operates.

Respondent
E.
GlaxoSmithKline plc is a corporation organized in the United Kingdom. Its
headquarters are located in Middlesex, United Kingdom. GSK’s common stock is registered with
the Commission under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and trades on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘GSK’.
F.
GSK is a global provider of pharmaceutical and consumer health care products and
its products are sold in at least 150 countries.

1

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
2

Other Relevant Entities
G.
GlaxoSmithKline (China) Investment Co Ltd (“GSKCI”) is operated from
Shanghai, China. GSKCI operations include the sale and marketing of pharmaceutical products.
GSKCI is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of GSK.
H.
Sino-American Tianjin Smith Kline & French Laboratories Ltd (“TSKF”) is a
public-private joint venture with Tianjin Zhong Xin Pharmaceutical Group Corporation Ltd and
Tianjin Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd. GSK indirectly owns 55 percent of TSKF.
Facts
I.
From at least 2010 to June 2013, employees and agents of GSKCI and TSKF
engaged in transactions and schemes to corruptly transfer things of value to foreign officials in
China to increase sales of pharmaceutical products. The payments were made to increase sales
through increased prescriptions by individual HCPs and purchases by hospital administrative staff
responsible for product selection or purchase. The conduct occurred across all geographic areas
within the sales and marketing functions and impacted all product lines.
J.
The corrupt payments took varied forms, including gifts, improper travel and
entertainment with no or little educational purpose, shopping excursions, family and home visits,
and cash. The costs associated with these payments were recorded in GSK’s books and records
as legitimate expenses, such as medical association sponsorships, employee expenses, conferences,
speaker fees, and marketing costs.
K.
These improper practices were pervasive among GSKCI’s and TSKF’s sales and
marketing representatives and were condoned by regional and district managers. For example, a
2013 work plan submitted by a sales representative to a regional sales manager described the intent
to pay, among other things, an HCP RMB 20/box of prescribed product every month, and deliver
appropriate gifts on each holiday in exchange for a guarantee of more than 40 boxes of prescribed
product every month.
L.
Among the ways employees were able to fund payments to HCPs was the use of
collusive third party vendors, such as those used to perform planning and travel services for events
involving HCPs. Between 2010 and June 2013, GSKCI spent nearly RMB 1.4 billion (USD $225
million) on planning and travel services. Test sampling showed that approximately 44 percent of
the sampled invoices were inflated and approximately 12 percent were for events that did not
occur.
M.
Controls weaknesses also permitted ostensibly legitimate speaker fees to be used to
improperly influence HCPs. While GSK’s policies as of 2010 placed limits on the amount of fees
paid to speakers per hour and by 2012 cumulatively per year, there was no effective system in
place to ensure the actual identity of a speaker. Of approximately RMB 106 million (USD $17
million) spent by GSKI in speaker fees, approximately RMB 14 million (USD $2.2 million) was
paid to persons whose qualification as an HCP could not be verified.
3

N.
Marketing programs were another mechanism used to improperly influence HCPs.
For example, in 2010, GSKCI engaged a local vendor to facilitate a national marketing program
called the Cold Chain Project. The project was intended to provide healthcare clinics with tools to
facilitate the storage and administration of vaccines that required refrigeration. However, the
project was instead used to provide HCPs with gifts such as laptops, tablets, and other electronic
devices. Over the life of the project, GSKCI paid out RMB 14.6 million (approximately USD $2.3
million). The project was created and administered by senior marketing and sales managers of
GSKCI. The clinics selected were based upon the potential to market additional pharmaceutical
products.
O.
During this period, local internal audit and compliance reviews identified controls
deficiencies and evidence of some mechanisms that were used to fund the improper payments, but
they were treated as isolated instances rather than signs of a larger problem. For example, in 2013 a
Sales Rep Office Audit was conducted by internal audit with respect to the Guangzhou office.
Among the problems identified were:





Issues of falsified POS slips and fake bank statements
Issues of fake invoices claimed from hotels and restaurants for sales
meeting activities. These invoices came from a local preferred meeting
agency used by the Guangzhou office.
Compliance and New Employee training not timely completed
Sales employees’ salaries were significantly driven by commissions that
could lead to an incentive to improperly inflate sales. The audit sampled 20
percent of the sales team for the office and found that for 41 percent their
sales commission bonuses were greater than 50 percent of their income.

P.
As early as 2010, internal audit identified problems related to sales and promotions
staff practices in China. Among other findings it noted:
[d]uring 2010, several new policies governing commercial
activities such as grants and donations and sponsorships
were introduced. The significant changes, combined with
the high staff turnover, contribute to an environment where
many commercial and medical staff do not understand how
to apply policies or the rationale behind them. This was
evidenced by approval of non-compliant activities, a lack of
clarity on which policy to apply for activities such as grants,
and weaknesses in documentation to support the legitimate
intent of activities such as advisory boards and sponsorships
of HCPs to attend meetings.
Q.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent violated Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(b)(2)(A)
and 78m(b)(2)(B)].

GSK’s Remedial Efforts
R. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts
promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.
1. During the course of the investigation, Respondent provided prompt and
regular briefings regarding its own internal investigation in China, and with
respect to other countries. Respondent timely conveyed the facts it learned in
the course of its own investigation, promptly responded to document requests
by the Commission staff, and provided translations of documents as needed.
2. Respondent also provided detailed and timely information regarding its
remedial efforts, enhancements to its compliance program and implementation
of key initiatives.
3. Respondent made global changes to its business. This included the
elimination of most payments to doctors, including fees to HCPs to speak
about the Company’s prescription medicines, and altering the compensation
structure for its sales force to eliminate incentive pay based on the number of
prescriptions generated. Respondent enhanced its global risk assessment
process, strengthened its monitoring and risk assessment tools, and increased
its global compliance organization. Respondent also enhanced its third-party
oversight program, including increasing the number and scope of third-party
audits, and increased training and education of employees on anti-bribery
issues.
Undertakings
S.

Respondent has undertaken to:
1. Report to the Commission staff periodically, at no less than nine-month intervals
during a two-year term, the status of its remediation and implementation of
compliance measures. During this two-year period, should Respondent discover
credible evidence, not already reported to the Commission staff, that
questionable or corrupt payments or questionable or corrupt transfers of value
may have been offered, promised, paid, or authorized by Respondent, or any
entity or person acting on behalf of Respondent, or that related false books and
records have been maintained, Respondent shall promptly report such conduct to
the Commission staff. During this two-year period, Respondent shall: (a)
conduct an initial review and submit an initial report, and (b) conduct and
prepare at least two follow-up reviews and reports, as described below:
i. Respondent shall submit to the Commission staff a written
report within 180 calendar days of the entry of this Order setting
forth a complete description of its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(“FCPA”) and anti-corruption related remediation efforts to
5

date, its proposals reasonably designed to improve the policies
and procedures of Respondent for ensuring compliance with the
FCPA and other applicable anticorruption laws, and the
parameters of the subsequent reviews (the “Initial Report”). The
Initial Report shall be transmitted to Charles Cain, Deputy Unit
Chief, FCPA Unit, Division of Enforcement, United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F St NE,
Washington, DC 20549. Respondent may extend the time
period for issuance of the Initial Report with prior written
approval of the Commission staff.
ii. Respondent shall undertake at least two follow-up reviews,
incorporating any comments provided by the Commission staff
on the previous report, to further monitor and assess whether the
policies and procedures of Respondent are reasonably designed
to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws (the “Follow-up Reports”).
iii. The first Follow-up Report shall be completed by no later than
270 days after the Initial Report. The second Follow-up Report
shall be completed by no later than 450 days after the
completion of the Initial Report. Respondent may extend the
time period for issuance of the Follow-up Reports with prior
written approval of the Commission staff.
iv. The periodic reviews and reports submitted by Respondent will
likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and
competitive business information. Public disclosure of the
reports could discourage cooperation, impede pending or
potential government investigations and thus undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons,
among others, the reports and the contents thereof are intended
to remain and shall remain non-public, except (a) pursuant to
court order, (b) as agreed by the parties in writing, (c) to the
extent that the Commission staff determines in its sole discretion
that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Commission’s
discharge of its duties and responsibilities, or (d) is otherwise
required by law.
2. Certify, in writing, compliance with the undertaking(s) set forth above. The
certification shall identify the undertaking(s), provide written evidence of
compliance in the form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient to
demonstrate compliance. The Commission staff may make reasonable requests
for further evidence of compliance, and Respondent agrees to provide such
6

evidence. The certification and supporting materials shall be submitted to
Charles Cain, Deputy Unit Chief, FCPA Unit, with a copy to the Office of the
Chief Counsel of the Enforcement Division, no later than sixty (60) days from
the date of the completion of the undertakings.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is
hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Respondent cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any
future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
[15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B)].
B.
Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money
penalty in the amount of $20,000,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to
the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If
timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §3717. Payment
must be made in one of the following ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3)

Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying GSK as a
Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the cover
letter and check or money order must be sent to Charles Cain, Division of Enforcement, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 100 F St., NE, Mailstop 5631, Washington, DC 20549.
C.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
7

Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.
D.

Respondent shall comply with the undertakings enumerated in Section III above.

By the Commission.
