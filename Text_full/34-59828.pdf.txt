ORDER DIRECTING
DISBURSEMENT OF FAIR FUND

On December 8, 2008, the Commission published a notice of the Plan of Distribution
(“Plan”) proposed by the Division of Enforcement in connection with this proceeding (Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 59065). The Commission received no substantive comments and on
February 4, 2009, the Plan was approved (Exchange Act Release No. 59356).
The Plan provides that a Fair Fund consisting of $250,000,000 in disgorgement and civil
penalties, plus any accrued interest, be transferred to the Escrow Bank1 to be distributed by the
Fund Administrator to injured mutual funds and mutual fund shareholders according to the
methodology set forth in the Plan. The Plan provides that the Commission will arrange for
distribution of the Fair Fund when a Validated Payee List listing the payees with the
identification information required to make the distribution has been received and accepted. The
Validated Payee List for the first tranche of distribution in the amount of $216,819,719.80 has
been received and accepted.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $216,819,719.80
of the Fair Fund to the Escrow Bank and the Fund Administrator shall distribute such monies to
investors, as provided for in the Plan of Distribution.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
