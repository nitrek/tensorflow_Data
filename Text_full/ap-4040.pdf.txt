NOTICE

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on November 9, 2015, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP alleges that Respondent Sandip Shah violated Exchange
Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) thereunder in light of a series of events connected with his
seeking financing for penny stock companies that he was assisting. A fifth prehearing conference
was held today. Martin F. Healey, Esq., appeared on behalf of the Division of Enforcement, and
Shah, who is incarcerated at FCI Sheridan in Oregon, appeared pro se.
In accordance with leave granted, the Division of Enforcement has filed a motion for summary
disposition, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a); Shah, an opposition; and the Division, a reply. The
filings mostly relate to sanctions – the Division requests a cease-and-desist order and a penny stock bar,
and Shah argues that a penny stock bar should not be imposed. At the prehearing conference, the
parties advanced arguments in support of their filings and in reference to the OIP. Shah affirmed that
he does not dispute that he violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and that his state of
mind during the events in question eventually became reckless in that he overlooked indications that he
was involved in an illegal kickback scheme. He also advised that he is not defending against the
imposition of a cease-and-desist order.
