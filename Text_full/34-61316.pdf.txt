EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time,
until September 30, 2010, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution (“distribution
plan”) under Rule 1101(a) of the Commission Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement
Plans.
In its request, the Division states that since the issuance of the Commission’s
November 4, 2009 Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings,
Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order
Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 15(b)(4), 15(b)(6) and 21C
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, the staff has been working diligently to identify and obtain records that
are sufficient to determine the feasibility of a possible distribution of Fair Funds in this
matter to victims harmed by Respondents’ violations, which date back to 1986. The
Division requires additional time to continue its efforts to recover records needed to

ascertain the identity and whereabouts of injured investors and, if feasible, to
recommend the appointment of a fund administrator and to develop a proposed
distribution plan. In the event that a distribution to injured investors is deemed
feasible, the Division further states that it expects to submit a proposed distribution
plan no later than September 30, 2010.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
Division’s request for an extension of time until September 30, 2010 to submit a
proposed plan of distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
