MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Welcome, everyone.

3

Sebastian, I assume we have a quorum.

4

MR. GOMEZ: We do.

5

MR. GRAHAM: All right. Well, again, good

6

morning, and welcome to the meeting of the SEC Advisory

7

Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.

8

Our agenda today includes two timely topics

9

that were suggested by many of you during our last

10

meeting. The first item is the accredited investor

11

definition under the Securities Act rules. And as you

12

all know, this is the subject of a recent report from the

13

staff that -- they pretty much cover the issue

14

extensively. We will hear from the SEC staff about that

15

review, and then I hope that we can discuss and move to

16

recommendation.
The definition is a topic that the committee

17
18

has been interested in for quite a while. We provided

19

recommendations to the Commission in 2015, and we are

20

pleased the staff report is finalized and looking forward

21

to hearing more about it.

22

This afternoon we will turn to Regulation D

23

with an update from the SEC staff and guidance they are

24

providing in connection with 506(c) and general

25

solicitation. But for now I'm going to turn it over to

CHAIR WHITE: Thank you very much, Sara. Thank

7
8

you very much, Steve. And good morning to everybody.

9

I've seen most of you directly this morning but not

14

Let me just sort of start with -- since we're

15

relatively new to each other, just my overall perspective

16

on our mission at the SEC and the important spaces that

17

small and emerging companies that you occupy are -- what

18

is my sort of overall perspective.

19

Obviously they're critical drivers of

20

innovation on our economy and our rules, should provide

21

them with a range of options for raising capital,

22

understanding the diversity of business models and

23

capital needs that these companies have while ensuring,

24

obviously, at the same time that investors can have the

25

confidence in those markets that come with strong

protections.

As it happens, I was actually in Lima, Peru

2

a familiar and very important one for all of us. Last

3

last week for IOSCO's annual conference and was on a

3

year this committee did provide recommendations

4

panel where I was asked to discuss and did discuss the

4

cautioning that the primary goal of the Commission's

5

Commission's approach to some of these issues and some of

5

review of this definition should be to do no harm in the

6

the recent work that we've done on behalf of smaller and

6

private offering ecosystem. The recommendation -- that

7

emerging businesses. And one subject that was

7

recommendation also suggested including within the

8

highlighted there was equity crowdfunding.

definition those investors who meet a test of

And on Monday, as you know, our federal

9

sophistication.

10

crowdfunding rules came into effect, providing another

As you know, again, in December the Commission

option for small issuers. There's considerable

11

published a staff report that analyzes various approaches

12

excitement among entrepreneurs and investors for

12

for modifying the definition and provides recommendations

13

securities-based crowdfunding, and I certainly hope it

13

for potential updates and modifications. I look forward

14

will provide a new useful tool for small businesses

14

to hearing your discussion on those approaches and

15

seeking to raise capital.

15

reviewing any further comments that are submitted. I've

As required by the JOBS Act and our rule, a

16

asked the staff to prepare recommendations on how the

17

registered broker or funding portal really does serve as

17

Commission should modify the definition, and the comments

18

an important gatekeeper between those seeking capital and

18

we're receiving obviously will help the Commission in its

19

investors. We were pleased to see that a number of

19

-- in considering its next steps.

20

companies have already filed their Form C offerings.

20

21

Seventeen companies on the first day and I think we're

21

afternoon of Regulation D, one of the primary engines of

22

now up to 27 at least as of the close of business

22

capital formation in this country. Approximately 1.3 to

23

yesterday.

23

$1.4 trillion was reported to be raised through

24

unregistered securities offerings in actually both 2014

25

and 2015 in reliance on Regulation D, an amount that

16

24
25

Nine funding portals have completed the
registration process with the Commission and FINRA and

I also very much welcome your discussion this

Page 7

more are in process. So we're watching developments very

1

comparable to the amount of capital that's raised by

2

closely.

2

public equity and debt offerings combined in those same
periods.

3

The staff of Corporation Finance and Trading

3

4

and Markets published compliance guidance in the last few

4

The vast majority of those offerings -- and I

5

days, and they're obviously available to answer

5

know you discussed this at your last meeting -- occurred

6

questions, and I think it's very important that we

6

under Rule 506(b), the traditional pre-JOBS Act exemption

7

obviously have those interchanges with all interested

7

which does not allow general solicitation. The activity

8

parties in this. And I think it's also just important

8

in exempt offerings is of particular interest now as

9

that we all keep striving to make crowdfunding work for

9

issuers, investors and their advisors seek to take

10
11

both issuers and obviously investors.
I'm also pleased to note that the Commission

10

advantage of relatively new options for capital raising,

11

like Rule 506(c) and its allowance for general
solicitation.

12

published a concept release on April 13 that

12

13

comprehensively reviews the business and financial

13

14

disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K among a wide

14

reported to have been raised in Rule 506 offerings,

15

range of other issues. The release discusses scale

15

approximately 38 billion used Rule 506(c). During 2014

16

disclosure for smaller publicly-traded companies, a topic

16

and 2015 about 1,600 new offerings were initiated each

17

that has been of keen interest to this committee, and I

17

year in reliance on Rule 506(c). So this is an area,

18

encourage you to review the concept release and provide

18

again, that we are monitoring closely, and I look forward

19

your input. Our goal is to make sure our disclosure

19

to hearing your insights now and later as we go along.

20

system is efficient and effective for investors and

20

21

companies, and we need input, obviously, from all

21

capital raising under the JOBS Act, Rule 506(c),

22

stakeholders.

22

Regulation A+ and Regulation Crowdfunding, are designed

23

to foster new ways for smaller companies to access the

Your agenda today, as Steve has outlined,

are both workable for issuers and providing appropriate

We all benefit from capital formation that is

Page 12

businesses in the states are increasingly conducted

2

through unregistered offerings as Chair White pointed

3

done in a transparent, safe and efficient way. As you'll

3

out. In fact, more than $2 trillion was raised privately

4

hear in your -- I think you'll hear in the update from

in 2014. And Regulation D offerings accounted for about

5

Enforcement staff this afternoon, we've drawn on the

5

1.3 trillion of this amount. In comparison, registered

expertise of the staff really across the agency and

offerings or public offerings amounted to approximately

7

engaged them in a program that is keeping a watchful eye

7

1.35 trillion in 2014. So more money was raised in the

8

on how these markets develop. My view, such

8

private markets than was raised in the public markets,

9

interdivisional working groups help to make us smarter

9

which I think is another thing for all of us to be

10

and quicker in assessing the extent of these new markets,

10

considering about where we are right now and how

11

their workability under our rules and the extent of any

11

important some of these definitions are.

12

fraud or other rule violations that are occurring. And

12

13

this real-time approach should enable us to make any

13

vary, but all Reg D offerings depend on properly

14

necessary regulatory adjustments and take action against

14

identifying accredited investors. Does the current

15

abuses more quickly.

15

definition of accredited investor accurately capture who

16

should be allowed to participate in a Reg D offering? Is

So let me stop there by, again, saying thank

MS. HANKS: We'll hear from Commissioner Kara
Stein now.

COMMISSIONER STEIN: Thank you. Good morning,
everyone. I want to welcome you to today's meeting. I

test, I encourage you to keep in mind the lessons we

25

learned from the recent financial crisis. In 2008 hyper­

Page 11
1

really look forward to these meetings because there's

2

such a nice, free flow of ideas, and it benefits the

3

Commission immensely to hear from people on the ground

4

who are actually trying to improve capital formation

5

while protecting investors.

6

Today's discussions are going to focus on, as

7

Chair White pointed out and I know you know from your

8

agenda on the definition of accredited investor and

9

observations regarding unregistered offerings, but in

10

particular, offerings made pursuant to Regulation D.

11

Both topics are part of the ongoing dialogue that we've

12

all been having about small businesses' access to

13

capital, and I think both topics provide us with an

14

opportunity think about and consider how to strike the

15

right balance between supporting small businesses' access

16

to capital while protecting investors.

17

Last December our staff in the Division of

18

Corporation Finance issue their first review as required

19

by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer

20

Protection Act of the definition of accredited investor.

21

The definition until the Dodd-Frank Act had not been

22

significantly revised since 1982. Yet an understanding

23

of who fits within the current definition I think is of

24

increasing importance in today's financing markets.

25

Today capital raising opportunities for small

inflated housing valuations created artificial paper
wealth for many Americans. And at that time, the
accredited investor definition permitted an individual's
primary residence to be included in the calculation of
net worth.
As a result, many investors qualified as
accredited investors. But in reality, many of these
individuals were not able to fend for themselves or to
bear the risk of loss. I think this became painfully
evident upon the crash of the housing market and the
obliteration of trillions of dollars of paper wealth
during the financial crisis.
In light of history, what is the best way to
supplement the definition of accredited investor. The
staff of the Division of Corporation Finance and many
commenters, including this committee, have provided
thoughtful alternative factors that we should consider.
Perhaps it's time for the definition to become more
nuanced and to move away from a one-size-fits-all
approach.
For example, should we layer onto the
quantitative thresholds qualitative indicia of
sophistication such as professional credentials or
perhaps experience in engaging in exempt offerings.
Similar to Reg Crowdfunding and Reg A+, should we

Page 14

Page 16

1

consider investment limitations? How can we gather and

1

2

analyze data to test the definition to make sure it

2

3

continues to be appropriate.

discuss the accredited investor definition. I'm sure

4

there will be a lively discussion about alternative

So to some degree I'm talking about back-

important insights on alternative regulatory approaches.
After the staff presentation the committee will

5

accredited investor definitions. But I want to ask the

6

they're working or not? What were we hoping to

6

committee to consider going beyond that discussion,

7

accomplish when we made the changes? To answer these

7

perhaps after today's meeting, but before making any

8

questions we will need to think through how to craft a

8

recommendations to take a step back and ask the question:

9

definition of accredited investor that's flexible enough

9

Should the Commission consider doing away with the

10

to differentiate between investors. It would need to

10

11

take into account the wide range of investors that exist

11

As I've said before it essentially divided the

12

from the soon-to-be retiree who is reaching for yield in

12

world of private offerings into two arbitrary categories

13

a low interest environment to the angel investor who is

13

of individuals: those persons who were accorded the

14

seeking to identify the next big disruptor.

14

privileged status of being an accredited investor and

15

those are who are not. In short, if you made more than

Finally, I look forward to the second

15

notion of a so-called accredited investor altogether?

discussion agenda item today, the market for unregistered

whether public or private.

20

about the developments in this market and recent

If not, the government decided that for your

21

observations. I'm particularly interested in your

own protection you were restricted access to these

private investments. The committee has the opportunity

23

Reg 501(c) which removed the ban on general solicitation.

23

to move beyond the artificial distinction between so-

24

So I look forward to the meeting today. Thank

24

called accredited and so-called non-accredited investors

25

you for everyone's pro bono participation. We really

25

and challenge the notion that non-accredited investors

Page 15

are, in fact, being protected when the government

prohibits them from investing in high-risk securities.

financial economics. The first is the risk-return

Steve.

For example, the committee could do as I do and

First, since I was not able to make the

tradeoff. Because most investors are risk-averse,

8

This means that prohibiting non-accredited investors from

9

investing in high-risk securities is the same thing as

I look forward to hearing the discussion and seeing any

prohibiting them from investing in high-return

11

resulting recommendations. As Steve mentioned, the

11

securities.

12

committee will be discussing, among other things, the

12

13

accredited investor definition and Regulation D. In

13

theory. By holding a diversified portfolio of assets,

14

fact, the Commission adopted the notion of a so-called

because non-accredited investors are prohibited from

14

As a result, small businesses may face higher

The flip side is that investors who participate
in unregistered offerings can be subject to increased

work on the report and I've found that I've said the

words "accredited investor" so many times over the last

So there could be somebody who's very smart,

11

with over $1.3 trillion being raised using Regulation D

11

financially sophisticated.

12

over the last couple of years. So it's a very, very

12

13

robust, very active market. And being an accredited

13

14

investor is very important in order to participate in

14

That being said, not everybody is critical of

15

that market. So that's why the definition is very

15

the definition, and many people think that the definition

16

important and why we've been looking at it recently.

16

shouldn't be changed, and oftentimes those people point

17

As Steve mentioned, the definition is intended

17

to factors like the definition by using financial

18

to encompass those persons whose financial sophistication

19

and ability sustain the risk of loss of an investment or

over time and that if the Commission were to revise the

So those are kind of two of the criticisms that
we often hear about the definition.

So why did we do the report? The Dodd-Frank

Commission's first review of the definition. On December

qualify as accredited investors, not -- regardless of

4

18th last year, the Commission authorized publication of

4

their income or their net worth. So the report suggested

5

the report and the report contains a number of

5

five of these. The first one is that the Commission

6

recommendations from the staff.

6

consider whether it could establish an investments test

7

whereby people with certain level of investments would be

7

The recommendations are structured in terms of

The next set of recommendations in the report

8

alternatives that the Commission could consider if it

8

able to qualify as accredited investors. And the number

9

were to go ahead and revise the accredited investor

9

that the report suggested as a possible number was

10

definition. And the benefit of structuring the

10

11

definitions in this way is that it allows you to look at

11

12

the definitions in a couple of different ways. You could

12

investments are a better indicator of financial

13

look at them as a package, 11 things that the Commission

13

sophistication than net worth is, because net worth could

14

could do all at the same time to change the definition,

14

include things such as vehicles and other assets that

15

or you could also look at the definitions as more of a

15

16

menu, things that the Commission could pick and choose if

16

investing.

17

it were to change the definition.

17

18

Now that being said, I think that there are a

$750,000.
Now the idea here is that potentially

The second alternative criteria that the report

18

suggests is allowing people who have achieved certain

19

couple of recommendations that work well together instead

19

professional credentials to qualify as accredited

20

of being applied just on a one-off basis.

20

investors. And the three that the report suggests as

21

potential ideas are individuals who have a Series 7

22

recommendations that were in the report. The first three

22

certification, which is the general securities

23

recommendations deal with the income and net worth

23

representative certification; Series 65 certification

24

thresholds, and the first recommendation is that the

24

which is the NASAA uniform investment advisor exam

25

Commission could consider leaving the thresholds where

25

certification and the Series 82, which is the limited

21

So I wanted to just briefly go through the

Page 27

Page 29

1

they are today, so $200,000 of income, $1 million of net

1

2

worth, $300,000 of joint income with the spouse, but

2

3

applying investment limitations to people who qualify

3

suggested as potential alternatives is because each one

4

based on those thresholds. And the idea that the report

4

takes into consideration to some degree an individual's

5

tosses out in this area is potential 10 percent limits in

5

experience and knowledge of investing in the private

6

terms of income or net worth. So somebody who qualified

6

securities markets.

7

having a $200,000 income would be able to participate in

7

8

offerings as an accredited investor, but would not be

8

report has to do with investment experience, and it would

9

able to invest more than $20,000 in any given offering by

10
11

any given issuer in a 12-month period.
The second recommendation that the report

The reason why these three certifications were

The next alternative in this section of the

9

allow individuals who have acquired over the course of

10

their lives a good amount of experience investing in the

11

private securities markets to be accredited based on that
experience. And the report suggests that possibly anyone

12

contains is that the Commission consider creating new

12

13

alternative and higher income and net worth thresholds

13

who has participated in 10 private securities offerings

14

that take into consideration the impact of inflation that

14

by 10 different issuers would be an accredited investor.

15

has occurred over time. And the report suggests that the

15

16

Commission could possibly use $500,000 of individual

16

detail and talks about what types of offerings might be

17

income, $750,000 of joint income and a million dollars or

17

the ones that would qualify for this. So we probably

18

$2.5 million of net worth.

18

wouldn't have something like a crowdfunding offering in

19

mind, but it would be people who have participated in one

20

way or another on Reg D offerings in the past.

19
20

So these two recommendations are potentially
recommendations that might work well together.

And the report kind of goes into a little more

21

The third recommendation that involves the

21

22

income and net worth thresholds is it's a recommendation

22

consider whether knowledgeable employees of private funds

23

that this committee suggested in last of last year, and

23

-- so these are individuals who are involved in

24

that -- it's that the thresholds be adjusted on a regular

24

investment decision making processes every day, but are

25

going forward basis to reflect the impact of inflation.

25

not necessarily officers or directors of the fund,

8 (Pages 26 to 29)


The next recommendation is that the Commission

Page 30

Page 32
The next recommendation has to do with spousal

1

whether they should be allowed to participate in

1

2

offerings by their own funds as accredited investors.

2

equivalence and it suggested the Commission consider

3

spousal equivalents to be treated similarly to the way

4

that the Commission may want to consider whether it would

4

spouses are in the definition in terms of pooling their

5

be possible or feasible to create an examination that

5

financial resources to qualify based on the net worth and

6

somebody could take and become an accredited investor

6

the income tests.

7

based on sitting down and taking an exam that tests their

7

8

knowledge on private securities offerings and all of the

8

-- this is one that the Commission would not adopt on its

9

risks and things associated with those markets.

9

own because it depends on other changes to the definition

3

And the last recommendation in this area is

And then the final recommendation in the report

10

in order for this one to make any sense -- is that if the

11

lot of logistical things to consider if the Commission

11

Commission does change the definition in any way, the

12

were to think about this as a potential, including who

12

report suggested the Commission consider grandfathering

13

would write the exam, who would administer the exam, when

13

current investors who qualify based on the accredited

14

would the exam be updated, how long would passing the

14

investor definition as written today and who continue to

15

exam be good for.

15

qualify in the future based on the definition as written

10

The report acknowledges that there would be a

16

So that's kind of an interesting idea that is

16

today for future offerings by any issuer in which they

17

kind of written in more of a loose way than some of the

17

are currently an investor.

18

other recommendations because the staff recognized that

18

19

there would be a lot of logistical things to think about.

19

an anti-dilution protection for people who have already

20

But nonetheless, it's an interesting idea that we came

20

participated in offerings by certain issuers.

21

across in the course of preparing the report.

21

22

So those are all of the main recommendations in

So this -- the idea here is that it's kind of

So that is the summary of the recommendations

22

that are contained in the report. The Commission opened

23

the report with respect to how natural persons could

23

up a comment box when we published the report, and we've

24

qualify as accredited investors. There are a couple of

24

gotten about 30 comment letters today. Some of them are

25

other recommendations that are in the report, and I'll

25

very good, very long and address all of the

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

mention those just briefly because a large percentage of
accredited investors are not individuals, but they're
entities.
The report does have a section on the
definition of entities and briefly the idea that we
suggested for the Commission to consider is rather than
focus on the type of entity -- because right now the way
that an entity could qualify is that there's a list of
different types of entities and if you're on the list -­
for example, if you're a bank or if you're a corporation
or if you're an insurance company, you're on the list and
you could potentially qualify as an accredited investor
based on being on the list.
But if you're not on the list -- and there's
many different types of entities that are not on the
list, for example, limited liability companies are not on
the list because the list was created at a time when
limited liability companies didn't really exist.
So there's a number of different types of
business entities that aren't on the list that are kind
of excluded from being an accredited investor definition
right now. So the report suggests that perhaps the
Commission treat all entities equally and any entity that
has an excess of $5 million of investments be treated as
an accredited investor.

Page 33
1

recommendations. We're hoping to get many more. We're

2

excited to see what recommendations this committee comes

3

up with. And just a couple of quick themes that we've

4

seen is that we're not surprised to see that there are

5

people on all sides of the debate when it comes to the

6

comments.

7

So there are some people who think that the

8

Commission should do nothing with the definition because

9

it's worked very well in their opinion. There are people

10

who think that the thresholds -- the financial thresholds

11

should be increased. There are dome people who think

12

that they should be decreased. So we're not surprised to

13

see lively debate on all sides of the topic.

14

One thing that almost everybody does agree on,

15

though, is that the Commission should consider having

16

alternative ways for investors to qualify that are not

17

simply based on income and net worth thresholds. Not

18

everybody agrees on what exactly those alternative ways

19

should be, but it seems like there's almost universal

20

agreement that possibly having some different methods for

21

qualification is something for the Commission to

22

consider.

23

So that is the end of the summary that I had

24

about the report and I'm happy to take any questions that

25

the committee has either now or during the course of

9 (Pages 30 to 33)

2

MR. GRAHAM: Well, thank you, Michael. Thank

2

they can invest strikes me as paternalistic and

3

you for your time this morning and thank you for the time

3

potentially off base. The goal has to be to prevent

4

you've spent putting this report together.

4

fraud and not to prevent losses resulting from legitimate

1

their discussions about the definition. Thank you.

Page 36

5

I would like to hear from everyone on the

5

business failures. And I think the idea is to protect us

6

committee and just to kind of kick things off I'll say a

6

from fraudsters and not to protect ourselves -- not to

7

couple things that come to mind so that everyone else can

7

protect us from ourselves.

8

kind of collect their thoughts. But while you're here,

8

9

it's good to have you as a resource.

9

So from -- I think the -- in terms of coming up
with a more nuanced definition as well, what's it -- what

10

I've heard a lot of good ideas, but I'm not

10

is attractive about Regulation D for all of us that have

11

sure if I understand the problem we're trying to solve.

11

been around long enough to know about 146 and all the

12

Yes, the thresholds were essentially set in 1982, but

12

rest was the fact that suddenly there was certainty and

13

does that make them wrong? We're dealing with an

13

there was reduced complexity, which is something that we

14

important ecosystem that is supporting capital formation

14

should be striving for with our rules.

15

quite well and have not -- I've not heard words actually

15

16

failing from an investor protection point of view. And

16

core of what we have largely because it works. And

17

if we start tinkering too much, we could very end up

17

certainly I continue to be in favor of expanding the

18

unintentionally damaging a system that is clearly very

18

definition as well. It's -- I think more is better, but

19

important to the small business community and quite

19

you start getting into some of the suggestions with

20

frankly important to the country at large.

20

respect to defining certain levels of -- certain classes

21

of sophistication, and I think that is going to get

22

that we're actually trying to solve as opposed to just

22

complex and it may end up getting to be a little more

23

simply going and reviewing to see if we think there's an

23

complicated than we would like. But as long as that's

24

issue, I would be reluctant to do too much.

24

not the only way and as long as we preserve the core, I

25

think that it continues to work.

21

25

So absent better articulation of the problem

So I continue to be in favor of preserving the

Again, there are a lot of good-sounding ideas

that I think are attractive at least on their face. I

1

2

think just the whole notion of putting -- taking

2

Those are just a few of my initial thoughts.

3

thresholds and coming up with the 500,000, 750,000, 2.5

3

MS. MOTT: Michael, thank you for that report

4

million changes, I think that if -- I can understand the

4

and the summary. I read it, but it was good to go back

5

logic that underlies that suggestion. Certainly things

5

through and pull out the highlights. So I'm going to

6

like including spousal equivalents is just kind of

6

echo some of Stephen's thoughts. When I look at 1982,

7

bringing things in line with the times I think. And

7

that was an arbitrary number, and what was the basis for

8

Commissioner Piwowar's suggestion about portfolio theory,

8

which that was selected.

9

taking that into consideration, that just makes my head

9

So -- yes, Catherine?

And I also am going to waive the American flag

10

explode. But I think -- but it sounds definitely worth

10

here. So when I say this it's that I look at 1982, 1.8

11

of consideration.

11

percent qualified; 2014, 10 percent qualified. And I

12

think about my own market as a -- running and angel group

12

But has anyone shown that investments in this

13

sector are any more problematic than the public markets,

13

and running a venture fund is that we are the economic

14

markets by the way that are made available to

14

engine for net job creation in the United States. And

15

unaccredited investors spectacular failures? And are we

15

actually when you look at the corporate numbers, they're

16

seeing increased fraud in this segment? I'm not sure

16

net job -- what do you call it -- net job losers.

17

that we are. And while 1982 was not yesterday, at least

17

They're always doing -- they're about becoming

18

two things come to mind. One, who's to say that the

18

bigger with less people. We're about becoming bigger

19

numbers in 1982 weren't too high? They're just numbers.

19

with more people. And so when I think about these

20

things, I think it's really critical for us to think

20

And, two, I think the context has changed

21

dramatically. We talk about information and the ability

21

about do no harm, especially when the world economy is -­

22

to educate oneself and certainly with the advent of the

22

right now is a tech economy. And for us to be

23

internet and other technology, it's -- 2016 is quite a

23

competitive in the marketplace, I believe that this has

24

different place than 1982.

24

to be a very robust market. So one of the things we

25

shouldn't do is limit it to the point that we become less

25

So -- and also to develop a framework where we

10 (Pages 34 to 37)


Page 38
1

competitive globally.

1

I also think around the numbers, around 2.5

2

Page 40
2

current definition is protecting us from ourselves?
MR. GRAHAM: When I said I didn't know what the

3

million as a threshold with 500 annually, that might

3

4

really work well in Los Angeles or New York City, but for

4

5

me in Pittsburgh or somebody in Louisville, Kentucky or

5

I just -- it is odd to me that in SEC the rulemaking, not

6

elsewhere, there's some disparity there because doctors

6

only does it require -- as a place for advisors to advise

7

in my angel group are making 300,000, but if they were in

7

on these things, CPAs, lawyers to certify private

8

New York City, they'd be making 550,000.

8

offerings, it has a committee of this room to suggest on

9

the appropriate accredited investor rule and it has lots

So putting those numbers around -- I think it

9

problem was, I was being facetious.
MR. HAUPTMAN: All right. Fair enough. Yeah,

10

unfairly limits the middle of America where the middle of

10

of SEC staff. There are folks in this room on this

11

America needs it more than Silicon Valley and Boston and

11

committee who don't meet the standard.

12

New York.

12

I'll tell you right now I don't. So it's odd

13

The other thing I would like to comment on is

13

to me that I'm being asked to opine on it when this same

14

if we pick something like $750,000 investments as a

14

committee won't allow me to invest $5,000 on it. But I

15

threshold, we're doing the same thing we did in 1982.

15

do have a seat at the table to advise on trillions of

16

We're picking a number. And what basis are we picking

16

dollars of offerings. It just -- I don't know.

17

that number?

17

If it was Excel, it would be one of those

18

And then finally one of the things I think

18

circular errors and to have staff who -- I don't know

19

about when -- you know, I'm thrilled when we see the

19

anybody's finances, but to have a place in the regulation

20

increase in private offerings. The market drivers for

20

for all of these professionals, including the members of

21

that, though, is what we have to give thought to. One of

21

this group who are not eligible to invest even a small

22

the things I'd like to understand about those numbers is

22

amount of money outside of the new crowdfunding, it just

23

when I think about the public companies delisting and

23

strikes me as an opportunity to review it and ask which

24

taking private capital because it's no longer an

24

part of it that -- what I consider a circular error is

25

opportunity for them to grow, there are limits because

25

the issue.

Page 39

Page 41

1

they have to report quarterly, which is fine, but if they

1

2

don't get the numbers properly -- don't hit the market

2

with that. It's, again, I -- we have a system that

3

expectations, they can't invest long-term. And so they

3

clearly works. We have a system where I haven't seen a

4

delist. So how much of that 1.-some trillion that I'm

4

lot of evidence of fraud and -- or otherwise the need for

5

trying to remember what it was now is actually coming

5

the kind of investor protection we're used to thinking

6

from private capital because public companies have to

6

about in terms of enforcing our laws and that sort of

7

delist.

7

thing. So that works. So let's not bother -- let's not

8

adversely affect the core.

8

The other is: How much of this is driving -­

MR. GRAHAM: Yeah, and I would tend to agree

9

is because of the tech economy? I mean it's something

9

But there are a lot of good ideas that come

10

that we didn't have in 1982 but we have now. And so

10

into the subject of expansion, and I mean you've

11

private capital is needed for that, and it has been

11

mentioned something which I think pretty much hits it.

12

growing because we've been educated by the internet and

12

And that's we've got so many people that are -- they're

13

MR. HAUPTMAN: Yeah. I like what you said,

very little dramatic evidence that there is a direct

from ourselves and the investments we pick. But at the

suggest that wealth as a yardstick implies sophistication

just strikes me that, in fact, people with an unusual

15

And as a personal -- as an angel investor in 30

What has been earlier mentioned in terms of the

So I wonder if we might be looking at the wrong

The securities laws and the mission of the

16

end of the telescope. I heard the assertion that this

16

slope, because how much education do you need to invest

17

has worked. I would heretically challenge that. I'm not

17

and do you need different kinds of education to invest in

18

sure -- what has it worked? What's an example recently ­

18

different deals?

19

- recently of an example where the accredited investor

19

20

rule has saved people money that they would have lost if

20

I'm a sophisticated securities lawyer, but I do have

21

they had been able to invest it.

21

trouble when I'm reading the footnotes to Bank of

22

America's 10-K.

22

And I would suggest the final point I'll make,

I think I used the analogy the last time that

23

which actually you made, which I think is incredibly

23

24

important is that today I can go on the internet today

I have invested in deals involving science. I

25

and I can find out virtually every single thing about

everybody in this room -- their social security number,

1

Excluding retirement assets was another idea that had

2

their income, their neighbors, everything about them

2

been mentioned.

3

today is available.

3

Again, all these I think fall within the idea

4

So the fact or the assertion that unaccredited

4

that we need to protect people from themselves. And, in

5

investors have as much blindness about the prospects of a

5

fact, as we age up, almost everything that we invest in

6

company as they did in 1982 when it was written is also

6

becomes our retirement assets. So I guess I second or

7

specious. So I think if information is readily available

7

third the viewpoint that we really should be talking

8

in a wide variety of pathways for people that have

8

about expanding the sphere of Americans who can invest in

9

appetites for risk that may or may not be appropriate for

9

transactions in the private market and not restricting

10

their income, have we fixed anything or solved anything

10

11

or corrected anything with this since '82? I'm not sure

MR. GRAHAM: Thanks, Greg.

I see the evidence. I believe as was stated a while ago

MS. HANKS: Yeah, I had a question for Michael,

16

committee, the investor advisory committee,

17

because I think Commissioner Piwowar set it up and Mike

17

recommendations and in our recommendations, we keep

18

just said the same thing. I think more effort, talking

18

saying you should continue studying the data. The

19

about how to open it up to people who are not accredited

19

trouble is I'm not sure that we actually have the right

20

would be important.

20

data.

15

21

And it's the logical extension of our

21

Steve mentioned earlier measures of dubious

22

discussion previously at this committee where we talked

22

utility. And I think here we're looking at metrics of

23

about some of the fallacies in trying to protect people

23

dubious utility. One of the most interesting things that

24

and for example protecting seniors. Obviously everyone

24

I think is in the staff's report is the Swedish study

25

wants to protect seniors, but what is a senior now? And

25

where contrary to what Mark said -- and maybe it's

12 (Pages 42 to 45)


Page 46

Page 48

1

because they're Swedes -- but there's a study there that

1

2

shows that financial sophistication does, in fact,

2

already exceed the $1 million net worth test anyway?

3

increase with wealth. And that's a very, very

3

would come through commenters that chime in in response

4

interesting data point, but it was one of the very few

4

to the report, and I think all of those comments and

5

relative data points that we've actually got.

5

views would be helpful as the Commission continues to
consider the topic.

Part of the getting additional data I think

6

Because the metrics we've got are how many fall

6

7

into this bucket, how many fall into this bucket. If you

7

8

took this measure out, how many would be in this other

8

get Kyle. When you -- we talk about the data, we talk

9

bucket. But we're not answering the basic question, as

9

about the fact that, for example, we know what the

MR. GRAHAM: Well, Sebastian, at a minimum we

10

Steve said, which is: What problem are we trying to

10

definition of accredited -- what today's definition of

11

solve here? What could we be looking for? What data can

11

accredited investor is. But we don't know precisely who

12

we access that would actually help us answer this

12

is doing the actual investing. And so -- but, again, it

13

question.

13

just kind of gets me to my point: Why are we trying to

14

find the answer to that question? I'm still trying to
appreciate that.

14

And I know that's a very difficult thing to

15

answer at the moment, but until we know what we should be

15

16

looking for, I'm not sure that we have a decision to

16

I think we started out someplace which, as

17

make. What data sets are out there, Michael, and what

17

Catherine suggested and I think I may have suggested it

18

would we like to be looking for here?

18

as well, that was arbitrary. 1982 I think was probably

19

MR. GOMEZ: Can I chime in and -- Sara, I think

19

arbitrary. But that's kind of where we are.

20

one of the challenges as looking at data is understanding

20

And, Mark, when I say that something works,

21

who is actually investing versus who is just not

21

what I mean is that we have a system in place where small

22

interested in investing. And I think part of the

22

businesses are able to raise $1.3 trillion a year. Don't

23

challenges is understanding that. Now the difficulty is

23

ask me why, but that does happen and with the current

24

once you come up with a definition that encompasses a

24

system.

25

group just because they're not investing now, it doesn't

25

So that's -- anyway, Lisa, you had -­

Page 47

Page 49

1

mean that they're not going to invest in the future.

1

2

A lot of the data that we have looks at

2

echo what you were saying, too, to hurry and jump in

MS. SHIMKAT: Yes. And I'm kind of going to
before it's all -- before it just is echoing.

3

percentage of the populations that either qualify under

3

4

the current thresholds or would potentially qualify on

4

The -- I disagree a little bit because the no

5

the revised thresholds. I think it would be very

5

complaints could come back to we're not measuring the

6

interesting through the comment process for people who

6

right stuff. And maybe instead it's doing a really good

7

are active investors to provide some more information

7

job to have the qualified investor, is it for prevention

8

that would help the Commission understand who is actually

8

of fraud or protect losses. And then it's the chicken

9

investing out of that pool of 10 percent of the

9

and the egg. It feels like we have a very circular

10

population. Do we really have 10 percent of the American

10

11

population investing in Reg D offerings, or is it a much

11

conversation there.

12

smaller pool of those investors?

12

thoroughly agree the cost of living there, you know, a

And especially being in the Midwest I

13

I know the Angel Capital Association has done

13

4,000 square-foot home, 115,000. And so it kind of puts

14

some surveys of their members who are active investors in

14

some things in perspective.

15

that area. It would be interesting to see what the

15

(Off-mic comment.)

16

profile of those members are. Also challenging is the

16

17

fact when you add other measures of sophistication, it's

17

18

sometimes difficult to understand whether those measures

18

19

of sophistication will encompass new people that would

19

consideration, too. And you spoke about 1.8 to 10

20

come into the pool, or are they just the same people who

20

percent, but the 10 percent I don't think is a bad

21

currently qualify under the definition.

21

number. Maybe we should look at it as, wow, that should

22

actually be closer to 20 percent. The 1.3 trillion, why

22

So, for example, if you are a -- if you pass

Well, after I get rid of a few kids, I'll let
you know.
But -- so that needs to be taken into

23

the Series 83 examination, are most of those individuals

23

isn't it 2 trillion? Do we -- where are our

24

who already qualify under the current definition? If you

24

opportunities? And, yes, what the commissioner said made

25

already have $750,000 in investments, are you likely to

25

my head explode, too, but at the same time it was like

13 (Pages 46 to 49)


Page 50

Page 52

1

the Wizard of Oz. You pull that curtain back and think,

1

there. I work with some of these clients. When I was -­

2

oh, hey, there's other opportunities here. And I think

2

when I worked for large corporations that were SEC

3

maybe that's another way to look at it.

3

reported, things went like a top. You didn't have to
address many of the issues that you do when you're first

4

But it's about also, Stephen, what you said,

4

5

too, the why side, asking those why questions. Why the

5

starting and taking clients through that process of

6

number? Is the number for protecting those losses or

6

beginning to become more formal, having to register,

7

preventing fraud? Why the sophistication if there are

7

having to do things differently.

8

other avenues? Are we regulating the wrong side of it?

8

9

Is there the other end of it that maybe the enforcement

9

10
11

side can focus on that versus the investor side?
And it's a totally changing landscape. And,

So I would suspect -- and this is just
qualitative -- that once we start to have an equal level

10

of examination that perhaps there is a little bit -- I'd

11

be surprised if there weren't more, frankly, let's say

12

yes, we don't have the demographics. There could be

12

educational opportunities that could borderline onto

13

those investors that are being counted twice because

13

aggressive types of reporting. I think in the past it's

14

they're here, they're investing in this as well. So we

14

been okay because we've had a limited pool of investors.

15

need to maybe look at positioning ourselves for what our

15

16

overall intent is. And that's where asking why the three

16

Commissioner Piwowar that was saying are we in a way

17

to five times -- why are we doing this, why do we need to

17

limiting then the general population to participate in

18

know this and what is our overall goal and how is it

18

the growth of the economy? So as we push our people more

19

going to make it better.

19

into retirement to rely less on governmental assistance,

20

defined contribution or defined retirement plans from

20

So I think those are things that maybe this

But that brings back to the point of

21

regulation is giving us or the qualified side is giving

21

large corporations, they are being forced to go to other

22

us more of an acceptable loss of capital investment is

22

avenues of investments, which I'm not disagreeing with.

23

because there could be a portion that we're not

23

But by conceptually if we're limiting that

24

capturing, but it's not the portion that is speaking up,

24

population not to have access to this, are we in essence

25

it's not the portion that's writing in. And it's just a

25

limiting their future and their retirement also? So

Page 51
1

these are just a couple of questions that I have, one on

2

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you.

2

throwing it out there to think -- for people to think

3

Laura.

3

about as far as what our greater purpose it, and then,

MS. YAMANAKA: Well, actually, yeah, you've got

1

different thought on it, and I just wanted to share that.

Page 53

4

two, I really wish we could get some additional data on

5

to weigh in early because everybody says great things

5

the fraud.

6

here. But as to why, I have a different perspective why

6

7

we're here. We're here, in my opinion, to protect and

7

because when those businesses go under, it's less

8

encourage and increase the greatest capital system in the

8

spectacular. It might be regionally of interest, but

9

world right now, right, with all our faults, with all our

9

it's much more notable when you have an Enron or

4

10
11

issues, with all our complaints.
And when I look at that, although I respect

10
11

I also suspect we don't hear about it as much

executive life or something else in that case.
MR. GRAHAM: And to your point, what's to

stability -- hey, I'm an accountant, right? You know,

12

prevent the unsophisticated investor from buying Enron

our goal is stability. On the other hand, to some other

13

stock?

14

people's points, are we missing out on an opportunity for

14

15

capital formation that has grown tremendously?

15

So if I look at the infrastructure that we've

12
13

MS. YAMANAKA: Yeah, you're absolutely -- well,
absolutely.

16

MR. GRAHAM: I think like Mark was saying I

17

put into place for public corporations with the SEC

17

think, a fool and his money will soon be separated. We

18

reporting, that's huge. We've got another segment of the

18

don't need to -­

19

population or our business that has grown to be a

19

20

comparable size and kind of -- it appears to me that the

20

certain -- I mean we all have to accept a certain amount

21

regulation process is not supported, frankly, on the same

21

of risk, right? And in reality unless we close it down

22

level as far as infrastructure support. We don't know, I

22

absolutely, we are going to have those situations in my

23

think, about the fraud because we don't look at it, we

23

mind. But that's my opinion.

24

don't have the mechanisms in place to identify it.

24

MR. GRAHAM: Annemarie.

25

MS. TIERNEY: I actually echo Laura's comments

16

25

I'm going to throw a qualitative statement in

14 (Pages 50 to 53)


MS. YAMANAKA: And I think we have to accept a

Page 54

Page 56

1

also. One of my thoughts was that we see the data that

1

investors and improve capital formation after the Great

2

public market returns are just not where they were in

2

Depression.

3

1982. Probably in 1982 if you invested in a public

3

4

company, you could expect a pretty substantial return

4

all done in private offerings. So the idea was to

5

over the life of your investment. Those dynamic is

5

improve disclosure, to allow investors to have certain

6

changing now. The real returns in investment seem to be

6

basic information they could rely on, whether it was

7

in the private company space as opposed to the public

7

audited financials or other required disclosures, and

8

company space.

8

they would be able to compare investments. So they'd be

9

apples to apples.

9

And I also had the exact same point in my

So there was a huge amount of fraud. It was

10

brain, Laura, which is that significant numbers of U.S.

10

11

investors are not going to be getting a pension when they

11

12

retire. We're going to be relying on our 401(k)s, we're

12

You could do an offering with 15 of your closest wealthy

13

going to be relying on our portfolios. And if the most

13

friends, and that was sort of the only way to get out of

14

significant access to return is in the private company

14

the disclosure requirements of the '33 Act in particular.

15

space, why would we limit that opportunity.

15

16

I really react very badly to the idea of a

So if you go back to those acts, both of them
severely restricted the ability to do a private offering.

Going forward, go to 1982 -- but the subsequent

16

years you have the '40 Act, which is mutual fund

17

dollar investment limit. We've already imposed that in

17

protections and thinking through things, again, in a

18

Reg A and Crowdfunding. You're protecting people against

18

different way because of problems in the marketplace,

19

loss as opposed to protecting people against fraud, which

19

still very firmly based on disclosure. We get to '82,

20

I don't think is the best way for the market to be

20

and we're basically saying, again, it's a new world,

21

developing. I don't need somebody to say to me you can

21

we're going to open up the ability to have more of these

22

only invest this much in an opportunity that I really

22

unregistered offerings, so you don't have to submit

23

believe is right for me in my own specific circumstances

23

paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It

24

with my own specific risk tolerance.

24

doesn't have to be in the same form, so investors compare

25

apples to apples, and you're going to be providing it

25

I don't that at the SEC you should be imposing

Page 55

Page 57

1

suitability on investors as a general rulemaking

1

people who can rely on -- who are sophisticated enough to

2

endeavor. I think it should be up to investors to make

2

decide whether to part with their money based on the

3

those decisions for themselves. And over the last 10

3

information that is being provided.

4

years we've been limiting those opportunities and those

4

5

choices for U.S. investors, which I just don't think

5

we have venture capital, we have all these wonderful

6

there's a basis for.

6

things happening in the marketplace. But I think one of

7

the underlying issues is -- and I hear it over and over

7

And I would like to understand: Is there data

We go on down the line, we have private equity,

8

that shows that it's more risky to invest in a Reg D

8

even from the very sophisticated players is sometimes

9

offering than in the public markets?

9

it's hard to demand and get the information you need to

10

Commissioner Stein, you referred to the

10

make the investment. It depends on your leverage so to

11

implosion of the markets for housing prices and the

11

speak as an investor about whether or not you can get the

12

public markets, but that was hosing prices in the public

12

information you need.

13

markets. People lost trillions of dollars of wealth in

13

14

the public markets. I don't know what the data looks

14

have a growing private market. It is now bigger than the

15

like in the private space, but that would be something

15

public market. I think there are issues about how is

16

I'd be really interested in learning.

16

that affecting price discovery and the public marketplace

17

if we're having more and more happen in the private

18

space. And if more and more is happening in the private

17
18

COMMISSIONER STEIN: I think they lost it every
during the -­

So I guess I would reframe this. In my mind we

19

MS. TIERNEY: I think you're right.

19

space, maybe that's okay. But what type of disclosures

20

COMMISSIONER STEIN: -- financial crisis just

20

or information should be required to sophisticated,

21

for the record. Anecdotal at this point. But can I just

21

accredited players or the less accredited players? We're

22

say one thing? I think one of the things -- maybe this

22

talking retail investors.

23

is being securities geek -- is I go back before 1982 to

23

So I think we have this -- we've been using

24

the '33 Act and the '34 Act, right, which are sort of

24

this accredited investor standard as a gateway for

25

foundational here for how we thought about how to protect

25

whether you get to invest in the private market or the

15 (Pages 54 to 57)


Page 58
1

public market. Maybe that's not the right gate.
But I think the bigger issue from a conceptual

2

Page 60
1

offering side when talking about accreditation? You

2

know, maybe there's a different standard for different

3

standpoint is this divide between private and public and

3

types of issuers or different types of offerings. I feel

4

what does it mean for the private marketplace if it's -­

4

like there may be certain areas -- certain types of

5

you know, it's easier to get money through the private

5

issuers or offerings where fraud may be more likely,

6

than the public. What does it mean for the public? And

6

where maybe you have a higher standard. So there's a lot

7

do we need a different conception now eighty years more

7

of discussion about the investor, but I'm just wondering

8

than that after the Great Depression.

8

if there's been any consideration of the other side in

9

terms of throwing that into the mix of the definition.

So I think that, again, securities geek, but

9

MR. SEAMAN: So in the report we do talk a

10

sort of framing it differently is these are all part of

10

11

the same continuum of capital raising and the world is

11

little bit about that idea in terms of whether the

12

changing and we're being disrupted as everybody knows in

12

definition should be tailored in different ways and based

13

this room, but I think we have to think through both

13

on the type of issuer is one of the things that the

14

sides of the equation, the private and the public and how

14

report does address and talks about. But at the end of

15

we help investors make the best decisions they can to

15

the day, none of the recommendations that were set out in

16

take on as much risk as they might be willing to take on.

16

the report actually recommended the Commission consider

17

doing that.

But we have these different tools in our

17

toolbox for investor protection and how should we use

18

And I think that speaking personally like

19

them in 2016 and beyond? So that's -- again, I think it

19

possibly one of the reasons was that would just

20

goes back pre-1982, severely limiting access to private

20

complicate the definition in potentially a way that would

21

offerings, starting to open that up, using this

21

make it a little bit more unwieldy than it is currently.

22

definition as the gateway whether it's the right one or

22

23

not. And where are we now in 2016?

23

Sebastian. The echo in this room, sometimes it's hard to

24

figure out where it's coming from. Anecdotally I think

25

we've also heard from people mentioning how they would

MR. GRAHAM: So, Commissioner, are you asking a

24
25

different question of -- are you asking whether we should

MR. GOMEZ: And, Jenny, anecdotally -- here,

Page 59
1

be focused on disclosure as opposed to a definition -­
COMMISSIONER STEIN: No, I guess I'm saying as

2

Page 61
1

view it differently. Some people have said, well, if

2

you're invested in a hedge fund, your risk is going to be

3

we talk about the definition in the private space, it

3

a lot less. Therefore maybe the standard should be

4

very much implicates the public as well, and I think we

4

different if your investment is in a hedge fund.

5

need to actually be thinking about both, you as a

5

6

committee, us as a Commission.

6

says, well, why trust your money to the hedge fund,

7

(Off-mic comment.)

7

instead the risk would be less if you actually can meet

8

MR. GRAHAM: Okay. And I think some -- okay.

8

with the people at the company and understand their

9

business. And so I think while the idea had been

9

Let's -- one, two, three.
MS. KASSAN: Thank you. I just wanted to

10

Some people have taken the opposite view and

10

mentioned, at the same time I think a lot of people

11

mention we haven't talked about rule 504. I have -- I'm

11

differ onto how they would apply it and they would come

12

an attorney and I have clients that are fairly small

12

up at different answers based on the way they look at it.

13

raising a few hundred thousand. And they use Rule 504

13

14

and then they do state-level compliance. So, for

14

of issuer and saying these issuers can deal with a light

15

example, in California, you can have up to 35

15

accredited investor versus a heavier accredited investor.

16

unaccredited investors.

16

So I think that's another interesting question:

17

17

And it's not necessarily pointing to one type

MR. GRAHAM: Yes.
MR. GUTIERREZ: So, first of all, appreciate

18

Why is it that if the issuer's only raising a million

18

this conversation. I really wanted to make three

19

you actually don't have to be accredited to invest. So

19

comments. The first is that I do think it is important

20

it would be interesting to see, you know, look at some of

20

for us to review these types of things besides the fact

21

the 504 offerings and see if there's -- what the data is

21

that it's mandated by Dodd-Frank, I think it's important

22

on the unaccredited investors that are investing in

22

for us to take a look at this periodically to see if we

23

those.

23

are actually answering the right question.

24
25

And then I also have a question, which is: Has
there been any consideration of the issuer or the

16 (Pages 58 to 61)


24
25

The second comment is as I was reading the
report, the recommendations, it felt as if there was this

connection and this correlation of you have more
investors, and thus you have a bigger problem, which I
had an issue with. I don't believe that that correlation
should be there, and I think it should be closer to a
reexamination of the issue of are we getting the proper
disclosures within Reg D and dealing more with the
issuers rather than with the investors on this problem.
The final comment I wanted to make is I wanted
to bring sort of our or my perspective of dealing with
small business owners, right, that quite frankly would
not qualify under these new qualifications. However,
they are incredibly sophisticated. They may be
incredibly sophisticated in those industries in which
they'd like to put money out. And so from the
perspective of these millions of small business owners
changing the rules on them would actually be incredibly
limiting.
And I really would like for us to keep that in
mind as to who exactly we're talking about when we're
talking about investors. You have this incredibly robust
small business community led by business owners and
changes that would limit their opportunity I think would
be very hard-pressed for me to be supportive of. So
thank you.
MR. GRAHAM: Thank you.

MR. GRAHAM: Robert, did you -- okay.

Patrick.

3

letter on file on this, and so I'm not going to repeat

5

what's in there. But, Commissioner Stein, I think

6

there's two issues here. One is disclosure material

7

information and -- with which I vigorously agree that

8

anybody who makes a private placement investment needs to

9

have all material information in front of them and that

10

that is essential. And there's no dispute from me that

11

they need that, that that's important. That's just a

12

rule you play by. If you're going to sell securities,

13

you have to disclose all material information, 10(b)5.

14

if -- my experience has been that all the rules in the

16

world are not going to prevent crooks from being crooks.

17

So are you fixing something -- do you fall into the trap

18

of fixing something that you can't fix? In other words,

19

are we trying to prevent fraud here? I'd like to. I'd

20

like that there would be something we could write on this

21

piece of paper that says -- that would prevent fraud, but

22

I'm afraid that's ineffective. I think what you're doing

23

is you're burdening honest people with trying to deal

24

with crooks.

25

Was it Robert or Brian?

1

2

MR. HAHN: So I work for a biotech company that

2

3

operated as a private company for 11 years before we went

3

4

public. Several times a year we present our data at

4

5

different scientific meetings, and we've been approached

5

6

by people in the field, by scientists who are very

6

7

excited about our novel approach to drug development and

7

8

wanted to invest in the company. But as a private

8

9

company, they didn't qualify, they weren't able to.

9

10

Biotech companies fail because of bad science, usually

10

11

not fraud.

11
12

13

open to expanding. Even to Commissioner Piwowar's

13

14

recommendation or comments about getting rid of limits,

14

15

if we keep the limits, either reduce them or come up with

15

16

some other way to expand this pool.

16

17

One of the reasons we went public was because

The crooks have to be dealt with by

Page 65

1

We're -- and in the biotech industry we're very

So the other side is do you prevent fraud. And

15

Page 63

12

MR. REARDON: Thank you. I've got a comment

4

17

18

of lack of options for funding as a private company. And

18

19

a lot of times we were permanently -- we were actually

19

20

all VC-backed and a lot of times with our three rounds of

20

21

VC funding, you're beholden to the VC to dictate the

21

22

valuation and the term sheets. And I think there's a

22

23

bigger pool of investors, that would actually help small

23

24

companies determine the true value of the company instead

24

25

of just having it dictated to you.

25

enforcement, and I'm all in favor of vigorous
enforcement. Kick their butts. I'm from a state that
once sent a securities violator to prison for life
because that was his third offense and he was a three­
time loser. So he went to jail for life for securities
fraud. And there's no regret on my part about that.
So that -- and I don't mean to disagree with
you, and I hope -- I mean I think fraud is -- and you've
got a tremendous budget here for fraud, plus you've got
the 50 states chasing fraud. So -- plus private
litigation. That, to me, is an issue.
Chair White, you gave a speech at the end of
March in the Silicon Valley that was very interesting.
And I think that one of the -­
CHAIR WHITE: I barely got out alive just so
you know.
MR. REARDON: Oh, you barely got out alive?
Well -­
CHAIR WHITE: I did, though.
MR. REARDON: Well, I'm glad you did. We're
happy to have you back. And in that speech you were
talking about that the -- all this money has flowed into
the private sector and that it's not subject to the
scrutiny that it gets in a public offering. And I agree
with that.

1

And funny thing, I call around and talk to

1

2

clients and friends I have in business where I come to

2

guys from MIT.

3

these meetings because they all -- every once in a while

3

well, here's some names, call some people and get going

4

they give me a nugget of something. And I was talking to

4

on your widget. And he comes back and not the names I

5

a man who had been a CFO of a private company. And he

5

gave him, he comes back with two fellas who told him,

6

said, "Yeah, I remember S-16," that form which was the

6

well, we're going to get professional athletes to invest

7

simplified form for public offerings under $1 and a half

7

in your deal. Not a good sign. And nor can you contact

8

million. Was that right? I can't -- it was a very small

8

the professional athletes, you're not allowed to talk to

9

amount.

9

them.

And -- but -- so I took him on, and I told him,

10

Well, we have gone a long way from that. And I

10

11

look back and I'm -- maybe my perspective is different

11

are some other signs that this is bad. And I said these

And so he's all excited about this, and there

12

than some people, but I look back and I look at like

12

-- this is not good. These signs are not good. I'm

13

Sarbanes-Oxley, I look at Dodd-Frank, I look at other

13

afraid they're going to take you. And I didn't know how

14

things, and I see that the takeaway that I have is that

14

they were going to take him, but he was getting set up.

15

money runs away from overregulation. Okay? So the risk

15

16

we run in the private sector is if we overregulate, it

16

there was no Santa Claus, and he was saying there is a

17

will go somewhere else, which means offshore. And we'll

17

Santa Claus. And finally at the end of the conversation,

18

have other people investing.

18

"Mr. Reardon, you're fired," which was okay with me

And so the client just wouldn't -- I was saying

19

Now do I think this one step is going to do

19

because if I couldn't convince him that he was going to

20

that? No. But I think somewhere in the back of your

20

get taken, then he needed to go to the cleaners without

21

mind you've got to be saying we have to balance here what

21

me.

22

we're going to do and put it in some sort of perspective.

22

23

The one thing I'd like to see is for it to be easier to

23

don't know a lot of accredited investors. They don't -­

24

do public offerings once again. If money's running away

24

the people -- they are all working people that they

25

from the public sector, have we overregulated that?

25

associate with and the higher you make the standard, the

And -- but those are the kind of people, they

harder it is for that guy, assuming he gets a good

2

has done a lot of this, and you've got to do what

investor, to go out and get good investors. And the

3

Congress tells you to do, but -- and that's another

airplane was invented by some mechanics in Dayton, Ohio.

4

discussion. But you're the only three people in this

4

So, anyway, I would also say that net worth

5

room that can think about that because this is really a

5

versus -- excuse me. I feel like Marco Rubio. Net worth

6

policy decision.

6

and income standards versus amount invested, those are -­

7

that is what in Texas we call messing in your chili.

1

7

And I understand there are a lot of -- Congress

Page 69

But I'll just raise that question and say we've

8

-- somewhere there's a balance out there and two tree -­

8

Then you get into what everybody's net worth is or income

9

that's a forest comment. Two or three tree comments.

9

and that gets into a bunch of things that people don't

10

One is that remember that net worth requirements and

10

want you looking at. And I'd be careful about that. And

11

income requirements discriminate against geographic

11

I think those are my comments.

12

areas, that if you are -- have highly rural areas, you're

12

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you, Patrick.

13

going to have fewer accredited investors in those areas.

13

Greg.

14

And companies tend to invest or tend to get their

14

MR. YADLEY: If I had any sense, I'd let

15

investors from people in their neighborhoods. So you're

15

somebody else go after Patrick, but I'm -- I think, first

16

precluding that.

16

of all, I'd like to thank the chair and the two

17

The other thing to keep in mind is that higher

17

commissioners for being here so long with us and

18

standards also discriminate against socioeconomics. And

18

listening attentively because I think what we all agree

19

I'll tell a quick story. I once had a -- excuse me, I

19

on is -- and the history review that Commissioner Stein

20

once had a client come in to me, and he had a widget.

20

gave us instructive -- the world has changed immensely

21

And this man misused words and very limited formal

21

and this private-public dichotomy that we go back and

22

education and -- but I like take these on kind of with

22

forth on helps inform us about what we should do except

23

the -- sometimes because if they're interesting, I always

23

that there's so many things now and the Commission should

24

think that the airplane was invented by two bicycle

24

be commended for experimenting sometimes with

25

mechanics from Dayton, Ohio. So it wasn't a bunch of

25

congressional prodding, which is sometimes not helpful.

18 (Pages 66 to 69)


Page 70
But crowdfunding will change some of these

1

Page 72
1

The observation of the chairman yesterday as

2

things that we've taken for granted. 506(c), which is

2

we're trying to get this deal across the transom is it

3

not being used that much yet, when it does that will

3

was much easier to sell the two public companies we

4

change things. But a couple of observations and back to

4

started, and that's true because all the information was

5

what I said earlier that disclosure is the key. But

5

out there. The reason it's harder to sell a private

6

disclosure is really sunshine, in the words of the

6

company, as we all know, is private equity is the name of

7

Supreme Court justice, being the great disinfectant.

7

the game. And private equity people do due diligence.

8

It's not that investors -- retail investors read 10-Ks

8

They hire accountants, they hire lawyers, and the

9

and annual reports or that analysts read all of them

9

standard is very, very high. It's their money that

10

they're responsible for and their carried interests and

11

But the fact of the matter is the disclosure

11

everything else.

12

standard is very high and it's very general, and that has

12

13

worked pretty well because it forces people to think

13

private equity stages before they finally go public,

14

about what you want to say about your company and your

14

investors have that same ability to make a decision on

15

investment and the with encouragement of forward-looking

15

the management team and on the prospects -- and this has

16

statements which is a relatively new phenomenon, what

16

been self-regulating. The private equity groups decide

17

will happen in the future. And so now it's out there,

17

what to look for, they get the information they need, and

18

and you have to stand behind it. And that's been very

18

when I was a younger lawyer I had no opportunity to

19

important for investors whether they read it or not.

19

invest in these funds, because, A, I didn't have the

20

money like Kyle, and, B, the minimum investment was more
than I could have had and certainly more than the

10

either.

But the public or the private markets have also

20

And as companies go through more and more

21

been gatekeepers of sorts, and 506(b), while it was

21

22

restrictive in that you could only approach people that

22

investment limitations that we would put on -- some of

23

you knew and not everybody quite understands what general

23

the limitations that people have suggested.

24

solicitation is because it's not defined, but in essence,

24

25

people did invest, particularly in smaller offerings with

25

But over time -- and I lost money in my very
first private deal, and that was instructive, too,

Page 71
1

because it made me a little more cautious the second

2

time. Diversification is clearly the key because even

somebody's a crook, there's nothing you can do about it.

3

these private equity investors and venture capitalists

4

But if somebody is an honest business person, their

4

hit on one or two out of ten.

5

money is invested in their business. In fact, their

5

6

entire net worth is invested in that business. And,

6

regulating and I think we should encourage it and we

7

yeah, they're out soliciting money and all the

7

should, as this committee's mandate is is to look for

8

gazillionaires, from Zuckerberg to Gates to everyone

8

other ways to promote public companies because the one

9

else, they dedicated themselves to their business and

9

thing that the private companies do not have today is

1

growing companies with somebody they knew.

Page 73

Back to what many of us have said, if

2
3

So the system is working now and it is self-

10

people trusted them, the idea and the management. So

10

liquidity. And no matter how bad a public company may

11

that's one thing that has helped us conclude on this

11

stumble, you can make the decision to sell your stock now

12

committee that we don't see that much fraud out there,

12

or hold it. And with a private company you can't.

13

people dealing with people they know.

13

The second thing is I'm in the middle of

14

So -- and I guess that's probably the answer to

14

Steve's first discussion is we're studying this not

15

selling a very successful private company that started 18

15

because there's a problem. I agree with you. I don't

16

years ago, and it was going to be a company that grew and

16

think there's a problem. But with all these changes,

17

was sold within seven years. All the investors were

17

maybe we're not letting enough people in and we need to

18

individual investors, the management group had had public

18

be careful about it. So thanks.

19

company experience and venture experience.

19

MR. GRAHAM: Yes.

20

And based on the fact that this had more risk

20

21

than other deals they'd done, they said, "We're only

21

mean obviously the SEC comes from sort of the -- one of

CHAIR WHITE: Just a couple of comments. I

22

going to have individuals who can make their own

22

its main, core purposes obviously to protect investors,

23

decisions about us, not funds where people have somebody

23

how do you best do that. And I certainly take the points

24

else's money." So it's taken us this long to get to a

24

of you're going to have fraud and it's going to be out

25

sale.

25

there and how do you best sort of -- how do you prevent

19 (Pages 70 to 73)


Page 74
1
2

it and do you prevent it.
The questions about is there more or less fraud

Page 76
1

considerably, but sometimes in negative return ways, by

2

which I mean the 48 states that have a lottery -- Hawaii

3

in the private markets, in the Reg D markets than in the

3

and Utah if you're interested don't. Over 40 states have

4

public markets, press our folks this afternoon I urge you

4

casino gambling. So I think I know Commissioner

5

on that, our Enforcement people who will be here. I took

5

Piwowar's view on this because he stated it earlier.

6

advantage of my Blackberry to email them to tell them

6

7

that question had indeed come up. I had to send four or

7

so as a non-accredited investor, a thousand dollars

8

five to get what I think may be -- but I think what -­

8

Powerball tickets, a thousand dollars on a blackjack

9

yeah, I mean a couple points on that. I mean, one, I

9

table, a thousand dollars to an American entrepreneur,

But to Chair White and to Commissioner Stein,

10

think you will hear I think from them a sense -- and I

10

the only one of those that I should be arrested for is

11

said there's a sense and then there's data.

11

the last one?

12

And the data is hard to come by, I mean in a

12

CHAIR WHITE: I don't think you'd get arrested,

13

reliable way. There's sense that there is more fraud in

13

at least not by the SEC.

14

the private markets than the public markets. Press them

14

MR. HAUPTMAN: The one of those I am -­

15

on that. I mean and the data isn't what you'd want it to

15

CHAIR WHITE: The issuer might have a problem.

16

be. The other thing I would just comment on that is that

16

17

I mean when we obviously did the lifting the ban on

17

18

general solicitation obviously rightly so, lots of

18

19

concerns about is this really going to be a huge uptick

19

think this goes to maybe Lisa's comment about when you're

20

in fraud and lots of harm to investors.

20

basically thinking of what's the purpose of the

MR. HAUPTMAN: Yeah, the only one of those I am
prohibited from doing is the final one. Is that correct?
CHAIR WHITE: Yes. One other comment, and I

21

So what we've -- I figure we've done on all

21

accredited investor definition in terms of protecting

22

these new changes to some degree -- and I hope it pans

22

investors and you want to sort of define the universe as

23

out, I sort of referred to it in my remarks -- but is to

23

to those who can fend for themselves, what does that mean

24

try to monitor out the gates how these new spaces are

24

and does it have an element of protecting a certain -­

25

working, not wait three years and say how much capital

25

and, again, I understand the philosophical discussions on

Page 75

Page 77

1

got raised, how much of it was moved from one method to

1

this -- certain investors against loss as opposed to

2

another and is there fraud out there, are there other

2

protecting just against fraud.

3

rule violations harming investors. And you'll hear,

3

4

again, this afternoon -- I don't want to steal all their

4

the discussion and analysis and further debate on

5

thunder about 506(c), although we've talked to you about

5

accredited investor. If a certain amount of fraud is

6

it before.

6

inevitable, we all don't want any fraud. Obviously you

And so both of those concepts are inherent in

7

And it's -- I think the sample's not big enough

7

may not have fraud if you're not, Kyle, in that

8

yet and that has other issues in it. But I think we've

8

investment that happened to have fraud in it. So I'm not

9

not seen yet and hopefully will not a real uptick in

9

asking you to thank us or anything, but I mean -- I just

10

fraud in that space yet. So it's something -- but we're

10

11

trying to watch it as it sort of comes out of the gates.

11

MR. GOMEZ: And if I may just to add a little

12

star to Kyle's point, I think, Kyle, it depends on what

13

private, I mean I do think we have a responsibility in

13

exemption the issuer's relying on, and I think it would

14

the public markets obviously to protect investors and

14

be interesting to hear the views of the Commission as to

15

we've been at that for many, many years, but also to make

15

how the requirements of different exemptions limit who

16

our rules workable in the public sector as well. I mean

16

can participate. If Kyle was investing a thousand

17

that's part of our responsibility, too, and we're very

17

focused on that. I mean so none of this is very easy,

but, anyway, I appreciate the conversation tremendously.

20

It's been terrific.

To go to Patrick's point about sort of public­

If Kyle was investing a thousand dollars in an

MR. HAUPTMAN: If I could ask you guys a

Page 78

So I think one interesting thing when -- it

Page 80
1

to a lot of extent, we are your enforcers.

2

seems like a lot of the conversation today has focused on

2

MR. GRAHAM: Mark. And I don't know what

3

accredited investors, private and that's the only way to

3

you're about to say, but one question that I did want to

4

invest. There's different exemptions that permit non-

4

come back to you on was you seemed to toss out the idea

5

accredited investors to invest. So is there a difference

5

that maybe we should be thinking about eliminating this

6

between the exemptions? And, if so, do those differences

6

concept altogether. And if I heard you right then, I

7

actually highlight for us some of the factors we need to

7

would like to kind of hear your ideas for what you might

8

think about in determining whether someone should invest

8

do in its place if anything.

9

in a 506(c) offering or not.

9

MR. GRAHAM: Well, that's kind of a complicated

MR. WALSH: Far from being a libertarian, which

10

I am not, I just -- I think we might step back. It

11

question or a number of complicated questions are

11

strikes me that this organization is in the business of

12

embedded in what you just said, Sebastian.

12

protecting individual investors from corporate

13

misbehavior. That's regulation. I think this specific

14

thing we're talking about today is protecting individual

15

investors from their own misbehavior. And I'm not sure
that those two actually coexist in a very convenient way.

10

13
14
15

MR. GOMEZ: I trust that the committee will be
able to peel the different layers of the onion.
MR. GRAHAM: We most certainly can, but I'm not

16

sure if we have that much time. But -- and in partial

16

17

response you don't have the Facebooks of the world, for

17

So philosophically I then say to myself if the

18

example, doing Reg A offerings. A lot of the real

18

SEC is in the business of protecting individual investors

19

opportunities are going -- are not going to be in the

19

from corporate misbehavior, why is limiting individual

20

deals that -- where they're only trying to raise a half a

20

"misbehavior" under its rubric.

21

million bucks. I mean there's a lot more to that, but

21

As an example, if the janitor at Winthrop House

22

that's one thought that comes to mind.

22

at Harvard University who knew Mark Zuckerberg in 2006,

23

Catherine.

23

had been offered in a correct and paperwork -- correctly

24

MS. MOTT: One of the things I wanted to say, I

24

paperworked way, a chance to buy into Facebook at a

25

wanted to piggyback on what Greg and Patrick were saying,

25

valuation of a million and a half dollars and that

Page 79

Page 81

1

was that in many cases we are your enforcers. So if I

1

janitor was mandated to be below some ceiling that this

2

could give some examples, one, we were on the board of a

2

room put forth, could that janitor sue us for stopping

3

-- this is my angel group -- on the board of a company

3

him from making a lot of money that he should have made

4

where the CEO was having the company pay his Jaguar

4

because he knew Mark and it worked out?

5

monthly payment. Of course because there was board

5

6

oversight, the CEO was fired, and we brought in another

6

example, but I'll give it. My brother's a doctor, and he

7

CEO who was -- successfully ran the company.

I think that this is an incredibly crass

7

once said that states that don't have helmet laws for

8

So to some extent, we are your enforcers. I

8

motorcycles are a self-correcting problem. And what I

9

mean the reason -- you know, I think Patrick was saying

9

mean by that is to use some of the examples before, I

10

these are your neighbors. We drive by and make sure the

10

believe that people that rashly find ways to waste their

11

lights are on, there's cars in the parking lot. You

11

money are always going to find ways to waste their money.

12

know, there's -- I mean we make sure that the issuer is

12

So when the SEC starts to creep into moving

13

of good standing. We do the background checks.

13

from protecting individual investors from corporate

14

misbehavior into limiting individuals' behavior which is

15

lot of times you know this CEO, you know them. They're

15

what this is about, I think we should reexamine the

16

spinning out of the university and they work for the

16

entire prospect of what this means. And the final point

17

university and we know how much NIH money they got or -­

17

I'll make is about information again.

18

I mean there's just so much you know about them.

18

14

19

But not only do we do the background checks, a

And the other piece I would say to this is it's

You talked about 1930 and 1982. I believe you

19

might as well be talking about 1830 and 1882. I went to

20

the attorneys they work with. Even the attorney that

20

business school with Jeff Skilling of Enron. In 1930

21

represents us, when they're -- when the issuer is working

21

Jeff Skilling could have committed crimes and then come

22

with an attorney that's a rather novice in the securities

22

back and reissued new paper two years later and no one

23

business, my attorney's helping that attorney to get it

23

would have known. In maybe 1982 he almost could have

24

right. So there's a lot of this -- just like Patrick was

24

pulled the same thing off.

25

trying to help that potential client to get it right. So

25

But I think there is virtually no chance of a

21 (Pages 78 to 81)


Page 82

Page 84
MR. PIECIAK: Thank you very much. I just had

1

serial misbehaver in the securities industry with today's

1

2

transparency, is able to commit the same types of

2

a couple of points that I wanted to make to follow on

3

misdeeds that we saw in 1930 and 1982, and I think that

3

Chair White's comments and also Annemarie's comments from

4

this transparency level that we all now experience as

4

earlier about risk. Unfortunately, the states don't have

5

citizens and business people is an important feature of

5

a comparison to say that one private market or public

6

how I would ask that we reexamine the essence of this

6

market is more or less risky. However, we do conduct an

7

whole rule.

7

annual enforcement survey by the states collecting data

8

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you for that.

8

that's not anecdotal but not sort of a hundred percent

9

Please, please.

9

obviously complete and reliable because it's a voluntary

10

CHAIR WHITE: I was only going to say there are

10

survey.
But always ranking among the top in those

11

a lot of recidivists out there. We see them every week

11

12

in our calendar for cases. So it's not -- it -- and

12

surveys is 506 offerings. Anecdotally in Vermont I know

13

that's sort of a continuous flow of data. So I mean I

13

we spend a lot of time examining either 506 offerings or

14

don't think it -- I mean I think in -- clearly there's

14

what would otherwise be private 506 offerings when we're

15

more information flow, clearly there's more transparency

15

talking about enforcement. But at the end of the day,

16

that may stop certain things from repeating themselves,

16

again, the data is not complete and it's not absolute.

17

but we see no want of repeaters.

17

So I think it sort of ties back to this data issue.

18

MR. YADLEY; But just to add to that, of

18

And also staying on the risk topic, I mean not

19

course, the bad actor limitations are now becoming

19

just the regulatory risk but also the business risk of a

20

pervasive and that's very salutary.

20

business failing, of a startup not making it, whatever

21

MR. GRAHAM: Commissioner Piwowar.

21

the sort of terminology is, I mean I think that's another

22

COMMISSIONER PIWOWAR: Yeah, I wanted to make ­

22

component to consider in the 506 space, and I think it
comes back to data again.

23

- on a different topic. So Sara mentioned that Swedish

23

24

study and the fact that we don't have a lot of good data

24

25

here in the United States, and that study is very

25

In Vermont in our state-based crowdfunding
regime, we require a post-effective or post-offering, I

Page 83

Page 85

1

informative in the fact that it shows that richer, better

1

should say, filing that says how many investors invested,

2

educated households make better investment decisions.

2

how much they invested, was the offering successful. I

3

And let's suppose for argument's sake, that that

3

think something along those lines would be useful in

4

translates into better outcomes. Right? And so what

4

terms of a data collection aspect for 506 as well.

5

that means is that for me it means that we need to invest

5

6

a lot in investor education to educate the less

6

7

sophisticated, maybe poorer, maybe less educated

7

thing on the Swedish experiment if you don't mind. It

8

individuals.

8

just strikes me that many know this rap about in

9

economics the Arizona effect, which is the state of

9

What it does not mean -- and this is a flaw

MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Anyone else? Well -­
MR. WALSH: Can I just -- I just -- one last

10

that so many -- in logic that so many people in this town

10

Arizona has the highest per capita incidents of emphysema

11

make all the time is that to then move to the argument

11

of any state in America not because there's something in

12

that, well, because the less sophisticated people have

12

Arizona that causes emphysema, but everybody with

13

worse outcomes than the more sophisticated people, we

13

emphysema is told by their doctor to move to a dry

14

need to limit their investment opportunity set. That's a

14

climate called Arizona.

15

completely irrelevant discussion comparison.

15

So the impact of the data is not necessarily

16

correct. And I wonder if in Sweden if the outcomes of

16

The comparison that needs to be made, the

17

thought experiment needs to be: Would these less

17

more wealthy people have better financial outcomes is not

18

sophisticated individuals be better off with expanded

18

due to because the sophistication of them, but the amount

19

opportunities -- investment opportunities set. And I

19

of advice they're able to afford. So I think it you wrap

20

would argue that they would be based upon the portfolio

20

advisors -- wealth people off and get -- to give them the

21

diversification effects, all those sorts of things. So

21

good advice, their outcome is not a function of their

22

keep that in mind and please don't make the same mistake

22

personal sophistication but that the advice they're able

23

that so many people in this town make.

23

to afford.

24

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you.

24

And I wonder if to your point actually about

25

Michael.

25

education and information, that making it more available

22 (Pages 82 to 85)


Page 86

Page 88

1

may, in fact, level the playing field of the advisory

1

perfect one or not, for sophistication. An element to

2

level of that outcome as opposed to the personal

2

that is that, with some amount of wealth, someone is able

3

sophistication element of the outcome.

3

to hire someone to help work through whether a particular

4

investment is suitable.

4

MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Thank you. Well, we were

5

supposed to end at 11:30. It just happens to be 11:30.

5

I think, similarly, if we're going to look at

6

So thanks, everyone, for a very good discussion and we're

6

nonfinancial criteria, they should be simply understood

7

going to break for lunch. But, first, I guess for

7

so that it will be easier for issuers to comply with

8

archival purposes, there will be a photograph taken of

8

them. And as the Chair said this morning, when we were

9

this committee outside in five minutes on the steps. All

9

talking about data collection and making reasoned

10

decisions based on hard facts or, as Sara said, metrics

11

(Whereupon, a brief recess was taken.)

11

that are applicable to the situation, along with any

12

AFTERNOON SESSION

12

revision to the rules, the -- to elicit information that

10

right. Thank you.

13

MR. GRAHAM: Okay, why don't we get started?

13

the Commission Staff can use to see how it's working,

14

I'm going to turn this over to Sara. But

14

starting at the time of implementation.

15

before I do that, I want to just kind of recap a little

15

16

bit what we talked about this morning.

16

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you, Greg. I would agree
with that.

17

And, you know, it seems to me, you know, where

17

18

our discussion led us was pretty much to a confirmation

18

19

of this committee's prior recommendations. I think, you

19

about the dollar figure, since '82 is staying the same.

20

know, that with, you know, perhaps a need to underscore

20

I think it's an interesting point. We talked about

21

of how, you know, raising thresholds would discriminate

21

geography, with cost of living and stuff like that. But

22

against regions where the cost of living is lower and

22

I would also flip it and talk about what it takes to

23

likely discriminate against women and minority

23

start a company, so the investment opportunities -- now,

24

entrepreneurs as well.

24

I'm particularly familiar with the technology space. But

25

in 1982, it took about $100 million to start a big

25

I think we also -- there also seemed to be some

Mark?
MR. WALSH: Just one other point I want to make

Page 87

Page 89

1

consensus on expanding the definition of accredited

1

technology company. In 1992, it took about 50. In 2002,

2

investor to cover nonfinancial measures. I think

2

it took about 10. Today, it probably takes about a

3

certainly I am supportive of the concept. And as far as

3

million dollars and you can have a successful e-commerce

4

specifics are concerned, I think that requires more

4

or other technology oriented product or service or

5

thought. But certainly it was kind of intriguing to me

5

successful company.

6

to -- you know, the part of our discussion that talked

6

7

about the way our current regime might be excluding

7

other. Which is, you know, the layer announced in '82

8

people that really should not be excluded, they're being

8

and set forth, but the structural need of capital for the

9

excluded unfairly.

9

companies. And I think the May 16 debut of the million

So the two vectors are almost matching each

10

And so I think with these -- with coming up

10

dollars or less is a recognition. And I applaud the SEC

11

with different ways to qualify as accredited in the

11

for this, that the amount of dollars it takes to be

12

context of any given offering, I think it would be -- I

12

successful also is dropping.

13

think an objective should be to find a way to include

13

14

those who we are currently robbing of opportunity, quote,

14

15

unquote, for their own good.

15

recommendation, we will, and get it circulated to that

MR. GRAHAM: Thank you. Anyone else?
What we will do is put together a draft

16

Does anyone have anything to add? Greg.

16

everyone can take a look at it and we will put ourselves

17

MR. YADLEY: I think it's a good idea to

17

in a position to hopefully make another recommendation to

18

restate what we did -- what we said last time, beginning

18

the SEC within the next several weeks.

19

with the do no harm. And while I too am open to

19

20

nonfinancial measures as additional criteria, not

20

circulated -- actually, I have a telephone call. We'll

21

changing the current monetary thresholds except for a go­

21

let you know. Okay.

22

forward inflation adjustment, I think we simply need to

22

23

be cautious because simplicity is a virtue and the fact

23

24

is that, right now, we have a definition that has worked

24

25

well and has stood in as a proxy, whether it's the

25

I would anticipate that we would get a draft

So Sara, I want to turn it over to you.
MS. HANKS: Okay, so we are going to move on to
the second topic for today.
If you recall from our last meeting in

23 (Pages 86 to 89)


Page 90

Page 92

1

February, a number of us asked for a discussion of the

1

2

definition of general solicitation, which is a continuing

2

Thank you.

3

uncertainty in the markets, and how it's impacting the

3

4

use of Regulation D. And we came up with a number of

4

5

questions during the course of that.

5

there's something else you want to talk about, you know,

MR. FREDRICKSON: Thanks very much for the
opportunity and the introduction. Good afternoon, all.
I have stuff prepared but, obviously, if

6

So, for example, what can an issue do at a

6

raise your hand and let me know and we'll talk about

7

venture fair? What is an issuer allowed to do at a demo

7

whatever you'd like.

8

day? What is an issuer allowed to do in an elevator when

8

9

he comes across someone who looks like he might be a

9

So we've been implementing 506(c) for the last
couple of years. The first sets of questions were about

10

little bit accredited and he would like to pitch to him

10

reasonable steps to verify and the nature of the safe

11

at the demo day? And we all know this happens all the

11

harbors that the Commission provided in the rule. So a

12

time.

12

little over a year ago, we put out guidance, what we call

13

CDIs. And the basic thrust though of those was, to the

13

How does a company that starts out with a

14

506(b) offering, that is the non-generally solicited

14

extent that someone was outside the safe harbor, the

15

version, make sure it doesn't trip up by suddenly making

15

Staff wasn't going to create new safe harbors, but

16

a general solicitation and therefore having to convert

16

encourage people to think, were you within the general

17

that offering into a generally solicited 506(c) meeting?

17

principles that the Commission outlined in the release.

18

And at least anecdotally, we've heard that that's given

18

And if you are doing a 506(c) offering, what's

19

required to meet the reasonable steps to verify standard

19

some people a little more encouragement to trust their

20

in the statute and the rule. And I will note that we are

20

judgment in determining that they can rely on the general

21

hearing, anecdotally at least, a lot of folks who are

21

principles and aren't looking to us for further safe

22

saying reasonable steps to verify is too hard or too

22

harbors.

23

uncertain, or we just can't do it or we don't want to do

23

The second set of inquiries that we got were

24

it, and therefore some of those offerings are being

24

around the nature of general solicitation. It's somewhat

25

structured either as 506(b) offerings or, even more

25

ironic to us that the Congress and then the Commission

Page 91

Page 93

1

restrictively, the counsel is dropping to a 4(a)(2)

1

allowed general solicitation and then it became a burning

2

private placement; we're not even going to rely on

2

question as to what it was. And in the end, it is still

3

Regulation D, we're not going to file any Reg D forms,

3

a factual matter. But we, last August, put out further

4

therefore leading to a lack of transparency for the

4

CDIs to try to give some scope and contour to this area

5

Commission to know what, in fact, is going on. And those

5

that we hope gives guidance to practitioners.

6

deals are effectively going dark. So that would be not

6

And so in the first instance we, you know,

7

such a good thing.

7

wanted to start with some clear statements that we still

8

The Division of Corporation has put out some

8

think, based upon what the Commission has said, that to

9

guidance in this space. So we are going to hear from

9

the extent you are making an offer of securities on an

10

them today. David Fredrickson is chief counsel of the

10

unprotected Internet website, you're making a general

11

Division of Corporation Finance. He assumed that role in

11

solicitation. We have seen those who try to have website

12

February of 2014, having served as assistant general

12

-- password protected sites and other efforts to limit

13

counsel in the SEC's Office of General Counsel since

13

the nature, and we've given guidance in the past on that.

14

1998. David has advised the division and the Commission

14

But certainly if you are broadcasting through the

15

in the implementation of numerous rulemakings, including

15

Internet, that's a general solicitation.

16

rules to implement Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank and the

16

17

JOBS Act.

17

about some old guidance we'd given about having a

We also received a fair amount of question

18

David's Office of Chief Counsel is one of the

18

substantive preexisting relationship. The Staff for a

19

offices responsible for no action, interpretative and

19

number of years has said that, to the extent that you are

20

exemptive positions taken by the division on the

20

making an offer to someone with whom you have a

21

securities registration process and exemptions from it.

21

substantive preexisting relationship, you are not engaged

22

In this role, he has been actively involved in the

22

in general solicitation. Most of the Staff guidance in

23

Staff's guidance surrounding Reg D, 506(c) and what may

23

the past about such a relationship has involved broker

24

or may not constitute general solicitation.

24

dealers. And so the first step that people asked was,

25

well, what about registered investment advisers? Well,

25

David, we're very happy to have you here today.

that makes sense too. They both are subject to certain
duties, regulatory oversight. And so to the extent that
those professionals had a substantive preexisting
relationship, that was something that we would be
comfortable would suffice.
It gets more interesting and hard once you get
out of that, but certainly we didn't want to foreclose
that possibility. We issued a no-action letter to
Citizens VC, which I will talk about the substance of
which a little bit later. But they were not registered
in any capacity but they were offering a platform on the
Internet to attract and qualify accredited investors.
And then once they went through that process, then sort
of opened the curtain and showed them particular
offerings. And we thought, you know, that they had put
in place sufficient procedures to create a relationship
and then could do so.
We think it's hard but not impossible for
issuers to have -- create substantive preexisting
relationships. There is old Staff guidance, back from
the '80s, I believe, that to the extent that an issuer
goes back to those with whom it has done previous deals
or suppliers, contractors, others with whom it has
developed a relationship and understands their financial
sophistication, that such relationships could also be

Page 96
1

One, it's the network and the reasonable basis that

2

those within that network share a level of

3

sophistication. So that even if the issuer is already

4

engaged in an offering, so isn't preexisting, and the

5

person that you may ultimately try to make an offer to,

6

you have no previous relationship, you have a reasonable

7

belief that the person you initially contacted in that

8

angel group is sophisticated. And that when they

9

introduce you to their tech specialist or pharmaceutical

10

person, that you have a reasonable basis for believing

11

that they are sophisticated and that that's not a general

12

solicitation.

13

Of course, in the end, this is always a

14

question of fact. And the broader the group, the less

15

the sophistication. The extent to which someone uses

16

nonselective means in reaching people in that network,

17

then it looks like a general solicitation. So that was

18

what we tried to offer in how we are thinking about why

19

angel groups are not -- may not be, depending on how

20

they're constituted, general solicitation.

21

We also tried to give some guidance as to what

22

is not an offer. It wasn't revolutionary, but we tried

23

to communicate that certainly we don't think and the

24

Commission hasn't said that every communication by an

25

issuer is an offer. It has to be something about the

Page 95
1
2

substantive or preexisting.
So what do we mean by substantive, preexisting

Page 97
1

securities. So to the extent that the issuer is

2

communicating information about its business, products in

3

relationship? Substantive is about what you know about

3

the regular course, that those communications, even on

4

the person. Do you have enough information about their

4

the Internet, are not an offer.

5

financial sophistication in order to make an assessment

5

6

as to whether or not they are an accredited investor?

6

wanted to sort of put forth. And then particularly with

7

And you do, in fact, review that information before

7

respect to demo days, then sort of kind of walk through

8

making.

8

what that meant.

9

Preexisting is that the relationship has to

And so that was at least the construct that we

9

So to the extent that there's a demo day where

10

exist before the offer. We don't want the process around

10

you're talking about your products and services, and

11

finding -- getting to know the potential investor to, you

11

you're not offering securities, it's not a general

12

know, conflict or overlap with the actual offering

12

solicitation. To the extent that the people you've

13

communications. And so, you know, we hoped that most of

13

invited to this demo day, you have a substantive

14

that was a restatement, but a clarification of where we

14

preexisting relationship or they're part of some network

15

think that line of thinking goes.

15

of sophisticated investors, then you probably are not

16

engaged in a general solicitation.

16

Now the Staff had always said that having a

17

substantive preexisting relationship is just one way of

17

18

not having a general solicitation. And that sort of

18

solicitation and you widely broadcast the invitation to

19

challenged us to think, well, what's another way? And

19

the event, you can still take advantage of taking

20

we're certainly aware, and have been for a long time,

20

reasonable steps to verify who you sell to. And so we

21

about the practices of certain groups, often called angel

21

hoped that that would obviously not solve every question,

22

investors. And what is it about that that doesn't, in

22

but at least provide a framework for how to think about

23

many instances, lead us to believe that that's a general

23

these issues. And always the, you know, application may

24

solicitation?

24

require some judgment. But at least we were trying to

25

provide, you know, a framework that would give some rules

25

And in thinking about it, it's several things.

Even if you are engaged in a general

25 (Pages 94 to 97)


Page 98

of the road.
And I guess with that, I'll stop and see if

2
3

there's anything -­

Page 100
1

not making offers at the demo day. But when they're

2

talking with somebody that they meet there afterwards,

3

they are.

4

MR. WALSH: How do you view social networks?

4

5

Did you look at any way that a relationship generated on

5

concepts become so close that we just have one big 506(c)

So I'm wondering whether at some point the

6

a social network could be validated? I mean, I have -­

6

and then we're okay, except to the extent some of the

7

we all have friends on Facebook we have a relationship

7

things we talked about this morning, there's somebody we

8

with, and often air quotes there to some extent. And I

8

want in an offering who is unaccredited?

9

may see that this friend on Facebook just bought a house

9

MR. FREDRICKSON: Obviously, hopefully, the

10

in the Bahamas, and so I may have a whole bunch of

10

entrepreneurs will be seeking counsel on some of these

11

indicators that would suggest sophistication and

11

questions. But I think part of the intent at least of

12

capacity.

12

the first round of guidance we gave was to try to take

13

Where do you see that going?

13

some of the mystery out of reasonable steps to verify.

14

MR. FREDRICKSON: I don't have a solid answer.

14

It's a real requirement. It should be rigorous. And yet
just because the Commission outlined three things that

15

We have thought about that a bit, yes. I think I am,

15

16

you know, not to brag, over 500 LinkedIn contacts. Yes,

16

will always work doesn't mean those are the only way that

17

golden club member.

17

one can reasonably verify that someone's accredited.

18

(Laughter.)

18

And so I don't know why, at least based on the

19

MR. FREDRICKSON: And I couldn't possibly

19

data our economists are able to gather, that 506(c) is

20

imagine saying that any, you know, fraction of that were

20

not near the levels, either in number of offerings or

21

people that I had a real notion as to whether or not they

21

number of amount of money raised, and to what extent it's

22

were sophisticated or not.

22

simply -- you know, no one wants to be first in the pool.

Are there closer networks? Are there other

23

23

And, you know, once people get comfortable that, you

24

indicia that people might have, under particular facts

24

know, it's not that hard, it has to be done, but to the

25

where, you know, it's not simply they are, you know, a

25

extent that one can take the reasonable steps to verify,

Page 99

Page 101

1

professional network like LinkedIn, whatever that means,

1

that it's a natural part of communications with potential

2

I think it may be possible. But I don't think we're

2

investors.

3

anywhere close to saying that, you know, there's any

3

4

particular form of medium that is always going to be

4

I remember in the original proposed rule, I believe,

5

okay.

5

there was a requirement that you file the Form D 15 days

MS. KASSAN: I have two questions. One is that

6

Yes?

6

before you start the general solicitation. But whatever

7

MR. YADLEY: Thank you. And that was very

7

happened with that?

8
9

clear.

8

And one of the issues I've had recently in

9

MR. FREDRICKSON: The Commission proposed that
as part of a separate rulemaking, that was proposed on

10

trying to talk to non-securities lawyer clients about how

10

the day that the Commission adopted the changes to

11

all this works is, they see some circularity in all of

11

506(c). That's still a pending rulemaking. And so the

12

this. That we're trying to define what general

12

Commission could come back to that. The Commission is

13

solicitation is not and if somebody is accredited or

13

very, very busy. But that is still an outstanding

14

otherwise meets some sort of ability to bear the risk and

14

proposal.

15

fend for herself, then they get confused and say, I

15

16

really don't have to worry about what general

16

away that option of saying, whoops, I made a public

17

solicitation is, as long as I'm -- before I actually

17

solicitation, I can just switch over to 506(c).

18

offer the security, know that they're accredited, I'm

18

19

okay. In a way, that is 506(c).

19

20

The demo day interp, though, or CDI, sort of

20

MS. KASSAN: Because that would sort of take

MR. FREDRICKSON: We received a fair amount of
comment on that.
MS. KASSAN: Great. And then my other question

21

takes it a little bit of a step further, in that the

21

is, if -- I've seen a lot of people send out kind of mass

22

issuer could actually, under certain facts and

22

e-mails, I don't know how many people were -- you know,

23

circumstances, already be offering a security. And as

23

it was b.c.c., so I have no idea how many people received

24

Sara pointed out in the introduction, I think people are

24

it, and they would probably argue that everyone in the

25

careful, at least to the extent they get advice. They're

25

b.c.c. list was someone that they had a preexisting

relationship with. And I kind of -- my instinct says,
even if you have a preexisting relationship, you really
shouldn't be sending out a mass e-mail. Is there any
thought about that?
MR. FREDRICKSON: Again, one of the factors
that we think is relevant is the means of communication.
And obviously, e-mail has the capacity to forward on
what you receive. And so it seems difficult to contain,
once you send that out. So that would seem to be hard.
MS. MOTT: David, one of the things I will tell
you I've observed about demo days and pitch contests is
that some clarification around general solicitation has
changed the behaviors. So when I attend an event like
that now, there are no financials being presented, like
there used to be. You know, and if you want to have a
private discussion with an investor, then you're
arranging to have it in a separate room or a separate
place so you can have that private discussion. So that
has cleared up the behavior, I think, having this
clarified.
One of my concerns is that there are a large
segment of investors who are -- angel investors who do
not want to go down the 506(c) route and actually will
not. When you apply to angel groups -- I lead an angel
group -- you have to be 506(b) or you're not going to be

Page 104
MR. GRAHAM: Before you answer that, Catherine,

1
2

this kind of goes into it. A question for you is, is it

3

intended that the way you determine whether or not

4

someone is an accredited investor is different, depending

5

on whether it's 506(b) or 506(c)?

6

MR. FREDRICKSON: There is a clear statutory

7

and rule-based requirement in 506(c) to take reasonable

8

steps to verify.
MR. GRAHAM: Understood, but at the end of the

9
10
11

day -­
MR. FREDRICKSON: There's an obligation under

12

506(b) to have a reasonable basis to determine whether

13

someone is.

14
15
16

MR. GRAHAM: Understood. Different words, but
do they mean the same thing?
MR. FREDRICKSON: We think they're a lot closer

17

than it seems many practitioners do. But I don't know

18

all practices, so I'm certainly not blessing all

19

practices by saying that. I think, to be a credible

20

506(b), reasonable basis means reasonable.

21

MR. GRAHAM: And so it has seemed that if it's

22

reasonable in that context, it should be reasonable in

23

the 506(c) context.

24
25

MR. FREDRICKSON: I won't say always and ever.
But those words are obviously the same. And I think

Page 103

Page 105

1

entertained, your application will not be entertained.

1

they are driving at the same goal of what's your basis

2

So they are very careful about protecting that and having

2

for believing that someone is accredited, and that should

3

to go through all the steps to verify.

3

be a real discipline. And whether that's always sharing

4

tax returns, we don't think it has to be. That was

5

this earlier this morning, the more difficult you make

5

simply one way the Commission said, ever and always, you

6

it, the more the market is going to pull away from it.

6

can satisfy. But are there other ways? Absolutely.

7

And especially when you have a huge segment of the market

7

8

currently used to self-certifying. You know? And

8

9

they're not interested in sharing their tax returns with

9

same, and I don't think the marketplace sees it as the

4

In other words, and I think Patrick alluded to

MR. GRAHAM: So it's the same.
MS. MOTT: Yeah, so I didn't see it as the

10

anybody, especially the issuer. Sometimes it's very

10

same. So for -- yeah, I was going to say, our lawyers

11

challenging for them to even share it with each other.

11

are going to tell us that as well.

12

So they prefer to keep that information private and not ­

12

13

- and not risk it getting into the hands of anybody else.

13

words on the ability to rely on a third party? Because I

14

think one of the issues that Catherine has raised is

15

by simply saying shouldn't we all just go down the path

15

there's no -- no angel investor truly trusts an unknown,

16

of 506(c), I think there's a risk that it would be a

16

small company to keep sensitive information sensitive,

17

shock to the marketplace and you would lose a

17

private.

18

considerable amount of individuals who are taking the

18

And so there are third party validators. And

19

risk to invest in startup companies.

19

angel groups could be one of them. I mean, in theory, is

20

that not a reasonable thing to say? If the angel group

14

20

So I just want to caution everybody that, just

MS. HANKS: Could we just have a couple of

MR. FREDRICKSON: And if I could follow up, do

21

you think the reluctance is simply about not willing to

21

itself has established accreditation, that could be

22

share that financial information? And are there not

22

reasonable steps in certain circumstances?

23

other ways to establish the sophistication and experience

23

24

of the angel investors?

24

assume it could be. Again, this is the problem, you

25

know, that we had in the rulemaking, that the third

25

MS. MOTT: So, one is they don't -­

MR. FREDRICKSON: In certain circumstances, I

27 (Pages 102 to 105)


Page 106

Page 108

1

parties that we identified, registered brokers,

1

information about assets or income has to be within the

2

registered advisers, lawyers and accountants, we felt

2

last three months. We try to then say that, to the

3

that the professional regulation that guided them gave us

3

extent that it's outside but still reasonable, that could

4

sufficient comfort that, ever and always, that would be

4

be a basis for taking reasonable steps to verify.

5

okay.

5

MS. MOTT: So I believe the current -- the

6

Are there other methods that could be, that

6

marketplace would perceive that as problematic, now that

7

would satisfy the principles that the Commission

7

I have to pay someone to verify every quarter that I'm,

8

outlined? I assume there could be. But without -- it

8

you know, I'm an accredited investor, when I've been

9

would be hard for the Staff to bless that concept,

9

doing this for years, or -­

10

because what's an angel group and what steps they're

10

11

taking, we simply wouldn't have the insight to.

11

12

MR. GRAHAM: You wouldn't necessarily have to

12

MR. GRAHAM: But not necessarily, because it's
a safe harbor.
MS. MOTT: I see. Got it. All right. Sorry.

13

bless it. But as a concept, if you thought it was fine

13

14

for 506(b) purposes, then you should think it's fine for

14

15

506(c) purposes. Not defining what is -- necessarily

15

you -- could you describe to us what had generally been

16

what is fine or not.

16

done in an offering? Let's say we're going to pre-2013,

17

so we only have 506. There is no difference between

18

506(b) and (c).

17
18

MR. FREDRICKSON: I'll think more on that. But
that's a fair question.

So I missed that.
MR. GOMEZ ABERO: Catherine, question. Could

19

MS. HANKS: It's certainly something that angel

19

20

groups could develop a best practices, which -- I mean,

20

then what the investors did in order to participate?

21

the ACA could take a lead on that.

21

What was the practice that, as an angel investor, who had

22

the relationship with the issuer and what information was

22

MS. MOTT: The ACA already has. Interesting

Could you tell us what a deal looked like? And

23

enough, we have an -- what we call an established angel

23

provided to the issuer as to who the investors were? And

24

group certification. And what that means is that you

24

what, if anything, did the issuer ask or check about

25

show, you know, your documents and your policy, you know,

25

angels as potential investors?

Page 107

Page 109

1

for membership and show the steps that you take. And if

1

2

you do that, you get to verify that you've got accredited

2

3

investors in your group. Then you get the EAG

3

4

certification.

MS. MOTT: So typically -- so do you want to
know about what the issuer did with the angels? Okay.
So typically, an issuer comes to an investor in

4

the group and says, you know, I have a deal. I have a

5

But I don't know how that would stand up. I

5

company I'm starting and I would like to, you know, pitch

6

mean, we just -- we just did that on our own, not legally

6

to your group. And they have to go through an

7

saying that, you know -- I mean, it's just like, are

7

application process and a screening process, with

8

there best practices being deployed? And then the answer

8

probably a small committee of -- of members of that

9

is, check, yes, you're deploying best practices based on

9

group.

10
11

what we know and understand.
So back to this third party, I think the third

10

And if they make the cut through this screening

11

process, then they will pitch to the entire group. But

12

party is an option. Even outside -- but I'm very

12

probably after they do due diligence. Some do it after

13

concerned still about the marketplace, because you have

13

the meeting, the general meeting, some do it before.

14

again a large segment of the population who has been able

14

The due diligence is about a four-page

15

to self-certify. And now they have to pay someone to

15

checklist. Which it's the National Venture Capital

16

certify. And then, if I understand the verification,

16

Association's checklist, so it's identical. So it looks

17

like these are people who are sophisticated and create a

17

at everything, from corporate documents to insurance

18

portfolio of early stage companies. So they're investing

18

documents, to financials, market research, IP analysis,

19

probably once a quarter, sometimes twice a year. So then

19

all that.

20

every time you invest, I believe, if I understand it, you

20

21

have to get -- you know, verify every three months or

21

the group to proceed through the investment, then the

22

four months or something like that.

And then, if there is enough interest through

22

attorney for the angel group and the attorney for the

23

MR. GRAHAM: Ninety days.

23

issuer, you know, get together with either the lead

24

MS. MOTT: Ninety days.

24

investor of that group and the entrepreneur to negotiate

25

MR. FREDRICKSON: Under this safe harbor, the

25

the terms. And typically it turns out to be a preferred

28 (Pages 106 to 109)


Page 110

Page 112

1

stock, sometimes a convertible note. But typically, in

1

2

most of the cases anymore, what we're seeing is preferred

2

MR. GOMEZ ABERO: Just the question.

3

stock round. It looks just like a Series A, a Series A.

3

(Laughter.)

4

The only difference is we're calling it Series Seed.

4

5

But it's a Series A. But that's essentially what we're

5

6

looking at as far as documents.

6

7

Did I answer your question? I'm not sure.

7

8

MR. GOMEZ ABERO: I think you described a lot

8

9

of what the angels ask the issuer. I'm not sure I got,

9

10

and maybe -- I'm not sure I got what is it that the

10

11

issuer wanted to know about the investors.

11

12

MS. MOTT: Okay, so when we -- okay, so we sign

that violate where we are with the structure?

MR. GRAHAM: It's facts and circumstances,
Mark.
MR. WALSH: Sorry?
MR. GRAHAM: I said, it's facts and
circumstances. So I think -­
MS. TIERNEY: Can I? Sorry, I was going to
interject. A few things.
First of all, I'm confused by the idea that

12

506(b) requires some active steps on behalf of the issuer

13

documents, investment documents, that come from the

13

to actually reasonably confirm that an investor is

14

issuer. And, obviously, they have to check how they -­

14

accredited. Based on the line of no-action letters, IPO

15

how they're accredited. Okay? And that is confirmed by

15

Net and others, and practice over the years, I think the

16

the attorneys as well. Maybe that's what you were

16

practice has been if you get an investor to complete an

17

looking for. Sorry.

17

investor questionnaire and they're representing to an

18

investor that they're an accredited investor, I think the

19

guidance out there is that the issuer has the ability to

18
19

When you said process, I was ready to -- okay.
Thanks.

20

MR. WALSH: So you're saying the issuer's

20

rely on that representation in the context of accepting

21

attorneys validated that your angels are accredited

21

that certification that the investor is an accredited

22

investors?

22

investor.

23

MS. MOTT: It's between -- let's put it this

23

I don't think I've ever heard, in the case of

24

way. How can I say this? When we fill out the

24

506(c), that a company had more of an obligation, if they

25

documents, when the investors fill out the documents,

25

were getting a certification, representations in the

Page 111

Page 113

1

they're completing those documents. The investor

1

subscription documents that somebody is accredited, that

2

questionnaire, okay. They're completing the investor

2

there was more that they needed to do -- (b). Yeah.

3

questionnaire. And then a copy of that goes to that -- a

3

So in (c), we wrote a comment letter on the

4

copy of all of that goes to that attorney.

4

original proposal for 506(c), we really, really supported

5

the idea of a safe harbor, nonexclusive safe harbor. We

5

MR. WALSH: Yeah, so just if I could add some

6

flavor to this, just because you asked about sort of pre

6

were very happy to see the Staff do that. But I think

7

whatever year it was. So I worked at AOL and I'm still

7

it's really important to remember that the Staff

8

friends with Ted Leonsis. So Ted Leonsis calls me up and

8

repeatedly said, this is nonexclusive, there's other ways

9

says, I have a deal for you. And this is the preexisting

9

to do this, facts and circumstances. This is a

10

-- I mean, David, to your point, this is the examples I

10

11

think of relationships like this.

11

nonexclusive safe harbor.
But at Second Market, I think I talked about

So your teams have systemically created a

12

this at the last meeting we had, we had a business for

structure that maps this. But in personal behavior, Ted

13

two years where we verified accreditation in the context

14

Leonsis calls me up and says, I have a great deal for

14

of primary offerings by investment funds and other

15

you. I take the call and, of course, look at the deal.

15

companies raising capital. And it is really challenging

16

But then to your point, the exact same process, I look at

16

to get human beings to give you their tax forms. We were

17

the deal, I love the company, meet management with Ted or

17

a registered broker dealer, we were, you know, governed

18

whatever, and then I sign a document that asserts that I

18

by Reg S-P and FINRA rules for confidentiality of client

19

am an accredited investor.

19

information. But there is still a really low tolerance
for providing private documents.

12
13

20

I don't know whether the issuer, whether the

20

21

company that Ted introduced me to, ever checks that my

statement is true. But that's sort of not my problem,

22

practice was representation letters from lawyers and from

23

right? I made an assertion. It's up to them, I guess,

23

CPAs, which was surprising to us, that the investor was

24

to validate it.

24

accredited. So once you got that letter, we'd pass it on

25

to the issuer and they had the ability to reasonably

25

Is that what you were hoping to find? Or does

What we started seeing as an increasing

assume that that person was verified to be accredited.
So that's how we saw the market developing.
But I agree with you, and I think I talked
about this at the last meeting, too. One real challenge
for a net worth individual is having to get reverified
every 90 days. I mean that's just, I think, unnecessary.
These are high worth individuals. And it's the law
firms representing the issuers that are being very
conservative in this space, because so few companies are
actually utilizing general solicitation.
I think, Patrick, you sent us around something
that said that you've seen situations where the states
are starting to ask, you know, issuers how verification
was, you know, handled. I'd like to know sort of what
the states are looking at and what they're seeing, if
Mike knows.
But I really do think that there are places
where there's so much friction in the nonexclusive safe
harbor, that companies are less likely, and their law
firms are less likely to encourage them to use 506(c) and
generally solicit.
MR. FREDRICKSON: I guess just a couple
reactions, if I could?
What's reasonable is always a question of
facts. I would think that if a complete stranger walked

Page 116
1

enforcement action knocking on their door. So they were

2

following the letter of the nonexclusive safe harbor to

3

the law and it is -- if you verify -- annual income, you

4

only get one, you know, you get one tax filing a year.

5

So we didn't feel like it was necessary to get more than

6

a confirmation that the investor felt like they were

7

still expecting to be accredited based on the current

8

year's net income. But we certainly were going back and

9

relooking at tax filings that we had already looked at

10
11

and verified.
In net worth, though, you have to get them to

12

refresh their bank statements. And that really irritated

13

the crap out of a lot of really, really wealthy people,

14

to the point that they stopped being willing to invest in

15

the 506(c) offerings. Because the law firms, again, were

16

saying, no, no, no, you're the broker dealer, you're

17

doing the attestation, the documents have to be dated

18

within 90 days, and then your certification is only good

19

for 90 days. So if you had a round that hadn't closed

20

and we verified somebody on May 1 and that round hadn't

21

closed within 90 days, then we had to recertify while the

22

round was still, you know, in process. And that doesn't

23

feel like it's necessary.

24

But people wanted that level -- right, exactly.

25

MR. WALSH: Is "irritated the crap" a technical

Page 115

Page 117

1

up and had only a certification and a check box, even in

1

2

the old 506, pre-(b) world, that that would form a

2

term in the investment community?

3

reasonable basis to believe that someone was accredited.

3

4

I suspect, in most instances, there is something else

4

5

going on. There's prior relationships, there's

5

6

reputation, there's introductions, there is something

6

7

that is giving flavor to when the introduction is made

7

8

and they say, I'm certified. It's sort of like, well, I

8

Annemarie's question. I saw that in Patrick's edition

9

know other things about you and that confirms for me.

9

and I was actually going to get back to Patrick and ask

MS. TIERNEY: That's an official securities law
term, yes.
(Laughter.)
MR. GRAHAM: It's right there, Mark, with
"messing in my chili."
MR. PIECIAK: I was just going to answer

10

And translated to the Internet world, that's

10

what states that may be, because I was interested in

11

why it's particularly scary on a 506(c) basis, to canvass

11

knowing the specific circumstances of the request.

12

strangers. And if all you get back is a certification,

12

13

that's not, in our view, a reasonable step to verify.

13

14

But I -- you know, I guess sort of I'll stop

14

MR. REARDON: I don't know. I can try and find
out for you, and send that around supplementally.
MR. PIECIAK: Yeah, it would be interesting.

15

with, the Commission doesn't require recertification

15

Because I would assume, and this is an assumption, that

16

every 90 days. If someone would like to be conservative

16

that particular state had some facts and circumstances at

17

and know that they are within the safe harbor, that was

17

their disposal that questioned the verification process.

18

provided. Whether there are other ways that one can, you

18

MR. REARDON: Yeah, I was just thinking, good

19

know, attain a level of assurance that they are taking

19

luck with a blue sky administrator in convincing him that

20

reasonable steps to verify, you know, the Commission laid

20

these safe harbors are not requirements and that whatever

21

out an analysis of how to get there.

21

you did that's not in the safe harbor is reasonable. You

22

know, not you, but certainly others would say, no, we
want to see that. Or your attestation is 91 days old.

22

MS. TIERNEY: I completely agree with you. But

23

I think again, my own -- our own experience was that

23

24

issuers and their counsels were being very conservative

24

25

because they didn't want to be the first one to have an

25

30 (Pages 114 to 117)


You know, as far as explaining this to people
who have invested in this before, explaining the

Page 118

Page 120

1

securities laws to any layperson is, you know, it's like

1

2

explaining a black hole, you know. It's just -- they

2

3

don't get it. You know, that's why we spend years and

3

4

years learning about it.

4

5

Think about when you get out of law school. Or

5

6

maybe you'd taken securities reg. But even if you had,

6

7

it's so weird, the way the system works.

7

MR. FREDRICKSON: Its mysteries delight me

8
9

8
9

every day.

10

(Laughter.)

10

11

MR. GRAHAM: Michael?

11

12

MR. PIECIAK: I had a question pertaining to

12

13

the offering or the offeror definition. I guess my

13

14

question is, I mean, it's both sort of old format and new

14

15

format with social media and maybe a local road show or

15

16

demo day and, you know, when a product is being described

16

17

over social media or at one of these demo days. I mean,

17

18

is it appropriate to say, you know, we're looking for

18

19

partners of all kinds to come, you know, and if so, come

19

20

and contact us. Because, I mean, that's something that

21

we see in social media and demo days.

21

And then also in the demo day piece, or I guess

22

20

23

in social media as well, whether there are specific

24

questions that get posed like, well, what were your

25

revenues this year or, you know, how -- what's your

22
23
24
25

starts with language that says that an accredited
investor is someone who in fact is an accredited investor
or someone who an issuer reasonably believes is an
accredited investor.
And I think, in many respects, when you then
translate that into 506(b), you get to the fact that the
issuer either reasonably believed that the person was an
accredited investor and, to the extent it had a
reasonable belief, then the issuer likely would be in
good shape. Or, in fact, the person was an accredited
investor.
So I think it begs the question as to, if you
have an issuer in 506(b) that does nothing, but happens
to get lucky that all of the investors are, in fact,
accredited investors, then arguably you are still within
the 501(a) definition of an accredited investor.
Now, contrast that to 506(c) that, in fact,
imposes the specific requirement for the issuer to take
reasonable steps to verify. That is not a requirement
that exists in 506(b). So I think we often -- in part of
the conversation, we talked about 506(b) and this
reasonable belief, and 506(c) reasonable steps to verify.
But I think it's very important to keep in mind that the
way "accredited investor" is defined, it gives a little
bit more leeway to an issuer that is doing it under (b)

Page 119

Page 121

1

growth plan? And they start getting into specifics and

1

than it does under (c), because of the language that

2

how entrepreneurs should handle those questions.

2

specifically requires the verification under (c).

MR. FREDRICKSON: Yeah. I certainly don't,

3

3

MR. GRAHAM: And so are you underscoring the

4

sitting here, have anything helpful. The Commission has

4

part that says that it has to actually be an accredited

5

traditionally seen "offer" as quite broad. Without much

5

investor? In other words, the point we made is that you

6

imagination, you know, how easily those conversations can

6

don't have to verify but you could get lucky when you're

7

turn into an offer, even if it starts more neutral.

7

dealing with 506(b)?

We tried in the CDIs to give some contours to

8
9

what was on more one side -- more likely to be on one

8

MR. GOMEZ ABERO: All I'm pointing to -- and,

9

by the way, the beauty of technology today is that

10

side and what on another. But these are tough judgment

10

instead of carrying all my five volumes of federal

11

calls. But if there's suggestions on how to approach it,

11

securities rules, I can carry them right here. So if you

12

if there's other things that we might be able to say,

12

look at 501(a), it says that an accredited investor shall

13

we're willing to think about it. But those are tough

13

mean any person who comes within any of the following

14

calls.

14

categories. So that's an accredited investor. And then

15

MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Any other comments?

15

it goes on to the categories that we talked about this

16

MS. HANKS: Anything else that we need to get?

16

morning.

17

MR. GOMEZ ABERO: Can I just add one thing?

17

Or who the issuer reasonably believes comes

18

This goes to a little bit of reaction to something that

18

19

Annemarie mentioned. I think a lot of the times when we

19

So I think it's important to keep that in mind

20

think of 506(b), this reasonable belief standard comes

20

when you look at 506(b). Because 506(b) itself did not

21

up. I just wanted to point it out, and I think a lot of

21

impose any additional requirements. 506(c) does. But

22

you know this.

22

506(b) looks back at the accredited investor definition

23

in 501(a). And 501(a) does make this distinction between

23

But when you look at the definition of

within any of the following categories.

24

accredited investor in 501(a), technically, the

24

someone who is in fact an accredited investor or someone

25

definition has, in addition to other requirements, it

25

the issuer believes is an accredited investor, reasonably

31 (Pages 118 to 121)


Page 122
1

believes is an accredited investor.

1

MS. KASSAN: And that definition also applies

2

Page 124
2

3

to 506(c). So even if you -- if you take reasonable

3

4

steps and you make a mistake and somebody is not

4

5

accredited, presumably that would be acceptable, no?

5

6

Right? Yeah.

6

7

MR. FREDRICKSON: Take reasonable steps.

7

8

MS. KASSAN: Yeah, you have to take -- yeah.

8

9

You can be wrong, as long as you reasonably believed that

9

10

the person was accredited after taking reasonable steps

10

11

under 506(c), you'd be okay.

11

MR. YADLEY: I think what Sebastian said is

12

12

13

really consistent with what Annemarie said the practice

13

14

was. And so with all the other information that David

14

15

acknowledged you used to have in the old days before

15

16

somebody signed that subscription agreement and made

16

17

those representations, you really felt, well, belonged to

17

18

this country club, was introduced by this guy, or was in

18

19

business with this -- this woman and she vouches for him

19

20

and now he has said he is, without any other knowledge

21

that would cause you to disbelieve what has been

22

certified to, that was acceptable.

21
22

So the rule makes sense. 501(a) is a good

23

20

24

definition. But it does bear, and certainly we always

25

advised people what you just said.

23
24
25

is securities law stuff. Because people do execute these
things at a hundred miles an hour.
And the other thing I would suggest people do
is, if you have investors that you deal with regularly,
is these people all get their taxes done. And put in
their hands a form, a letter, and say, the next time you
get your taxes done, get the accountant to fill out this
letter. And if you got the letter, it's no longer
current, it's beyond 90 days, you can worry about it.
But I would rather be -- have a letter that's
120 days old and at least it's signed by an accountant
and you don't have to ask for all this stuff. Because
they're going to go to the accountant every year anyway.
And just give them a form and say, get your accountant
to do this. And, you know, see if there's any pushback
from the accountant or an extra charge or anything like
that. Should be a good way to start this.
MR. GRAHAM: Okay. Thanks, Patrick.
We kind of went off on a little bit of an
accredited investor tangent. Does anyone have anything
they want to run by David dealing with general
solicitation?
Okay. Then is Margaret here? Okay. So, thank
you, David.
The topics that we have considered and will

Page 123
Look, even if the person is accredited, this is

Page 125
1

consider during this -- determined at this committee will

2

a new requirement. So if you're going to use general

2

bring out a diversity of viewpoints on which reasonable

3

solicitation, you have to do this. And then you get into

3

minds can differ. The landscape for unregistered

4

some of the discussions that Annemarie referenced. And

4

offerings has been dynamic in recent years. Changes to

5

sometimes people say, well, maybe I'll just see how much

5

historical cornerstones, like the accredited investor

6

money I can raise before I do that. And I say, yes.

6

definition and the ban on general solicitation in

7

Because I believe that the most protection an issuer can

7

unregistered offerings, have revealed some deeply held

8

get is to deal with people they know and that they're

8

opinions along with the hope of new opportunities for

9

honest with. And somebody that just appears over the

9

capital formation.

1

10

Internet, you don't know. And you don't have the same

10

11

dialogue and they're not around the corner, so you can't

11

thing that we can all agree on is that robust enforcement

But steady throughout this dynamic time, one

12

visit.

12

of the securities laws is critical to protecting

13

MR. GRAHAM: Okay, thank you Greg.

13

investors and maintaining confidence that is essential to

14

Is there any other -- yes.

14

foster a positive environment for capital formation. We

15

MR. REARDON: Just a couple of practical

15

all require the assurance that there are protective laws

16

things. Your form might say that the issuer -- whatever

16

in place that will be enforced against fraudsters and

17

form you're using for 506(b), and I imagine I'm preaching

17

other bad actors.

18

to the choir and this is already done, but the form ought

18

We are pleased to have Margaret Cain,

19

to say in bold letters at the top that this information

specialist attorney from the SEC's Division of

securities laws, and it needs to be accurate in all

the enforcement activities the SEC is undertaking in

material respects, or something like that. You know, if

you want to hire me to do it, I'll make it a little

better.

25

the JOBS Act rules, 506(c), Reg A, crowdfunding. They

In other words, it should say that, look this

We note that Staff from multiple divisions

effective, Chair White asked the divisions to collaborate

Margaret plays a key role in this JOBS Act task

6

and formalize a Commission-wide working group outlining

force and will focus today on what Enforcement is seeing

objectives and steps for a program to monitor the use of

in this area. And as we understand, you've been

9

forewarned, we certainly are curious about the level of

similarly, the Chair has asked the divisions to continue

and build upon that expertise and the relationships

MS. CAIN: Thank you. Thank you for that kind

introduction. Thank you so much for having me here

today.

So in that capacity, the Division of

I want to manage expectations. I hope I can

organizations. And we work with the rulemaking divisions

21

Sorry, I have these glasses.

21

to plan training for Enforcement Staff and monitor the

22

evolving landscape, because this is kind of a moving

I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you

22
23

guys today about what the Division of Enforcement is

doing in the Jumpstart Our Business Act or JOBS Act

space. And, finally, we assist the division in creating

programmatic objectives in this space.

Page 127

Page 129

1

Just a little bit of background on me. I have

1

So, as you may know, tips, complaints and

2

been at the Commission for almost 17 years. The majority

2

referrals, or TCRs, as we colloquially call them inside

3

of that time was spent as a senior counsel in Division of

3

the building, are submitted to the Commission on any

4

Enforcement, where I was tasked with investigating

4

number of potential violations. Some actually are

5

potential violations of the Securities Act, so insider

5

securities violations and some may, you know, actually

6

trading, market manipulation, unregistered offerings,

6

need to be referred out because we don't have a

7

Ponzi schemes, that sort of thing.

7

regulatory scheme to address them. But all of these TCRs

8

are put into one centralized database where we have Staff

9

in the Office of Market Intelligence that are reviewing

For the last few years, I have been a

8
9

specialist attorney in the Enforcement Division's Office

10

of Market Intelligence, where I am working very closely

10

11

with our Microcap Fraud Task Force, and I am also working

11

And the TCRs related to this new regulatory

12

with the JOBS Act Task Force and working with the

12

regime, so for crowdfunding exemption or Rule 506(c) or

13

Division of Enforcement in providing guidance in that

13

even Regulation A receive the exact same treatment. The

14

area.

14

same Staff are -- these TCRs are streamlined and the same

15

Staff are reviewing them to ensure consistency in their
analysis and triage and assignment, where appropriate.

15

So, as you know, the JOBS Act was passed in

these TCRs as they come in.

16

April of 2012 and it required the SEC to adopt rules that

16

17

removed the ban on general solicitation and advertising

17

18

and create an exemption called Rule 506(c). That's where

18

Act was passed, OMI decided to start tagging any TCRs

19

we see the majority of our cases.

19

that may come in and highlight potential violations of

20

these exemptions. And we've -- since that time, we've

20

On September 23, the Rule 506(c) went into

So in October of 2012, shortly after the JOBS

21

effect. And then in March of last year, the SEC also

21

handled dozens of TCRs in this area. Of those, a number

22

adopted rules that updated its rules for smaller

22

of them warranted further review. And some went on to

23

offerings that allow companies to raise up to 50 million

23

become active cases and some even were filed.

24

in a 12-month period. And then, as you know, this past

24

25

Monday, the crowdfunding rules went into effect. They

25

Some of them were referred off to state
regulatory agencies or to criminal agencies. And some

33 (Pages 126 to 129)


Page 130

Page 132

1

became the focus of an examination that was done by our

1

step. We spent a lot of time this morning talking about

2

Office of Inspections and Examinations.

2

the definition of accredited investor. And one of the

3

things that I think we all wrestled with was the -- the
maybe lack of understanding of how much, you know, how

3

Current investigations in this space are

4

primarily focused on issues surrounding the following:

4

5

Failure by issuers to take reasonable steps to verify

5

much fraud, how much enforcement activity might actually

6

accredited investor status and then, subsequently, sales

6

occur within that sector.

7

to unaccredited investors; unregistered broker dealer

7

8

activity, where we have an intermediary or third party

8

problem tied to -- tied to fraud, if you will, in the

9

providing investment advice or receiving funds as part of

9

context of private placements? Where, if you -- where

So, in other words, is there -- is there a

10

monies raised, transaction-based compensation or what

10

one way of addressing the problem is increasing the

11

appears to be transaction-based compensation; and, fraud.

11

thresholds under the definition of accredited investor?

12

The subject matter of these investigations has

12

13

kind of run the gamut. We have everything from oil and

13

14

gas investments to real estate, sometimes investment

14

15

funds with unrealistic rates of return or very

15

understand the desire for a firm answer there. I'm not

16

exaggerated rates of return, and digital currency. It's

16

sure that we have that information to answer that

17

very topical.

17

question adequately. I think in kind of the paradigm of

18

looking at cases, that's maybe not the way we would

18

The Commission has filed eight cases to date,

Was I especially unclear in formulating that
question?
MS. CAIN: No, I understand the question and I

19

including three settled cases and five cases that are

19

necessarily look at a case, in terms of the investor -­

20

currently in some form of litigation. The cases have

20

accredited investor definition.

21

involved some variation of offering frauds, unregistered

21

We're looking at cases -- when we look at

22

broker dealer activity, and violations of the

22

potential violations, we're looking to see have actions

23

registration requirements.

23

taken place that might potentially implicate any of the

24

generally speaking, it probably does not come

24

federal securities laws? And there are just elements to

25

as any surprise in light of some of the other speakers

25

each exemption. We just look to see if they've been met

Page 131

Page 133
or not met.

1

you've heard today, the activity in the Rule 506(c) space

1

2

has been relatively light, especially when you look at it

2

3

in comparison to issuers using the Rule 506(b) exemption.

3

4

However, my sense is that, based on the absence of

4

5

internal controls and disclosure requirements, we have

5

6

seen more fraud in private markets and private offerings

6

Because as part of the Staff report, we talk not just

7

than we have in the public space.

7

internally with Enforcement, but we talk to other

8

regulators to try to ascertain whether there could be a

9

direct link between the $200,000 threshold and whether

8
9

I have two examples of recent cases filed in
this space. In the SEC versus Ascenergy, LLC, et al.,

MR. GOMEZ ABERO: Can I add -- can I add a -­

(Laughter.)
MR. GOMEZ ABERO: Can I add something, Steve?

10

matter, which is Release Number 2399 -- I'm sorry, 23394,

10

someone is more likely to be subject to fraud or not.

11

the Staff filed a civil action against Ascenergy and its

11

And, as we talk to a number of regulators, part of the

12

CEO for offering fraudulent oil and gas investments. The

12

challenge is that in many of the -- and Margaret, I'm

13

Staff obtained a temporary restraining order halting the

13

just speaking here and if I'm completely wrong, just let

14

offering, as well as an order freezing the defendants'

14

me know.

15

and the relief defendants' assets.

15

But the feeling that I got was that in many of

16

In the Michael G. Thomas matter, which is SEC

16

the cases, the fraudster was not actually conducting an

17

Release Number 9801, Michael Thomas made materially false

17

analysis as to whether their prospective investor was at

18

and misleading statements in general solicitations to the

18

$190,000 or $210,000 in income. In fact, they were

19

public concerning a pooled investment vehicle. Relief

19

looking to just get quick, easy money from an

20

included a cease and desist order from committing fraud,

20

unsuspecting investor.

21

as well as a five-year industry bar of Thomas.

21

22
23
24
25

So those are my prepared remarks. I'm happy to
take questions and try to elaborate where I can.
MR. GRAHAM: You know, thank you for that.
Again, I think one question that we have -- backing up a

34 (Pages 130 to 133)


In some of the cases, the investors that were

22

defrauded, the fraudster did not take any steps to

23

determine whether the investor was an accredited investor

24

or not. And in some cases, those investors would not

25

have qualified as accredited investors. In some other

Page 134

Page 136

1

cases, the investors who were defrauded were nowhere

1

of the funnel and those you ended up crystalizing and

2

close to the $200,000. In fact, they exceeded it by

2

taking action on. Is it the same ratio as the public

3

multiples of that and they were still subject to the

3

market TCR ratio, or how different is it in your

4

fraud.

4

experience so far?

But throughout the questions that we asked, it

5

5

MS. CAIN: Those are great questions. I think

6

was something that the theme that at least came across to

6

to answer your second question first, I would say because

7

me was that the fraudster was not trying to comply with

7

the activity has been pretty slow in this area, that the

8

some type of rule and regulation and then went above and

8

TCRs in this space have been less than overall just

9

beyond that. The idea was the fraudster was going to get

9

general TCRs. I mean, I can say that of the cases, we

10

the money as easily as possible from the investor and had

10

11

no regards for any of the SEC rules, whether that was

11

So initially, for instance, we saw most of the

12

accredited investor or general solicitation or

12

TCRs that kind of implicated this area really dealt with

13

preexisting substantive relationship. They didn't focus

13

a failure to comply with the exemption requirements. So,

14

on any of that stuff.

14

you know, not taking reasonable steps or failing to take

15

any kind of step or selling to an accredited investor.

16

And then we saw that kind of evolve over time to

17

increasingly implicating potentially unregistered broker

18

dealer activity, you know, where you're having a platform

19

that's set up and they're taking funds based on how much

MR. GRAHAM: So the fraudster didn't submit a

15
16

questionnaire to the potential victim in advance of -­
MR. GOMEZ ABERO: Surprisingly enough, they did

17
18
19

not.
MS. CAIN: I echo what you say, Sebastian. And

have seen an evolution in this space.

20

I think, to the extent -- and this is generally speaking

20

money is raised. They are not putting those funds into

21

and, of course, my opinion. But to the extent that

21

escrow. They might be providing investor advice.

22

there's any attention paid to trying to meet, for

22

23

instance, the requirements of 506(c) by a fraudster, it's

23

And, you know, of the cases that have been filed since

24

just to give the appearance of legitimacy, as opposed to

24

June of last year, there have been five. All of them

25

actually thoughtfully trying to comply with the

25

have been private offerings and all of them have involved

And then the final kind of evolution is fraud.

Page 135

exemption.
MR. GRAHAM: No, our real question was, okay,

Page 137
1

fraud.

2

So in terms of geography, nothing really stands
out. I mean, it's nationwide.
MR. GRAHAM: What about the demographic?
MS. CAIN: Again, it kind of runs the gamut. I
mean, you have, you know, potential victims from all
walks of life, from all socioeconomic walks of life. In
fact, one of the cases that was filed recently, the
victim essentially was an issuer. You had, in the Steven
J. Muehler, et al., case that was filed in September of
last year, the Staff is alleging that Steven Muehler
through two organizations offered assistance to
companies, putting himself out there and his companies
out there as we can help you structure a Regulation A
Plus offering, we can get it through the review process
with the Commission and then we can market it to
potential investors. And that was -- well, it's still in
litigation, but our allegations are that they made false
statements to the issuers. And they were not a
registered broker dealer, neither Mr. Muehler nor his
organization. So from my sense, what we're seeing is,
you know, a strong need to protect not just investors but
also issuers that are new to this space and just still
learning, like everyone is, kind of the ins and outs of
this area.

3

we have a definition. We're taking a look at the

3

4

definition. We're trying to determine whether or not

4

5

something should change with respect to that definition.

5

6

And our question is, well, is there a correlation

6

7

between today's definition and fraud? And we don't see

7

8

one and we haven't heard anyone make that connection.

8

9

But since you're in Enforcement, we thought we'd ask you

10
11

the question.
MS. CAIN: I don't have the answer to that

9
10
11

12

question, unfortunately, in any kind of definitive or

12

13

meaningful way. That's just not -- we don't collect -­

13

14

I'm not aware of any data that we collect in that regard.

14

15

MR. GRAHAM: That's not surprising.

15

16

Mark?

16

17

MR. WALSH: So first, thank you for TCR.

17

18

Because I try in my new career in the government to get a

18

19

new TLA -- which stands for three-letter acronym -- to

19

20

get a new TLA every single day. And you've fulfilled my

20

21

daily quota. Thank you for that.

21

22

Are there other patterns from the TCRs that you

22

23

got? Any geographical patterns, any other type of

23

24

patterns from it? That's question A. And the other was,

24

25

I think you touched on this, the ratio of TCRs in the top

25

35 (Pages 134 to 137)


Page 138

Page 140

1

MR. GRAHAM: Greg, you had something?

1

this is going to play out because the -- the industry has

2

MR. YADLEY: Yeah. I think I misunderstood

2

just been very slow to utilize 506(c) and some of these

3

something you said. I did hear you say that you're

3

other exemptions. I mean, obviously, crowdfunding, that

4

seeing more fraud in the private offering space than

4

just want effective on Monday.

5

public. But then you were talking about eight cases.

5

6

Those were from the TCRs relating to 506(c)?

6

individually. But let's go back to pre-April 2012.

7

What's the division's experience been with fraud in

8

private placements under old 506?

7
8
9

MS. CAIN: Right. So since we -- I'm sorry,
let me clarify.
Since we started, since post-JOBS Act, we've

MR. YADLEY: And I'm not pressing against you

MS. CAIN: I can't answer that with any kind of

9

10

had eight cases that implicate potential -- certain

10

11

aspects of the JOBS Act, so either 506(c) or the

11

12

crowdfunding rules. I mean, obviously, until Monday, the

12

if you could get with your colleagues and then let Julie

13

crowdfunding rules, you couldn't violate them. But we

13

know, we are very interested in that. Because that falls

14

had activity that, you know, presented itself as, you

14

squarely within what we're supposed to try and be talking

15

know, a crowdfunding platform or what have you, or

15

about.

16

Regulation A Plus.

certainty. Maybe we can -­
MR. YADLEY: Would that be something that maybe

16

MS. CAIN: We will endeavor to get that

17

MR. YADLEY: Okay. I think our question was

17

information. I can't make any promises on that, on that

18

broader, as we've looked at 506 offerings in general and

18

issue.

19

private placements. If you're seeing more fraud in the

19

MR. GRAHAM: Michael?

20

private area, that means there's only six cases in the

20

MR. PIECIAK: Just to assist with Margaret, not

21

public area in the same time period? Or less than six?

21

that our information is all that much more accurate or

22

I missed something.

22

better. But from the state perspective, as I mentioned

23

earlier this morning, that when we conduct our state

24

enforcement surveys and, you know, the response rate is

25

somewhere north of, you know, somewhere around 40 states

23
24
25

MS. TIERNEY: Her cases are only JOBS Act
related, not overall enforcement.
MR. YADLEY: Okay. I guess that -- okay.

Page 139

Page 141

1

MS. CAIN: Yeah, there are very general

1

or so that provide data and we specifically ask, you

2

statements. I am talking specifically about cases that

2

know, what are the top five types of frauds that you are

3

are post-JOBS Act that are implicating certain aspects of

3

seeing? Ponzi schemes, 506 offerings, affinity frauds.

4

the JOBS Act.

4

Sometimes they fall in the multiple of those categories.

5

MR. YADLEY: Okay. So that means there have

5

But 506 offerings generally, not differentiating between

6

been fewer than six cases related to emerging growth

6

(b) or (c), are frequently in the top five, at least for

7

companies, right? Since that's the only public -- real

7

the last, you know, five or six years.

8

public aspect of the JOBS Act. Which is good. Because

8

9

so many of the public offerings have been emerging growth

9
10

participation. And we can't, to Annemarie's earlier

11

We are interested then in the question that you

11

point, quantify whether it's more risky or less risky

12

were not addressing and maybe, you know, you don't know.

12

than the public markets. But we can just say that there

13

But when we were -- what Steve was alluding to in our

13

is -­

14

discussion this morning, which was about the accredited

14

15

investor definition, we are unaware of fraud really being

15

be, on that, are those points issues that states are

16

a huge issue that is affected by the wrong people or too

16

seeing that are state law? Or that states are seeing in

17

many people being able to invest in private offerings.

17

companies in their state? So would that include public

18

And so we were wondering if the division has seen more

18

company issues? Or is it just state-covered

19

fraud in private placements generally that would inform

19

transactions, like intrastate offerings or -­

20

us as we try and wrestle with the issues that are in our

20

21

mandate?

21

antifraud authority. So the issuer would have utilized
506.

10

companies. We want them to be successful.

Again, that's not -- the survey is not mandated
by the states. We don't have a hundred percent

22

MS. CAIN: Yeah. And I think, as the Chair

22

23

said this morning, just data like that is very difficult

23

24

to come by. It's a little, I think, a little premature

24

25

to really be able to say with any kind of certainty how

25

36 (Pages 138 to 141)


MS. TIERNEY: Well, my question was going to

MR. PIECIAK: The 506 would the states' general

MS. TIERNEY: But, I mean, is your survey
looking also at public company fraud? Or -­
MR. PIECIAK: Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah, we would

25

be looking at anything in which the states had antifraud
authority over.
MS. HANKS: Michael, any chance of -- any idea
of whether that's changed over the last five years?
MR. PIECIAK: In terms of -­
MS. HANKS: Since the JOBS Act went into
effect?
MR. PIECIAK: I know the last -- I don't want
to overstate it, but I want to say the last five years,
the -- in terms of the top five, you know, most frequent
frauds, the 506 offering has consistently been in there.
Whether it's number one, two, you know, three or four,
it does seem to be sort of a reoccurring element that
states see.
MR. GRAHAM: What again are the numbers?
MR. PIECIAK: Yes, the numbers are where it
gets tricky, because they fall into multiple sort of
categories, whether it's Ponzi scheme, you know, affinity
fraud and 506 offerings. And sometimes it can fall into
each of those. And it's a bit about categorizing, how
the state provides us the information. The enforcement
survey that was passed out was sort of asked on an
aggregate level, in terms of, you know, what are the top
10 or five -- actually, I think it's the top five that
you see every year. So we don't necessarily have that

Page 144
1

laws. Everybody feels that way about tax law. Everybody

2

knows if you take your dog as a dependent, you're going

3

to get in trouble with the IRS. But, for some reason,

4

there are a lot of people in the business community who

5

think that complying with the securities laws is

6

optional. And I've heard people as investment advisers

7

functioning out there and saying, I'm going to get my RIA

8

one day, like it's something to wear on his hat or

9

something and it was not a condition precedent to being

10

in the business.
So -- and there are people in the -- I have not

11
12

heard of unregistered broker cases in Texas until the

13

recent kind of well noted case that was filed in Texas.

14

So I haven't heard of those in a while. Maybe I'm not

15

keeping up the way I should be.
But, I mean, if I'm unfair, I'm sorry and I'll

16
17

apologize if you tell me I'm unfair in saying that you

18

bring the big cases. But get down on those little cases

19

and bring them. Because nothing is going to make

20

somebody want to comply with the securities law than

21

having a guy at his country club who's got in trouble

22

with the SEC over something. So that's my comment.
MS. CAIN: Thank you for your honesty and your

23
24

feedback. I think Chair White and the other

25

commissioners have certainly spoken very publicly about a

Page 143

Page 145

1

specific number data that we can provide. And again,

1

broken windows concept, if you will, and looking for what

2

it's not mandated by all of the states.

2

some people may characterize as smaller infractions. And

3

I think that the Commission has been much more aggressive
in bringing those types of cases.

3

But it's more than -- you know, I think it's

4

safe to say it's in the hundreds, not in the tens. You

4

5

know, it's a significant number, even though we can't

5

6

provide the specific number now.

6

the Microcap Fraud Task Force. And an initiative out of

7

MR. GRAHAM: Patrick?

7

that group and out of my group in OMI has been to be more

8

MR. REARDON: This may be unfair, but I'm going

8

-- to recommend more frequently trading suspensions

9

against companies that are putting out false information

9

to state it anyway. And I live in Fort Worth, where you

As I mentioned before, I work very closely with

10

have an office. There's a perception that the SEC only

10

or misleading information or omitting material

11

brings the big cases, the cases that get a lot of

11

information. And over the last five years, we've

12

publicity are at the top of the list. And the small

12

probably brought approximately 800 trading suspensions.

13

fraud cases are at the bottom. Or the small,

13

And we're seeing that that is having a real deterrent

14

unregistered broker dealers. Now, that's a perception,

14

effect in that specific kind of space, the microcap fraud

15

and it can be wrong. And feel free to tell me I'm wrong.

15

space.

16
17

16

I would just encourage you to file cases,

So, you know, those smaller companies that are

17

quoted on the over-the-counter market, they're not listed

18

whatever, fraud or unregistered broker dealers or

18

securities on a national exchange, and historically have

19

whatever, to file all size cases.

19

preyed upon our most vulnerable of victims in terms of

20

elderly or unsophisticated investors. And so I certainly

20

I'm sure you've got some young lawyers who have

21

been hired. And on these little cases, cut them loose if

21

take your point, and I think it is something that we try

22

they're fraud. Or give them to the states.

22

to be mindful of. And so I do appreciate that feedback.

23

But, you know, the compliance -- it helps us on

23

24

compliance if people have a perception that there will be

24

25

consequences for failing to comply with the securities

25

MR. GRAHAM: Okay, any other comments,
questions?
