ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17221
In the Matter of
ORDER OF SUSPENSION PURSUANT
TO RULE 102(e)(2) OF THE
COMMISSION’S RULES OF PRACTICE

GERRY G. ZOBRIST, ESQ.,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate to issue
an order of forthwith suspension of Gerry G. Zobrist (“Respondent” or “Zobrist”) pursuant to
Rule 102(e)(2)1 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice (17 C.F.R. § 200.102(e)(2)).
II.
The Commission finds that:
1.

Gerry G. Zobrist is an attorney previously licensed in the State of Nevada.

2.
On at least one occasion in 2011, Zobrist appeared and practiced before the
Commission as an attorney by providing a legal opinion to a company that was included in a
registration statement filed with the Commission.
3.
On September 5, 2013, Zobrist was convicted in the United States District Court
for the District of Nevada on one count of felony conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire
fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 1344 and 1349. From in or about June 2006 to in or
about May 2008, Zobrist conspired with others to buy homes through straw buyers using false
1 Rule 102(e)(2) provides in pertinent part: “[a]ny attorney who has been suspended or disbarred
by a court of the United States or any State . . . or any person who has been convicted of a felony
or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or
practicing before the Commission.” See 17 CFR § 201.102(e)(2).

mortgage applications and supporting documents, in order to obtain portions of the loan proceeds
for himself and his co-conspirators. Through this scheme, Zobrist and his co-conspirators
obtained control of approximately 144 properties. The total amount of the loans made to
purchase the properties was greater than $53,000,000.00. Because Zobrist and his coconspirators defaulted on the mortgage loans, causing the properties to go into foreclosure, the
financial institutions they defrauded suffered losses greater than $30,000,000.00.
4.
On April 10, 2015, the Supreme Court of Nevada issued an order disbarring
Zobrist from the practice of law in Nevada, based on his conviction for conspiracy to commit
bank fraud and wire fraud.

III.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Zobrist has been convicted of a
felony and disbarred from the practice of law, within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED, that Zobrist is forthwith suspended from appearing or
practicing before the Commission, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice.
By the Commission.
