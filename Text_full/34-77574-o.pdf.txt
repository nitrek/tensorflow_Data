File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of each of the issuers detailed below because
questions have arisen as to their operating status, if any. Each of the issuers below is quoted on
OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. OTC Markets Group, Inc., however, has been
unable to contact each of these issuers for more than one year. In addition, the staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission has independently endeavored to determine whether any

of the issuers below are operating. Each of the issuers below either confirmed that they were no
longer operating or were now private companies, failed to respond to the Commissionâ€™s inquiry
about their operating status, did not have an operational address, or failed to provide their
registered agent with an operational address. The staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission also determined that none of the issuers below has filed any information with OTC
Markets Group, Inc. or the Securities and Exchange Commission for the past year.
