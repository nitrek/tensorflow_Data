ORDER STAYING PROCEEDING AS TO

Today this office received a joint motion to stay this proceeding as to Respondent David

that will resolve the proceeding as to Hall on all major terms.
For good cause shown, it is ORDERED that the joint motion is GRANTED, and the
proceeding is STAYED as to Hall, subject to compliance with Rule of Practice 161(c)(2), 17
C.F.R. § 201.161(c)(2), requiring that this office be notified promptly if any of the requirements
of the Rule are not met.
This proceeding is now stayed as to all four Respondents, pending the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s consideration of their respective settlement offers. The hearing
currently scheduled to begin February 1, 2016, is therefore CANCELED.
