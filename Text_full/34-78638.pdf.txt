SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Release No. 78638 / August 22, 2016
Admin. Proc. File No. 3-17202

In the Matter of
EXPLEO SOLUTIONS, INC.

ORDER DISMISSING PROCEEDING
On April 6, 2016, the Commission instituted an administrative proceeding against Expleo
Solutions, Inc. and one other respondent under § 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.1
The Order Instituting Proceedings alleged that Expleo had violated periodic reporting
requirements and sought to determine, based on those allegations, whether it was “necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors to suspend . . . or revoke” the registration of Expleo’s
securities.2
On April 12, 2016, Expleo filed a Form 15, seeking to terminate voluntarily the
registration of its securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.3 Under Exchange Act
Rule 12g-4(a), an issuer’s registration is terminated ninety days after the issuer files Form 15, in
this case, on July 11, 2016.4 The Division of Enforcement subsequently moved to dismiss the
proceeding against Expleo. Expleo has not responded to the Division’s motion.

17 C.F.R. § 240.12g-4(a) (providing for certification of termination of registration under
§ 12(g), 15 U.S.C. § 78l(g)). Expleo relied on Rule 12g-4(a)(1), which permits the termination
of registration if the issuer certifies that the class of securities being deregistered is held of record
by fewer than 300 persons. 17 C.F.R. § 240.12g-4(a)(1). In its Form 15, Expleo certified that
the approximate number of holders of record, as of April 12, 2016, was 53.
4

17 C.F.R. § 240.12g-4(a).

We have determined to grant the Division’s motion. Expleo no longer has a class of
securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Because revocation and suspension
of registration are the only remedies available in a proceeding instituted under Section 12(j), we
find it appropriate to dismiss this proceeding against Expleo.5
IT IS therefore ORDERED that this proceeding is dismissed with respect to Expleo
Solutions, Inc.
By the Commission.
