In the Matter of the Application of
KENNY A. AKINDEMOWO
For Review of Action Taken by

ORDER DENYING STAY

FINRA

Kenny A. Akindemowo (“Akindemowo”) has appealed from a FINRA order barring him
from association with any FINRA member and directing him to pay $15,000 plus prejudgment
interest as disgorgement and to pay costs for converting two investors’ funds and inducing their
investments by fraudulent means. After filing his application for review on January 29, 2016,
and a brief in support of that application on April 20, 2016,1 Akindemowo filed the instant
motion on June 28, 2016, requesting a stay of the bar pending his appeal to the Commission.
FINRA opposes his motion. Akindemowo's motion is denied.
I.

Background

FINRA’s Department of Enforcement (“Enforcement”) filed a complaint against
Akindemowo on February 1, 2013, alleging, among other things, that he converted investor
funds by making fraudulent misrepresentations in connection with the purported sale of
securities. Enforcement further alleged that Akindemowo engaged in securities transactions and
outside business activities without providing written notice to his firm.
On January 23, 2014, a FINRA Hearing Panel (the “Hearing Panel”) issued a decision
finding that Akindemowo had committed the alleged violations. The Hearing Panel found that
Akindemowo “preyed on two women with whom he was socially acquainted” and convinced
them “to invest in purported securities transactions that he did not disclose to his firm.” Instead
of investing the money as promised, Akindemowo was found to have “converted it to his own
Akindemowo’s reply brief was due on June 1, 2016, but he has not filed a reply. See
Kenny Akindemowo, Exchange Act Release No. 77513, 2016 WL 2621664, at *1 (Apr. 4, 2016).

use.” The Hearing Panel barred Akindemowo for his fraud and conversion violations but, in
light of those bars, imposed no further sanctions for Akindemowo’s other violations.
Akindemowo appealed the Hearing Panel’s decision to FINRA’s National Adjudicatory
Council (the “NAC”). On December 29, 2015, the NAC affirmed the Hearing Panel’s finding
that Akindemowo converted two investors’ funds through fraudulent means. According to the
NAC, the two defrauded investors (who gave Akindemowo a total of $15,000 to invest in an
investment vehicle operated by Akindemowo’s acquaintance) did not know each other but gave
similar testimony at the hearing about Akindemowo’s investment pitch, his evasiveness in
providing them with documentation of their investments, and his refusal to remit their invested
funds. The NAC further found that, instead of investing the investors’ funds as he represented,
Akindemowo used them to pay his personal expenses.
In determining sanctions, the NAC found several aggravating factors. The NAC found
that Akindemowo acted intentionally when converting the investors’ funds, that he exploited his
personal relationships with the investors to induce their investments, that he used their money for
his own pecuniary benefit, that he refused to remit their funds, and that he attempted to lull the
investors into inactivity when they insisted that he repay them. The NAC concluded that this
was “an egregious case,” that Akindemowo presented “a substantial risk to the investing public,”
and that “[i]ndependently barring Akindemowo for his conversion and fraud are the only
appropriate sanctions.” The NAC further concluded that disgorgement was appropriate because
Akindemowo converted $15,000 in investor funds for his own benefit and should not be
permitted to retain these ill-gotten gains.

Analysis

In determining whether to grant a stay under Rule of Practice 401,2 the Commission
considers: (i) whether there is a strong likelihood that the moving party will succeed on the
merits of its appeal; (ii) whether the moving party will suffer irreparable harm without a stay;
(iii) whether any person will suffer substantial harm as a result of a stay; and (iv) whether a stay
is likely to serve the public interest.3 The party seeking a stay has the burden of establishing that
relief is warranted.4 Akindemowo has failed to satisfy this burden, and his motion is denied.
Akindemowo does not address how likely he is to succeed on the merits other than to
claim that, since affiliating with FINRA in 2000, he has “conducted [his] business with utmost
integrity,” that he has “never had a client complaint or any disciplinary action or admonishment
from any . . . firm [he has been] affiliated with,” and that he has “built a solid book of business of
almost $50 million with more than 200 clients [to whom he has] provided . . . excellent service

and advice.” The Commission, however, has repeatedly found that lack of a disciplinary history
is not mitigating as to sanctions.5 Although final resolution of Akindemowo’s appeal must await
the Commission’s determination on the merits, Akindemowo's motion does not establish a strong
likelihood that he will succeed.
Akindemowo has also failed to demonstrate that he will suffer irreparable harm absent a
stay. To establish irreparable injury, Akindemowo must do more than show he is subject to a bar
order.6 Rather, he must show an injury that is “both certain and great” and “actual and not
theoretical.”7 A stay “will not be granted [based on] something merely feared as liable to occur
at some indefinite time.”8 Here, Akindemowo argues vaguely that “[his] family has suffered
untold hardship since the disciplinary action was handed down by FINRA” and requests that his
“license be reinstated pending the outcome of SEC decision so [he] can continue to provide for
[his] family.” Even assuming that loss of employment (or an employment opportunity)
constitutes irreparable injury, rather than monetary harm,9 Akindemowo does not specify how he
or his family will be harmed by the bar pending the outcome of his appeal.10 Further weighing
against Akindemowo’s concern that he will suffer irreparable harm is that he did not seek a stay

No. 54723 (Nov. 8, 2006) (“[T]he lack of disciplinary history is not mitigating for the purposes
of sanctions because an associated person should not be rewarded for acting in accordance with
his duties as a securities professional.”); see also Rooms v. SEC, 444 F.3d 1208, 1214 (10th Cir.
2006) (“Lack of a disciplinary history is not a mitigating factor; Mr. Rooms was required to
comply with the NASD’s high standards of conduct at all times.”).

his only source of income,” without greater elucidation, did not establish irreparable injury);

that applicant’s argument that “the bar imposed on him ha[d] resulted in severe financial loss and
damages to his reputation . . . d[id] not rise to the level of irreparable injury”).

until five months after he initiated this review proceeding and more than two months after he
filed his brief in support of his application for review.11
Finally, Akindemowo has failed to address whether any person will suffer substantial
harm because of a stay and whether a stay is likely to serve the public interest. Fraud is
“especially serious and subject to the severest of sanctions.”12 And conversion is “generally
among the most grave violations committed by a registered representative.”13 Akindemowo has
not demonstrated a strong likelihood that he will overturn FINRA’s findings that he committed
this egregious misconduct. Instead, FINRA’s findings highlight the risk of harm to investors that
granting a stay—and thus allowing Akindemowo to continue participating in the industry—
would pose to the investing public. We therefore find that the public interest favors denying his
motion.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the Kenny A. Akindemowo’s motion to stay the
sanctions FINRA imposed pending Commission review of his appeal is denied.
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.
