Regulation SBSR—Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) is adopting
certain amendments to Regulation SBSR—Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based
Swap Information (“Regulation SBSR”). Specifically, new Rule 901(a)(1) of Regulation SBSR
requires a platform (i.e., a national securities exchange or security-based swap execution facility
(“SB SEF”) that is registered with the Commission or exempt from registration) to report a
security-based swap executed on such platform that will be submitted to clearing. New Rule
901(a)(2)(i) of Regulation SBSR requires a registered clearing agency to report any securitybased swap to which it is a counterparty. The Commission is adopting certain conforming
amendments to other provisions of Regulation SBSR in light of the newly adopted amendments
to Rule 901(a), and an amendment that would require registered security-based swap data
repositories (“SDRs”) to provide the security-based swap transaction data that they are required
to publicly disseminate to the users of the information on a non-fee basis. The Commission also
is adopting amendments to Rule 908(a) to extend Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements to additional types of cross-border security-based swaps. The
Commission is offering guidance regarding the application of Regulation SBSR to prime
brokerage transactions and to the allocation of cleared security-based swaps. Finally, the

Commission is adopting a new compliance schedule for the portions of Regulation SBSR for
which the Commission has not previously specified compliance dates.
DATES: Effective Date: October 11, 2016.
Compliance Dates: For a discussion of the Compliance Dates for Regulation SBSR, see
Section X of the Supplementary Information.

Introduction

Section 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 1 provides that each security-based swap that is
not accepted for clearing by any clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization shall be
subject to regulatory reporting. Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act 2 provides that each
security-based swap (whether cleared or uncleared) shall be reported to a registered SDR, and
Section 13(m)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act 3 generally provides that transaction, volume, and
pricing data of security-based swaps shall be publically disseminated in real time. 4
In February 2015, the Commission adopted Regulation SBSR, 5 which consists of Rules
900 to 909 under the Exchange Act and provides for the regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swap transactions. At the same time that it adopted Regulation
SBSR, the Commission also proposed certain additional rules and guidance relating to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination of security-based swap transactions that were not addressed

15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(1). All references in this release to the Exchange Act refer to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In addition, Section 13(m)(1)(E) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(E), provides
that, with respect to cleared security-based swaps, the rule promulgated by the
Commission related to public dissemination shall contain provisions, among others, that
“specify the criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional security-based swap
transaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts” and “specify the
appropriate time delay for reporting large notional security-based swap transactions
(block trades) to the public.”

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 74244 (February 11, 2015), 80 FR 14564 (March
19, 2015) (“Regulation SBSR Adopting Release”). The Commission initially proposed
Regulation SBSR in November 2010. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 63346
(November 19, 2010), 75 FR 75207 (December 2, 2010) (“Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release”). In May 2013, the Commission re-proposed the entirety of Regulation SBSR
as part of a larger release that proposed rules and interpretations regarding the application
of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title VII”) to cross-border security-based swap
activities. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 69490 (May 1, 2013), 78 FR 30967
(May 23, 2013) (“Cross-Border Proposing Release”).

in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. 6 In April 2015, the Commission proposed certain
rules that would address the application of Title VII requirements to security-based swap activity
engaged in by non-U.S. persons within the United States, 7 including how Regulation SBSR
would apply to such activity, and certain related issues. In this release, the Commission is
adopting, with a number of revisions, the amendments to Regulation SBSR contained in the
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release and the U.S. Activity Proposal.
The Commission received 18 comments on the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments
Release 8 and 16 comments on the U.S. Activity Proposal, of which seven addressed issues

relating to Regulation SBSR. 9 Below, the Commission responds to issues raised in those
comments and discusses the amendments to Regulation SBSR being adopted herein. Some
commenters directed comments to the rules the Commission already adopted in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release. 10 As the Commission stated in the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, however, the Commission did not reopen comment on the rules that it
adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. 11 Accordingly, these comments are beyond
the scope of this release and are not addressed herein.

The issues raised by these commenters included, for example, the 24-hour reporting delay
adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release; the ability to report all transaction
information required by Regulation SBSR in light of certain foreign privacy laws; the
identification of indirect counterparties; public dissemination of certain illiquid securitybased swaps; the requirement for registered SDRs to disseminate the full notional size of
all transactions; and the requirement that a registered SDR immediately disseminate
information upon receiving a transaction report.

II.

Economic Considerations and Baseline Analysis
To provide context for understanding the rules being adopted today and the related

economic analysis that follows, this section describes the current state of the security-based swap
market and the existing regulatory framework; it also identifies broad economic considerations
that underlie the likely economic effects of these rules.
A.

Baseline

To assess the economic impact of the final rules described in this release, the
Commission employs as a baseline the security-based swap market as it exists at the time of this
release, including applicable rules that the Commission already has adopted but excluding rules
that the Commission has proposed but not yet finalized. 12 The analysis includes the statutory
and regulatory provisions that currently govern the security-based swap market pursuant to the
Dodd-Frank Act, rules adopted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 13 the CrossBorder Adopting Release, 14 the SDR Adopting Release, 15 and the U.S. Activity Adopting
Release. 16 In addition, the baseline includes rules that have been adopted but for which

12

The Commission also considered, where appropriate, the impact of rules and technical
standards promulgated by other regulators, such as the CFTC and the European Securities
and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), on practices in the security-based swap market.

2012) (“Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release”).

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 72472 (June 25, 2014), 79 FR 47278 (August
12, 2014) (“Cross-Border Adopting Release”).

(March 19, 2015) (“SDR Adopting Release”).

16

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 77104 (February 10, 2016), 81 FR 8598
(February 19, 2016) (“U.S. Activity Adopting Release”).

11

compliance is not yet required, including the SBS Entity Registration Adopting Release, 17 the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 18 and the External Business Conduct Adopting Release, 19
as these final rules—even if compliance is not required—are part of the existing regulatory
landscape that market participants must take into account when conducting their security-based
swap activity.
The following sections provide an overview of aspects of the security-based swap market
that are likely to be most affected by the amendments and guidance being adopted today, as well
as elements of the current market structure, such as central clearing and platform trading, that are
likely to determine the scope of transactions that will be covered by them.
1.

Available Data Regarding Security-Based Swap Activity

The Commission’s understanding of the market is informed in part by available data on
security-based swap transactions, though the Commission acknowledges that limitations in the
data prevent the Commission from quantitatively characterizing certain aspects of the market. 20
Because these data do not cover the entire market, the Commission has developed an
understanding of market activity using a sample of transaction data that includes only certain
portions of the market. The Commission believes, however, that the data underlying its analysis
here provide reasonably comprehensive information regarding single-name credit default swap
(“CDS”) transactions and the composition of participants in the single-name CDS market.
17

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 75611 (August 5, 2015), 80 FR 48963 (August
14, 2015) (“SBS Entities Registration Adopting Release”).

18

See supra note 5.

19

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 77617 (April 14, 2016), 81 FR 29960 (May 13,
2016) (“External Business Conduct Adopting Release”).

20

The Commission also relies on qualitative information regarding market structure and
evolving market practices provided by commenters, both in letters and in meetings with
Commission staff, and knowledge and expertise of Commission staff.

12

Specifically, the Commission’s analysis of the state of the current security-based swap
market is based on data obtained from the DTCC Derivatives Repository Limited Trade
Information Warehouse (“TIW”), especially data regarding the activity of market participants in
the single-name CDS market during the period from 2008 to 2015. According to data published
by the Bank for International Settlements (“BIS”), the global notional amount outstanding in
single-name CDS was approximately $7.18 trillion, 21 in multi-name index CDS was
approximately $4.74 trillion, and in multi-name, non-index CDS was approximately $373
billion. The total gross market value outstanding in single-name CDS was approximately $284
billion, and in multi-name CDS instruments was approximately $137 billion. 22 The global
notional amount outstanding in equity forwards and swaps as of December 2015 was $3.32
trillion, with total gross market value of $147 billion. 23 As these figure show (and as the
Commission has previously noted), although the definition of security-based swaps is not limited
to single-name CDS, single-name CDS make up a vast majority of security-based swaps in terms
of notional amount outstanding, and the Commission believes that the single-name CDS data are
sufficiently representative of the market to inform the Commission’s analysis of the state of the
current security-based swap market. 24

21

The global notional amount outstanding represents the total face amount of the swap used
to calculate payments. The gross market value is the cost of replacing all open contracts
at current market prices.

22

See Semi-annual OTC derivatives statistics (December 2015), Table D5, available at
http://www.bis.org/statistics/derstats.htm (last viewed May 25, 2016).

23

These totals include both swaps and security-based swaps, as well as products that are
excluded from the definition of ‘‘swap,’’ such as certain equity forwards.

24

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8601.

13

The Commission notes that the data available to it from TIW do not encompass those
CDS transactions that both: (1) do not involve U.S. counterparties; 25 and (2) are based on nonU.S. reference entities. Notwithstanding this limitation, the TIW data should provide sufficient
information to permit the Commission to identify the types of market participants active in the
security-based swap market and the general pattern of dealing within that market. 26
One commenter recommended that the Commission collect a more complete set of data
to more precisely estimate the number of non-U.S. persons that would be affected by the
proposed rules. 27 Given the absence of comprehensive reporting requirements for security-based
swap transactions, and the fact that the location of personnel that arrange, negotiate, or execute a
security-based swap transaction is not currently available in TIW, a more precise estimate of the
number of non-U.S. persons affected by the adopted rules is not currently feasible.
2.

Clearing Activity in Single-Name CDS

25

The Commission has classified accounts as “U.S. counterparties” based on TIW’s entity
domicile determinations. The Commission notes, however, that TIW’s entity domicile
determinations are not necessarily identical in all cases to the definition of “U.S. person”
under Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3(a)(4), 17 CFR 240.3a71-3(a)(4).

26

The challenges the Commission faces in estimating measures of current market activity
stems, in part, from the absence of comprehensive reporting requirements for securitybased swap market participants. The Commission has adopted rules regarding trade

See ISDA Letter at 3, 7 (arguing that the Commission lacks complete data to estimate the
number of non-U.S. persons that use U.S. personnel to arrange, negotiate, or execute
security-based swap transactions or the number of registered U.S. broker-dealers that
intermediate these transactions and that this “makes it difficult or impossible for the
Commission to formulate a useful estimate of the market impact, cost and benefits of the
Proposal”; suggesting that the Commission “gather[] more robust and complete data prior
to finalizing a rulemaking that will have meaningful impact on a global market”).

Currently, there is no regulatory requirement in the United States to clear security-based
swaps. Clearing for certain single-name CDS products occurs on a voluntary basis. Voluntary
clearing activity in single-name CDS has steadily increased in recent years. As of the end of
2015, ICE Clear Credit accepted for clearing security-based swap products based on a total of
232 North American corporate reference entities, 174 European corporate reference entities, and
21 individual sovereign reference entities.
Figure 1, below, shows characteristics of new trades in single-name CDS that reference
North American standard corporate ISDA documentation. In particular, the figure documents
that about half of all clearable transactions are cleared.

Analysis of trade activity from January

2011 to December 2015 indicates that, out of $3,460 billion of notional amount traded in North
American corporate single-name CDS products that are accepted for clearing during the 60
months ending December 2015, approximately 70%, or $2,422 billion, had characteristics
making them suitable for clearing by ICE Clear Credit and represented trades between two ICE
Clear Credit clearing members. Approximately 80% of this notional value, or $1,938 billion,
was cleared through ICE Clear Credit, or 56% of the total volume of new trade activity. As of
the end of 2015, ICE Clear Europe accepted for clearing single-name CDS products referencing
a total of 176 European corporate reference entities and seven sovereign reference entities.
Analysis of new trade activity from January 2011 to December 2015 indicates that, out of €1,963
billion of notional volume traded in European corporate single-name CDS products that are
accepted for clearing during the 60 months ending December 2015, approximately 58%, or
€1,139 billion, had characteristics making them suitable for clearing by ICE Clear Europe and
represented trades between two ICE Clear Europe clearing members. Approximately 71% of

Current Market Structure for Security-Based Swap Infrastructure
a.

Exchanges and SB SEFs

The rules and amendments adopted herein address how transactions conducted on
platforms (i.e., national securities exchanges and SB SEFs) must be reported under Regulation
SBSR. Currently, there are no SB SEFs registered with the Commission, and as a result, there is

28

These numbers do not include transactions in European corporate single-name CDS that
were cleared by ICE Clear Credit. During the sample period, a total of 2,168 transactions
in European corporate single-name CDS (with a total gross notional amount of
approximately €11 billion) were cleared by ICE Clear Credit. All but one of these
transactions occurred between 2014 and 2015. For historical data, see
https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reports/99 (last visited on May 25, 2016).

29

The Commission believes that it is reasonable to assume that, when clearing occurs
within 14 days of execution, counterparties made the decision to clear at the time of
execution and not as a result of information arriving after execution.

16

no registered SB SEF trading activity to report. There are, however, currently 22 swap execution
facilities (“SEFs”) that are either temporarily registered with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”) or whose temporary registrations are pending with the CFTC and
currently are exempt from registration with the Commission.30 As the Commission noted in the
U.S. Activity Adopting Release, the cash flows of security-based swaps and other swaps are
closely related and many participants in the swap market also participate in the security-based
swap market. 31 Likewise, the Commission believes that it is possible that some entities that
currently act as SEFs will register with the Commission as SB SEFs. The Commission
anticipates that, owing to the smaller size of the security-based swap market, there will be fewer
platforms for executing transactions in security-based swaps than the 22 SEFs reported within
the CFTC’s jurisdiction. Under newly adopted Rule 901(a)(1), a platform is required to report to
a registered SDR any security-based swap transaction that is executed on the platform and
submitted to clearing.

The market for clearing services in the security-based swap market is currently
concentrated among a handful of firms. Table 1 lists the firms that currently clear index and
single-name CDS and identifies the segments of the market each firm serves. While there may
be several choices available to participants interested in cleared index CDS transactions, only
two firms (albeit with the same parent) clear sovereign single-name CDS and only a single firm
serves the market for North American single-name CDS. Concentration of clearing services
within a limited set of clearing agencies can be explained, in part, by the existence of strong
economies of scale in central clearing. 32
The rules adopted today will, among other things, assign regulatory reporting duties for
clearing transactions (i.e., security-based swaps to which registered clearing agencies are direct
counterparties). Any rule that would assign reporting duties for clearing transactions would
affect the accessibility of data related to a large number of security-based swap transactions. In
addition, the number of clearing transactions would affect the magnitude of the regulatory
burdens associated with those reporting duties.

Trade Repositories

The market for data services has evolved along similar lines. While there is currently no
mandatory reporting requirement for the single-name CDS market, virtually all transactions are
voluntarily reported to TIW, which maintains a legal record of transactions. 38 That there
currently is a single dominant provider of recordkeeping services for security-based swaps is
consistent with the presence of a natural monopoly for a service that involves a predominantly
fixed cost investment with low marginal costs of operation.

There are currently no SDRs registered with the Commission.39 Registration
requirements are part of the new rules discussed in the SDR Adopting Release. 40 In the absence
of SEC-registered SDRs, the analysis of the economic effects of the adopted rules and
amendments discussed in this release on SDRs is informed by the experience of the CFTCregistered swap data repositories that operate in the swap market. The CFTC has provisionally
registered four swap data repositories to accept transactions in swap credit derivatives. 41
It is reasonable to estimate that a similar number of persons provisionally registered with
the CFTC to service the equity and credit swap markets might seek to register with the
Commission as SDRs, and that other persons could seek to register with both the CFTC and the
Commission as swap data repositories and SDRs, respectively. There are economic incentives
for the dual registration attributed to the fact that many of the market participants in the securitybased swap market also participate in the swap market. Moreover, once a swap data repository is
registered with the CFTC and the required infrastructure for regulatory reporting and public
dissemination is in place, the marginal costs for a swap data repository to also register with the
Commission as an SDR, adding products and databases and implementing modifications to
account for differences between Commission and CFTC rules, will likely be lower than the
initial cost of registration with the CFTC.

Vertical Integration of Security-Based Swap Market Infrastructure

39

ICE Trade Vault, LLC, and DTCC Data Repository (U.S.) LLC (“DDR”) each have filed
an application with the Commission to register as an SDR. See Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 77699 (April 22, 2016), 81 FR 25475 (April 28, 2016) (ICE Trade Vault);
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 78216 (June 30, 2016), 81 FR at 44379 (July 7,
2016).

http://sirt.cftc.gov/sirt/sirt.aspx?Topic=DataRepositories (last visited May 25, 2016).

20

The Commission has already observed vertical integration of swap market infrastructure:
clearing agencies have entered the market for record keeping services for swaps by provisionally
registering themselves, or their affiliates, as swap data repositories with the CFTC. Under the
CFTC swap reporting regime, two provisionally registered swap data repositories are, or are
affiliated with, clearing agencies that clear swaps. These clearing agencies have adopted rules
providing that they will satisfy their CFTC swap reporting obligations by reporting to their own,
or their affiliated, swap data repository. 42 As a result, beta and gamma transactions and
subsequent netting transactions that arise from the clearing process are reported by each of these
clearing agencies to their associated swap data repositories.

Security-Based Swap Market: Market Participants and Dealing
Structures
a.

Market Centers

Financial groups engaged in security-based swap dealing activity operate in multiple
market centers and carry out such activity with counterparties around the world. 43 Several
commenters noted that many market participants that engage in dealing activity prefer to use
traders and manage risk for security-based swaps in the jurisdiction where the underlier is
traded. 44 Thus, although a significant amount of the dealing activity in security-based swaps on
U.S. reference entities involves non-U.S. dealers, the Commission understands that these dealers
tend to carry out much of the security-based swap trading and related risk-management activities

42

See CME Clearing Rule 1001 (Regulatory Reporting of Swap Data); ICE Clear Credit
Clearing Rule 211 (Regulatory Reporting of Swap Data).

21

in these security-based swaps within the United States. 45 Some dealers have explained that
being able to centralize their trading, sales, risk management, and other activities related to U.S.
reference entities in U.S. operations (even when the resulting transaction is booked in a foreign
entity) improves the efficiency of their dealing business. 46
Consistent with these operational concerns and the global nature of the security-based
swap market, the available data appear to confirm that participants in this market are in fact
active in market centers around the globe. Although, as noted above, the available data do not
permit the Commission to identify the location of personnel in a transaction, TIW transaction
records indicate that firms that are likely to be security-based swap dealers operate out of branch
locations in key market centers around the world, including New York, London, Tokyo, Hong
Kong, Chicago, Sydney, Toronto, Frankfurt, Singapore and the Cayman Islands.
Given these market characteristics and practices, participants in the security-based swap
market may bear the financial risk of a security-based swap transaction in a location different
from the location where the transaction is arranged, negotiated, or executed, or where economic
decisions are made by managers on behalf of beneficial owners. And market activity may occur
in a jurisdiction other than where the market participant or its counterparty books the transaction.
Similarly, a participant in the security-based swap market may be exposed to counterparty risk
from a counterparty located in a jurisdiction that is different from the market center or centers in
which it participates.
b.

Common Business Structures for Firms Engaged in Security-Based
Swap Dealing Activity

45

See IIB Letter at 2; SIFMA/FSR Letter at 6; ISDA Letter at 5.

46

See id.

22

A financial group that engages in a global security-based swap dealing business in
multiple market centers may choose to structure its dealing business in a number of different
ways. This structure, including where it books the transactions that constitute that business and
how it carries out market-facing activities that generate those transactions, reflects a range of
business and regulatory considerations, which each financial group may weigh differently.
A financial group may choose to book all of its security-based swap transactions,
regardless of where the transaction originated, in a single, central booking entity. That entity
generally retains the risk associated with that transaction, but it also may lay off that risk to
another affiliate via a back-to-back transaction or an assignment of the security-based swap. 47
Alternatively, a financial group may book security-based swaps arising from its dealing business
in separate affiliates, which may be located in the jurisdiction where it originates the risk
associated with those security-based swaps, or alternatively, the jurisdiction where it manages
that risk. 48 Some financial groups may book transactions originating in a particular region to an
affiliate established in a jurisdiction located in that region. 49
Regardless of where a financial group determines to book its security-based swaps arising
out of its dealing activity, it is likely to operate offices that perform sales or trading functions in
one or more market centers in other jurisdictions. Maintaining sales and trading desks in global
market centers permits the financial group to deal with counterparties in that jurisdiction or in a
specific geographic region, or to ensure that it is able to provide liquidity to counterparties in
47

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8604.

48

See id.

49

There is some indication that this booking structure is becoming increasingly common in
the market. See, e.g., “Regional swaps booking replacing global hubs,” Risk.net (Sept. 4,
2015), available at: http://www.risk.net/risk-magazine/feature/2423975/regional-swapsbooking-replacing-global-hubs.

23

other jurisdictions, for example, when a counterparty’s home financial markets are closed. 50 A
financial group engaged in security-based swap dealing business also may choose to manage its
trading book in particular reference entities or securities primarily from a trading desk that can
take advantage of local expertise in such products or that can gain access to better liquidity,
which may permit it to more efficiently price such products or to otherwise compete more
effectively in the security-based swap market. 51 Some financial groups prefer to centralize risk
management, pricing, and hedging for specific products with the personnel responsible for
carrying out the trading of such products to mitigate operational risk associated with transactions
in those products.
The financial group affiliate that books these transactions may carry out related marketfacing activities, whether in its home jurisdiction or in a foreign jurisdiction, using either its own
personnel or the personnel of an affiliated or unaffiliated agent. For example, the financial group
may determine that another affiliate in the financial group employs personnel who possess
expertise in relevant products or who have established sales relationships with key counterparties
in a foreign jurisdiction, making it more efficient to use the personnel of the affiliate to engage in
security-based swap dealing activity on its behalf in that jurisdiction. 52 In these cases, the
affiliate that books these transactions and its affiliated agent may operate as an integrated dealing
business, each performing distinct core functions in carrying out that business.

50

These offices may be branches or offices of the booking entity itself, or branches or
offices of an affiliated agent, such as, in the United States, a registered broker-dealer.
See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8604-605.

51

See id. at 8605.

52

See id.

24

Alternatively, the financial group affiliate that books these transactions may in some
circumstances determine to engage the services of an unaffiliated agent through which it can
engage in dealing activity. For example, a financial group may determine that using an
interdealer broker may provide an efficient means of participating in the interdealer market in its
own, or in another, jurisdiction, particularly if it is seeking to do so anonymously or to take a
position in products that trade relatively infrequently. 53 A financial group may also use
unaffiliated agents that operate at its direction. Such an arrangement may be particularly
valuable in enabling a financial group to service clients or access liquidity in jurisdictions in
which it has no security-based swap operations of its own.
The Commission understands that financial group affiliates (whether affiliated with U.S.based financial groups or not) that are established in foreign jurisdictions may use any of these
structures to engage in dealing activity in the United States, and that they may seek to engage in
dealing activity in the United States to transact with both U.S.-person and non-U.S.-person
counterparties. In transactions with non-U.S.-person counterparties, these foreign affiliates may
affirmatively seek to engage in dealing activity in the United States because the sales personnel
of the non-U.S.-person dealer (or of its agent) in the United States have existing relationships
with counterparties in other locations (such as Canada or Latin America) or because the trading
personnel of the non-U.S. person dealer (or of its agent) in the United States have the expertise to
manage the trading books for security-based swaps on U.S. reference securities or entities. The
Commission understands that some of these foreign affiliates engage in dealing activity in the
53

The Commission understands that inter-dealer brokers may provide voice or electronic
trading services that, among other things, permit dealers to take positions or hedge risks
in a manner that preserves their anonymity until the trade is executed. These inter-dealer
brokers also may play a particularly important role in facilitating transactions in lessliquid security-based swaps.

25

United States through their personnel (or personnel of their affiliates) in part to ensure that they
are able to provide their own counterparties, or those of financial group affiliates in other
jurisdictions, with access to liquidity (often in non-U.S. reference entities) during U.S. business
hours, permitting them to meet client demand even when the home markets are closed. In some
cases, such as when seeking to transact with other dealers through an interdealer broker, these
foreign affiliates may act, in a dealing capacity, in the United States through an unaffiliated,
third-party agent.
c.

Current Estimates of Number of Security-Based Swap Dealers

Security-based swap activity is concentrated in a relatively small number of dealers,
which already represent a small percentage of all market participants active in the security-based
swap market. 54 Based on an analysis of 2015 data, the Commission’s earlier estimates of the
number of entities likely to register as security-based swap dealers remain largely unchanged. 55
Of the approximately 50 entities that the Commission estimates might register as security-based
swap dealers, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to expect 22 to be non-U.S.
persons. 56 Under the rules as they currently exist, the Commission identified approximately 170
entities engaged in single-name CDS activity, with all counterparties, of $2 billion or more. Of
those entities, 104 are expected to incur assessment costs to determine whether they meet the

54

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8605.

55

See id.

56

These estimates are based on the number of accounts in TIW data with total notional
volume in excess of de minimis thresholds, increased by a factor of two, to account for
any potential growth in the security-based swap market, to account for the fact that the
Commission is limited in observing transaction records for activity between non-U.S.
persons that reference U.S. underliers, and to account for the fact that the Commission
does not observe security-based swap transactions other than in single-name CDS. See
U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8605.

26

definition of “security-based swap dealer.” Approximately 47 of these entities are non-U.S.
persons. 57
Many of these dealers are already subject to other regulatory frameworks under U.S. law
based on their role as intermediaries or on the volume of their positions in other products, such as
swaps. Available data support the Commission’s prior estimates, based on the Commission’s
experience and understanding of the swap and security-based swap market, that, of the 55 firms
that might register as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants,
approximately 35 would also be registered with the CFTC as swap dealers or major swap
participants. 58 Based on an analysis of TIW data and filings with the Commission, the
Commission estimates that 16 market participants that will register as security-based swap
dealers have already registered with the Commission as broker-dealers and are thus subject to
Exchange Act and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) requirements applicable
to such entities. Finally, as the Commission discusses below, some dealers may be subject to
similar requirements in one or more foreign jurisdictions. 59
Finally, the Commission also notes that it has adopted rules for the registration of
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, although market
participants are not yet required to comply with those rules. 60 Thus, there are not yet any

In the SBS Entity Registration Adopting Release, the Commission established the
compliance date for security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap
participant registration (the “SBS entities registration compliance date”) as the later of six
months after the date of publication in the Federal Register of a final rule release
adopting rules establishing capital, margin and segregation requirements for SBS entities;

d.

Arranging, Negotiating, and Executing Activity using Personnel
Located in a U.S. Branch or Office

Under rules recently adopted by the Commission as part of the U.S. Activity Adopting
Release, non-U.S. persons will be required to apply transactions with other non-U.S. persons in
connection with their dealing activity towards their de minimis thresholds when those
transactions are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in a U.S. branch or office,
or by personnel of an agent of such non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office. 61 As a
result of this requirement, certain market participants will likely incur costs associated with
determining the location of relevant personnel who arrange, negotiate, or execute a transaction, 62
and, having determined the locations, these market participants will be able to identify those
transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in a U.S. branch or
office, or by personnel of an agent of such non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office.
The Commission estimated that an additional 20 non-U.S. persons, beyond the 56 identified
under the Cross-Border Adopting Release, were likely to incur assessment costs in connection
with the de minimis exception as a result of these rules. 63

disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on the SBS

28

To estimate the number of unregistered foreign entities that arrange, negotiate, or execute
security-based swap transactions using U.S. personnel in connection with their dealing activity
for the purpose of this rulemaking, Commission staff used 2015 TIW single-name CDS
transaction data to identify foreign entities that have three or more counterparties that are not
recognized as dealers by ISDA and that traded less than $3 billion in notional volume and
identified four entities that met these criteria. In 2015, these four entities were counterparties to
1,080 transactions in single-name CDS, referencing 186 reference entities, with a total notional
volume of $5.2 billion. The Commission believes that these foreign dealing entities that are
likely to remain unregistered engage in transactions in essentially the same products as foreign
dealing entities that are likely to register as security-based swap dealers. The Commission staff
observed in the 2015 data that foreign dealing entities that are likely to register as security-based
swap dealers based on single-name CDS transaction activity in 2015 traded in 185 out of the 186
reference entities that the smaller foreign dealing entities had traded in.
These smaller foreign dealing entities were counterparties to a very small number of
security-based swaps involving foreign dealing entities engaging in U.S. activity. Using 2015
TIW data, the Commission estimates that foreign dealing entities that likely would register with
Commission as security-based swap dealers based on their transaction activity in 2015, were
counterparties to nearly all security-based swaps involving foreign dealing entities engaging in
U.S. activity. 64

64

The Commission staff analysis of TIW transaction records indicates that approximately

99.72% of single-name CDS price-forming transactions and 99.73% of price-forming
transaction volume in 2015 that involved foreign dealing entities involved a foreign
dealing entity likely to register with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer
based on its 2015 transaction activity.

5.

Security-Based Swap Market: Levels of Security-Based Swap Trading
Activity

As already noted, firms that act as dealers play a central role in the security-based swap
market. Based on an analysis of 2015 single-name CDS data in TIW, accounts of those firms
that are likely to exceed the security-based swap dealer de minimis thresholds and trigger
registration requirements intermediated transactions with a gross notional amount of
approximately $5.8 trillion, approximately 60% of which was intermediated by the top five
dealer accounts. 65
These dealers transact with hundreds or thousands of counterparties. Approximately 24%
of accounts of firms expected to register as security-based dealers and observable in TIW have
entered into security-based swaps with over 1,000 unique counterparty accounts as of year-end
2015. 66 Another 24% of these accounts transacted with 500 to 1,000 unique counterparty
accounts; 16% transacted with 100 to 500 unique accounts; and 36% of these accounts
intermediated swaps with fewer than 100 unique counterparties in 2015. The median dealer
account transacted with 481 unique accounts (with an average of approximately 635 unique
accounts). Non-dealer counterparties transacted almost exclusively with these dealers. The
median non-dealer counterparty transacted with three dealer accounts (with an average of
approximately four dealer accounts) in 2015.

65

The Commission staff analysis of TIW transaction records indicates that approximately

99% of single-name CDS price-forming transactions in 2015 involved an ISDArecognized dealer.
66

Many dealer entities and financial groups transact through numerous accounts. Given
that individual accounts may transact with hundreds of counterparties, the Commission
may infer that entities and financial groups may transact with at least as many
counterparties as the largest of their accounts.

30

Figure 2 below describes the percentage of global, notional transaction volume in North
American corporate single-name CDS reported to TIW between January 2008 and December
2015, separated by whether transactions are between two ISDA-recognized dealers (interdealer
transactions) or whether a transaction has at least one non-dealer counterparty.
Figure 2 also shows that the portion of the notional volume of North American corporate
single-name CDS represented by interdealer transactions has remained fairly constant and that
interdealer transactions continue to represent a significant majority of trading activity, even as
notional volume has declined over the past seven years, 67 from more than $6 trillion in 2008 to
less than $1.3 trillion in 2015. 68

67

The start of this decline predates the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the proposal
of rules thereunder, which is important to note for the purpose of understanding the
economic baseline for this rulemaking.

68

This estimate is lower than the gross notional amount of $5.8 trillion noted above as it
includes only the subset of single-name CDS referencing North American corporate
documentation. See supra note 65.

The high level of interdealer trading activity reflects the central position of a small
number of dealers, each of which intermediates trades with many hundreds of counterparties.
While the Commission is unable to quantify the current level of trading costs for single-name
CDS, those dealers appear to enjoy market power as a result of their small number and the large
proportion of order flow that they privately observe.
Against this backdrop of declining North American corporate single-name CDS activity,
about half of the trading activity in North American corporate single-name CDS reflected in the
set of data that the Commission analyzed was between counterparties domiciled in the United
States and counterparties domiciled abroad, as shown in Figure 3 below. Using the self-reported
registered office location of the TIW accounts as a proxy for domicile, the Commission estimates
that only 12% of the global transaction volume by notional volume between 2008 and 2015 was
32

between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties, compared to 48% entered into between one U.S.domiciled counterparty and a foreign-domiciled counterparty and 40% entered into between two
foreign-domiciled counterparties. 69
If the Commission considers the number of cross-border transactions instead from the
perspective of the domicile of the corporate group (e.g., by classifying a foreign bank branch or
foreign subsidiary of a U.S. entity as domiciled in the United States), the percentages shift
significantly. Under this approach, the fraction of transactions entered into between two U.S.domiciled counterparties increases to 33%, and to 52% for transactions entered into between a
U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a foreign-domiciled counterparty. By contrast, the proportion
of activity between two foreign-domiciled counterparties drops from 40% to 16%. This change
in respective shares based on different classifications suggests that the activity of foreign
subsidiaries of U.S. firms and foreign branches of U.S. banks accounts for a higher percentage of
security-based swap activity than U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms and U.S. branches of foreign
banks. It also demonstrates that financial groups based in the United States are involved in an
overwhelming majority (approximately 85%) of all reported transactions in North American
corporate single-name CDS.
Financial groups based in the United States are also involved in a majority of interdealer
transactions in North American corporate single-name CDS. Of transactions on North American
corporate single-name CDS between two ISDA-recognized dealers and their branches or

affiliates, 93% of transaction notional volume involved at least one account of an entity with a
U.S. parent.
The Commission notes, in addition, that a significant majority of North American
corporate single-name CDS transactions occur in the interdealer market or between dealers and
foreign non-dealers, with the remaining (and much smaller) portion of the market consisting of
transactions between dealers and U.S.-person non-dealers. Specifically, 74% of North American
corporate single-name CDS transactions involved either two ISDA-recognized dealers or an
ISDA-recognized dealer and a foreign non-dealer. Approximately 16.5% of such transactions
involved an ISDA-recognized dealer and a U.S.-person non-dealer.

Global Regulatory Efforts

In 2009, the G20 Leaders—whose membership includes the United States, 18 other
countries, and the European Union—addressed global improvements in the OTC derivatives
markets. They expressed their view on a variety of issues relating to OTC derivatives contracts.
34

In subsequent summits, the G20 Leaders have returned to OTC derivatives regulatory reform and
encouraged international consultation in developing standards for these markets. 70
Foreign legislative and regulatory efforts have focused on five general areas: moving
OTC derivatives onto organized trading platforms, requiring central clearing of OTC derivatives,
requiring post-trade reporting of transaction data for regulatory purposes and public
dissemination of anonymized versions of such data, establishing or enhancing capital
requirements for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives transactions, and establishing or
enhancing margin and other risk mitigation requirements for non-centrally cleared OTC
derivatives transactions. The rules being adopted in this release will affect a person’s obligations
with respect to post-trade reporting of transaction data for public dissemination and regulatory
purposes under Regulation SBSR.
Foreign jurisdictions have been actively implementing regulations of the OTC derivatives
markets. Regulatory transaction reporting requirements are in force in a number of jurisdictions,
including the European Union, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India,
Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore; other jurisdictions are in
the process of proposing legislation and rules to implement these requirements. 71 The CFTC, the
13 Canadian provinces and territories, the European Union, and Japan have adopted

requirements to publicly disseminate transaction-level data about OTC derivatives transactions.
In addition, a number of foreign jurisdictions have initiated the process of implementing margin
and other risk mitigation requirements for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives transactions. 72
Several jurisdictions have also taken steps to implement the Basel III recommendations
governing capital requirements for financial entities, which include enhanced capital charges for
non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives transactions. 73 There has been limited progress in moving
OTC derivatives onto organized trading platforms among G20 countries. The CFTC mandated
the trading of certain interest rate swaps and index CDS on CFTC-regulated SEFs in 2014.
Japan implemented a similar requirement for a subset of Yen-denominated interest rate swaps in
September 2015. The European Union has adopted legislation that addresses trading OTC
derivatives on regulated trading platforms, but has not mandated specific OTC derivatives to
trade on these platforms. This legislation also should promote post-trade public transparency in

In November 2015, the Financial Stability Board reported that 12 member jurisdictions
participating in its tenth progress report on OTC derivatives market reforms had in force
a legislative framework or other authority to require exchange of margin for non-centrally

consultation or proposal. A further 11 member jurisdictions had a legislative framework
or other authority in force or published for consultation or proposal. See Financial

In November 2015, the Financial Stability Board reported that 18 member jurisdictions
participating in its tenth progress report on OTC derivatives market reforms had in force
standards or requirements covering more than 90% of transactions that require enhanced
capital charges for non-centrally cleared transactions. A further three member
jurisdictions had a legislative framework or other authority in force and had adopted
implementing standards or requirements that were not yet in force. An additional three
member jurisdictions had a legislative framework or other authority in force or published
for consultation or proposal. See Financial Stability Board, OTC Derivatives Market

Economic Considerations

In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission highlighted certain
overarching effects on the security-based swap market that it believes will result from the
adoption of Regulation SBSR. These benefits could include, generally, improved market quality,
improved risk management, greater efficiency, and improved oversight by the Commission and
other relevant authorities. 75 Regulation SBSR requires market participants to make
infrastructure investments in order to report security-based swap transactions to registered SDRs,
and for SDRs to make infrastructure investments to receive and store that transaction data and to
publicly disseminate transaction data in a manner required by Rule 902 of Regulation SBSR.
The amendments to Regulation SBSR being adopted today will, among other things,
impose certain requirements on the platforms, 76 registered clearing agencies, and registered
SDRs that constitute infrastructure for the security-based swap market and provide services to
counterparties who participate in security-based swap transactions. The adopted amendments
and the guidance provided will affect the manner in which these infrastructure providers compete
with one another and exercise market power over security-based swap counterparties. In turn,

there will be implications for the security-based swap counterparties who utilize these
infrastructure providers and the security-based swap market generally.
In addition, the Commission is adopting regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements under Regulation SBSR for certain types of cross-border security-based swaps not
currently addressed in Regulation SBSR. Subjecting additional types of security-based swaps to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination will affect the overall costs and benefits associated
with Regulation SBSR and have implications for transparency, competition, and liquidity
provision in the security-based swap market.
1.

Security-Based Swap Market Infrastructure

Title VII requires the Commission to create a new regulatory regime for the securitybased swap market that, among other things, includes trade execution, central clearing, and
reporting requirements aimed at increasing transparency and customer protection as well as
mitigating the risk of financial contagion. 77 These new requirements, once implemented, might
require market participants, who may have previously engaged in bilateral transaction activity
without any need to engage third-party service providers, to interface with platforms, registered
clearing agencies, and registered SDRs.
As a general matter, rules that require regulated parties to obtain services can have a
material impact on the prices of those services in the absence of a competitive market for those
services. In particular, if service providers are monopolists or otherwise have market power,
requiring market participants to obtain their services can potentially allow the service providers

77

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47285.

38

to increase the profits that they earn from providing the required services. 78 Because Title VII
requires the Commission to implement rules requiring market participants to use the services
provided by platforms, 79 registered clearing agencies, 80 and registered SDRs, 81 these
requirements could reduce the sensitivity of demand to changes in prices or quality of the
services of firms that create and develop security-based swap market infrastructure. As such,
should security-based swap infrastructure providers–such as platforms, registered clearing
agencies, and registered SDRs–enjoy market power, they might be able to change their prices or
service quality without a significant effect on demand for their services. In turn, these changes in
prices or quality could have negative effects on activity in the security-based swap market.
As discussed in Section XIII, infra, the amendments to Regulation SBSR being adopted
today could have an impact on the level of competition among suppliers of trade reporting
services and affect the relative bargaining power of suppliers and consumers in determining the
prices of those services. In particular, when the supply of trade reporting services is
concentrated among a small number of firms, consumers of these services have few alternative
suppliers from which to choose. Such an outcome could limit the incentives to produce more
efficient trade reporting processes and services and could, in certain circumstances, result in less
security-based swap transaction activity than would otherwise be optimal. In the case of
security-based swap transaction activity, welfare losses could result from higher costs to
counterparties for hedging financial or commercial risks.

78

These effects, as they relate specifically to the rules and amendments, as well as
alternative approaches, are discussed in Section XIII, infra.

Competition Among Security-Based Swap Infrastructure Providers

As noted above, the Commission recognizes how regulatory requirements may affect the
demand for services provided by platforms, registered clearing agencies, and SDRs, and, in turn,
the ability of these entities to exercise their market power. The Commission’s economic analysis
of the amendments adopted today considers how the competitive landscape for platforms,
registered clearing agencies, and registered SDRs might affect the market power of these entities
and hence the level and allocation of costs related to regulatory requirements. Some of the
factors that may influence this competitive landscape have to do with the nature of trade
reporting and are unrelated to regulation, while others may be a result of, or influenced by, the
rules that the Commission is adopting in this release. To the extent that the adopted rules inhibit
competition among infrastructure providers, they could result in fees charged to counterparties
that deviate from the underlying costs of providing services.
As a general matter, trade execution, clearing, and reporting services are likely to be
concentrated among a small number of providers. For example, SDRs and clearing agencies
must make significant infrastructure and human capital investments to enter their respective
markets, but once these start-up costs are incurred, the addition of data management by SDRs or
transaction clearing services by clearing agencies is likely to occur at low marginal costs. As a
result, the per-transaction cost to provide infrastructure services quickly falls for SDRs and
clearing agencies as their customer base grows, because they are able to amortize the fixed costs
associated with serving counterparties over a larger number of transactions. These economies of
scale would be expected to favor incumbent service providers who can leverage their market
position to discourage entry by potential new competitors that face significant fixed costs to enter
the market. As a result, the markets for clearing services and SDR services are likely to be

40

dominated by a small number of firms that each have large market share, which is borne out in
the current security-based swap market. 82
Competition among registered clearing agencies and registered SDRs could also be
influenced by the fact that security-based swap market participants incur up-front costs for each
connection that they establish with an SDR or clearing agency. If these costs are sufficiently
high, an SDR or clearing agency could establish itself as an industry leader by ‘‘locking-in’’
customers who are unwilling or unable to make a similar investment for establishing a
connection with a competitor. 83 An SDR or clearing agency attempting to enter the market or
increase market share would have to provide services valuable enough, or set fees low enough, to
offset the costs of switching from a competitor. In this way, costs to security-based swap market
participants of interfacing with market infrastructure could serve as a barrier to entry for firms
that would like to provide market infrastructure services provided by SDRs and clearing
agencies.
The rules adopted today might also influence the competitive landscape for firms that
provide security-based swap market infrastructure. Fundamentally, requiring the reporting of
82

See supra Section II(A).

83

See Joseph Farrell and Paul Klemperer, “Coordination and Lock-in: Competition with
Switching Costs and Network Effects,” in Handbook of Industrial Organization, Mark
Armstrong and Robert Porter (ed.) (2007), at 1972. The authors describe how switching
costs affect entry, noting that, on one hand, “switching costs hamper forms of entry that
must persuade customers to pay those costs” while, on the other hand, if incumbents must
set a single price for both new and old customers, a large incumbent might focus on
harvesting its existing customer base, ceding new customers to the entrant. In this case, a
competitive market outcome would be characterized by prices for services that equal the
marginal costs associated with providing services to market participants. This is because,
in a competitive market with free entry and exit of firms, a firm that charges a price that
is higher than marginal cost would lose sales to existing firms or entrants that are willing
to provide the same service at a lower price. Such price competition prevents firms from
charging prices that are above marginal costs.

41

security-based swap transactions to SDRs creates an inelastic demand for reporting services that
would not be present if not for regulation. This necessarily reduces a counterparty’s ability to
bargain with infrastructure service providers over price or service because the option of not
reporting is unavailable. Moreover, infrastructure requirements imposed by Title VII regulation
will increase the fixed costs of an SDR operating in the security-based swap market and increase
the barriers to entry into the market, potentially discouraging firms from entering the market for
SDR services. For example, under Rule 907, as adopted, registered SDRs are required to
establish and maintain certain written policies and procedures. The Commission estimated that
this requirement will impose initial costs on each registered SDR of approximately
$12,250,000. 84
The rules adopted today might also affect the competitive landscape by increasing the
incentives for security-based swap infrastructure service providers to integrate horizontally or
vertically. As a general matter, firms engage in horizontal integration when they expand their
product offerings to include similar goods and services or to acquire competitors. For example,
swap data repositories that presently serve the swap market might horizontally integrate by
offering similar services in the security-based swap market. Firms vertically integrate by
entering into businesses that supply the market that they occupy (“backward vertical
integration”) or by entering into businesses that they supply (“forward vertical integration”).
As discussed in more detail in Section XIII(A), infra, while adopting a reporting
methodology that assigns reporting responsibilities to registered clearing agencies, which will
hold the most complete and accurate information for cleared transactions, could minimize
potential data discrepancies and errors, rules that give registered clearing agencies discretion
84

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14718, n. 1343.

42

over where to report transaction data could provide incentives for registered clearing agencies to
create affiliate SDRs and compete with other registered SDRs for post-trade reporting services.
The cost to a clearing agency of entering the market for SDR services is likely to be low, given
that many of the infrastructure requirements for entrant SDRs are shared by clearing agencies.
Clearing agencies already have the infrastructure necessary for capturing transaction records
from clearing members and might be able to leverage that preexisting infrastructure to provide
services as an SDR at lower incremental cost than other new SDRs. Because all clearing
transactions, like all other security-based swaps, must be reported to a registered SDR, there
would be a set of potentially captive transactions that clearing agencies could initially use to
vertically integrate into SDR services. 85
Entry into the SDR market by registered clearing agencies could potentially lower the
cost of SDR services if clearing agencies are able to transmit data to an affiliated SDR at a lower
cost relative to transmitting the same data to an independent SDR. The Commission believes
that this is likely to be true for clearing transactions, given that the clearing agency and the
affiliated SDR would have greater control over the reporting process relative to sending clearing
transaction data to an independent SDR. Even if registered clearing agencies did not enter the
market for SDR services, their ability to pursue a vertical integration strategy could motivate
incumbent SDRs to offer competitive service models.
However, the Commission recognizes that the entry of clearing-agency-affiliated SDRs
might not necessarily result in increased competition among SDRs or result in lower costs for
85

A registered clearing agency expanding to provide SDR services is an example of
forward vertical integration. In the context of the rules adopted today, SDRs “consume”
the data supplied by registered clearing agencies. Clearing agencies engage in forward
vertical integration by creating or acquiring the SDRs that consume the data that they
produce as a result of their clearing business.

43

SDR services. In an environment where registered clearing agencies with affiliated SDRs have
discretion to send their clearing transaction data to their affiliates, security-based swap market
participants who wish to submit their transactions to clearing may have reduced ability to direct
the reporting of the clearing transaction to an independent SDR. As a result, clearing-agencyaffiliated SDRs would not directly compete with independent SDRs on the basis of price or
quality, because they inherit their clearing agency affiliate’s market share. This might allow
clearing agency incumbents to exercise market power through their affiliated SDRs relative to
independent SDRs.
3.

Security-Based Swaps Trading by Non-U.S. Persons Within the United
States

Several broad economic considerations have informed the Commission’s approach to
identifying transactions between two non-U.S. persons that should be subject to certain Title VII
requirements. The Commission has taken into account the potential impact that rules already
adopted as part of the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release might have on competition between
U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons when they engage in security-based swap transactions with
non-U.S. persons, along with the implications of these competitive frictions for the ability of
market participants to obtain liquidity in a market that is predominantly over-the-counter. In
particular, competitive disparities could arise between U.S. dealing entities and foreign dealing
entities 86 using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office when serving unregistered non-U.S.
counterparties. In the absence of the rules adopted today, U.S. dealing entities and their agents

86

Throughout this release, a “dealing entity” refers to an entity that engages in securitybased swap dealing activity regardless of whether the volume of such activity exceeds the
de minimis threshold established by the Commission that would cause the entity to be a
“security-based swap dealer” and thus require the entity to register with the Commission
as a security-based swap dealer.

44

would bear the costs associated with regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements
when trading with unregistered non-U.S. counterparties, while foreign dealing entities that use
U.S.-based personnel to trade with the same unregistered non-U.S. counterparties would not bear
such regulatory costs if these foreign dealing entities are not subject to comparable regulatory
requirements in their home jurisdictions. Thus, these foreign dealing entities could offer
liquidity at a lower cost to unregistered non-U.S. persons thereby gaining a competitive
advantage over U.S. dealing entities.
Competitive disparities could also arise between U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons that
trade with foreign dealing entities that use U.S. personnel to arrange, negotiate, or execute
security-based swap transactions. 87 A transaction between an unregistered U.S. person and a
foreign dealing entity that uses U.S. personnel to arrange, negotiate, or execute the transaction is
subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination under existing Rule 908(a)(1)(i). In the
absence of newly adopted Rule 908(a)(1)(v), a transaction between an unregistered non-U.S.
person and the foreign dealing entity engaging in ANE activity would not be subject to
Regulation SBSR. This could create a competitive advantage for unregistered non-U.S. persons
over similarly situated U.S. persons when unregistered non-U.S. persons trade with foreign
dealing entities that engage in ANE activity. Such a foreign dealing entity might be able to offer

87

Throughout this release, a security-based swap transaction involving a non-U.S.-person
counterparty that, in connection with its dealing activity, has arranged, negotiated, or
executed using its personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, or the personnel of its
agent located in a U.S. branch or office, is referred to as an “ANE transaction”; the
arrangement, negotiation, and/or execution of such a security-based swap by personnel of
a non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office, or by the personnel of its agent
located in a U.S. branch or office are referred to as “ANE activities” or “engaging in
ANE activity”; and the personnel located in the U.S. branch or office of the foreign
dealing entity, or (if applicable) the personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or
office, are referred to as “U.S. personnel.”

45

liquidity to an unregistered non-U.S. person at a lower price than to an unregistered U.S. person,
because the foreign dealing entity that is engaging in ANE activity would not have to embed the
potential costs of regulatory reporting and public dissemination into the price offered to the
unregistered non-U.S. counterparty. By contrast, the price offered by that foreign dealing entity
to an unregistered U.S. counterparty likely would reflect these additional costs.
The Commission acknowledges, however, that applying Title VII rules based on the
location of personnel who engage in relevant conduct could provide incentives for these foreign
dealing entities to restructure their operations to avoid triggering requirements under Regulation
SBSR. For example, a foreign dealing entity could restrict its U.S. personnel from
intermediating transactions with non-U.S. persons or use agents who are located outside the
United States when engaging in security-based swap transactions with non-U.S. persons.
In addition, disparate treatment of transactions depending on whether they are arranged,
negotiated, or executed by personnel located in a U.S. branch or office could create
fragmentation among agents that may seek to provide services to foreign dealing entities. To the
extent that using agents with personnel located in a U.S. branch or office might result in
regulatory costs being imposed on foreign dealing entities, such entities might prefer and
primarily use agents located outside the United States, while U.S. dealers might continue to use
agents located in the United States.

Reporting by Registered Clearing Agencies
A.

Background

46

Section 13(m)(1)(F) of the Exchange Act 88 provides that parties to a security-based swap
(including agents of parties to a security-based swap) shall be responsible for reporting securitybased swap transaction information to the appropriate registered entity in a timely manner as
may be prescribed by the Commission. Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act 89 provides that
each security-based swap (whether cleared or uncleared) shall be reported to a registered SDR.
Section 13A(a)(3) of the Exchange Act 90 specifies the party obligated to report a security-based
swap that is not accepted for clearing by any clearing agency or derivatives clearing
organization. To implement these statutory provisions, the Commission in February 2015
adopted Rule 901(a) of Regulation SBSR, which designates the persons who must report all
security-based swaps except: (1) clearing transactions; 91 (2) security-based swaps that are
executed on a platform and that will be submitted to clearing; (3) transactions where there is no
U.S. person, registered security-based swap dealer, or registered major security-based swap
participant on either side; and (4) transactions where there is no registered security-based swap
dealer or registered major security-based swap participant on either side and there is a U.S.

including those used to establish prices for cleared products and those resulting from

Clearing Process for Security-Based Swaps

As discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release and the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release, two models of clearing—an agency model and a principal
model—are currently used in the swap markets. 93 In the agency model, which predominates in
the United States, a swap that is submitted to clearing—typically referred to in the industry as an
“alpha”—is, if accepted by the clearing agency, terminated and replaced with two new swaps,
known as the “beta” and “gamma.” One of the direct counterparties 94 to the alpha becomes a
direct counterparty to the beta, the other direct counterparty to the alpha becomes a direct
counterparty to the gamma, and the clearing agency becomes a direct counterparty to each of the
beta and the gamma. 95 This release uses the terms “alpha,” “beta,” and “gamma” in the same

Existing Rule 900(k) defines “direct counterparty” as “a person that is a primary obligor
on a security-based swap.”

95

If both direct counterparties to the alpha are clearing members, the direct counterparties
would submit the transaction to the clearing agency directly and the resulting beta would
be between the clearing agency and one clearing member, and the gamma would be
between the clearing agency and the other clearing member. The Commission
understands, however, that, if the direct counterparties to the alpha are a clearing member
and a non-clearing member (a “customer”), the customer’s side of the trade would be
submitted for clearing by a clearing member acting on behalf of the customer. When the
clearing agency accepts the alpha for clearing, one of the resulting swaps—in this case,
assume the beta—would be between the clearing agency and the customer, with the
customer’s clearing member acting as guarantor for the customer’s trade. The other
resulting swap—the gamma—would be between the clearing agency and the clearing
member that was a direct counterparty to the alpha. See, e.g., Byungkwon Lim and

way that the Commission understands they are used in the agency model of clearing in the U.S.
swap market. As noted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, an alpha is not a “clearing
transaction” under Regulation SBSR, even though it is submitted for clearing, because it does not
have a registered clearing agency as a direct counterparty. 96

Proposed Rules and General Summary of Comments

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed a
new subparagraph (2)(i) of existing97 Rule 901(a), which would designate a registered clearing
agency as the reporting side for all clearing transactions to which it is a counterparty. In its
capacity as the reporting side, the registered clearing agency would be permitted to select the
registered SDR to which it reports. 98

See 80 FR at 14599. This release does not address the application of Section 5 of the
Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. (“Securities Act”), to security-based swap
transactions that are intended to be submitted to clearing (i.e., alphas, in the agency
model of clearing). Rule 239 under the Securities Act, 17 CFR 230.239, provides an
exemption for certain security-based swap transactions involving an eligible clearing
agency from all provisions of the Securities Act, other than anti-fraud provisions of
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. This exemption does not apply to security-based
swap transactions not involving an eligible clearing agency, including a transaction that is
intended to be submitted to clearing, regardless of whether the security-based swaps
subsequently are cleared by an eligible clearing agency. See Exemptions for SecurityBased Swaps Issued By Certain Clearing Agencies, Securities Act Release No. 33-9308
(March 30, 2012), 77 FR 20536 (April 5, 2012).

Throughout this release, the Commission distinguishes “existing” provisions of
Regulation SBSR—i.e., provisions of Regulation SBSR that the Commission adopted in
the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release in February 2015—from provisions that the
Commission is adopting in this release.

98

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14746-47.

49

The Commission also proposed certain rules that would specify the reporting
requirements for life cycle events attendant to the clearing process. The determination by a
registered clearing agency of whether or not to accept an alpha for clearing is a life cycle event
of the alpha. 99 Existing subparagraph (i) of Rule 901(e)(1) generally requires the reporting side
for a security-based swap to report a life cycle event of that security-based swap, “except that the
reporting side shall not report whether or not a security-based swap has been accepted for
clearing.” Under existing Rule 901(e)(2), a life cycle event must be reported “to the entity to
which the original security-based swap transaction was reported.” In the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed a new subparagraph (ii) of Rule
901(e)(1) that would require a registered clearing agency to report to the registered SDR that
received or will receive the transaction report of the alpha (the “alpha SDR”) whether or not it
has accepted an alpha security-based swap for clearing. 100 The Commission also proposed to
amend the definition of “participant” in existing Rule 900(u) to include a registered clearing
agency that is required to report whether or not it accepts an alpha for clearing. 101
99

See id., 80 FR at 14746, 14748. A life cycle event is, with respect to a security-based
swap, any event that would result in a change in the information reported to a registered
security-based swap data repository under Rule 901(c), 901(d), or 901(i), including an
assignment or novation of the security-based swap; a partial or full termination of the
security-based swap; a change in the cash flows originally reported; for a security-based
swap that is not a clearing transaction, any change to the title or date of any master
agreement, collateral agreement, margin agreement, or any other agreement incorporated
by reference into the security-based swap contract; or a corporate action affecting a
security or securities on which the security-based swap is based (e.g., a merger, dividend,
stock split, or bankruptcy). Notwithstanding the above, a life cycle event shall not
include the scheduled expiration of the security-based swap, a previously described and
anticipated interest rate adjustment (such as a quarterly interest rate adjustment), or other
event that does not result in any change to the contractual terms of the security-based
swap. See 17 CFR 242.900(q).

If the registered clearing agency does not know the identity of the alpha SDR, the
registered clearing agency would be unable to report to the alpha SDR whether or not it accepted
the alpha transaction for clearing, as required by proposed Rule 901(e)(1)(ii). Therefore, the
Commission proposed a new subparagraph (3) of Rule 901(a), which would require the platform
or reporting side for a security-based swap that has been submitted to clearing to promptly
provide the relevant registered clearing agency with the identity of the alpha SDR and the
transaction ID of the alpha transaction that will be or has been submitted to clearing. 102
The Commission requested and received comment on a wide range of issues related to
these proposed amendments. Four commenters generally supported the Commission’s proposal
to require the registered clearing agency to report clearing transactions and to allow it to select
the SDR to which it reports. 103 One of these commenters noted that a clearing agency is “the
sole party who holds the complete and accurate record of transactions and positions” for clearing
transactions. 104 Another commenter agreed, noting that alternative reporting workflows “could
require a person who does not have information about [a] clearing transaction at the time of its
creation to report that transaction.” 105 The commenter expressed the view that the Commission’s
proposal for reporting clearing transactions “is simple in that the same party in each and every
transaction will be the party with the reporting requirement,” and that this approach would
eliminate confusion “as to who has the obligation to report the initial trades and different life-

cycle events.” 106 Two commenters expressed the view that clearing agencies can leverage
existing reporting processes and the existing infrastructure that they have in place with market
participants and vendors to report clearing transactions. 107 A third commenter observed that
requiring clearing agencies to report clearing transactions would be “efficient, cost effective and
promote[] global data consistency,” because clearing agencies already report transactions under
swap data reporting rules established by the CFTC and certain foreign jurisdictions, such as the
European Union and Canada. 108
However, one commenter opposed assigning the reporting duty to the registered clearing
agency, arguing instead that the reporting side for the alpha transaction should be the reporting
side for any subsequent clearing transactions. 109 Another commenter expressed support for the
Commission’s proposal to require registered clearing agencies to report betas and gammas, but
disagreed with the Commission’s proposal to permit registered clearing agencies to choose the
registered SDR that receives these reports. 110

for all clearing transactions to which it is a counterparty. 111 In its capacity as the reporting side,
the registered clearing agency is permitted to select the registered SDR to which it reports.
The Commission believes that, because a registered clearing agency creates the clearing
transactions to which it is a counterparty, the registered clearing agency is in the best position to
provide complete and accurate information to a registered SDR about the clearing transactions
resulting from the security-based swaps that it clears. Two commenters noted that swap clearing
agencies currently report clearing transactions to CFTC-registered swap data repositories, thus
evidencing their ability to report clearing transactions. 112 The Commission’s determination to
assign to registered clearing agencies the duty to report clearing transactions should promote
efficiency in the reporting process under Regulation SBSR by leveraging these existing
workflows.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission considered
three alternatives to requiring the clearing agency to report clearing transactions: (1) utilize the
reporting hierarchy in existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii); (2) modify that reporting hierarchy to place
registered clearing agencies above other non-registered persons, but below registered securitybased swap dealers and major security-based swap participants; and (3) require the reporting side

111

In its capacity as a reporting side, a registered clearing agency must report all of the
primary trade information and secondary trade information required by existing Rules
901(c) and 901(d), respectively, for each security-based swap to which it is a
counterparty. See infra Section III(F) (discussing the UICs that a registered clearing
agency must report).

112

See ICE Letter at 5; LCH.Clearnet Letter at 8. The Commission notes that the CFTC has
adopted rules that would impose reporting responsibilities on these clearing agencies
similar to those that the Commission is adopting today. See Amendments to Swap Data
Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Cleared Swaps, Final Rule, 80 FR 41736
(June 27, 2016).

of the alpha to report both the beta and the gamma. 113 The Commission assessed each
alternative and expressed the preliminary view that none would be as efficient and reliable as
assigning the reporting duty to the registered clearing agency. 114 The Commission noted that
each of the three alternatives could place the duty to report the clearing transaction on a person
who does not have information about the clearing transaction at the time of its creation; to
discharge its duty, this person would have to obtain necessary transaction information from the
registered clearing agency or from a counterparty to the registered clearing agency. 115
One commenter urged the Commission to adopt Alternative 3—i.e., to designate the
reporting side for the alpha as the reporting side for the beta and gamma. 116 The commenter
stated that the non-clearing-agency counterparties to the beta and gamma will always obtain
information regarding their clearing transactions as a part of the clearing process. 117 The
commenter suggested, therefore, that Alternative 3 would not result in unnecessary data transfers
prior to reporting. In support of Alternative 3, the commenter noted that an alpha counterparty
could rely on a “middleware reporting agent [who] could perform all steps necessary to report an
alpha transaction as well as the associated beta and gamma security-based swaps in a matter of

See id. at 5, 13. The commenter stated that a clearing agency “must, as a matter of
course, send the cleared SBS trade record straight through to the sides of the trade or, if
relevant, any non-affiliated reporting side (e.g., the platform or reporting agent). In other
words, for the clearing agency to transmit a message indicating that a trade has or has not
been accepted for clearing (a necessary last step to conclude cleared transactions between
the clearinghouse and the parties to the beta and gamma trades) there is no ‘extra step.’”

54

seconds, while a clearing agency could, at best, perform only the last two steps.” 118
Furthermore, while endorsing Alternative 3, the commenter also believed that Alternatives 1 and
2 would be preferable to the Commission’s proposed approach. 119
Finally, the commenter suggested a fourth alternative to address the concern of an alpha
counterparty having to report a clearing transaction to which it is not a counterparty. The
commenter suggested that “the platform would remain the reporting side for all platformexecuted trades while for bilateral or off platform cleared transactions, the reporting side would
be the clearing agency. However, the clearing agency would be required to submit beta and
gamma trade records to the alpha SDR (which would be determined by the alpha trade reporting
side and not the clearing agency).” 120
The Commission believes that assigning reporting duties for clearing transactions to
registered clearing agencies will be more efficient and reliable than any of the alternatives
discussed in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release or raised by the commenter.
Because each of these alternatives could assign the reporting duty to a person who does not have
information about the clearing transaction at the time of its creation, the person with the
reporting duty would have to rely on the clearing agency, directly or indirectly, to provide it with
the information to be reported:

“better able to ensure the accuracy of trade records and the linkage between alpha, beta,
and gamma trade records”).

119

See id. at 13 (“these other alternatives, relative to the Proposal, encourage competition
based on quality of service and cost and the rule of reporting agents and are more likely
to result in outcomes whereby the same SDR will receive alpha, beta, and gamma
trades”).

•

Alternative 1 would be to utilize the existing reporting hierarchy in Regulation
SBSR. Since a registered clearing agency is not a registered security-based swap
dealer or registered major security-based swap participant, it would occupy the
lowest rung in the hierarchy. Therefore, in any clearing transaction between a
registered clearing agency and a registered security-based swap dealer or
registered major security-based swap participant, the registered security-based
swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant would incur the
reporting duty. However, the registered security-based swap dealer or registered
major security-based swap participant would be dependent on the registered
clearing agency to supply the information that must be reported. 121

•

Alternative 2 is similar to Alternative 1 in that the registered security-based swap
dealer or registered major security-based swap participant with the reporting duty
would be dependent on the registered clearing agency to supply the information
that would be reported.

•

Alternative 3 would designate the reporting side for the alpha as the reporting side
for the beta and gamma. Under this alternative, the alpha reporting side would
need to obtain information from the clearing agency to report its own clearing
transaction. The alpha reporting side also would need to obtain, either from the

121

For any clearing transaction between a registered clearing agency and a non-registered
person that is not guaranteed by a registered security-based swap dealer or registered
major security-based swap participant, the reporting hierarchy in existing Rule
901(a)(2)(i) would require the sides to select the reporting side. In these circumstances, it
is likely that the counterparties would select the registered clearing agency as the
reporting side for the clearing transactions. Assigning the duty to report clearing
transactions directly to the clearing agency is consistent with the Commission’s objective
of minimizing the possibility that the reporting obligation would be imposed on a nonregistered counterparty. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14598.

56

non-reporting side or from the registered clearing agency, information about the
clearing transaction of the alpha’s non-reporting side. The Commission believes
that Alternative 3 would be difficult to implement operationally and could create
confidentiality concerns, because it does not offer a mechanism for reporting of
subsequent clearing positions created by the registered clearing agency in the
account of the non-reporting side of the alpha. 122
•

Under the fourth alternative, 123 while the Commission concurs with the approach
of requiring the registered clearing agency to report the resulting beta and gamma
transactions, the Commission believes that the registered clearing agency, when it
has the duty to report security-based swaps, should be able to choose the
registered SDR to which it reports. 124

In general, the Commission believes that Regulation SBSR should not assign reporting
obligations to persons who lack direct access to the information necessary to make the report.
With respect to clearing transactions, a person who lacked direct access to the necessary
information would be obligated to obtain the information from the clearing agency or another
122

Assume, under Alternative 3, that P and Q execute a security-based swap (S1) and submit
it to a registered clearing agency (CA). P is the reporting side of the S1 alpha. When CA
accepts the alpha for clearing, P would then have to report the beta between P and CA
and the gamma between Q and CA (gamma1). Further assume that Q executes a second
transaction (S2) in the same product as S1 with R, and that R is the reporting side for S2.
If CA accepts S2 for clearing, R then must report the beta between R and CA and the
gamma between Q and CA (gamma2). In its next netting cycle, CA nets together
gamma1 and gamma2 to create a new security-based swap representing the net open
position (NOP) of Q in that product. Under Alternative 3, it is unclear who should report
NOP as between P and R, because NOP is a security-based swap resulting from the
netting of security-based swaps involving both P and R. Furthermore, Q likely will not
want P or R to know of its additional activity in that product with other counterparties.

party who has access to that information to discharge its reporting duties. Placing the reporting
duty on the non-clearing-agency side would create additional reporting steps and each extra
reporting step could introduce some possibility for discrepancy, error, or delay. The
Commission believes that discrepancies, errors, and delays are less likely to occur if the duty to
report clearing transactions is assigned to registered clearing agencies directly, because there
would be no intermediate steps where data would have to be transferred between parties before it
is sent to a registered SDR. Therefore, the Commission is adopting Rule 901(a)(2)(i) as
proposed. A registered clearing agency has complete information about all clearing transactions
to which it is a counterparty. This includes not only betas and gammas that arise from clearing
alphas, but also security-based swaps that result from the clearing agency netting together betas
and gammas of the same person in the same product to create new open positions in successive
netting cycles. Under the alternatives discussed above, a person other than the registered
clearing agency would have to obtain information from the clearing agency to report the clearing
transactions—not just once, to report the initial beta and gamma, but potentially with every
netting cycle of the registered clearing agency. This further increases the risks that there could
be discrepancies, errors, or delays in reporting new clearing transactions as they are created.
The commenter who endorsed Alternative 3 also argued that “[t]he Proposal’s failure to
acknowledge the efficiency benefits and reduced costs that result from the presence of
middleware reporting agents is a serious defect.” 125 To the contrary, the Commission has

processing services despite noting such benefits in the Regulation SBSR Final Rule”) and

they were properly accounted for by the Commission . . . would have provided additional

above, including the role that agents might play in reporting security-based swap transactions
under these different alternatives. 126 The Commission notes that, while Regulation SBSR
permits the use of agents to carry out reporting duties, it does not require the use of an agent.
C.

Choice of Registered SDR for Clearing Transactions

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission considered
whether, if a registered clearing agency is assigned the duty to report clearing transactions, the
clearing agency should be permitted to choose the registered SDR to which it reports or whether
it should be required to report them to the alpha SDR. 127 The Commission proposed to allow a
registered clearing agency to choose the registered SDR to which it reports clearing
transactions. 128 The Commission recognized that this approach might result in beta and gamma
security-based swaps being reported to a registered SDR other than the alpha SDR, thereby
requiring the Commission to link these trades together across SDRs. 129
Some commenters supported the Commission’s proposal to allow the registered clearing
agency to select the registered SDR to which it reports. 130 Other commenters, however,
recommended that the Commission require the registered clearing agency to report the beta and

gamma transactions to the alpha SDR. 131 These commenters generally believed that requiring
beta and gamma security-based swaps to be reported to the alpha SDR would reduce data
fragmentation and enhance the Commission’s ability to obtain a complete and accurate
understanding of the security-based swap market. 132
One commenter endorsed the view that clearing should be considered a life cycle event of
the alpha transaction, and that the clearing agency should be required to report the termination of
the alpha, as well as the beta and gamma, to the alpha SDR. 133 In this commenter’s view,
“[m]aintaining all records related to an alpha trade in a single SB SDR will help to ensure that
regulators are able to efficiently access and analyze all reports related to an SB swap regardless
of where or how the transaction was executed and whether it is cleared.” 134
Another commenter noted that, in its experience with CFTC swap data reporting rules,
clearing agencies “generally send beta and gamma records to an affiliated SDR” even though
other market participants generally prefer using an SDR not affiliated with the clearing
agency. 135 In this commenter’s view, clearing agencies do not “provide services or fees that

131

See Better Markets Letter at 2, 4-5 (“we are concerned that allowing the clearing agency
to report data to a different SDR than the one to which the initial alpha trade was reported
could cause potential complications, such as double-counting or bifurcated data”); DTCC
Letter at 2, 6; Markit Letter at 6.

132

See id. See also DTCC Letter at 5 (predicting that the Commission “would encounter
various implementation challenges” in linking alpha security-based swaps to the
associated beta and gamma transactions that had been reported to different SDRs because
SDRs might “store, maintain, and furnish data to regulators in formats different from
other trade repositories”).

make them competitive as SDRs for all swap trade records.” 136 The commenter believed that the
Commission’s proposed approach would result in tying of clearing services to SDR services and
create a market for SDR and post-trade processing services that is unresponsive to market
forces. 137 The commenter also stated that “middleware reporting agents can offer an even lower
price” than registered clearing agencies for reporting beta and gamma transactions. 138
Regulation SBSR generally allows the person with a duty to report to choose the
registered SDR to which it reports. 139 This approach is designed to promote efficiency by
allowing the person with the reporting duty to select the registered SDR based on greatest ease of
use, the lowest fees, or other factors that are relevant to the person with whom the duty rests. As
noted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, a clearing transaction is an independent
security-based swap and not a life cycle event of an alpha security-based swap that is submitted
to clearing. 140 Under Rule 901(a)(2)(i), as adopted herein, a registered clearing agency is the
reporting side for all clearing transactions to which it is a counterparty; because the registered

137

See id. at 2-3, 12 (stating that, if a registered clearing agency is permitted to choose the
registered SDR to which it reports clearing transactions, the clearing agency “can more
easily leverage a dominant clearing agency position to gain a dominant SDR positon by
selecting an affiliated SDR as its SDR of choice for beta and gamma trades”).

138

See id. at 4, 7-8 (noting that, “[i]n contrast to currently registered SBS clearing agencies

repositories globally and have achieved economies of scale with respect to the straightthrough processing of cleared swaps across numerous clearinghouses and regulatory
reporting regimes”).

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14597-98 (“The reporting side may
select the registered SDR to which it makes the required report”).

140

See 80 FR at 14599, n. 291. However, the determination by a registered clearing agency
of whether or not to accept the alpha for clearing is a life cycle event of the alpha
transaction. As discussed above, new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) requires a registered clearing
agency to report these life cycle events to the alpha SDR.

61

clearing agency has the duty to report, it also has the ability to choose the registered SDR. The
Commission considered requiring the registered clearing agency to report the beta and gamma to
the alpha SDR. But had the Commission done so, the registered clearing agency would be
required to report clearing transactions to a registered SDR that might not offer the clearing
agency what it believes to be the most efficient or convenient means of discharging its reporting
duty, as others with a reporting duty are permitted to do. As noted in Section XIII(A), infra, a
clearing agency may be able to realize efficiency gains through vertical integration of clearing
and SDR services and may choose to use an affiliated SDR. However, if an independent SDR or
middleware reporting agent offers a competitive service model that provides a clearing agency
with a duty to report a more efficient or cost-effective means of fulfilling its reporting
obligations, the registered clearing agency may choose to use those instead.
One commenter expressed the view that requiring the beta and gamma to be reported to
the alpha SDR would help to ensure that regulators are able to efficiently access and analyze all
reports related to a security-based swap. 141 The commenter also stated that a clearing agency
will need to incur costs to establish connections with alpha SDRs for purposes of reporting
whether or not the clearing agency has accepted the alpha for clearing. 142 The commenter
cautioned, furthermore, that “[t]he proposed process assumes that, in all instances, the
transaction ID provided to the clearing agency would be accurate.” 143 The commenter stated that

141

See DTCC Letter at 4. See also Markit Letter at 13 (raising as an alternative to the
Commission’s proposed approach that the Commission should require a clearing agency
to report the beta and gamma to the alpha SDR).

142

Id. The commenter added that it has encountered issues under the CFTC’s swap
reporting framework when transaction IDs have been reported inconsistently for the same
trade. See id.

only the alpha SDR would be able to ascertain whether the alpha transaction ID is valid based on
its existing inventory. 144 The commenter concluded that, “[r]ather than establishing a complex
reporting process for clearing transactions and potentially introducing data quality issues . . . the
Commission [should] consider preservation of high quality data and ready access to a full audit
trail as the paramount concerns that should govern the choice of SB SDR for clearing
transactions.” 145 Finally, the commenter questioned the ease with which the Commission would
be able to track related transactions across SDRs through the transaction ID, stating that “the
Commission would likely be forced to expend significant resources harmonizing data sets from
multiple SDRs, thereby hindering the Commission’s ready access to a comprehensive audit
trail.” 146
The Commission has considered the commenter’s arguments but continues to believe that
it is appropriate to allow a registered clearing agency to choose the registered SDR to which it
reports. Although the commenter is correct that Regulation SBSR will require a registered
clearing agency to report to the alpha SDR whether or not the clearing agency accepts the alpha
for clearing, this does not necessarily mean that the clearing agency would find it more efficient
or convenient to make initial (and life cycle event) reports of clearing transactions to the alpha
SDR. Betas, gammas, and transactions that arise from subsequent clearing cycles are
independent security-based swaps. It is possible that a registered clearing agency might
conclude that a registered SDR other than the alpha SDR is better suited for reporting these new
transactions. Of course, if the registered clearing agency determines that reporting beta and

63

gamma security-based swaps to the alpha SDR is, in fact, equally convenient or more convenient
than connecting and reporting to a different SDR, the registered clearing agency would be free to
make this choice under new Rule 901(a)(2)(i).
The Commission shares the commenter’s concern about ensuring that a termination
reported by a registered clearing agency to an alpha SDR includes a valid transaction ID of an
alpha held by that SDR and acknowledges the commenter’s observation that this might not
always occur in the CFTC’s swap reporting regime. Because Rule 901(g) requires a registered
SDR to assign a transaction ID to each security-based swap (or establish or endorse a
methodology for transaction IDs to be assigned by third parties), the registered SDR should
know the transaction ID of every security-based swap reported to it on a mandatory basis. If a
registered clearing agency submits a termination report with a transaction ID that the registered
SDR cannot match to an alpha transaction report, the registered SDR’s policies and procedures
must specify how this situation will be addressed. 147 The SDR’s policies and procedures could
provide, for example, that the registered SDR will hold the termination report from the registered
clearing agency in a pending state until either (1) the registered SDR obtains a valid transaction
ID from the registered clearing agency (if the registered clearing agency originally had reported
an incorrect transaction ID); or (2) the registered SDR determines that it can otherwise match the
termination report against the correct alpha (if the clearing agency reported the correct
transaction ID but the correct transaction ID did not for some reason appear in the report of the
147

See Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.13n-5(b)(1)(i) (requiring
every SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed for the reporting of complete and accurate transaction data); Rule 13n5(b)(1)(iii) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.13n-5(b)(1)(iii) (requiring every SDR to
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
satisfy itself that the transaction data that has been submitted to the SDR is complete and
accurate).

alpha transaction). Furthermore, in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the
Commission acknowledged that it might not be possible for a registered SDR to determine
immediately whether a particular transaction ID is invalid because a registered clearing agency
could report whether or not it has accepted an alpha for clearing before the registered SDR has
received a transaction report for that alpha. 148 The Commission stated that, in such case, the
registered SDR should address this possibility in its policies and procedures, which could
provide, for example, that the registered SDR would hold a registered clearing agency’s report of
the disposition of an alpha in a pending state until the registered SDR receives the transaction
report of the alpha; the registered SDR could then disseminate as a single report the securitybased swap transaction information and the fact that the alpha had been terminated. 149 Because
the reporting side for an alpha generally has 24 hours from the time of execution to report the
transaction, 150 the duration of the pending state generally should not exceed 24 hours after
receipt of the clearing agency’s report of whether or not it has accepted the alpha for clearing.
The Commission staff intends to evaluate whether the termination reports submitted by
registered clearing agencies to an alpha SDR are appropriately matched to the alpha.
The Commission also believes that the adopted approach of allowing a registered clearing
agency to choose the registered SDR to which it reports clearing transactions is, unlike any
alternatives considered, 151 properly designed to account for the possibility that alphas could be
reported to several different SDRs. Consider the following example:

•

On Day 1, Party A executes three alpha transactions (T1, T2, and T3) in Product
XYZ.

•

T1 is reported to SDR1. T2 is reported to SDR2. T3 is reported to SDR3.

•

All three alpha transactions are submitted to Clearing Agency K and accepted for
clearing.

•

Clearing Agency K creates Beta1 and Gamma1 after terminating T1, Beta2 and
Gamma2 after terminating T2, and Beta3 and Gamma3 after terminating T3.

•

Assume that Party A is the direct counterparty to Beta1, Beta2, and Beta3.

If, as suggested by some commenters, the Commission required Beta1 and Gamma1 to be
reported to SDR1, Beta2 and Gamma2 to be reported to SDR2, and Beta 3 and Gamma3 to be
reported to SDR3, operational difficulties would result when Clearing Agency K nets Beta1,
Beta2, and Beta3 as part of its settlement cycle because each of the Betas has been reported to a
different SDR.
•

At the end of Day 1, Clearing Agency K nets Beta1, Beta2, and Beta3 together to
create a net open position (NOP) of Party A in Product XYZ.

•

As part of the netting process, Clearing Agency K terminates Beta1, Beta2, and
Beta 3. Under new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), Clearing Agency K would have to report
the termination of Beta1 to SDR1, the termination of Beta2 to SDR2, and the
termination of Beta3 to SDR3.

•

NOP is a new security-based swap and must be reported to a registered SDR.

Under the commenters’ alternate approach, it is not apparent which registered SDR
should receive the report of NOP, because NOP incorporates transactions that were originally
reported to three different registered SDRs. Reporting NOP to each of SDR1, SDR2, and SDR3

66

serves no purpose because the same position would be reflected in three separate SDRs and
could lead to confusion about the true size of the security-based swap market.
The Commission also disagrees with the commenter’s view that the Commission’s ability
to understand or analyze reported data would be impaired by permitting registered clearing
agencies to select the registered SDR for reporting clearing transactions. 152 The Commission
acknowledges that it will likely be necessary for the Commission’s staff to link an alpha to the
associated beta and gamma across different SDRs to obtain a complete understanding of
transactions that clear. The Commission believes, however, that there are sufficient tools to
facilitate this effort. Existing Rule 901(d)(10), for example, requires reporting of the “prior
transaction ID” if a security-based swap arises from the allocation, termination, novation, or
assignment of one or more prior security-based swaps. Therefore, the Commission believes that
it is appropriate to allow a registered clearing agency to choose where to report the beta and
gamma, even if it chooses to report to a registered SDR other than the alpha SDR.
The Commission acknowledges that permitting a registered clearing agency to report
clearing transactions to a registered SDR other than the alpha SDR also could increase
complexity for market participants who would prefer to have reports of all of their security-based
swaps in a single SDR. 153 The Commission notes that SDRs are required to “collect and
maintain accurate SBS transaction data so that relevant authorities can access and analyze the
data from secure, central locations, thereby putting them in a better position to monitor for
potential market abuse and risks to financial stability.” 154 The Commission notes, in addition,

67

that Regulation SBSR permits a security-based swap counterparty to make non-mandatory
reports of security-based swaps to an SDR of its choice (if the SDR is willing to accept them). 155
Thus, to the extent that SDRs are willing to accept such non-mandatory reports, non-clearingagency counterparties of clearing transactions would have a mechanism for consolidating reports
of their transactions in a single SDR if such counterparties wished to do so.
The Commission does not agree with the assertion made by one commenter that
permitting a registered clearing agency to report clearing transactions to a registered SDR of its
choice necessarily results in the tying of clearing services to SDR services. 156 Under the rules
being adopted today, the user of clearing services—i.e., an alpha counterparty that clears a
security-based swap at a registered clearing agency—has no obligation to report the subsequent
clearing transaction.
Because Regulation SBSR does not require an alpha counterparty to have ongoing
obligations to report subsequent information about the clearing transaction, such as life cycle
events or daily marks, to the registered SDR that is selected by the clearing agency, alpha
counterparties will not be required to establish connections to multiple SDRs and to incur fees
for reporting information to those SDRs.
D.

Scope of Clearing Agencies Covered by Final Rules

Proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) would assign clearing agencies a duty to report under
Regulation SBSR based on their registration status, not on their principal place of business.
Thus, a foreign clearing agency, like a U.S. clearing agency, would be required to report all
155

See Rule 900(r) (defining a “non-mandatory report” as any information provided to a
registered SDR by or on behalf of a counterparty other than as required by Regulation
SBSR).

68

security-based swaps of which it is a counterparty if it is registered with the Commission.
Commenters had differing recommendations with respect to the scope of clearing agencies that
should be covered by proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(ii). Two commenters expressed the view that the
rule should apply to all registered clearing agencies, regardless of their principal place of
business. 157 A third commenter agreed that a registered clearing agency with its principal place
of business inside the United States should be required to report all clearing transactions, but
took a different view with respect to a registered clearing agency with its principal place of
business outside the United States; the non-U.S. clearing agency, according to the commenter,
should be required to report only clearing transactions involving a U.S. person. 158
Final Rule 901(a)(2)(i) assigns the reporting obligation for a clearing transaction to a
registered clearing agency that is a counterparty to the transaction. The rule applies to any
registered clearing agency without regard to the location of its principal place of business. The
Commission generally believes that, if a person registers with the Commission as a clearing
agency, it should assume the same obligations as all other persons that register as clearing
agencies. 159 Conversely, new Rule 901(a)(2)(i) does not apply to unregistered clearing agencies
157

See LCH.Clearnet Letter at 9 (“Registered clearing agencies are best placed to report
cleared transactions. Assigning these obligations to other participants for foreign
domiciled clearing agencies will needlessly complicate the reporting landscape”);
ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 24.

158

See ICE Letter at 5.

159

The Commission notes, however, that the reporting duty of a registered clearing agency
under new Rule 901(a)(2)(i) must be read in connection with Rule 908(a), amendments to
which the Commission is adopting today. In other words, a registered clearing agency
must report only those security-based swaps that fall within Rule 908(a). It is likely that
many clearing transactions of a registered clearing agency having its principal place of
business outside the United States would not fall within any prong of Rule 908(a) and
thus would not have be reported by the registered clearing agency pursuant to Rule
901(a)(2)(i). For example, a clearing transaction between a registered clearing agency
and a non-U.S. person that is not registered with the Commission as a security-based
69

(e.g., persons that act as clearing agencies outside the United States that are not required to, and
choose not to, register with the Commission).
A fourth commenter requested the Commission to clarify whether clearing agencies that
are “deemed registered” under the Exchange Act are “registered clearing agencies” for purposes
of Regulation SBSR, which would trigger the duty to report clearing transactions even before
they complete a full registration process with the Commission. 160 The Commission previously
has stated that each clearing agency that is deemed registered is required “to comply with all
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to
Registered Clearing Agencies.” 161 Pursuant to this guidance, a “deemed registered” clearing
agency is required to comply with all requirements of Regulation SBSR that are applicable to
registered clearing agencies. 162
E.

Reporting Under the Principal Model of Clearing

Two commenters acknowledged that the agency model of clearing predominates in the
United States but requested that the Commission clarify the application of Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) to

swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, and who is not utilizing U.S.
personnel to arrange, negotiate, or execute the clearing transaction, would not fall within
any prong of Rule 908(a).

162

This commenter also sought guidance regarding the reporting obligations relating to a
security-based swap between a clearing agency that has been exempted from registration
by the Commission and a counterparty. See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 26. The
Commission does not believe that this issue is ripe for consideration. The Commission
anticipates that it would consider this issue if it exempts from registration a clearing
agency that acts as a central counterparty for security-based swaps.

70

security-based swaps cleared under the principal model of clearing. 163 One of these commenters
recommended that the Commission require all clearing transactions to be reported according to
the workflows used in the agency model of clearing. 164 By contrast, the other commenter argued
that “a set of clearing transactions should be reported in accordance with the actual applied
clearing model.” 165
The Commission concurs with the latter commenter: Regulation SBSR requires
reporting of clearing transactions in accordance with the actual clearing model. Under the rules
adopted today, any security-based swap that is a clearing transaction—i.e., that has a registered
clearing agency as a direct counterparty—must be reported by the registered clearing agency
pursuant to new Rule 901(a)(2)(i). 166 If a security-based swap is not a clearing transaction, it
must be reported by the person designated by the other provisions of Rule 901(a).
F.

Clearing Transactions and Unique Identification Codes

Rules 901(c) and 901(d), respectively, require the person with the duty to report to report
all of the primary trade information and secondary trade information for each security-based
swap to which it is a counterparty. Noting that existing Rule 901(d)(2) requires the reporting
163

See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 25 (“Although we do not have reason to believe the principal
model will become prevalent in the U.S. market, it will be used in a percentage of SBS
reportable under SBSR especially by non-U.S. parties registered as SBSDs or MSBSPs
which may be the direct or indirect counterparty to a SBS. Providing additional guidance
on the treatment of SBS cleared via the principal model would be useful to promote data
accuracy and consistency”); ICE Letter at 2-3.

164

See ICE Letter at 3 (arguing that reporting principal clearing workflows is unnecessarily
complicated and costly and “results in a duplicative representation of cleared records
submitted to repositories”).

165

ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 26.

166

Existing Rule 902(c)(6) provides that a registered SDR shall not disseminate any
information regarding a clearing transaction that arises from the acceptance of a securitybased swap for clearing by a registered clearing agency or that results from netting other
clearing transactions.

71

side to report, as applicable, the branch ID, broker ID, execution agent ID, trader ID, and trading
desk ID of the direct counterparty on the reporting side, the Commission in the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release asked whether these types of unique identification codes
(“UICs”) 167 would ever be applicable to a registered clearing agency when it incurs the duty to
report a clearing transaction. 168 Three commenters suggested that these UICs are not applicable
to clearing transactions and should not have to be reported by the clearing agency. 169
The Commission agrees. In its capacity as a central counterparty for security-based
swaps, a registered clearing agency does not engage in market-facing activity and thus would not
utilize a branch, broker, execution agent, trader, or trading desk to effect security-based swap
transactions. Therefore, these UICs are not applicable to clearing transactions, and a registered
clearing agency need not report any UICs pursuant to Rule 901(d)(2). 170

167

See Rule 900(qq) (defining “UIC” as “a unique identification code assigned to a person,
unit of a person, product, or transaction”).

168

See 80 FR at 14752.

169

See DTCC Letter at 16; ICE Letter at 4; LCH.Clearnet Letter at 8.

170

The Commission also deems these UICs “not applicable” to the non-clearing agency side
of a clearing transaction; therefore, under Rule 906(a), a registered SDR need not query a
non-clearing-agency participant for these UICs with respect to a clearing transaction, and
the participant need not provide these UICs to the registered SDR with respect to any
clearing transaction. As the Commission has previously stated when exempting most
types of clearing transactions from public dissemination, clearing transactions “are
mechanical steps taken pursuant to the rules of the clearing agency.” Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14610. See also Rule 902(c)(6). Thus, the Commission does
not believe that clearing transactions can meaningfully be said to involve a market-facing
subdivision or agent of the counterparty such as the branch, trading desk, individual
trader, broker, or execution agent. To the extent that there was meaningful participation
by a branch, trading desk, individual trader, broker, or execution agent on behalf of the
counterparty, these UICs must be provided in connection with the original alpha
transaction—either in its capacity as the reporting side (in which case it would be
required to provide these UICs pursuant to Rule 901(d)(2)) or as the non-reporting side
(in which case it would be required to provide these UICs pursuant to Rule 906(a) if it
were a participant of the registered SDR). Cf. DTCC Letter at 16 (while not specifically

G.

Reporting Whether an Alpha Transaction is Accepted for Clearing

Existing Rule 901(e)(1)(i) addresses the reporting requirements for most life cycle events
and assigns the reporting duty for reporting those life cycle events to the reporting side of the
original transaction. However, Rule 901(e)(1)(i) specifically provides that “the reporting side
shall not report whether or not a security-based swap has been accepted for clearing.” In the
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed a new
subparagraph (ii) to Rule 901(e)(1) that would require a registered clearing agency that receives
an alpha to report to the alpha SDR whether or not it has accepted the alpha for clearing. 171
Two commenters expressed support for proposed Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), noting that clearing
agencies would be well-positioned to issue a termination report for the alpha and subsequently to
report the beta and gamma to a registered SDR. 172 However, two commenters objected to
proposed Rule 901(e)(1)(ii). One of these commenters argued that proposed Rule 901(e)(1)(ii)
was unnecessary because the counterparties to the alpha would learn of the disposition of the
alpha from the clearing agency in the normal course of business, and could report this
information to the alpha SDR. 173 This commenter further asserted that concerns regarding “data

addressing the question of whether these UICs should be reported for the non-clearingagency side of a clearing transaction, questioning whether the non-reporting side should
be required to report these UICs for any transaction).
171

See infra Section III(J) (discussing when an alpha has been rejected from clearing).

172

See ICE Letter at 5 (“Upon acceptance for clearing, CAs should be required to report the
alpha termination to the appropriate SDR storing the alpha swap”); ISDA/SIFMA Letter
at 24 (noting that the proposal would prevent the “orphaning of alphas” that currently
occurs under the CFTC swap data reporting rules). Cf. DTCC Letter at 5-6, 17
(expressing support for proposed Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), but in the context of DTCC’s view,
discussed supra, that clearing agencies also should be required to report betas and
gammas to the alpha SDR).

173

See Markit Letter at 5 (“the clearing agency must, as a matter of course, send the cleared
SBS trade record straight through to the sides to the trade or, if relevant, any non73

discrepancies, errors, or delays” cited by the Commission in support of proposed Rule
901(e)(1)(ii) were unfounded and could be addressed, if necessary, through rulemaking or
enforcement action to encourage clearing agencies to provide accurate and timely data to
platforms and counterparties about clearing dispositions. 174 Similarly, the second commenter
that objected to proposed Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) argued that the “party that originally reported the
alpha trade is best placed to report the result of clearing” 175 and that clearing agencies should not
have to incur costs associated with establishing connectivity to alpha SDRs. 176 This commenter
also questioned why the Commission’s approach to the reporting of cleared transactions differed
from its approach to the reporting of prime brokerage transactions, 177 where the Commission is
requiring that the person who reported the initial leg of a prime brokerage transaction (not the

affiliated reporting side (e.g., the platform or reporting agent). In other words, for the
clearing agency to transmit a message indicating that a trade has or has not been accepted
for clearing (a necessary last step to conclude cleared transactions between the
clearinghouse and the parties to the beta and gamma trades), there is no ‘extra step.’
Moreover, the processing of cleared trades is nearly instantaneous, resulting in no
operationally significant delay”).
174

See id. This commenter also argued that Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) would be unnecessary if the
Commission permitted the reporting side of the alpha to select the SDR that will receive
reports of the associated beta and gamma. See id. at 15.

175

LCH.Clearnet Letter at 8.

176

See id. at 8-10 (arguing that the incremental costs of assigning the reporting obligation to
the alpha reporting side would be small compared to the costs associated with registered
clearing agencies having to establish connectivity to alpha SDRs). The Commission
notes that one of the commenters that supported the general approach of requiring
registered clearing agencies to incur reporting duties argued also that “CAs [i.e., clearing
agencies] should not incur SDR fees to report alpha termination messages. Requiring
CAs to become a full ‘participant’ of alpha SDRs, is unnecessary and overly burdensome
for CAs.” ICE Letter at 6.

prime broker) must report any life cycle event resulting from whether the prime broker accepts
or rejects that transaction. 178
After carefully considering the comments received, the Commission is adopting
subparagraph (ii) of Rule 901(e)(1) as proposed. Final Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) is consistent with the
Commission’s general approach of assigning the reporting obligation for a security-based swap
transaction to the person with the most complete and efficient access to the required information
at the point of creation. Because a registered clearing agency determines whether to accept an
alpha for clearing and controls the precise moment when the transaction is cleared, the
Commission believes that the clearing agency is best placed to report the result of its decision.
One commenter argued that requiring a registered clearing agency to report to an SDR
not of its choosing whether it accepts an alpha for clearing “is in contradiction with the
Commission’s reasons for permitting a registered clearing agency to decide which registered
SDR to use for reporting of beta and gamma trades.” 179 The Commission does not believe that
there is a contradiction in its reasoning. The person with the duty to report whether or not the
alpha was accepted for clearing must report that information to the alpha SDR or else it would be
difficult to pair the alpha transaction report with the report of its clearing disposition.180 The
178

See infra Section VII (discussing application of Regulation SBSR to security-based
swaps arising from prime brokerage arrangements).

179

LCH.Clearnet Letter at 3.

180

Existing Rule 901(e)(2) requires a life cycle event to be reported to the same entity to
which the original security-based swap transaction was reported. A termination of an
alpha resulting from action by a registered clearing agency is a life cycle event of the
alpha, and thus must be reported to the alpha SDR. Requiring the clearing disposition
report to go to the alpha SDR will allow the alpha SDR to match the relevant reports and
understand the disposition of the alpha. Allowing the registered clearing agency to report
the disposition of the alpha to a registered SDR of its choice, rather than to the alpha
SDR, could make it difficult, if not impossible, to match the alpha transaction report with
the report of the alpha’s clearing disposition. The Commission seeks to minimize the
75

Commission believes that a registered clearing agency, because it chooses when and how to
handle an alpha that is submitted for clearing, is best placed to report whether or not it accepts
the alpha for clearing.
The Commission considered, but determined not to adopt, the alternative recommended
by certain commenters of assigning to the person who has the duty to report the initial alpha (and
thus can choose the alpha SDR) the duty of also reporting to the alpha SDR whether or not the
registered clearing agency has accepted the alpha for clearing. The Commission acknowledges,
as one commenter pointed out, that counterparties to security-based swaps that are submitted to
clearing would in the normal course learn from the clearing agency whether or not a securitybased swap has been accepted for clearing. The Commission believes, however, that requiring a
registered clearing agency to report the termination of the alpha will increase the likelihood that
the alpha termination will be reported accurately and without delay, thereby helping to minimize
the problem of orphan alphas and helping to promote the integrity of reported security-based
swap information. The adopted approach centralizes the function of reporting alpha dispositions
in self-regulatory organizations that operate under rules approved by the Commission.
Centralizing this reporting function into registered clearing agencies, rather than relying on a
potentially large number of platforms and reporting sides to report alpha clearing dispositions,

problem of “orphan alphas,” where it cannot readily be ascertained whether a transaction
involving a product that is customarily submitted to clearing has in fact been submitted to
clearing and, if so, whether it was accepted for clearing. If alpha transactions are not
reported as terminated or they are reported as terminated but the alpha SDR cannot match
the report of termination with the original transaction report—i.e., the alpha is
“orphaned”—it would be more difficult for the Commission to carry out various
oversight functions, such as calculating the total amount of open exposures resulting from
security-based swap activity and understanding trends in clearing activity, including
adherence to any clearing mandate.

76

should help minimize the potential for data discrepancies and delays. 181 Not all counterparties
that may have a reporting obligation would be registered entities. The Commission thus has
greater confidence in the ability of clearing agencies registered with the Commission to
accurately report alpha dispositions. The Commission believes that the approach adopted today
is preferable to an approach that would require platforms and reporting sides to report the alpha
clearing disposition, given that these entities would first have to receive that information from
the registered clearing agency. The Commission believes that the approach of requiring the
registered clearing agency to report that information directly to the alpha SDR is preferable to
relying on Commission rulemaking or enforcement action, as one commenter suggests, 182 to
address data accuracy concerns arising from the exchange of information from the clearing
agency to the platform or reporting side.
The Commission believes that the approach suggested by commenters to require the
person who had the duty to report the alpha transaction also to report whether or not a clearing
agency accepts an alpha for clearing is particularly unsuitable for situations where the alpha was
executed on a platform and the platform incurs the duty to report that alpha under new Rule
901(a)(1). 183 A platform is not a counterparty to the transaction and thus, unlike a counterparty,
typically would not monitor or record life cycle events, or be involved in post-trade processing,
of any transactions executed on the platform (beyond sending messages about executed
transactions to other infrastructures, such as SDRs and clearing agencies, that do carry out posttrade processing functions). The commenters’ suggested approach of requiring the person who
181

The Commission estimates that four registered clearing agencies will clear security-based
swaps and thus incur duties under Regulation SBSR. See infra Section XI(B)(2)(b)(ii).

See infra Section IV(A) (discussing adopting of new Rule 901(a)(1)).

77

has the duty to report the alpha also to report whether or not the clearing agency has accepted the
alpha for clearing would thus require platforms to develop processes for tracking and reporting
life cycle events of platform-executed alphas that they currently do not have.
The Commission believes that it is more efficient to require a registered clearing agency
to report all alpha dispositions, rather than having one rule for reporting the disposition of alphas
that are executed on-platform and a different rule for reporting the disposition of alphas that are
executed off-platform. The potential candidates for reporting the disposition of on-platform
alphas include the platform, one of the sides of the alpha, and the clearing agency. As noted
above, a platform is not well-positioned to perform this function. Furthermore, because neither
side has the duty to report an on-platform alpha (because the platform has the duty), difficulty
could arise from attempting to assign to one of the sides the duty to report the alpha disposition,
particularly if the sides traded anonymously on the platform. Given the alternatives and for the
reasons noted above, the Commission believes that the clearing agency is in the best position to
report whether or not it has accepted a transaction for clearing, with respect to both on- and offplatform alphas. In this regard, the Commission notes that, once a clearing agency has
established a mechanism for reporting to an SDR whether or not it has accepted on-platform
alphas for clearing, there would be only minimal incremental burdens to send additional
messages to that SDR to report whether or not the clearing agency has accepted off-platform
alphas for clearing.
As noted above, one commenter questioned why the Commission’s approach to the
reporting of whether or not an alpha is accepted for clearing differs from its approach to the
reporting of life cycle events stemming from the acceptance or rejection by a prime broker of the

78

initial leg of a prime brokerage transaction. 184 The commenter correctly understands that, in the
prime brokerage context, the reporting side of the first transaction of a prime brokerage
workflow (whether in a two- or three-legged scenario) must report the termination of that
transaction. 185 In contrast, for a transaction submitted to clearing, the registered clearing agency,
rather than the reporting side for the initial alpha transaction, must report whether or not it has
accepted the alpha for clearing. The commenter disagrees with this approach to the reporting of
transactions submitted to clearing, asserting that the reporting side or platform, as applicable,
should report whether the alpha has been accepted for clearing. 186
Although prime brokerage and clearing arrangements are similar in some ways, there also
are differences that, the Commission believes, warrant different approaches to the reporting of a
termination of the first leg of the overall transaction. A prime broker, like a registered clearing
agency, has the most direct access to information about whether a transaction has been accepted.
However, because a prime broker might not be subject to Rule 908(b) and thus might not be
eligible to incur any duties under Regulation SBSR, there could be uncertainty as to who would
be required to report the disposition of the first transaction. By contrast, a clearing transaction by
definition includes a registered entity: the registered clearing agency. Therefore, there is no
uncertainty as to whether the registered clearing agency could have the duty to report the
disposition of the alpha.

79

Finally, two commenters expressed concern about the costs associated with requiring
registered clearing agencies to report whether or not they accept alphas for clearing. 187 One
commenter stated, for example, that “[c]onnecting to all registered SDRs is necessary to ensure
that the registered clearing agency is prepared to report to any SDR to which an alpha trade
could be reported . . . [T]here is a significant cost to establishing and maintaining connectivity to
registered SDRs to facilitate the reporting required by Rule 901.” 188 The second commenter
argued that “CAs [i.e., clearing agencies] should execute an agreement with [the alpha SDR]
outlining the requirements to report termination messages; however, CAs should not incur SDR
fees to report alpha termination messages.” 189 This commenter cautioned, furthermore, that
“[r]equiring CAs to become a full ‘participant’ of alpha SDRs is unnecessary and overly
burdensome for CAs.” 190
With respect to whether a registered SDR may impose a fee on a registered clearing
agency for reporting to the SDR whether or not an alpha transaction has been accepted for
clearing, neither the statute nor the applicable rules prohibit such a fee. The Commission notes,
however, that existing Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act 191 requires an SDR to ensure
that any dues, fees, or other charges imposed by the SDR are fair and reasonable and not
unreasonably discriminatory.

With respect to the wider costs associated with clearing agencies’ reporting of alpha
clearing dispositions to registered SDRs, the Commission notes that Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), by its
terms, requires registered clearing agencies to report only a limited amount of information (i.e.,
whether or not they have accepted a security-based swap for clearing, along with the transaction
ID of the relevant alpha) and therefore does not require the clearing agency to have connectivity
sufficient to report all of the primary and secondary trade information of a security-based
swap. 192 The Commission believes that registered SDRs should consider providing a minimally
burdensome means for registered clearing agencies to report whether or not they accept an alpha
for clearing. 193
Accordingly, for similar reasons that the Commission is assigning to registered clearing
agencies the duty to report all clearing transactions, the Commission also believes that it is
appropriate to assign to the registered clearing agency—rather than to the person who had the
initial duty to report the alpha (i.e., a reporting side or a platform)—the duty to report to the
alpha SDR whether or not the clearing agency has accepted the alpha for clearing.
H.

A Registered Clearing Agency Must Know the Transaction ID of the Alpha
and the Identity of the Alpha SDR

192

As described in more detail in Section XII(A), infra, the Commission has considered the
costs of requiring registered clearing agencies to have the capability to report clearing
dispositions to multiple alpha SDRs and the benefits associated with ensuring that the
clearing disposition report is made by the person with immediate and direct access to the
relevant information.

193

For example, a registered SDR should consider how it will comply with Rule 13n4(c)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.13n-4(c)(1)(ii), which requires that the
SDR permit market participants to access specific services offered by the SDR
separately, and Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iii) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.13n4(c)(1)(iii), which requires the SDR to have objective criteria that would permit fair,
open, and not unreasonably discriminatory access to services offered and data maintained
by the SDR, when offering access to a registered clearing agency that seeks only to report
whether or not it has accepted individual transactions for clearing.

81

Existing Rule 901(e)(2) requires the person who has the duty to report a life cycle event
to include in the report of the life cycle event the transaction ID of the original transaction.
Under new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), a registered clearing agency that accepts or rejects an alpha
transaction from clearing incurs this duty. The transaction ID of the alpha transaction is
information that the registered clearing agency might not have, because the registered clearing
agency is not involved in the execution or reporting of the alpha. Therefore, the Commission
proposed a new subparagraph (3) of Rule 901(a), which would require the person who has the
duty to report the alpha security-based swap to provide the registered clearing agency with the
transaction ID of the alpha and the identity of the alpha SDR.
One commenter “acknowledged the value” of the proposed rule and noted that in other
jurisdictions the data flows to clearing agencies already include identification information for
alpha transactions, so these data flows should be extensible to the security-based swap market. 194
By contrast, a second commenter expressed the view that the proposed rule “would add a layer
of complexity to the reporting framework” and noted that the reporting person for the alpha
might provide an inaccurate transaction ID to the registered clearing agency to which the trade is
submitted. 195
After carefully considering the comments received, the Commission is adopting Rule
901(a)(3) as proposed. Although Rule 901(a)(3) adds an additional step to the reporting
framework, the Commission believes that this additional step is necessary to facilitate the linking
of related transactions. Under new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), a registered clearing agency must report to
the entity to which the original security-based swap was reported whether or not it accepts the
194

195

82

alpha for clearing. For the alpha SDR to link the registered clearing agency’s report of
acceptance or rejection to the appropriate transaction, the registered clearing agency must be able
to include the transaction ID of the alpha transaction in its report to the alpha SDR. The
Commission further believes that the person having the duty to report the alpha is best situated to
also report the transaction ID of the alpha and the identity of the alpha SDR to the registered
clearing agency. While it is true, as the commenter asserts, that the person having the duty to
report the alpha might provide an inaccurate transaction ID to the registered clearing agency, the
same could be said about any reporting requirement imposed by Regulation SBSR. This
situation should be addressed, at least in part, by Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 196
which requires every SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed for the reporting of complete and accurate transaction data to the SDR. 197
Furthermore, the person with the duty to report the alpha is certain to know the transaction ID
and the identity of the alpha (since it selected the SDR) and thus is well placed to provide this
information to the registered clearing agency, which would allow the clearing agency to
discharge its duty under new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii).
Two commenters sought guidance regarding the means by which persons with the duty to
report the alpha transaction could provide the transaction ID of the alpha and the identity of the

196

17 CFR 240.13n-5(b)(1)(i).

197

A registered SDR should consider including in its policies and procedures under Rule
13n-5(b)(1)(i) what actions to take if it receives clearing disposition information from a
registered clearing agency that includes transaction IDs of alpha transactions that do not
match to the records of any alpha transactions held at the registered SDR. The SDR
might seek to call this discrepancy to the attention of the registered clearing agency so
that the registered clearing agency could work with persons who are required by Rule
901(a)(3) to provide the registered clearing agency with the transaction IDs of the alphas.

83

alpha SDR to the registered clearing agency. 198 One of these commenters stated that some
platforms can provide the information required by Rule 901(a)(3) using third-party service
providers, but cautioned that “platforms would be forced to undertake a significant development
investment if required to perform that function itself and to build functionality that replaces
existing solutions.” 199 The commenter requested, therefore, that the Commission “make clear in
its final rules that platforms have discretion to determine the most appropriate technological
manner in which they comply [with Rule 901(a)(3)].” 200 The other commenter expressed the
view that “the most efficient approach would be for clearing agencies to gather the choice of
alpha SDR for an asset class or product once from all reporting sides and platforms, and retain
and maintain as static data rather than requiring a notification on a transactional basis.” 201
Final Rule 901(a)(3) does not prescribe a specific means by which the person with the
duty to report an alpha must inform the registered clearing agency of the alpha’s transaction ID
and the identity of the alpha SDR. There is no prohibition on utilizing existing infrastructure.
Thus, market participants may determine the most efficient way of communicating this
information. The Commission notes, however, that Rule 901(a)(3) applies on a transaction-bytransaction basis. Thus, while it might be possible for a registered clearing agency to obtain and
store static data regarding a reporting person’s SDR preferences, Rule 901(a)(3) requires the
person having the duty to report a particular alpha transaction to ensure that the registered
clearing agency learns the identity of the SDR that holds the record of the particular alpha. If the
person with the duty to report attempts to satisfy this obligation with static data and the data

satisfy its obligation under Rule 901(a)(3).
I.

Alpha Submitted to Clearing Before It Is Reported to a Registered SDR

In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission described the interim phase
for regulatory reporting and public dissemination, 202 under which security-based swap
transactions may be reported up to 24 hours after the time of execution (or, if 24 hours after the
time of execution would fall on a day that is not a business day, by the same time on the next day
that is a business day). 203 However, the reporting timeframe for a life cycle event and any
adjustment due to a life cycle event is within 24 hours after the occurrence of the life cycle event
or the adjustment due to the life cycle event. 204 Thus, an alpha might be submitted for clearing
immediately after execution but not reported until 24 hours later (or longer, if 24 hours after the
time of execution would fall on a day that is not a business day), and the clearing agency’s
obligation under new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) to inform the alpha SDR whether or not it has accepted
the alpha for clearing could arise before the alpha SDR has received the alpha’s initial
transaction report. 205

202

See 80 FR at 14616-25.

203

See Rule 901(j). In the case of a security-based swap that is subject to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination solely by operation of Rule 908(a)(1)(ii) (i.e., the
security-based swap is accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States), Rule 901(j) requires reporting within 24 hours of
the time of acceptance for clearing (or, if 24 hours after the time of acceptance would fall
on a day that is not a business day, by the same time on the next day that is a business
day).

204

See Rule 901(j).

205

To submit the report contemplated by new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), the registered clearing
agency must know the transaction ID of the alpha. The person with the duty to report the
alpha might know the alpha’s transaction ID before it reports the transaction to a
registered SDR. Under existing Rules 903(a) and 907(a)(5) there is no requirement that a
85

To account for this possibility, the Commission proposed to amend existing Rule
901(e)(2) to require a life cycle event (which would include a notification by a registered
clearing agency whether or not it has accepted an alpha for clearing) to be reported “to the entity
to which the original security-based swap transaction will be reported or has been reported”
(emphasis added). This amendment mirrors the language in new Rule 901(a)(3), which requires
a person who reports an alpha to provide the registered clearing agency the alpha’s transaction
ID and the identity of the registered SDR to which the alpha “will be reported or has been
reported.”
The Commission received two comments on this proposed amendment, discussed
below. 206 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is adopting the amendment to Rule
901(e)(2) as proposed.
One commenter stated that, “[i]n the situation where a termination message to an alpha
swap is not found, the SDR should queue this message and attempt to reapply the termination
message to newly submitted SBSs. This process should continue until the end of the current
business day at which time an error message should be reported back to the clearing agency since

registered SDR itself assign a transaction ID. Under those rules, a registered SDR may
allow third parties, such as reporting sides or platforms, to assign a transaction ID using a
methodology endorsed by the registered SDR. If the registered SDR allows third parties
to assign the transaction ID, the reporting side or platform could tell the registered
clearing agency the alpha’s transaction ID, which in turn could allow the registered
clearing agency to report to the alpha SDR whether or not the alpha has been accepted for
clearing before the alpha has been reported to the registered SDR. If, however, the
person with the duty to report the alpha does not obtain the alpha’s transaction ID until it
reports the alpha to a registered SDR, the person could not provide the alpha’s transaction
ID to the registered clearing agency, and the registered clearing agency could not report
whether or not it accepts the alpha for clearing until after it receives the alpha’s
transaction ID.
206

Comments pertaining to the reporting of an alpha that is rejected from clearing are
discussed in the section immediately following.

86

the termination message could not be applied to a corresponding alpha.” 207 The Commission
notes that it is not requiring a registered SDR to use a particular workflow to account for
circumstances where the report of a life cycle event precedes the initial transaction report. Under
Rule 901(e)(2), each registered SDR may use the workflow that it finds most effective, provided
that it satisfies the requirements of the rule. A registered SDR generally should consider whether
the policies and procedures it establishes under Rule 907(a) will address the situation where it
receives a report from a registered clearing agency stating whether or not it has accepted an alpha
(with a particular transaction ID) for clearing before the registered SDR receives a transaction
report of the alpha. The policies and procedures could provide, for example, that the registered
SDR would hold in a pending state a report from a registered clearing agency that it accepted the
alpha for clearing until the SDR receives the alpha transaction report, and then disseminate the
security-based swap transaction information and the fact that the alpha has been terminated as a
single report.
The second commenter argued that Regulation SBSR should “prohibit [the alpha SDR]
from publicly disseminating the rejection or acceptance report from the clearing agency ahead of
the point at which the SDR receives and has publicly disseminated the report for the alpha.” 208
While the Commission shares the commenter’s concern that a “stand alone” termination not be
publicly disseminated without the associated transaction report, the Commission does not believe
that a new rule is necessary to avoid this result. Under existing rules, a registered SDR that
receives a termination report of a security-based swap before it receives the initial transaction
report cannot disseminate anything relating to the transaction. Existing Rule 902(a) requires this
207

87

result because it provides, in relevant part, that the public report “shall consist of all the
information reported pursuant to [Rule 901(c)].” Because the registered SDR has not yet
received the transaction report of the alpha, it would lack “all of the information reported”
pursuant to Rule 901(c) and thus could not make the report required by Rule 902(a). If the
registered SDR holds in queue the notice of the disposition of the alpha, it would be required—
when it subsequently receives the initial alpha transaction report—to immediately disseminate
the Rule 901(c) information pertaining to the alpha as well as the fact that the alpha has been
terminated if the alpha has been accepted for clearing. 209
J.

Consequences of Rejection

Two commenters raised issues relating to the reporting of an alpha that is rejected from
clearing. 210 One of these commenters stated that “[c]areful consideration needs to be made by
SDRs as to how a report by the clearing agency that a trade has not been accepted for clearing
would be reflected in the record for the SBS.” 211 The other commenter noted that “[i]t is unclear
what lifecycle event the registered clearing agency should report for rejected trades.” 212 This
commenter stated that an alpha that is rejected from clearing might remain a bilateral trade,
might be submitted to a different registered clearing agency, might be re-submitted to the same
registered clearing agency, or might be torn up. 213

209

To address the case where an alpha is rejected from clearing, the Commission is adopting
new Rule 902(c)(8), discussed in the subsection immediately below.

210

See id.

88

In some cases, depending on the contractual arrangement between the alpha
counterparties, a registered clearing agency’s rejection of an alpha will result in the immediate
termination of the transaction. 214 In other cases, as the commenter indicates, an alpha that is
rejected from clearing could remain a bilateral trade with different terms. The latter case implies
that the counterparties had effected a bilateral, off-platform transaction and that their contractual
arrangement specifically contemplated that the counterparties could elect to preserve the original
security-based swap as a bilateral transaction if the clearing agency rejects it from clearing. 215 If
the alpha counterparties do not have such an arrangement, then rejection from clearing
terminates the alpha. 216 But if the counterparties have such an arrangement and elect to preserve
a transaction that has been rejected from clearing, the reporting side of the original transaction
would be required by Rule 901(e) to report the amended terms of the security-based swap to the
registered SDR as a life cycle event of the original transaction. 217 A registered SDR must
establish and maintain written policies and procedures for specifying procedures for reporting
life cycle events, including those relating to a clearing agency’s rejection of an alpha. A

214

Under Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), as adopted herein, a registered clearing agency is required to
report whether or not it has accepted a security-based swap for clearing.

215

In the case of a platform-executed alpha, the security-based swap arises by operation of
the platform’s rules, and there likely would not be a separate agreement between the
counterparties that would allow for amendment in case of rejection, particularly for
anonymous trades.

216

The counterparties could choose to negotiate a new security-based swap, but this would
be a different transaction than the alpha that had been rejected from clearing.

217

A life cycle event is defined, in part, as “with respect to a security-based swap, any event
that would result in a change in the information reported to a registered security-based
swap data repository under Rule 901(c). . .” Rule 900(q). Because the resulting bilateral
transaction would no longer be intended to be submitted to clearing, the reporting side
would be required, among other things, to modify the information previously reported
pursuant to Rule 901(c)(6) (whether or not the counterparties intend that the securitybased swap be submitted to clearing).
89

registered SDR could, for example, provide in its policies and procedures that it would, in the
absence of any information provided by the reporting side to the contrary or in the case of a
platform-executed alpha, treat the clearing agency’s rejection of the alpha as a termination of the
alpha.
As noted in Section III(I), supra, during the interim phase for regulatory reporting and
public dissemination, 218 an alpha might be submitted for clearing immediately after execution
but not reported until more than 24 hours later, and the clearing agency’s duty under new Rule
901(e)(1)(ii) to inform the alpha SDR whether or not the clearing agency has accepted the alpha
for clearing could arise before the alpha SDR receives the initial transaction report for the alpha.
Therefore, during the interim phase, a registered SDR might receive notice of a clearing agency’s
rejection of an alpha before receiving the initial transaction report for that alpha.
In this limited case, the Commission believes that no transaction report should be
disseminated, and it is adopting a minor revision to existing Rule 902(c) to accomplish that end.
Rule 902(c) lists the types of reported information and the types of security-based swap
transactions that a registered SDR shall not publicly disseminate. The Commission is adding a
new subparagraph (8) to Rule 902(c) to prohibit a registered SDR from disseminating “[a]ny
information regarding a security-based swap that has been rejected from clearing or rejected by a
prime broker 219 if the original transaction report has not yet been publicly disseminated.” 220

218

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14616-25.

219

Because rejection by a prime broker has a similar effect to rejection by a clearing agency
(i.e., it may result in termination of the initial transaction), the Commission is adopting
language relating to prime broker transactions. See infra Section VII for additional
discussion of prime broker transactions.

220

The Commission is also making minor technical corrections to subparagraphs (c)(6) and
(c)(7) of Rule 902(c) to accommodate the addition of (c)(8). The Commission is deleting
90

New Rule 902(c)(8) is designed to avoid public dissemination of an alpha transaction that has
been rejected by the clearing agency, if the original transaction report has not already been
publicly disseminated by a registered SDR. Rule 902(c)(8) should help minimize public
dissemination of events that do not reflect any ongoing market activity. 221
New Rule 902(c)(8) applies only in cases of rejection prior to public dissemination of the
original transaction report of the alpha. When the action of a registered clearing agency results
in a termination of an alpha—whether because it was accepted by the clearing agency and
replaced by the beta and gamma, or because it was rejected by the clearing agency—the
termination of the alpha is a life cycle event of the alpha. If the registered SDR already has
publicly disseminated the primary trade information of the alpha, the termination life cycle event
also must be publicly disseminated. Rule 907(a)(3) requires a registered SDR to have policies
and procedures for flagging the report to indicate that the report is a life cycle event to ensure
that market observers can understand that the report represents a revision to a previous
transaction. 222 A life cycle event is defined to include the termination of an alpha.
Rule 907(a)(4) requires the policies and procedures of a registered SDR, in relevant part,
to identify characteristics of a security-based swap that could, in the fair and reasonable

the word “or” from the end of (c)(6) and the period from the end of (c)(7) and adding
“; or” to the end of subparagraph (c)(7).
221

As discussed in Section VII(D), infra, a similar situation could arise if a prime broker
rejects a security-based swap that has been negotiated between a client and a third-party
executing dealer. New Rule 902(c)(8) applies to security-based swaps that have been
rejected by a registered clearing agency as well as those that have been rejected by a
prime broker.

222

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14643 (“public reports of life cycle
events should allow observers to identify the security-based swap subject to the lifecycle
event”). However, the registered SDR may not use the transaction ID for this function
and must use other means to link the transactions. See id.

91

estimation of the registered SDR, cause a person without knowledge of those characteristics to
receive a distorted view of the market and to apply condition flags to help prevent a distorted
view of the market. The Commission believes that it would be difficult to comply with Rule
907(a)(4) if the condition flags do not provide sufficient information about the specific
characteristics to prevent the report from distorting observers’ view of the market, including by
distinguishing between a termination that results from successful clearing and a termination that
results from rejection from clearing. If market observers are not given the ability to distinguish
between alphas that terminate because they are successfully cleared and alphas that terminate
because they are rejected from clearing, there would be no means for market observers to avoid
developing a distorted view of the market. 223 Separate flags for terminations that result from
successful clearing of an alpha and terminations that result from rejection from clearing, both of
which can be derived from the report of the alpha’s clearing disposition provided by a registered
clearing agency pursuant to Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), would be appropriate to prevent a distorted view
of the market.

223

For example, assume that two counterparties bilaterally execute a transaction that they
wish to clear. The reporting side for the alpha reports the transaction to a registered SDR,
which immediately publicly disseminates it. The counterparties then submit the
transaction to clearing, but the alpha is rejected because there are clerical errors in the
clearing submission report. The registered clearing agency reports the rejection to the
alpha SDR, and the alpha SDR disseminates a termination. Shortly thereafter, the alpha
counterparties re-execute the transaction, and the reporting side submits a second
transaction report to the registered SDR, which immediately publicly disseminates it.
The counterparties submit the new transaction to the clearing agency; this time the alpha
successfully clears. The registered clearing agency reports this fact to the alpha SDR,
which publicly disseminates the termination. If the condition flag indicates only that the
alpha is terminated, market observers would likely draw the conclusion that twice as
much market activity had occurred than was the case. However, if the condition flags
distinguish termination for successful clearing from termination for rejection from
clearing, market observers would understand that only the second transaction resulted in
ongoing risk positions in the market.

Scope of Clearing Transactions

One commenter expressed the view that the proposed rule does not address the reporting
of trades that are part of a registered clearing agency’s end-of-day pricing process. 224 The
commenter recommended that these trades be reported by a clearing agency because the clearing
agency is “the sole party who holds the necessary information to report trades resulting from
downstream clearing processes.” 225 In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission
noted that the definition of “clearing transaction”—i.e., any security-based swap that has a
clearing agency as a direct counterparty226—includes “security-based swaps that arise as part of a
clearing agency’s internal processes, such as security-based swaps used to establish prices for
cleared products.” 227 In this release, the Commission is adopting new Rule 901(a)(2)(i), as
proposed, that makes a registered clearing agency the reporting side for any security-based swap
to which it is a counterparty. Thus, a security-based swap that arises from a clearing agency’s
process for establishing a price for a cleared product must be reported by the registered clearing
agency if it is a counterparty to the transaction. Otherwise, the transaction must be reported by
the person determined by the reporting hierarchy in existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii).
L.

Reporting of Historical Clearing Transactions

One commenter requested that the Commission clarify that a registered clearing agency
“is solely responsible for reporting historical SBS that are clearing transactions.” 228 The
Commission concurs with this statement. Existing Rule 901(i) provides that, with respect to any

historical security-based swap, the reporting side shall report all of the information required by
Rules 901(c) and 901(d) to the extent that information about the transaction is available. Under
new Rule 901(a)(2)(i), the reporting side for a clearing transaction is the registered clearing
agency that is a counterparty to the transaction. The Commission understands that all clearing
agencies that are counterparties to historical security-based swaps are “deemed registered”
clearing agencies. 229 Therefore, a registered clearing agency is the reporting side for every
historical clearing transaction to which it is a counterparty and must report information about
such transactions, to the extent that information is available.
This commenter also stated that “a clearing agency should not be expected to report the
transaction ID of the alpha for an historical clearing transaction since such value may not be
readily available.” 230 The Commission notes that a registered clearing agency would not be the

229

The Commission understands that ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe are the only
registered clearing agencies that are counterparties to historical security-based swaps that
fall within the definition of “clearing transaction” and thus would incur the duty to report
those historical transactions. Both ICE Clear Credit LLC and ICE Clear Europe Limited
were “deemed registered” in accordance with Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. See 15
U.S.C. 78q-1(l) (the “Deemed Registered Provision”). This provision applies to certain
depository institutions that cleared swaps as multilateral clearing organizations and
certain derivatives clearing organizations (“DCOs”) that cleared swaps pursuant to an
exemption from registration as a clearing agency. As a result, ICE Clear Credit LLC,
ICE Clear Europe Limited, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (“CME”) were
deemed registered with the Commission on July 16, 2011, solely for the purpose of
clearing security-based swaps. In 2015 the Commission granted CME’s request to
withdraw its registration as a clearing agency. See Securities Exchange Act Release No.
76678 (December 17, 2015), 80 FR 79983 (December 23, 2015). In its request to
withdraw from registration, the CME stated that it had never conducted any clearing
activity for security-based swaps. See Letter from Larry E. Bergmann and Joseph C.

secondary trade information about the alpha. 231
IV.

Reporting by Platforms
A.

Overview

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed a
new paragraph (1) of Rule 901(a) providing that, if a security-based swap is executed on a
platform and will be submitted to clearing (a “platform-executed alpha”), the platform would
incur the duty to report. In proposing Rule 901(a)(1), the Commission carefully assessed the
transaction information that the platform might not have or might not be able to obtain easily,
and proposed to require the platform to report only the information set forth in Rules 901(c) (the
primary trade information), 901(d)(1) (the participant ID or execution agent ID for each
counterparty, as applicable), 901(d)(9) (the platform ID), and 901(d)(10) (the transaction ID of
any related transaction). 232 For platform-executed security-based swaps that will not be
submitted to clearing, existing Rule 901(a)(2) provides that one of the sides, as determined by
that rule’s “reporting hierarchy,” will have the duty to report.

231

This commenter also noted that “in some cases a reporting side may be unable to report
an historic alpha as before there was no regulatory need to distinguish the alpha from the
beta or gamma and some firms may only have booked a position against the clearing
agency. In that instance, our understanding is that the historical alpha would not be
reportable.” Id. If it is true that transaction information about a historical alpha no longer
exists, there would be no duty to report the alpha pursuant to Rule 901(i). As the
Commission stated in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, Rule 901(i) requires the
reporting of historical security-based swaps only to the extent that information about such
transactions is available. See 80 FR at 14591.

Five commenters generally supported proposed Rule 901(a)(1). 233 However, two
commenters, while not objecting to platforms having reporting duties, argued that the
Commission should expand Rule 901(a)(1) to require a platform to report every transaction
executed on the platform. 234 In the view of one of these commenters, this approach would
eliminate the confusion that could arise if the platform makes an erroneous determination about
whether the transaction will be submitted to clearing. 235 The second commenter cautioned that
requiring a platform to report only platform-executed transactions that will be submitted to
clearing would “depart from current market practice . . . and create different reporting process
flows for SEF executed and cleared trades versus SEF executed and uncleared trades.” 236
Another commenter, however, recommended that the Commission not expand the scope of Rule
901(a) to require platforms to report all platform-executed security-based swaps. 237
After carefully considering all the comments, the Commission has determined to adopt
Rule 901(a)(1) largely as proposed, but with minor revisions. The revisions, discussed further
below, reduce the scope of information that platforms are required to report by eliminating the
need for platforms to identify the participation of indirect counterparties. New Rule 901(a)(1) is

See Better Markets Letter at 2, 4 (noting that the “proposal ensures that the reporting
party is specified and has all requisite information”); DTCC Letter at 6, 15 (stating that “a
platform is best placed to report the alpha trade because it has performed the execution
and has all the relevant economic terms, IDs, and timestamps, to report to the [registered
SDR]”); ICE Letter at 4; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 5, 27; LCH.Clearnet Letter at 3.

234

See DTCC Letter at 6; WMBAA Letter at 2.

235

See WMBAA Letter at 2-3. Specifically, the commenter noted that the proposed rule
could cause an SDR to receive duplicate reports, “if the platform believes the transaction
will be cleared and the counterparties do not clear the trade,” or no post-trade report, “if
the platform believes the transaction will not be cleared and counterparties clear the
trade.” Id. at 3.

intended to promote the accuracy and completeness of security-based swap transaction data,
while aligning the reporting duty with persons that are best able to carry it out. As the person
with the duty to report the transaction, the platform would be able to select the registered SDR to
which it reports. 238
B.

A Platform Is Not Required to Report All Transactions Occurring on Its
Facilities

If a platform-executed security-based swap will not be submitted to clearing, the platform
would have no reporting duty under Regulation SBSR, and the reporting hierarchy in existing
Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) would determine which side is the reporting side for the transaction.
One commenter argued that “a platform should report all trades executed on a SB SEF
regardless of whether an SB swap will be submitted to clearing.” 239 The Commission disagrees.
The Commission did not propose and is not adopting an extension to Rule 901(a)(1) that would
require a platform to report all security-based swaps that are executed on its facilities. Moreover,
the approach being adopted by the Commission avoids the need to develop an overly
complicated rule that would be needed to identify, with respect to a platform-executed
transaction that will not be submitted to clearing, what information would be reported by the
platform and what information would be reported by one of the sides. 240 The commenter
acknowledges that requiring a platform to report uncleared security-based swaps executed on its

238

This is consistent with the Commission’s guidance in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release that, for transactions subject to the reporting hierarchy, the reporting side may
choose the registered SDR to which it makes the report required by Rule 901. See 80 FR
at 14597-98.

239

WMBAA Letter at 2.

240

See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 27 (agreeing with the Commission’s approach of not
requiring shared reporting of the same transaction and noting that “[u]nder the CFTC
Rules, we have experienced the difficulty of a shared obligation for reporting a swap”).

97

facilities would necessitate additional reporting by at least one of the sides. 241 As discussed in
the subsection immediately below, the Commission believes that the transaction information
germane to a platform-executed alpha can and should be reported by the platform. 242 However, a
transaction that will not be submitted to clearing is more likely to include bespoke or more
counterparty-specific data elements that would be more difficult for the platform to obtain from
the counterparties and to report because such non-standardized transactions would not lend
themselves to routinized reporting. 243 Rather than adopting an approach that would seek to
identify each potential data element and to assign the duty to report it (as between the platform
and one of the sides), the Commission instead is adopting an approach that requires the platform
to report only those transactions executed on its system that will be submitted to clearing. In
cases where a platform-executed transaction will not be submitted to clearing, existing Rule
901(a)(2)(ii) provides that one of the sides will have the duty to report, and this duty is not
divided between the platform and the side.

241

See WMBAA Letter at 3 (“For uncleared SB swaps, . . . the platform should provide all
readily available information, and the reporting side should be responsible for reporting
the information not provided to the SB SEF”) (emphasis added).

242

Thus, the sides would have no duty to report anything except missing UICs, as required
by existing Rule 906(a). In Rule 906(a), the Commission established a mechanism for
obtaining missing UICs from non-reporting sides because it anticipated circumstances
when they might be unable or unwilling to provide those UICs to the persons who have
the initial reporting duty. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14644.

243

For example, an uncleared transaction between two counterparties executed on an SB
SEF is likely to involve one or more bilateral agreements between the counterparties that
govern other facets of their relationship, such as margining and collateral arrangements.
The title and date of any such agreement that is incorporated by reference into a securitybased swap contract must be reported pursuant to existing Rule 901(d)(4). The
Commission does not believe that it would be appropriate to require a platform to obtain
this information from the counterparties and to incur the duty for reporting it.

98

The commenter expressed concern that this approach could lead to confusion over
reporting obligations when “it is uncertain whether the transaction will be cleared upon
execution.” 244 A platform can determine whether a particular security-based swap will be
submitted to clearing implicitly through the product ID (e.g., if the security-based swap has a
product ID of a “made available to trade” product or if the product ID otherwise specifies that
the product will be submitted to clearing) or explicitly because the counterparties inform the
platform of their intent. 245 Counterparties could signal to a platform that they intend to clear a
particular security-based swap using communications infrastructure provided by the platform to
submit transaction information to a registered clearing agency or by otherwise specifically
informing the platform before or at the time of execution of their intent to submit the trade to
clearing. Absent an implicit or explicit indication before or at the time of execution that a
particular security-based swap will be submitted to clearing, the platform can reasonably
conclude that the transaction will not be submitted to clearing and thus that the platform has no
reporting obligation. Thus, if the direct counterparties do not inform the platform before or at the
point of execution that they intend to submit the transaction to clearing, the platform incurs no
duty to report. In that case, the reporting hierarchy in existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) would apply to

244

WMBAA Letter at 2.

245

The Commission notes that the certain execution venues that are registered with the
CFTC as swap execution facilities have adopted rules that require swap counterparties to
designate whether or not a swap will be submitted to clearing. See MarketAxess SEF
Rulebook, Rule 905, available at:
http://www.marketaxess.com/pdfs/cds/MKTX_SEF_Rulebook_Effective_08-242015.pdf (last visited May 25, 2016); Bloomberg SEF Rulebook, Rule 533(a), available

99

the security-based swap and the reporting side identified under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) would be
obligated to report the transaction. 246
Furthermore, the Commission believes that another alternate approach—of requiring all
platform-executed transactions, even those that will be submitted to clearing, to be reported by
one of the sides and not imposing any reporting duties on platforms—is impractical. As the
Commission has noted, platform-executed alphas can be executed anonymously. 247 Although
some platform-executed transactions that will be submitted to clearing might not be executed
anonymously, the Commission believes that it is more efficient to require the platform to report
all security-based swaps executed on that platform that will be submitted to clearing, regardless
of whether the counterparties are, in fact, anonymous to each other. The Commission believes
that assigning the duty to report to the platform minimizes the number of reporting steps and thus
minimizes the possibility of errors or delays in reporting the transaction to a registered SDR.
Thus, the Commission believes that all platform-executed transactions that will be submitted to
clearing should be reported by the platform. The Commission believes that this approach will be
more efficient than if the platform had to assess on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether or
not the counterparties are in fact unknown to each other.
C.

Data Elements That a Platform Must Report

The Commission continues to believe that platforms should not be required to report
information that they do not have or that it would be impractical for them to obtain. In the
246

The Commission encourages platforms and their participants to develop protocols for
determining in advance of execution whether a particular transaction will be submitted to
clearing to minimize ambiguity regarding which person—the platform or one of the
sides—will have the duty to report under Rule 901(a). If there is ambiguity regarding
whether a particular transaction will be submitted to clearing, the counterparties are in the
best position to resolve that ambiguity.

247

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14748.

100

Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission carefully reviewed each data
element contemplated by Rules 901(c) and 901(d) and proposed to require platforms to report
only those data elements that it believed that would be readily obtainable and germane to the
transaction. 248 One commenter stated that “[p]latforms could reasonably be expected to gather
and report the primary trade information contained under Rule 901(c),” but cautioned that
“requiring platforms to report a subset of the secondary trade information contained under Rule
901(d) will be problematic,” specifically noting that the platform could not reasonably be
expected to know the guarantors of the direct counterparties. 249 A second commenter also
pointed to difficulties with a platform identifying indirect counterparties. 250 In view of these
comments, the Commission is adopting, largely as proposed, the list of data elements that the
platform must report, but with minor revisions that remove any need for platforms to learn about
indirect counterparties. 251
The Commission continues to believe that platforms will have or can readily obtain the
primary trade information contemplated by Rules 901(c)(1)-(4). For example, the platform will
have information that identifies the products that it offers for trading. 252 When a transaction is
effected on the platform’s facilities, the platform should have the ability to capture the price, the

248

See 80 FR at 14749-50. One commenter generally agreed that platforms would have the
information that the Commission proposed to require them to report. See Barnard I at 2.

249

ICE Letter at 4.

250

See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 27.

251

The Commission also is making a minor revision to replace the phrase “the information
required by” in proposed Rule 901(a)(1) with “the information set forth in” in final Rule
901(a)(1). This revision is designed to clarify that a platform that incurs a reporting duty
under Rule 901(a)(1) must discharge that duty by reporting certain elements that are set
forth in Rules 901(c) and 901(d).

252

See Rule 901(c)(1).

101

notional amount, and the date and time of execution. 253 As discussed in the subsection
immediately above, platforms should be able to ascertain either implicitly (via the product
traded) or explicitly (from the counterparties) whether the direct counterparties intend that the
security-based swap will be submitted to clearing, as required by Rule 901(c)(6). If the direct
counterparties do not inform the platform before or at the point of execution that they intend to
submit the transaction to clearing, the platform incurs no duty under Rule 901(c)(6). 254
The platform will know the direct counterparty on each side of the transaction—or if one
side will be allocated among a group of funds or accounts, the execution agent of that side.
Therefore, final Rule 901(a)(1) requires the platform to report the counterparty ID or the
execution agent ID, as applicable, of each direct counterparty.
The platform also can readily provide its own platform ID, as required by Rule 901(d)(9).
Rule 901(d)(10) applies only if the security-based swap being reported arises from the
allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of one or more existing security-based swaps.
To the extent that a platform facilitates allocations, terminations, novations, or assignments of
existing security-based swaps, the platform would be in a position to require its participants that
engage in such exercises to provide the platform with the transaction IDs of the relevant existing
security-based swaps, which the platform would report—along with the transaction information
about any newly created transaction(s)—pursuant to Rule 901(d)(10).

253

See Rule 901(c)(2)-(4).

254

The Commission believes that this approach responds to the commenter who noted that,
in some instances, a platform might not know the intent of the counterparties and thus
would have difficulty complying with Rule 901(c)(6). See WMBAA Letter at 3.

102

As noted above, two commenters noted that it would be impractical for platforms to learn
the identity of indirect counterparties to transactions effected on their facilities. 255 The
Commission agrees that it would be burdensome to require a platform to learn from the direct
counterparties, on a trade-by-trade basis, whether either direct counterparty has a guarantor.
Furthermore, the Commission now believes that there would be little benefit to imposing such a
requirement. A platform-executed security-based swap, if it will be cleared, will be submitted to
clearing shortly after execution and thus will have only a short lifespan. Shortly, or perhaps even
immediately, after being submitted to clearing, it will likely either be terminated because it is
accepted for clearing or terminated because it is rejected from clearing. In either case, the
potential exposure of a guarantor of the alpha transaction—if there is a guarantor—is likely to be
fleeting. In view of the potential burdens that a requirement to report indirect counterparties
could place on platforms against only marginal benefits, the Commission has determined not to
adopt any requirement for platforms to report indirect counterparties. 256
Existing Rule 901(c)(5) requires reporting of whether both sides of a security-based swap
include a registered security-based swap dealer. One of the commenters who argued for the
removal of the requirement for platforms to report indirect counterparties also noted that it would
255

See ICE Letter at 4; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 27 (stating that “[a] platform will not likely
have advance access to complete information pertaining to whether there is an indirect
counterparty on either side of the transaction,” and that building a mechanism to capture
the existence of indirect counterparties “must be factored into the implementation
timeframe for platforms”).

256

This revision in final Rule 901(a)(1) does not affect the existing requirements for
reporting a platform-executed transaction that will not be submitted to clearing. Such a
transaction is governed by existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), which requires one of the sides to
be the reporting side. The reporting side must report, among other things, all of the
information required by Rule 901(d) including, as applicable, the identity of its own
guarantor and any guarantor of the direct counterparty on the other side. Reporting of the
guarantor(s) of a security-based swap will assist the Commission and other relevant
authorities in monitoring the ongoing exposures of market participants.

103

be difficult for platforms to comply with Rule 901(c)(5) if a registered security-based swap
dealer was an indirect counterparty. 257 The Commission agrees. Therefore, for the same reasons
that it has decided not to adopt a requirement for platforms to report whether either direct
counterparty has a guarantor, the Commission has revised final Rule 901(a)(1) to require a
platform to indicate only when both direct counterparties of a security-based swap are registered
security-based swap dealers—not, as originally proposed, if a registered security-based swap
dealer is present on both sides (e.g., as a guarantor). A platform will be able to learn from
publicly available sources when its participants who effect transactions as direct counterparties
are registered as security-based swap dealers. 258
D.

Platform Duty to Report Secondary Trade Information

Final Rule 901(a)(1) makes clear that the only secondary trade information that a
platform must report is the counterparty ID of each direct counterparty (or execution agent, if
applicable); 259 the platform ID; 260 and the transaction ID of the prior security-based swap if the
platform-executed security-based swap results from the allocation, termination, novation, or
assignment of the prior transaction. 261

257

See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 27.

258

See SBS Entity Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR at 48972 (“The Commission
intends to notify entities electronically through the EDGAR system when registration is
granted, and will make information regarding registration status publicly available on
EDGAR”).

259

See Rule 901(d)(1). As noted above, final Rule 901(a)(1) requires a platform to report
the counterparty IDs only of the direct counterparties to the transaction, not of any
indirect counterparties.

260

See Rule 901(d)(9).

261

See Rule 901(d)(10).

104

One commenter expressed concern about a platform having to report other secondary
trade information, such as the title and date of any agreements incorporated by reference into the
security-based swap contract. 262 Rule 901(a)(1), both as proposed and as adopted, requires a
platform to report only the secondary trade information specifically enumerated in the rule. The
agreements contemplated by Rule 901(d)(4) are not so enumerated. 263
E.

Platform Has No Duty to Report Life Cycle Events

One commenter argued that platforms should have no duty to report life cycle event
information because platforms have no involvement in a security-based swap after execution and
would not have access to such information. 264 The Commission agrees. Therefore, the
Commission did not propose and is not adopting a requirement for platforms to report any life
cycle events.
Existing Rule 901(e)(1)(i) provides that most life cycle events (and adjustments due to
life cycle events) must be reported by the reporting side. A platform is not a counterparty to a
security-based swap and thus cannot be a reporting side. Therefore, existing Rule 901(e)(1)(i),
by its terms, imposes no duty on platforms to report life cycle events. Furthermore, Rule
901(e)(1) includes one exception to the general rule that the reporting side must report life cycle
events: new subparagraph (ii), as adopted today, requires the registered clearing agency to which
the platform-executed alpha is submitted to report to the alpha SDR whether or not it has
accepted a security-based swap for clearing. The Commission believes that these are the only
life cycle events germane to a platform-executed alpha—the transaction will either be terminated
262

See WMBAA Letter at 4 (referencing requirement in Rule 901(d)(4)).

263

See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 27 (correctly observing that the Commission did not propose
to require platforms to report agreement information).

264

See WMBAA Letter at 4.

105

because it is accepted for clearing or terminated because it is rejected from clearing—and
therefore is not imposing any requirement on the platform or either of the sides to report
additional types of life cycle events for platform-executed alphas.
F.

Implementation Issues

One commenter encouraged the Commission “to allow the use of existing reporting
technology and reporting architecture to reduce the amount of additional technology investment
required to comply” with any reporting obligations. 265 This commenter further requested that the
Commission “make clear in its final rules that platforms have discretion to determine the most
appropriate technological manner in which they comply with the Commission’s rules.” 266 The
Commission has been sensitive to the current state of the security-based swap industry and, in
particular, the technological baseline that is utilized by market participants and infrastructure
providers to carry out business and regulatory functions. The Commission has sought to adopt
final rules that minimize changes to systems and processes so far as they can be adapted to new
reporting duties, while recognizing that new systems or processes, or fairly significant revisions
to existing systems or processes, might be necessary in some cases.
The Commission acknowledges that Rule 901(a)(1) will require platforms to develop,
test, implement, and maintain technology to ensure connectivity to at least one registered
SDR. 267 Rule 901(a)(1) does not specify the reporting technology or reporting architecture for
platforms to use, and platforms may use their existing technology and architecture to reduce the
amount of additional technology investment required to comply with the rule. Moreover, the

265

See WMBAA Letter at 3.

266

Id.

267

See WMBAA Letter at 3.

106

Commission affirms that platforms may retain third-party service providers to facilitate
compliance with their reporting obligations. The Commission notes that platforms are no
different from other persons having a duty to report that elect to use an agent to carry out that
function; the person with the reporting duty would retain responsibility under Regulation SBSR
for providing the required information in the required format. 268
Finally, this commenter also urged the Commission to “clearly outline the specific data
fields, and permissible formats for reporting those data fields, required for post-trade
reporting.” 269 When it adopted Regulation SBSR, the Commission took the approach of
generally requiring reporting of general categories of data (such as the “price” 270) while requiring
registered SDRs to establish and maintain written policies and procedures that specify the
manner in which persons having a duty to report must provide security-based swap transaction
data to the SDR. 271 In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission considered
whether to prescribe formats for the data elements required by Regulation SBSR, and concluded
that “it is neither necessary or appropriate to mandate a fixed schedule of data elements to be
reported, or a single format or language for reporting such elements to a registered SDR.” 272 In
the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission did not propose a new
268

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14602.

269

270

See Rule 901(c)(3).

271

See Rules 907(a)(1) and 907(a)(2). The Commission did, however, require reporting of
some specific data elements. See, e.g., Rule 901(c)(6) (requiring reporting of whether the
direct counterparties intend that the security-based swap will be submitted to clearing);
Rule 901(d)(9) (requiring reporting of the platform ID, if applicable).

272

80 FR at 14595. The Commission noted, furthermore, that new security-based swap
products are likely to develop over time and a rule establishing a fixed schedule of data
elements could become obsolete as new data elements might become necessary to reflect
material economic terms of new security-based swap products. See id.

107

approach for specifying how the required data elements must be reported to a registered SDR,
and declines to adopt a new approach here. 273
G.

Reporting Duty Applies Even to Unregistered Platforms

New Rule 901(a)(1) imposes a reporting duty on any “platform” if a security-based swap
that will be submitted to clearing is executed on the platform. One commenter requested the
Commission to clarify “whether an alpha SBS entered into via an execution venue in advance of
its registration or exemption as a national securities exchange or security-based swap execution
facility is required to be reported to one of the sides.” 274 The commenter stated that “[i]deally
the registration or exemption of platforms would precede the compliance date for reporting under
[Regulation] SBSR. Otherwise, the industry will need to transition the reporting responsibility
which may lead to gaps or duplications in reporting since the relevant static data and any system
architectural changes will not occur simultaneously.” 275 The commenter argued, in the
alternative, that “the Commission should exempt alphas from reporting in advance of platform
registration.” 276 A second commenter stated that it “is uncertain as to how the reporting
obligations for a platform under Regulation SBSR would be fulfilled if the compliance dates are
triggered before the Commission implements SB swap trading rules.” 277

273

The Commission notes, however, that it has proposed an amendment to Rule 13n-4(a)(5)
under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.13n-4(a)(5), that would specify the form and
manner with which SDRs will be required to make security-based swap data available to
the Commission. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 76624 (December 11, 2015),
80 FR 79757 (December 23, 2015).

108

In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission explained that there are
certain entities that currently meet the definition of “security-based swap execution facility” but
that are not yet registered with the Commission and will not have a mechanism for registering as
SB SEFs until the Commission adopts final rules governing the registration and core principles
of SB SEFs. These entities currently operate pursuant to an exemption from certain provisions
of the Exchange Act. 278 To ensure that transactions that occur on such exempt SB SEFs are
captured by Regulation SBSR, existing Rule 900(v) defines “platform” as “a national securities
exchange or security-based swap execution facility that is registered or exempt from registration”
(emphasis added). Therefore, the Commission does not believe that it is necessary, as the
commenter suggests, to transfer reporting duties from the platform to one of the sides, or to
exempt alphas from reporting entirely, until the Commission adopts registration rules for SB
SEFs. Doing so could significantly delay the benefits of regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of platform-executed alpha transactions. Furthermore, the Commission
understands that, although platforms for security-based swaps might not yet be registered with
the Commission, they likely already possess significant post-trade processing capabilities
because of their activities in the swaps market, which subjects them to reporting duties under
CFTC rules. 279 In any event, unregistered platforms will have an extended period in which to
prepare for their reporting duties under Regulation SBSR, as new transactions in an asset class
278

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 64795 (July 1, 2011), 76 FR 39927 (July 7,
2011). In this order, the Commission granted entities that meet the statutory definition of
“exchange” solely due to their activities relating to security-based swaps a temporary
exemption from the requirement to register as a national securities exchange in Sections 5
and 6 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78e and 78f. This included entities that would
meet the statutory definition of “security-based swap execution facility” but that
otherwise would not be subject to the requirements under Sections 5 and 6 of the
Exchange Act.

V.

Additional Matters Concerning Platforms and Registered Clearing Agencies
A.

Extending “Participant” Status

Existing Rule 901(h) requires “a reporting side” to electronically transmit the information
required by Rule 901 in a format required by the registered SDR. In the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed to replace the term “reporting side”
in Rule 901(h) with the phrase “person having a duty to report.” Under Rule 901(a), as amended
by this release, a platform or registered clearing agency might incur a reporting duty even if it is
not one of the sides to the transaction. 281 All persons who have a duty to report under Regulation
SBSR—i.e., platforms, reporting sides, and registered clearing agencies that must report whether
or not a security-based swap is accepted for clearing—must electronically transmit the
information required by Rule 901 in a format required by the registered SDR. Replacing
“reporting side” with “person having the duty to report” in Rule 901(h) extends this requirement
to all persons with reporting duties, even if they are not one of the sides. The Commission
received no comments that specifically addressed the amendment to Rule 901(h) 282 and is
adopting this amendment as proposed.
Under existing Rule 900(u), platforms and registered clearing agencies would not be
participants of registered SDRs solely as a result of having a duty to report security-based swap

280

See infra Section X (discussing compliance dates).

281

The Commission proposed to expand Rule 908(b) to include all platforms and registered
clearing agencies. This amendment to Rule 908(b) is discussed in Section IX, infra.

282

But see ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 29 (endorsing a similar amendment to Rule 905(a)(1) that
expands that rule from “the reporting side” to “the person having the duty to report”).

110

transaction information pursuant to Rule 901(a)(1) or 901(e)(1)(ii), respectively. 283 In the
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission expressed the preliminary
view that platforms and registered clearing agencies should be participants of any registered
SDR to which they report security-based swap transaction information on a mandatory basis.
Consistent with this view, the Commission proposed to amend the definition of “participant” in
Rule 900(u) to include a platform that is required to report a security-based swap pursuant to
Rule 901(a)(1) or a registered clearing agency that is required to report a life cycle event
pursuant to Rule 901(e)(1)(ii). 284
One commenter expressed general support for requiring platforms and clearing agencies
to become participants of the registered SDRs to which they report. 285 A second commenter
agreed that a clearing agency or platform must be a participant of a registered SDR to which it
reports to ensure that reports are submitted in a format required by the registered SDR. 286 The
second commenter, however, also expressed its understanding “that in this context, participant
means a registered user of an SDR, submitting data in the format as requested by the SDR, rather

283

Existing Rule 900(u) provides that a “[p]articipant, with respect to a registered securitybased swap data repository, means a counterparty, that meets the criteria of [Rule
908(b)], of a security-based swap that is reported to that registered security-based swap
data repository to satisfy an obligation under [Rule 901(a)].”

284

A registered clearing agency that is required to report a clearing transaction pursuant to
Rule 901(a)(2)(i) is a counterparty to that security-based swap and is thus covered by the
existing definition of “participant.”

285

See DTCC Letter at 5-6, 17 (stating that “the clearing agency should become an
onboarded participant of the SB SDR and adhere to the policy and procedures to report
data in the format required by the SB SDR. In this regard, separate accommodations
should not be made for clearing agencies, which should be required to comply with an SB
SDR’s policies and procedures to the same extent as other market participants”).

286

See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 24, 27.

111

than a ‘participant’ as defined in Final SBSR.” 287 A third commenter agreed that platforms
should be required to report transaction data to a registered SDR “in a format required by that
registered SDR”; however, the commenter “does not believe that it should be required to become
a member of an SDR.” 288 A fourth commenter stated that, although a clearing agency “should
execute an agreement outlining the requirements to report termination messages” to the alpha
SDR, the clearing agency should not become a full participant of the alpha SDR because it is not
a counterparty to the alpha. 289 This commenter also argued that the clearing agency “should not
incur SDR fees to report alpha termination messages.” 290
After carefully considering the comments, the Commission is adopting the amendment to
Rule 900(u) as proposed. Conferring “participant” status on these additional entities subjects
them to the requirement in Rule 906(c), as amended herein, 291 for enumerated participants to
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to
ensure that they comply with any obligations to report information to a registered SDR in a
manner consistent with Regulation SBSR. The Commission believes that these policies and
procedures will increase the accuracy and reliability of information reported to registered SDRs.
Without written policies and procedures for carrying out their reporting obligations, clearing
agencies and the other entities enumerated in Rule 906(c), as amended, might depend too heavily
on key individuals or ad hoc and unreliable processes. Written policies and procedures,
however, can be shared throughout an organization and generally should be independent of any

specific individuals. Requiring clearing agencies, as well as the other participants enumerated in
Rule 906(c), to adopt and maintain written policies and procedures relevant to their reporting
responsibilities should help to improve the degree and quality of overall compliance with the
reporting requirements of Regulation SBSR. Periodic review of these policies and procedures,
as required by Rule 906(c), should help to ensure that these policies and procedures remain wellfunctioning over time.
A registered clearing agency that clears security-based swaps or a platform that executes
security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing incurs reporting duties under Regulation
SBSR, which requires the platform or registered clearing agency, among other things, to submit
transaction information to one or more registered SDRs. As a result of the amendment to Rule
900(u) being adopted today, the platform or registered clearing agency automatically becomes a
“participant”—under Regulation SBSR—of any SDR to which it submits transaction information
on a mandatory basis. The Commission notes, however, that “participant” status under Rule
900(u) does not require a platform or registered clearing agency to sign a formal participant
agreement with a registered SDR or to establish connectivity sufficient to report all of the
primary and secondary trade information of a security-based swap. 292 A registered SDR may
impose certain obligations on persons who utilize the SDR’s services, regardless of whether such
persons are deemed “participants” under Regulation SBSR. For example, an SDR may impose
fees on such persons for submitting data. 293

292

At the same time, nothing in Regulation SBSR prevents a platform or registered clearing
agency from signing such a participation agreement.

293

See supra note 191 and accompanying text. However, an SDR must offer fair, open, and
not unreasonably discriminatory access to users of its services and ensure that any fees
that it charges are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory. See Rules
113

B.

Examples of Reporting Workflows Involving Platforms and Registered
Clearing Agencies

The following examples illustrate the reporting process for alpha, beta, and gamma
security-based swaps, assuming an agency model of clearing under which a counterparty to an
alpha security-based swap becomes a direct counterparty to a subsequent clearing transaction: 294
•

Example 1. A registered security-based swap dealer enters into a security-based
swap with a private fund. The transaction is not executed on a platform. The
counterparties intend to clear the transaction (i.e., the transaction is an alpha).
Neither side has a guarantor with respect to the alpha, and both direct
counterparties are U.S. persons.
o

The registered security-based swap dealer is the reporting side under
existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) and must report this alpha transaction to a
registered SDR (and may choose the registered SDR).

o

New Rule 901(a)(3) requires the registered security-based swap dealer, as
the reporting side of the alpha transaction, to promptly provide to the
registered clearing agency the transaction ID of the alpha and the identity
of the alpha SDR.

o

If the registered clearing agency accepts the alpha for clearing and
terminates the alpha, two clearing transactions—a beta (between the
registered security-based swap dealer and the registered clearing agency)

13n-4(c)(1)(i) and 13n-4(c)(1)(iii) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.13n-4(c)(1)(i)
and 240.13n-4(c)(1)(iii).
294

Because clearing of security-based swaps in the United States is still evolving, other
models of clearing might emerge where customers would not become direct
counterparties of a registered clearing agency. See supra Section III(A)(1) (discussing
the clearing process in the United States).

114

and a gamma (between the registered clearing agency and the private
fund)—take its place.
o

New Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) requires the registered clearing agency to report to
the alpha SDR that it accepted the transaction for clearing.

o

Under new Rule 901(a)(2)(i), the registered clearing agency is the
reporting side for each of the beta and the gamma. Therefore, the
registered clearing agency must report the beta and gamma to a registered
SDR (and the clearing agency may select the registered SDR). The report
for each of the beta and the gamma must include the transaction ID of the
alpha, as required by existing Rule 901(d)(10).

•

Example 2. Same facts as Example 1, except that the private fund and the
registered security-based swap dealer transact on an SB SEF.
o

New Rule 901(a)(1) requires the SB SEF to report the alpha transaction
(and allows the SB SEF to choose the registered SDR).

o

After the alpha has been submitted to clearing, new Rule 901(a)(3)
requires the SB SEF to promptly report to the registered clearing agency
the transaction ID of the alpha and the identity of the alpha SDR.

o

Once the alpha is submitted to clearing, the reporting workflows are the
same as in Example 1.

C.

Amendments to Rule 905(a)

115

Existing Rule 905(a) provides a mechanism for reporting corrections of previously
submitted security-based swap transaction information. 295 Rule 905(a)(1) requires a nonreporting side that discovers an error in a previously submitted security-based swap to promptly
notify “the reporting side” of the error. 296 Under existing Rule 905(a)(2), once “the reporting
side” receives notification of an error from the non-reporting side or discovers an error on its
own, “the reporting side” is required to promptly submit an amended report containing the
corrected information to the registered SDR that received the erroneous transaction report.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed—and
today is adopting—amendments to Rule 901(a) that require platforms and registered clearing
agencies to report certain transaction information. To preserve the principle in existing Rule
905(a) that the person responsible for reporting information also should have responsibilities for
correcting errors, the Commission proposed to replace the term “reporting side” in existing Rules
905(a)(1) and 905(a)(2) with the phrase “person having a duty to report.” This amendment was
necessitated by the fact that a platform—and a registered clearing agency, when it has the duty to
report whether or not it has accepted a security-based swap for clearing—is not a side to the
transaction, and thus is not covered by existing Rule 905(a).
Under the proposed amendment to Rule 905(a)(1), a person that is not the reporting side
who discovers an error in a previously submitted security-based swap would be required to
promptly notify “the person having the duty to report” of the error. Under the proposed
amendment to Rule 905(a)(2), “the person having the duty to report” a security-based swap
would be required to correct previously reported erroneous information with respect to that

116

security-based swap if it discovers an error or if it receives notification of an error from a
counterparty. Four commenters expressed general support for the proposed amendments to Rule
905(a). 297
After carefully considering the comments received, the Commission is adopting the
amendments to Rule 905(a) as proposed. The Commission believes that, in light of the
amendments to Rule 901(a) that also are being adopted today, 298 Rule 905(a) is necessary to
account for the possibility that a person who is not a counterparty and is thus not on either side of
the transaction could have a duty to report. Thus, a platform or registered clearing agency (when
the clearing agency is reporting whether or not it has accepted an alpha for clearing and thus is
not the reporting side of the alpha) can incur a duty to report a correction, because it also can
incur the initial duty to report the relevant information.
One commenter, discussing general difficulties in making non-reporting sides become
“onboarded users” of registered SDRs, stated that only reporting sides—who presumably would
be onboarded users—should be responsible for amending errors and omissions associated with
previously submitted security-based swaps. 299 The Commission agrees that the person having
the duty to report the initial transaction should be responsible for amending errors and omissions.
There is no scenario under Rule 905(a), as amended, in which a non-reporting side must report
297

See DTCC Letter at 18; LCH.Clearnet Letter at 11; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 29; WMBAA
Letter at 5. Another commenter acknowledged that the proposed amendments are
“technical changes to the rules to incorporate these new reporting participants,” but made
no further commentary on the proposed amendments to Rule 905(a). See Better Markets
Letter at 3-4.

298

See supra Section II(B).

299

See DTCC/ICE/CME Letter at 2 (also stating that requiring reporting sides to amend
errors and omissions would support “current operational workflows since the reporting
side is the only party with a contractual relationship with the non-reporting side as it
relates to the trade details”).

117

anything to a registered SDR. If a non-reporting side discovers an error, Rule 905(a)(1) requires
the non-reporting side to inform the person who had a duty to report the initial transaction—
which could be a platform, a registered clearing agency, or the reporting side—not the registered
SDR.
A second commenter expressed the view that “[w]hen a correction is made to a trade
which has already been accepted by a registered clearing agency or prime broker, then that party
must also notify the registered clearing agency or prime broker of the correction.” 300 Nothing in
Regulation SBSR requires a person to notify the registered clearing agency or prime broker of a
correction after the person reports the correction to a registered SDR. Rule 905(a) is concerned
with maintaining accurate information in registered SDRs. The acceptance of a security-based
swap by a registered clearing agency or a prime broker (in the case of a three-legged prime
brokerage structure) terminates the initial transaction and results in the creation of new securitybased swaps pursuant to the rules of the relevant registered clearing agency or the terms of the
prime brokerage arrangement, respectively. 301 Rule 905(a) requires that, if the person having the
duty to report the original transaction becomes aware of erroneous information in the report of
the transaction, that person must submit a correction to the registered SDR. If the sides of the
security-based swap also provided incorrect information about the initial transaction to the
registered clearing agency or prime broker, the sides presumably would follow the procedures
required by the registered clearing agency or the prime brokerage arrangement to correct the
error—but nothing in Regulation SBSR compels that result.

Requirements Related to Participant Providing Ultimate Parent and Affiliate
Information to Registered SDR

As described in Section V(A), supra, the Commission is adopting, as proposed, an
amendment to the definition of “participant” in Rule 900(u) to include platforms that are required
to report platform-executed security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing and
registered clearing agencies that are required to report whether or not an alpha is accepted for
clearing. Existing Rule 906(b) requires each participant—as defined by Rule 900(u)—of a
registered SDR to provide the SDR with information sufficient to identify any affiliate(s) of the
participant that also are participants of the SDR and any ultimate parent(s) of the participant. 302
By amending Rule 900(u) to make platforms and registered clearing agencies participants, these
entities would become subject to Rule 906(b). In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments
Release, however, the Commission proposed to amend Rule 906(b) to exclude platforms or
registered clearing agencies from the requirement to provide information about affiliates and
ultimate parents to an SDR.
Three commenters expressed support for the Commission’s proposal to exempt platforms
and registered clearing agencies from the obligations of Rule 906(b). 303 The Commission
continues to believe that platforms and registered clearing agencies should be exempt from the
obligations of Rule 906(b) and is adopting the amendment to Rule 906(b) as proposed.
The Commission also proposed to make a similar amendment to existing Rule 907(a)(6),
which requires a registered SDR to have policies and procedures “[f]or periodically obtaining
from each participant information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any
participant(s) with which the participant is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and counterparty
302

119

IDs.” The Commission proposed to amend Rule 907(a)(6) to require registered SDRs to have
policies and procedures to obtain this information from each participant “other than a platform or
a registered clearing agency.” One commenter supported the Commission’s proposal. 304 The
Commission continues to believe that this amendment to Rule 907(a)(6) is appropriate and is
adopting the amendment as proposed.
One commenter asked the Commission to exclude from Rule 906(b) transactions that
include an execution agent ID. 305 The commenter stated: “Aggregation across affiliated entities
under a common parent makes the most sense from a regulatory or systemic risk perspective
where there is coordinated trading activity and/or the risk of such swap positions is borne by the
parent under an explicit or implicit guarantee. In the context of asset management, neither is
typically present. For separate account clients, virtually all the asset management assignments
undertaken by our members are on a discretionary basis . . . As a result, the separate account
client (let alone its affiliates or parent) would not be responsible under its trading contracts for
trading losses incurred by a manager acting on its behalf beyond the assets it has provided to that
manager.” 306

304

ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 29 (“as we support the assignment of reporting duties to
platforms and clearing agencies, [we] also agree with the conforming changes to . . . Rule
907(a)(6)”).

305

See SIFMA-AMG II at 3-4. The commenter appears to be of the view that ultimate
parent IDs and affiliate IDs are fields that must be included in reports of individual
transactions. See id. at 3 (“AMG requests clarification that the parent and affiliate fields
are not applicable (or ‘N/A’) for a trade if the trade report includes an execution agent’s
ID”). The Commission notes, however, that a participant’s ultimate parent and affiliate
information must be disclosed to the registered SDR of which it is a participant in a
separate report, not in individual transaction reports.

306

Id. at 3-4. See also id. at 4 (“There is even less reason to require identification of the
affiliates or parent of a collective investment vehicle. While funds in the same complex
could be viewed as affiliated for certain purposes, aggregating swap positions across
120

Rule 906(b) is designed to facilitate the Commission’s ability to measure security-based
swap exposure within the same ownership group. The Commission believes that requiring the
funds and accounts described in the commenter’s letter to report parent and affiliate information
would not serve this goal. Accordingly, the Commission is amending Rule 906(b) to exclude
externally managed investment vehicles from the requirement to provide ultimate parent and
affiliate information to any registered SDR of which it is a participant. 307 The Commission is
not acting upon the commenter’s specific suggestion to base an exclusion on the fact that the
transaction reports submitted by a fund includes an ID of an execution agent. There could be
situations where a corporate entity within a group that Rule 906(b) is designed to cover might
use an execution agent and thus would be required to report an execution agent ID. Therefore,
basing an exclusion from Rule 906(b) on the use of an execution agent ID would be broader than
necessary. The Commission believes instead that an exclusion for externally managed
investment vehicles is well tailored to satisfy the concerns raised by the commenter while
minimizing the risk of unduly broadening the exclusion. In light of this amendment to Rule
906(b), the Commission is making a conforming change to Rule 907(a)(6). Under Rule

funds where recourse is legally and contractually limited would be misleading from a
systemic risk and regulatory oversight perspective”).
307

In the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the Commission added an express reference to
“investment vehicle” in the non-exclusive list of legal persons that could fall within the
final definition of “U.S. person” in Rule 3a71-3(a)(4) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR
240.3a71-3(a)(4). The Commission observed that investment vehicles are commonly
established as partnerships, trusts, or limited liability entities and required that an
investment vehicle will be treated as a U.S. person for purposes of Title VII if it is
organized, incorporated, or established under the laws of the United States or has its
principal place of business in the United States. See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79
FR at 47307. Thus, an investment vehicle—despite being incorporated, organized, or
established under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction—would be a U.S. person if it is
externally managed from the United States, i.e., its operations “are primarily directed,
controlled, and coordinated from a location within the United States.” Id. at 47310.

121

907(a)(6), as amended, a registered SDR need not include in its policies and procedures for
obtaining ultimate parent and affiliate information a mechanism for obtaining such information
from externally managed investment vehicles.
The Commission declines to grant the commenter’s request to exclude accounts from
Rule 906(b). Although, as the commenter indicates, the parent(s) or affiliate(s) of a separate
account client may not be responsible for losses incurred in the account, the security-based swap
exposure in multiple accounts of a parent would be relevant to understanding the total exposure
within the same ownership group. Thus, an account’s reporting of its parent and affiliate
information will serve the purposes of Rule 906(b) by assisting the Commission in monitoring
enterprise-wide risks related to security-based swaps.
E.

Additional Entities Must Have Policies and Procedures for Supporting Their
Reporting Duties

Existing Rule 906(c) requires each participant of a registered SDR that is a registered
security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant to establish,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that
the participant complies with any obligations to report information to a registered SDR in a
manner consistent with Regulation SBSR. Rule 906(c) also requires each registered securitybased swap dealer and registered major security-based swap participant to review and update its
policies and procedures at least annually.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed to
extend the requirements of Rule 906(c) to registered clearing agencies and platforms that are
participants of a registered SDR. 308 Four commenters generally supported this amendment. 309

308

See 80 FR at 14759.

122

In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission proposed to extend the requirements of
Rule 906(c) to any registered broker-dealer that incurs reporting obligations solely because it
effects transactions between two unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed
Rule 908(b)(5). The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed amendment to
Rule 906(c) for registered broker-dealers. The Commission continues to believe that this
amendment is appropriate and is adopting the amendment as proposed. 310
One commenter stated that the Commission should expand Rule 906(c) “to include all
parties with reporting obligations under Regulation SBSR, including platforms and registered
clearing agencies.” 311 While the Commission is expanding Rule 906(c) to include platforms and
registered clearing agencies, the Commission did not propose and is not adopting any
amendment to expand Rule 906(c) to include “all parties” with reporting obligations under
Regulation SBSR, which would include unregistered persons. Regulation SBSR was designed to
minimize, to the extent feasible, instances where unregistered persons have the primary duty to
report security-based swaps; an unregistered person that is a participant of a registered SDR in
most cases will have only limited duties under Regulation SBSR, such as the duty to report UIC
information pursuant to Rule 906(a). 312 The Commission does not believe that it is appropriate

309

See Better Markets Letter at 6; DTCC Letter at 18; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 29;
LCH.Clearnet Letter at 11.

310

Existing Rule 906(c) is titled: “Policies and procedures of registered security-based swap
dealers and registered major security-based swap participants.” As the Commission has
proposed to subject various other types of persons to Rule 906(c), the Commission also
proposed to revise the title to “Policies and procedures to support reporting compliance.”
The Commission is adopting the amended title.

311

LCH.Clearnet Letter at 11.

312

Existing Rule 906(a) applies to all participants of a registered SDR, including a
participant that is the non-reporting side of a security-based swap reported to the
registered SDR on a mandatory basis. Rule 906(a), in relevant part, requires a participant
123

to require unregistered persons to establish policies and procedures to support this limited
reporting function.
VI.

Reporting and Public Dissemination of Security-Based Swaps Involving Allocation
A.

Background

The Regulation SBSR Adopting Release provides guidance for the reporting of certain
security-based swaps executed by an asset manager on behalf of multiple clients—transactions
involving what are sometimes referred to as “bunched orders.” 313 That release explained how
Regulation SBSR applies to executed bunched orders that are subject to the reporting hierarchy
in existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), including bunched order alphas that are not executed on a platform
and platform-executed bunched orders that will not be submitted to clearing. That release also

of a registered SDR, with respect to a transaction to which it is a direct counterparty, to
provide the SDR with any UICs that the SDR lacks, including a counterparty ID “or (if
applicable), the broker ID, branch ID, execution agent ID, desk ID, and trader ID.” In the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission explained why it adopted the term
“trading desk” and “trading desk ID” rather than, as in earlier proposed versions, “desk”
and “desk ID.” See 80 FR at 14583-84. However, in one place in Rule 906(a), the
Commission failed to revise the term “desk ID” to “trading desk ID” even though it had
done so in another place in Rule 906(a). Therefore, the Commission in this release is
adopting a technical correction to Rule 906(a) to utilize the term “trading desk ID” in
both places. In addition, one commenter requested clarification “that trading desk ID and
trader ID fields are not applicable (or ‘N/A’) for trades entered into by an execution
agent.” SIFMA-AMG II at 2. Based on the rule text, the Commission believes that this
is a reasonable interpretation of Rule 906(a).
313

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14625-27. The Commission
recognizes that market participants may use a variety of other terms to refer to such
transactions, including “blocks,” “parent/child” transactions, and “splits.” The
Commission has determined to use a single term, “bunched orders,” for purposes of this
release, as this appears to be a widely accepted term. See, e.g., “Bunched orders
challenge SEFs,” MarketsMedia (March 25, 2014), available at
http://marketsmedia.com/bunched-orders-challenge-sefs/ (last visited May 25, 2016);
“Cleared bunched trades could become mandatory rule,” Futures and Options World
(October 31, 2013), available at http://www.fow.com/3273356/Cleared-bunched-tradescould-become-mandatory-rule.html (last visited May 25, 2016).

124

explained how Regulation SBSR applies to the security-based swaps that result from allocation
of an executed bunched order, if the resulting security-based swaps are uncleared.
As described in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, to execute a bunched order, an
asset manager negotiates and executes a security-based swap with a counterparty, typically a
security-based swap dealer, on behalf of multiple clients. The bunched order can be executed
on- or off-platform. After execution of the bunched order, the asset manager allocates a
fractional amount of the aggregate notional amount of the transaction to each of several clients,
thereby creating several new security-based swaps and terminating the bunched order
execution. 314 By executing a bunched order, the asset manager avoids having to negotiate the
client-level transactions individually, and obtains exposure for each client on the same terms
(except, perhaps, for size).
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission explained that Rule 901
requires a bunched order execution and the security-based swaps resulting from the allocation of
the bunched order execution, if they are not cleared, to be reported like other security-based
swaps. 315 The Commission further explained that Rule 902(a) requires the registered SDR that
receives the report required by Rule 901 to disseminate the information enumerated in Rule
901(c) for the bunched order execution, including the full notional amount of the transaction.
The Commission observed that publicly disseminating bunched order executions in this manner
would allow the public to “know the full size of the bunched order execution and that this size
314

In aggregate, the notional amount of the security-based swaps that result from the
allocation is the same as the notional amount of the executed bunched order. However,
as one commenter noted, “due to cross-border considerations the aggregate notional of a
bunched order will not always tie out completely in reported SBSR data to the sum of the
notional of its related allocations.” See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 28.

315

See 80 FR at 14625.

125

was negotiated at a single price.” 316 Existing Rule 902(c)(7) provides that a registered SDR shall
not publicly disseminate any information regarding the allocation of a bunched order execution,
which would include information about the security-based swaps resulting from the allocation of
the initial transaction as well as the fact that the bunched order execution is terminated following
this allocation.
B.

Guidance on How Regulation SBSR Applies to Bunched Order Executions

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission provided
guidance explaining how Regulation SBSR would apply to a bunched order that is executed on a
platform and will be submitted to clearing, and— if the bunched order execution is accepted for
clearing—the security-based swaps that result. 317 Consistent with the principles laid out in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release with respect to the reporting of bunched order executions
that will not be submitted to clearing, the reporting hierarchy in existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) will
apply to the reporting of original bunched order executions that will be submitted to clearing.
However, the reporting of the security-based swaps resulting from the allocation of the original
bunched order execution is different if a registered clearing agency is involved. Because the
Commission proposed a new approach for the reporting of all clearing transactions, the
Commission could not offer guidance on how Regulation SBSR applies to bunched order
executions that are allocated through the clearing process until the Commission adopted final
rules for the reporting of clearing transactions. Today, the Commission is adopting amendments
to Rule 901 that will govern how clearing transactions must be reported, and also now is

126

providing guidance for how bunched order executions and related allocations are to be reported
when they are cleared.
1.

Example 1: Off-Platform Cleared Transaction

Assume that an asset manager, acting on behalf of several advised accounts, executes a
bunched order alpha with a registered security-based swap dealer. The execution does not occur
on a platform, and there are no indirect counterparties on either side of the bunched order alpha.
The transaction is submitted to a registered clearing agency.
a.

Reporting the Bunched Order Alpha

The reporting hierarchy of existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) applies to the bunched order alpha
because the execution does not occur on a platform and the bunched order alpha is not a clearing
transaction. Under existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(B), the registered security-based swap dealer is
the reporting side for the bunched order alpha because its side includes the only registered
security-based swap dealer. As the reporting side, the registered security-based swap dealer
must report the primary and secondary trade information for the bunched order alpha to a
registered SDR (the “alpha SDR”) of its choice within 24 hours after the time of execution. Rule
902(a) requires the alpha SDR to publicly disseminate a transaction report of the bunched order
alpha immediately upon receiving the report from the registered security-based swap dealer. 318
When the registered security-based swap dealer submits the bunched order alpha to a
registered clearing agency for clearing, Rule 901(a)(3), as adopted today, requires the registered
security-based swap dealer promptly to provide the registered clearing agency with the
transaction ID of the bunched order alpha and the identity of the alpha SDR. This requirement

318

Pursuant to Rule 906(a), the registered SDR also would be required to obtain any missing
UICs from the counterparties.

127

facilitates the registered clearing agency’s ability to report whether or not it has accepted the
bunched order alpha for clearing, as required by Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), which also is being adopted
today.
b.

Reporting the Security-Based Swaps Resulting From Allocation

New Rule 901(a)(2)(i) requires the registered clearing agency to report all clearing
transactions that arise as a result of clearing the bunched order alpha, regardless of the workflows
used to clear the bunched order alpha. 319
If the asset manager provides allocation instructions prior to or contemporaneous with the
clearing of the bunched order alpha, clearing could result in the creation of a beta (i.e., the
clearing transaction between the registered clearing agency and the security-based swap dealer)
and a “gamma series” (i.e., the gammas between the registered clearing agency and each of the
client accounts selected by the asset manager to receive a portion of the initial notional amount).
The beta and each security-based swap that comprises the gamma series would not be treated
differently under Regulation SBSR than any other clearing transactions.
If the asset manager does not provide allocation instructions until after the bunched order
alpha is cleared, clearing could result in the creation of a beta (i.e., the clearing transaction
between the registered clearing agency and the security-based swap dealer) and an “intermediate
gamma” (i.e., the clearing transaction between the clearing agency and the side representing the
clients of the asset manager). The beta would be the same—and would be treated the same—as
any other clearing transaction, while the intermediate gamma would continue to exist until the

319

Like other clearing transactions that arise from the acceptance of a security-based swap
for clearing, these security-based swaps are not subject to public dissemination. See Rule
902(c)(6). See also Rule 902(c)(7) (exempting from public dissemination any
“information regarding the allocation of a security-based swap”).

128

registered clearing agency receives the allocation information, which could come from the asset
manager or its clearing member and would allow for the creation of the gamma series. The
registered clearing agency would report the intermediate gamma to a registered SDR of its
choice. As the registered clearing agency receives the allocation information, it would terminate
the intermediate gamma and create new security-based swaps as part of the gamma series. The
partial terminations of the intermediate gamma would be life cycle events of the intermediate
gamma that the registered clearing agency must report under existing Rule 901(e)(1)(i). Existing
Rule 901(e)(2) requires the registered clearing agency to report these life cycle events to the
same registered SDR to which it reported the intermediate gamma. Under new Rule 901(a)(2)(i),
as adopted today, the registered clearing agency also is required to report to a registered SDR
each new security-based swap comprising part of the gamma series. Because these securitybased swaps arise from the termination (or partial termination) of an existing security-based
swap (i.e., the intermediate gamma series), existing Rule 901(d)(10) requires the registered
clearing agency to link each new transaction in the gamma series to the intermediate gamma by
including the transaction ID of the intermediate gamma as part of the report of each new
security-based swap in the gamma series.
2.

Example 2: Cleared Platform Transaction

Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that the registered security-based swap
dealer and asset manager execute the bunched order alpha on a SB SEF.
a.

Reporting the Bunched Order Alpha

Because the initial transaction is executed on a platform and will be submitted to
clearing, the platform would have the duty under Rule 901(a)(1), as adopted today, to report the
bunched order alpha to a registered SDR. To satisfy this reporting obligation, the platform must

129

provide the information required by Rule 901(a)(1). Even if the platform does not know and
thus cannot report the counterparty IDs of each account that will receive an allocation, the
platform would know the identity of the execution agent who executed the bunched order alpha
on behalf of its advised accounts. The platform, therefore, would report the execution agent ID
of the execution agent, even though it might not know the intended counterparties of the
security-based swaps that will result from the allocation. 320 Existing Rule 902(a) requires the
registered SDR that receives the report of the bunched order alpha from the platform to publicly
disseminate a report of the bunched order alpha. Then, pursuant to existing Rule 906(a), the
registered SDR would be required to obtain any missing UICs from its participants. 321
b.

Reporting the Security-Based Swaps Resulting From Allocation

If the asset manager provides allocation instructions prior to or contemporaneous with the
clearing of the bunched order alpha, clearing would (under the agency model of clearing) result
in the creation of a beta (i.e., the clearing transaction between the registered clearing agency and
320

See Rule 901(d)(1) (requiring reporting of the counterparty ID “or the execution agent ID
of each counterparty, if applicable”). If the counterparties—i.e., the specific accounts
who will receive allocations—are not yet known, the requirement to report the execution
agent ID instead of the counterparty ID would apply. Similarly, if the asset manager uses
an execution agent to access the platform, the platform would report the identity of the
asset manager’s execution agent.

321

One commenter stated that a registered SDRs will be unable to compel non-reporting
sides to become “onboarded users” of the SDR; the commenter recommended, therefore,
that the Commission require any reports, such as those required by Rule 906(a), “to only
be provided to onboarded users.” DTCC/ICE/CME Letter at 2. In the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, the Commission resolved the issue of whether a non-reporting side
becomes a participant of a registered SDR: it does, if the non-reporting side falls within
Rule 908(b) and the transaction was reported to the registered SDR on a mandatory basis.
See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14645 (“The Commission recognizes
that some non-reporting sides may not wish to connect directly to a registered SDR
because they may not want to incur the costs of establishing a direct connection. Rule
906(a) does not prescribe the means registered SDRs must use to obtain information from
non-reporting sides”).

130

the registered security-based swap dealer) and a “gamma series” (i.e., the gammas between the
clearing agency and each of the asset manager’s clients). The beta and each security-based swap
that comprises the gamma series would be no different—and would not be treated differently
under Regulation SBSR—from other clearing transactions.
If the asset manager does not provide allocation instructions until after the bunched order
alpha is cleared, clearing (under the agency model) would result in the creation of a beta
(between the registered clearing agency and the security-based swap dealer) and an intermediate
gamma (between the registered clearing agency and the side representing the clients of the asset
manager). The registered clearing agency would then be required to report the termination of the
bunched order alpha and the creation of the beta and intermediate gamma, pursuant to Rules
901(e)(1)(ii) and 901(a)(2)(i), as adopted today. From this point on, the beta would be treated
the same as any other clearing transaction, while the intermediate gamma would be decremented
and replaced by the gamma series, as described in Example 1.
C.

Comments Received

The Commission received two comments that generally supported the guidance on the
proposed rules for the reporting and public dissemination of a bunched order execution that is
executed on a platform and will be submitted to clearing, and the security-based swap clearing
transactions that result from the allocation. 322

322

See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 28 (supporting “the requirement for a reporting side to report
a bunched order executed off-platform, proposed rule 901(a)(1) that would require a
platform to report a bunched order alpha executed on its facility, and proposed rule
901(a)(2)(i) that would require a registered clearing agency to report a cleared bunched
order, if applicable, and the allocations that result from the cleared bunched order” and
stating that “a bunched order should be subject to public dissemination instead of the
related allocations”); ICE Trade Vault Letter at 7 (supporting inclusion of the transaction
131

One of these commenters raised concerns, however, about the application of the guidance
to cross-border situations where the identity of the asset manager’s clients (i.e., the direct
counterparties to the security-based swaps that result from the allocation) is not known at the
time of bunched order execution, particularly if the Commission requires compliance with
Regulation SBSR before security-based swap dealers have had the opportunity to register with
the Commission as such. 323 The commenter stated that “the Commission should be aware that in
advance of dealer registration determining whether a bunched order is subject to reporting under
SBSR can only be based on the reporting side’s understanding of the execution agent’s status as
a U.S. person. The U.S. person status of the funds to which the bunched order will be allocated
will determine whether the allocations are subject to reporting and will have no bearing on
whether the bunched order is reported.” 324 The Commission shares the commenter’s concern
that there be clear and workable solutions for reporting transactions under Regulation SBSR
even under complex cross-border scenarios. The Commission also notes that, as discussed
below, 325 compliance with Regulation SBSR will be required independent of when securitybased swap dealers register as such with the Commission.
In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission proposed a new subparagraph (v) to
existing Rule 908(a)(1) that would subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination any
transaction in connection with a non-U.S. person’s security-based swap dealing activity that is
arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of such non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch

ID of the bunched order execution on each security-based swap resulting from its
allocation as a “critical data element necessary to improve data quality”).

or office, or by personnel of an agent of such non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office
(an “ANE transaction”). New Rule 908(a)(1)(v)—which is being adopted today 326—coupled
with the existing provisions of Rule 908(a)(1), will further clarify how the guidance discussed
above applies to various cross-border scenarios, as illustrated in the following examples:
•

If the dealing entity who executes the bunched order with the asset
manager/execution agent is a U.S. person, whether registered or unregistered, the
bunched order execution is subject to both regulatory reporting and public
dissemination because of the U.S.-person status of the dealing entity, regardless of
the U.S.-person status of the asset manager/execution agent or of the
funds/accounts that later receive allocations.

•

If the dealing entity who executes the bunched order with the asset manager is a
non-U.S. person but the bunched order execution is an ANE transaction, the
bunched order execution is again subject to both regulatory reporting and public
dissemination, regardless of the U.S.-person status of the asset manager/execution
agent or of the funds/accounts that later receive allocations.

•

If all of the funds/accounts that could be eligible to receive allocations are U.S.
persons, the bunched order execution is subject to both regulatory reporting and
public dissemination because of the U.S.-person status of the funds/accounts,
regardless of the U.S.-person status of the dealing entity or the location of the
personnel (or agent) of the dealing entity. In other words, however the asset
manager/execution agent allocates the bunched order execution in this example,
there is no scenario where any part of the bunched order execution could be

326

See infra Section IX(C).

133

viewed as involving a non-U.S. person. Therefore, the initial bunched order
execution involving the dealing entity on one side necessarily has a U.S. person
on the other side, and the initial bunched order execution is subject to both
regulatory reporting and public dissemination.
The Commission acknowledges that a more complex situation arises if the bunched order
execution is between an unregistered non-U.S. person who is not engaging in ANE activity and
an asset manager/execution agent acting on behalf of funds/accounts at least some of which are
non-U.S. persons. In some cases, the status of the initial bunched order execution would be
resolved if the asset manager/execution agent ultimately makes allocations only to
funds/accounts that are U.S. persons. 327 In other cases, however, the asset manager/execution
agent 328 might make allocations to some funds/accounts that are non-U.S. persons or might not,
in unusual cases, make any allocations until more than 24 hours after the time of execution of the
initial bunched order. Ordinarily, the U.S.-person status of the asset manager/execution agent is
not determinative of whether the bunched order execution is subject to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination under Rule 908(a)(1)(i) or any other provision of Rule 908(a). 329 In this
327

The Commission understands from discussions with market participants that allocation
determinations are generally made within 24 hours after execution. In such cases, the
asset manager/execution agent would know that all of the security-based swaps resulting
from allocation—as well as the initial bunched order execution—are subject to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination, because of the U.S.-person status of all of
fund/account counterparties, before a transaction report for the initial bunched order
execution is due, at least during the first interim phase of security-based swap reporting.

328

The Commission notes that some transactions could involve more than one execution
agent, and that the execution agent IDs of all execution agents of each direct counterparty
would be required to be reported. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at
14583 (“The Commission notes that some security-based transactions may involve
multiple agents”).

329

Existing Rule 908(a)(1)(i) provides that a security-based swap shall be subject to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination if there “is a direct or indirect counterparty
134

limited situation, however, the Commission believes that it would be reasonable for the sides to
look to the U.S.-person status of the asset manager/execution agent to resolve whether or not the
bunched order execution should be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination.
Given that the true counterparties might be unknown or unknowable when the transaction report
for the bunched order execution is due, the U.S.-person status of the asset manager/execution
agent can serve as a reasonable proxy. Even if some or all of the allocation is subsequently made
to funds/accounts that are not U.S. persons, it would not be inconsistent with Regulation SBSR if
a regulatory report and public dissemination of the initial bunched order execution, including the
full notional size, is made. Furthermore, if the asset manager/execution agent is not a U.S.
person and the counterparties determine not to report the transaction on that basis, and if
allocations are made to one or more funds/accounts that are U.S. persons, those security-based
swaps resulting from the allocation would have to be reported, and the Commission would still
have at least partial understanding of the overall transaction. 330 The Commission staff intends to
evaluate this issue after required reporting commences.
D.

Conforming Amendment to Rule 901(d)(4)

that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of the transaction.” The execution agent/asset
manager would not be a counterparty to the executed bunched order unless it was the
primary obligor or a guarantor for the bunched order execution. See Rule 900(i)
(defining “counterparty” for purposes of Regulation SBSR). If the asset
manager/execution agent is the primary obligor or a guarantor of the security-based swap,
it would be a counterparty and the outcome of the reporting hierarchy would have to
reflect this fact.
330

The commenter observed that, “due to cross-border considerations the aggregate notional
of a bunched order will not always tie out completely in reported SBSR data to the sum
of the notional of its related allocations.” ISDA/SIFMA Letter 28. This could occur if,
for example, the initial bunched order execution were reported to a registered SDR, but
certain security-based swaps resulting from the allocation were not, because they did not
fall within any of the prongs of Rule 908(a)(1). The Commission recognizes this
possibility. However, it does not appear that this would happen to such an extent as to
compromise the Commission’s ability to oversee the security-based swap market.

135

Existing Rule 901(d)(4) requires the reporting side to report, as applicable, the branch ID,
broker ID, execution agent ID, trader ID, and trading desk ID of the direct counterparty on the
reporting side. One commenter requested that, for bunched order executions, the reporting side
be excused from this requirement because the relevant information “can only be determined
upon allocation as any reported values would refer to applicable agreements with each party to
an allocation and not the execution agent. SBSR should explicitly absolve platforms, clearing
agencies and reporting sides from the obligation to report the information required by
§242.901(d)(4) for bunched orders.” 331
The Commission agrees and has decided to amend Rule 901(d)(4) so that it does not
apply to the initial bunched order execution, and instead applies only to the security-based swaps
that result from the allocation of that bunched order execution. The relevant agreements that are
to be reported pursuant to Rule 901(d)(4) are between the clients of the execution agent—i.e., the
funds that receive allocations—and the security-based swap dealer. The Commission believes
that it is unnecessary to require these agreements to be reported twice, once with the report of the
bunched order execution and once with the report of each security-based swap resulting from the
allocation of the original bunched order execution. Requiring the reporting of agreement
information for the bunched order execution could be challenging in instances when the clients
that will receive the allocated security-based swaps are not known at the time of execution of the
bunched order. Furthermore, the title and date of the relevant agreements will be included in the
reports of the security-based swaps resulting from the allocation. Therefore, the Commission

331

ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 28-29. The commenter noted that the Commission had not
proposed to require a platform to report the title and date of agreements incorporated by
reference for a bunched order alpha that will be submitted to clearing. See id. at 28.

136

does not believe it is necessary to require the names and dates of the agreements to be reported
with the initial bunched order execution.
VII.

Reporting and Public Dissemination of Prime Brokerage Transactions
A.

Background

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission discussed how
Regulation SBSR would apply to security-based swap transactions arising out of prime
brokerage arrangements. 332 The Commission understands that, under a typical prime brokerage
arrangement, a prime broker and a client enter into an agreement whereby the prime broker
facilitates the client’s participation in the security-based swap market by providing credit
intermediation services. The prime brokerage arrangement permits the client to negotiate and
agree to the terms of security-based swaps with one or more third-party “executing dealers,”
subject to limits and parameters specified in the prime brokerage agreement. An executing
dealer would negotiate a security-based swap with the client expecting that it would face the
prime broker, rather than the client, for the duration of the security-based swap. The executing
dealer and/or the client would submit the transaction that they have negotiated to the prime
broker. In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission set forth its
understanding that a typical prime brokerage transaction involved three security-based swap
transactions or “legs”: 333
•

Transaction 1. The client and the executing dealer negotiate and agree to the
terms of a security-based swap transaction (the “client/executing dealer

332

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14755-57.

333

See id. at 14755.

137

transaction”) and notify the prime broker of these terms. Transaction 1 is
terminated upon the creation of Transaction 2 and 3, as described below.
•

Transaction 2. If the terms of Transaction 1 are within the parameters established
by the prime brokerage arrangement, the prime broker accepts the transaction and
faces the executing dealer in a new security-based swap (the “prime
broker/executing dealer transaction”) having the same economic terms agreed to
by the executing dealer and the client in Transaction 1.

•

Transaction 3. Upon executing Transaction 2 with the executing dealer, the prime
broker will enter into an offsetting security-based swap with the client (the “prime
broker/client transaction”).

The Commission received three comments regarding this proposed interpretation. One
commenter disagreed with the Commission’s view that a typical prime brokerage transaction
comprises three legs, arguing that the negotiation of terms between the executing dealer and the
client does not result in a transaction between the executing dealer and the client. 334 The
commenter also stated that, if the prime broker did not accept the transaction, there would be no
security-based swap to report (i.e., there would not be a client/executing dealer transaction in the
absence of acceptance by the prime broker). 335 Accordingly, the commenter requested that the
Commission limit all reporting requirements arising from a prime brokerage arrangement to
Transactions 2 and 3. 336 Another commenter concurred that a typical prime brokerage
arrangement would result in only two legs, one between the prime broker and the executing

334

See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 20.

335

See id.

336

See id. at 21.

138

dealer and one between the client and the prime broker. 337 The commenter expressed the view
that there is not a transaction between the executing dealer and the client, 338 and that the initial
negotiation between the executing dealer and the client results in a security-based swap between
the executing dealer and the prime broker, with the client acting as the prime broker’s agent. 339
After considering these comments, the Commission is supplementing its views regarding
the application of Regulation SBSR to prime brokerage arrangements. The Commission
understands that the documentation used to structure a prime brokerage arrangement may vary.
As described more fully below, the documentation may provide that the client acts as agent for
the prime broker when negotiating the first leg with the executing dealer, resulting in a prime
brokerage structure comprised of two legs (the prime broker/executing dealer transaction and the
prime broker/client transaction). Alternatively, the documentation could provide that the
negotiation between the client and the executing dealer results in a transaction between those two
parties, 340 resulting in a prime brokerage structure comprised of three legs (the client/executing
dealer transaction, the prime broker/executing dealer transaction, and the prime broker/client
transaction). In cases where the client is acting as agent for the prime broker, the arrangement
would result in the following two legs:

337

See Memorandum from the Division of Trading and Markets regarding a November 13,
2015, meeting with representatives of SIFMA and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton
LLP (November 20, 2015), at slide 5.

338

See id. at slide 11.

339

See id. at slide 5.

340

For example, the client and executing dealer could agree in advance that, in the event of
rejection by the prime broker, they would preserve their contract without the involvement
of the prime broker. See ISDA, 2005 ISDA Compensation Agreement (“ISDA
Compensation Agreement”) at Section 2.

139

•

Transaction A. The client, acting as agent for the prime broker, and the executing
dealer negotiate a security-based swap transaction and notify the prime broker of its
terms. If the transaction does not satisfy the parameters in the prime brokerage
agreement, the prime broker may reject the transaction. If the prime broker accepts
the transaction, the prime broker and the executing dealer are counterparties to the
security-based swap.

•

Transaction B. If the prime broker accepts Transaction A, the prime broker also will
enter into an offsetting security-based swap with the client.

In cases where the documentation provides for a three-legged structure, the Commission
is making a minor modification to Rule 902(c) to account for the situation where a registered
SDR receives notice that the prime broker has rejected the transaction before the SDR has
received the initial transaction report. 341 The Commission discusses below the application of the
reporting and dissemination requirements as they apply to the two-legged structure and provides
additional clarification in response to comments.
B.

Reporting of Security-Based Swaps Resulting from Prime Brokerage
Arrangements

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission stated its
understanding that prime brokerage arrangements involve credit intermediation offered by the
prime broker, rather than a registered clearing agency; thus, prime brokerage transactions are not
cleared. 342 Therefore, the application of Regulation SBSR’s reporting and dissemination
requirements to a prime brokerage arrangement detailed below assumes none of the security-

341

See infra Section VII(D).

342

See 80 FR at 14755.

140

based swaps resulting from a prime brokerage arrangement is a clearing transaction, and that
none is intended to be cleared.
1.

If There Are Three Legs

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission set forth its
proposed interpretation of the application of Regulation SBSR to the three-legged prime
brokerage structure. 343 The Commission is finalizing this interpretation substantially as
proposed.
Because Transaction 1 (i.e., the client/executing dealer transaction) is not a clearing
transaction and it is not intended to be cleared, the reporting hierarchy in existing Rule
901(a)(2)(ii) assigns the reporting duty for Transaction 1. If the prime broker accepts the
transaction, the prime broker would initiate Transactions 2 and 3, which would have the effect of
terminating Transaction 1. The termination would be a life cycle event of Transaction 1, and
existing Rule 901(e)(2) requires the reporting side for Transaction 1 (likely the executing dealer)
to report this life cycle event to the same registered SDR to which it reported Transaction 1. 344
Transactions 2 and 3 (i.e., the prime broker/executing dealer transaction and the prime
broker/client transaction, respectively) also are security-based swaps that must be reported
pursuant to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii). Because each of these transactions is a security-based swap that
arises from the termination of another security-based swap (i.e., Transaction 1), existing Rule
901(d)(10) requires the reporting of Transaction 1’s transaction ID as part of the secondary trade
information for each of Transaction 2 and Transaction 3.
2.

If There Are Two Legs

343

See id. at 14755-57.

344

One commenter agreed with this approach, stating that the reporting obligation should
remain with the original reporting side. See LCH.Clearnet Letter at 11.

141

The Commission is providing the following interpretation of the application of the
reporting requirements of Regulation SBSR in cases where the documentation provides for a
two-legged structure.
Existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) assigns the reporting duty for Transaction A (i.e., the prime
broker/executing dealer transaction), because Transaction A is not a clearing transaction and it is
not intended to be cleared. When the client, acting as agent for the prime broker, executes
Transaction A with the executing dealer, the sides (i.e., the executing dealer and the prime
broker) would determine the reporting side pursuant to the hierarchy set forth in existing Rule
901(a)(2)(ii). The reporting side would have up to 24 hours after the time of execution to report
the applicable primary and secondary trade information of Transaction A. The client would be
disclosed as the execution agent of the prime broker pursuant to Rule 901(d)(2) (if the prime
broker is the reporting side) or Rule 906(a) (if the prime broker is not the reporting side).
If the prime broker accepts the transaction, the prime broker would initiate Transaction B
between itself and the client. The reporting side for Transaction B also would be determined
pursuant to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii). The reporting side would have up to 24 hours after the time of
execution to report the applicable primary and secondary trade information of Transaction B.
C.

Public Dissemination of Prime Brokerage Transactions

Existing Rule 902(a) requires public dissemination of each security-based swap, unless it
falls within a category enumerated in Rule 902(c). If the documentation of the prime brokerage
agreement is such that there are three security-based swaps, then each of the three is subject to
public dissemination; if the documentation of the prime brokerage agreement is such that there
are only two security-based swaps, both are subject to public dissemination.

142

If a prime broker rejects either Transaction 1 or Transaction A, the registered SDR would
handle dissemination of information regarding the termination of the first transaction in the same
manner as an alpha that has been rejected from clearing. 345
One commenter reiterated an earlier request that the Commission exempt the prime
broker/client leg of a prime broker transaction from public dissemination, arguing that
dissemination of this transaction would provide misleading price data without providing any
further transparency on costs related to prime brokerage. 346 The commenter argued that the
prime broker’s service fee is not relevant to security-based swap pricing. 347 In the Regulation
SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that publicly
disseminating reports of each leg of a prime brokerage transaction could provide market
observers with useful information about the cost of the prime broker’s credit intermediation
services, because prime brokers may charge for these services by pricing the executing
dealer/prime broker transaction differently than the prime broker/client transaction. 348 The
Commission also noted that, with prime brokerage transactions, the only mechanism for
ascertaining the charge for the credit intermediation service offered by the prime broker would
be to compare the prices of Transaction 1 with the prices of any subsequent transaction. 349
In response, the commenter noted that prime brokers might not in all cases include their
fees in transaction prices and stated that, if the fees charged for prime brokerage services were

obtained by requesting it from a [prime broker].” 350 The Commission, however, continues to
believe that disseminating each leg of a prime brokerage arrangement will enhance price
discovery by helping market observers to distinguish between the price of a security-based swap
and the cost of credit intermediation. Market participants should not have to request information
from a prime broker regarding the manner in which the cost of a prime broker’s credit
intermediation service might affect the price of a security-based swap when the mandate of
Section 13(m)(1)(C) provides all market observers with the ability to observe the prices directly.
Even if the fees charged for prime brokerage services are not always reflected in transaction
prices, at least some transaction prices will include the cost of credit intermediation. Therefore,
the Commission believes that none of the legs of a prime brokerage transaction should be
excluded from public dissemination.
In this regard, the Commission notes that Rule 907(a)(4) requires the policies and
procedures of a registered SDR, in relevant part, to identify characteristics of a security-based
swap that could, in the fair and reasonable estimation of the registered SDR, cause a person
without knowledge of those characteristics to receive a distorted view of the market. The
Commission believes that it would be difficult to comply with that requirements of the rule if a
registered SDR did not identify whether individual security-based swaps are related legs of a
prime brokerage transaction. If market observers are not given the ability to identify the two or
three legs of a prime brokerage transaction as related, it would be difficult for market observers
to avoid developing a distorted view of the market. 351

One commenter acknowledged that a prime brokerage flag had “potential value” for
regulatory reporting but strongly disagreed with the Commission’s view that a prime brokerage
flag should be publicly disseminated. 352 The commenter argued that the market for securitybased swap prime brokerage services is limited, so a prime brokerage flag would have a “high
probability of compromising the anonymity” of executing dealers and prime brokers. 353 The
Commission considered similar issues in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release relating to
thinly traded security-based swaps. 354 There, the Commission declined to provide any exception
to public dissemination based on the fact that only a small number of market makers were active
in particular segments of the market. Here, the Commission declines to make any exception to
its approach to public dissemination of prime brokerage transactions. Absent a prime brokerage
flag, market observers would have no ability to know that the separate legs of a single prime
brokerage transaction are related, and would incorrectly conclude that there was more market
activity than in fact occurred.
Finally, one commenter noted that a prime broker/client leg might be a bunched order
execution where the allocations “are provided upfront,” and argued that the dissemination of
these multiple transactions would not enhance price discovery. 355 In the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, the Commission provided guidance regarding how a bunched order execution
must be reported and publicly disseminated (assuming that the bunched order execution is not
cleared): The initial bunched order execution and any security-based swaps that result from
allocating the bunched order execution are subject to regulatory reporting, while only the

145

bunched order execution is subject to public dissemination. 356 Thus, the Commission agrees
with the commenter that the security-based swaps resulting from the allocation of a prime
broker/client transaction should not be publicly disseminated. However, the initial bunched
order execution between the prime broker and the client is subject to public dissemination.
D.

If the Prime Broker Rejects the Initial Security-Based Swap

Under either the two-leg or three-leg prime brokerage arrangements described above, the
prime broker could reject the initial transaction negotiated between the client and the executing
dealer. The Commission is providing guidance regarding how Regulation SBSR applies to this
possibility.
The effect of the rejection by the prime broker would depend on what, if any, contractual
agreement exists between the executing dealer and its client. In some cases, the client and the
executing dealer could have a pre-existing agreement that would allow them to revise the
security-based swap with new terms if the prime broker rejects a transaction that they have
negotiated. 357 If there is such an agreement and the client and executing dealer elect to preserve
a security-based swap between them, the result would have to be reported in one of two ways. If
the governing documentation provides that there are only two security-based swaps that could
result from the prime brokerage arrangement (i.e., the initial leg is between the prime broker and
the executing dealer, with the client acting as agent for the prime broker), the rejection by the
prime broker would have the effect of terminating this leg, and the termination would have to be
reported by the reporting side of the initial leg. The security-based swap arising between the
client and the executing dealer would, because there are new counterparties, be a new security356

See 80 FR at 14625-27. See also Rule 902(c)(7) (requiring a registered SDR to refrain
from disseminating any information regarding the allocation of a security-based swap).

357

See, e.g., ISDA Compensation Agreement, at Section 2.

146

based swap, and the reporting side for this security-based swap would be determined by the
reporting hierarchy. On the other hand, if the governing documentation provides that three
security-swaps would result from the prime brokerage arrangement and the client and executing
dealer intend to preserve the security-based swap with different terms, the rejection by the prime
broker and the amendment with the new terms would have to be reported as a life cycle event of
the initial leg (presumably by executing dealer). If there is no pre-existing agreement between
the client and the executing dealer that would allow for an amendment to the initially negotiated
leg or such an agreement exists but the client and executing dealer elect not to keep the securitybased swap in existence, the prime broker’s rejection would terminate the initial leg and the
reporting side of the initial leg would have to report the termination.
If rejection by the prime broker results in a termination, one of two things must occur
next. If the registered SDR that received the report of the initial leg has already disseminated it,
the SDR must then disseminate a follow-up report indicating that the initial security-based swap
has been terminated. 358 However, situations could arise where the registered SDR had not yet
disseminated a report of the initial leg when it receives notice of the termination. 359 As noted in

358

See Rule 902(a) (requiring, in relevant part, dissemination of life cycle events when there
are changes to information provided under Rule 901(c)); Rule 907(a)(3) (requiring a
registered SDR, in relevant part, to have written policies and procedures for flagging
transaction reports involving life cycle events).

359

For example, assume that the prime brokerage agreement provides for a three-legged
structure and the executing dealer is the reporting side for the initial leg between itself
and the client. However, there is no pre-existing agreement between the client and
executing dealer that would allow for the terms of the initial leg to be renegotiated if the
prime broker rejects the transaction. Assume further that the executing dealer does not
immediately report the initial leg. See Rule 901(j) (generally allowing up to 24 hours
after the time of execution to report a security-based swap). When the client and the
executing dealer convey the results of their negotiation to the prime broker, the prime
broker rejects the transaction. The executing dealer may simultaneously report to a
147

Section III(J), supra, the Commission is adopting a new subparagraph (8) to existing Rule 902(c)
providing that a registered SDR shall not publicly disseminate “[a]ny information regarding a
security-based swap that has been rejected from clearing or rejected by a prime broker if the
original transaction report has not yet been publicly disseminated.” Therefore, if the registered
SDR had not disseminated the transaction report for Transaction 1/Transaction A at the time that
it receives the report of the termination of that transaction, the registered SDR would not
disseminate any information regarding Transaction 1/Transaction A. Conversely, if the
registered SDR had disseminated a transaction report of Transaction 1/Transaction A before
receiving the termination report for that transaction, the registered SDR would disseminate a
report of the termination of Transaction 1/Transaction A.
VIII. Prohibition on Registered SDRs from Charging Fees for or Imposing Usage
Restrictions on Publicly Disseminated Data
A.

Background

Existing Rule 902(a) requires a registered SDR to publicly disseminate a transaction
report of a security-based swap, or a life cycle event or adjustment due to a life cycle event,
immediately upon receipt of information about the security-based swap, with certain exceptions
noted in existing Rule 902(c). Existing Rule 900(cc) defines “publicly disseminate” to mean “to
make available through the Internet or other electronic data feed that is widely accessible and in
machine-readable electronic format.” In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release,
the Commission stated its preliminary belief that a registered SDR should not be permitted to
charge fees for the security-based swap transaction data that it is required to publicly disseminate

registered SDR the terms of the initial leg and the fact that it has been rejected by the
prime broker and terminated.

148

pursuant to Regulation SBSR. 360 Accordingly, the Commission proposed new Rule 900(tt),
which would define the term “widely accessible”—as used in the definition of “publicly
disseminate” in existing Rule 900(cc)—to mean “widely available to users of the information on
a non-fee basis.” As discussed in the SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, this proposed
definition of “widely accessible” would have the effect of prohibiting a registered SDR from
charging fees for, or imposing usage restrictions on, the security-based swap transaction data that
it is required to publicly disseminate under Regulation SBSR. 361
In proposing this requirement, the Commission considered the statutory requirements to
establish post-trade transparency in the security-based swap market, the CFTC’s rules for public
dissemination, and comments received in response to Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed
and as re-proposed. Title VII contains numerous provisions directing the Commission to
establish a regime for post-trade transparency in the security-based swap market, which are
designed to give the public pricing, volume, and other relevant information about all executed
security-based swap transactions. 362 In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release,
the Commission expressed the preliminary view that the statutory requirement to make this
transaction information publicly available would be frustrated if registered SDRs could charge
members of the public for the right to access the disseminated data. 363
The Commission also expressed the preliminary belief that it is necessary to prohibit a
registered SDR from charging users of regulatorily mandated security-based swap transaction

data for public dissemination of the data to reinforce existing Rule 903(b). 364 Rule 903(b)
provides that a registered SDR may disseminate information using UICs (such as product IDs or
other codes, such as reference entity identifiers, that are embedded within the product IDs) or
permit UICs to be used for reporting by its participants only if the information necessary to
interpret such UICs is widely available on a non-fee basis. The Commission continues to be
concerned that a registered SDR that wished to charge (or allow others to charge) users for the
information necessary to understand these UICs—but could not, because of Rule 903(b)—might
seek to do so indirectly by recharacterizing the charge as being for public dissemination. Under
these circumstances, the economic benefit to the registered SDR would be the same, but the
manner in which the registered SDR characterizes the fee—i.e., whether as a charge to users for
public dissemination or as a charge of accessing the UICs within the publicly disseminated
data—would be the difference between the fee being permissible or impermissible under Rule
903(b). Accordingly, the Commission took the preliminary view that permitting a registered
SDR to charge users for receiving the publicly disseminated transaction data could undermine
the purposes of Rule 903(b).
The CFTC, in adopting its own rules for public dissemination of swap transactions,
addressed the issue of whether a swap data repository could be allowed to charge for its publicly
disseminated data. In Section 43.2 of its rules, 365 the CFTC defined “public dissemination” and
“publicly disseminate” to mean “to publish and make available swap transaction and pricing data
in a non-discriminatory manner, through the Internet or other electronic data feed that is widely
published and in machine-readable electronic format.” The CFTC also defined “widely
364

365

17 CFR 43.2.

150

published” to mean “to publish and make available through electronic means and in a manner
that is freely available and readily accessible to the public.” 366 Section 43.3(d)(2) of the CFTC
rules provides: “Data that is publicly disseminated . . . shall be available from an Internet Web
site in a format that is freely available and readily accessible to the public.” The CFTC stated
that “implicit in this mandate [of public dissemination] is the requirement that the data be made
available to the public at no cost,” 367 and that “Section 43.3(d)(2) reflects the [CFTC]’s belief
that data must be made freely available to market participants and the public, on a
nondiscriminatory basis.” 368 Although prohibiting fees on the data that swap data repositories
are required to publicly disseminate, the CFTC’s rules permit a swap data repository to offer, for
a fee, value-added data products derived from the freely available regulatorily mandated public
data and to charge fair and reasonable fees to providers of swap transaction and pricing data. 369

Comments Received and Final Rule

The Commission received six comments on whether registered SDRs should be permitted
to charge fees or impose usage restrictions on publicly disseminated data. 370 Several
commenters generally agreed with prohibiting an SDR from charging fees or imposing usage
restrictions on the transaction data that it is required to publicly disseminate. 371 However, one

commenter argued against imposing a prohibition against usage restrictions 372 and another
requested that the Commission clarify the applicability of the prohibition. 373 After carefully
considering all of the comments received, the Commission is adopting Rule 900(tt) as proposed
and provides clarification, below, regarding application of the rule.
The Commission stated in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release that the
requirement that information be “widely available to users of the information on a non-fee basis”
necessarily implies that a registered SDR would not be permitted to impose—or allow to be
imposed—any usage restrictions on the security-based swap transaction information that it is
required to publicly disseminate, including restrictions on access to or further distribution of the
regulatorily mandated public security-based swap data. 374 One commenter agreed with this
view 375 and another disagreed, the latter stating that a registered SDR should be able to manage
redistribution of data it disseminates. 376 The commenter noted that a limitation on usage
restrictions for publicly disseminated data would prevent a registered SDR from monetizing a
potential revenue stream. 377 In addition, the commenter was concerned about claims related to
data redistributed by others. 378 The commenter argued that a registered SDR should be
permitted to impose various usage restrictions on its publicly disseminated data, such as a
requirement to attribute the SDR as the source of the data, a restriction of the data to internal use,

and a prohibition on redistribution of the data “without first engaging the SB SDR and agreeing
on licensing terms.” 379
The Commission continues to believe that public dissemination would not satisfy the
“widely available” standard in Rule 900(tt) if a registered SDR could deny access to users who
do not agree to limit their use of the data in a manner directed by the registered SDR. Here, the
Commission notes the asymmetric bargaining strength of the parties: A registered SDR has a
monopoly position over the security-based swap transaction data that it is required to publicly
disseminate, because the public has no access to that information until it is publicly
disseminated. If a registered SDR could impose usage restrictions with which a user does not
wish to comply, there would be no other source from which the user could freely obtain this
transaction information.
The prohibition on usage restrictions would also prohibit an SDR-imposed restriction on
bulk redistribution by third parties of the regulatorily mandated transaction data that the
registered SDR publicly disseminates. Despite the objections of one commenter, 380 the
Commission continues to believe that it could prove useful to the public for intermediaries to
collect, consolidate, and redistribute the regulatorily mandated transaction data to the public.
Users of the data might, instead of obtaining data directly from each of several SDRs, find it

Id. at 19. See also id. at 15 (“Typical restrictions on the use of data obtained from the
trade repository’s public dissemination might include restricting data to internal use
without a license and limiting publishing, redistributing, databasing, archiving, creating
derivative works, or using the data to compete with the trade repository or in a manner
otherwise adverse to the trade repository. These are relatively standard clauses in data
licenses”). Even if these restrictions are “standard clauses in data licenses,” the
Commission notes that they are not permitted under Regulation SBSR, in light of the
amendments being adopted today.

153

preferable to obtain the data from a single person who itself obtains the data directly from the
multiple registered SDRs and consolidates it. The Commission continues to believe that
allowing unencumbered redistribution best serves the policy goals of wide availability of the data
and minimization of information asymmetries in the security-based swap market. Because the
Commission is prohibiting registered SDRs from imposing a restriction on bulk redistribution,
third parties (as well as registered SDRs themselves, as discussed below) will be able to take in
the full data set and scrub, reconfigure, aggregate, analyze, repurpose, or otherwise add value to
those data, and potentially sell that value-added product to others.
The Commission acknowledges the concern of the commenter who stated that “SB SDRs
must be able to protect themselves from claims related to data sourced or scraped from the trade
repository and redistributed by others where there are quality issues with respect to data
redistributed.” 381 However, a registered SDR may not, consistent with its duty to publicly
disseminate under Rule 902(a) when read in connection with Rule 900(tt), require a user of the
data to “agree” to any terms purporting to disclaim the SDR’s responsibility for incorrect data
before the user may access the regulatorily mandated public security-based swap data, as this
would constitute a usage restriction. The Commission declines to make an exception for usage
restrictions that are designed to limit a registered SDR’s potential liability to third parties. The
Commission believes that unencumbered access best serves the policy goals of wide availability
of the data and minimization of information asymmetries in the security-based swap market, and
that the speculative risk of SDR liability does not justify foregoing the public benefits of
promoting free and unrestricted access to the security-based swap transaction data that registered
SDRs are required to disseminate.
381

Id. at 15.

154

The Commission recognizes that establishing and operating a registered SDR entails
various costs. The Commission does not believe, however, that prohibiting a registered SDR
from charging for data that it is required to publicly disseminate will impede its ability to carry
out these functions because other viable sources of revenue are available to registered SDRs.
One such source may be fees imposed on persons who are required to report transactions to the
SDR. Thus, the Commission believes that, with the adopted definition of “widely accessible,” a
registered SDR will have adequate sources of funding even if it is prohibited from charging users
fees for receiving the security-based swap transaction data that the SDR is required to publicly
disseminate. 382
C.

Other Interpretive Issues

Two commenters advocated that a registered SDR be permitted to offer value-added
services related to publicly disseminated data. 383 One of these commenters stated, for example,
that a registered SDR “should be permitted to commercialize aggregated SB swap data and
charge fees for value-added data products that incorporate the regulatorily mandated transaction
data.” 384 As the Commission stated in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 385

382

One commenter, responding to the Commission’s request for comment on what means
exist for registered SDRs to recoup their operating costs, stated: “Non-reporting sides
should be charged a minimum monthly fee for system access. This minimum charge
reflects the fact that non-reporting and small volume participants tend to require equal
levels of support and other resources relative to moderate and high volume participants.”
ICE Letter at 7. This issue is beyond the scope of this rulemaking, although the
Commission notes that existing Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act requires an
SDR to ensure that any dues, fees, or other charges imposed by the SDR are fair and
reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory.

383

See DTCC Letter at 14-15, 18-19; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 29.

384

likely be better equipped to bear the costs associated with operating a Commissionregistered SB SDR. In turn, to the extent that such commercialization offsets the costs of

existing Rule 902(a) does not prohibit a registered SDR from creating and charging fees for a
value-added data product that incorporates the regulatorily mandated transaction data, provided
that the registered SDR has first satisfied its duty under Rule 902(a) to publicly disseminate the
regulatorily mandated transaction data in accordance with the definition of “widely accessible.”
To comply with Rule 902(a), a registered SDR must publicly disseminate a transaction report of
a security-based swap (assuming that the transaction does not fall within Rule 902(c))
immediately upon receipt of information about the security-based swap. Thus, a registered SDR
would not be permitted to make its value-added product available before it publicly disseminated
the regulatorily mandated transaction report because such dissemination would not comply with
the requirement in Rule 902(a) that a registered SDR publicly disseminate a transaction report of
a security-based swap immediately upon receipt of information about the security-based swap.
This approach is consistent with parallel CFTC rules that require regulatorily mandated
data to be freely available to the public but do not prohibit a CFTC-registered swap data
repository from making commercial use of such data subsequent to its public dissemination. 386
This approach also allows potential competitors in the market for value-added security-based
swap data products to obtain the regulatorily mandated transaction information from registered
SDRs that have a monopoly on this information until it is publicly disseminated. 387 Potential
competitors to the registered SDR could be at a disadvantage if, needing the raw data for their
own services, they had to purchase a value-added data product from the registered SDR or could

reduced”).

notes, finally, that any value-added data product offered by an SDR may be subject to certain
SDR rules. 388
A final commenter “ask[ed] the Commission to clarify that the restrictions on user fees
and usage in Proposed Rule 900(tt) extends only to data that is disseminated by SDRs in a posttrade context.” 389 The commenter further stated: “We note and ask the Commission to confirm
that certain information contained in publicly-disseminated SBS transaction records may be
proprietary and therefore subject to usage restrictions in pre-trade contexts . . . We believe this
clarification is needed because in its absence, we have reason to expect some market participants
to infer that because SDRs may not impose usage restrictions on information contained in a
publicly-disseminated SBS record, that all such limitations on user fees and usage restrictions,
i.e., in pre-trade contexts, are similarly prohibited. However, we do not believe that it is the
Commission’s intention . . . to eliminate all user fees and usage restrictions on information
contained in publicly disseminated SBS data.” 390 The commenter further stated that there would

See, e.g., Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i) (requiring that any dues, fees, or other charges imposed by
an SDR are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory); Rule

offered by the SDR separately); Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(iii) (requiring an SDR to establish,
monitor on an ongoing basis, and enforce clearly stated objective criteria that would
permit fair, open, and not unreasonably discriminatory access to services offered and data
maintained by the SDR).

not be any significant benefit to post-trade transparency from restrictions on user fees and usage
in pre-trade contexts. 391
The Commission declines to make the clarification requested by the commenter. In fact,
it is the Commission’s intention to eliminate all fees and usage restrictions on the information
that a registered SDR is required to publicly disseminate. In the Commission’s view, the
commenter’s distinction between “post-trade contexts”—where fees and usage restrictions could
not be imposed—and “pre-trade contexts”—where, according to the commenter, they could be
imposed—would be unworkable. The Commission intends for market observers to be able to
take in the security-based swap transaction data that are publicly disseminated by registered
SDRs on a mandatory basis and scrub, reconfigure, aggregate, analyze, repurpose, or otherwise
add value to that publicly disseminated data in any manner that they see fit, without fear that
doing so might subject them to liability to a third party for violating a license agreement. 392 It
would be difficult if not impossible for a market observer to explain that its use of particular
codes derives only from the “post-trade context” when utilization of the same codes “in the pretrade context” might render the market observer liable to the third party who claims to own
intellectual property in the code. When proposing the requirement that the information
mandatorily disseminated by a registered SDR be “widely available on a non-fee basis,” the
Commission stated that the requirement “necessarily implies that a registered SDR would not be
permitted to impose—or allow to be imposed—any usage restrictions on the security-based swap

For example, a third party could take in data that are publicly disseminated by one or
more registered SDRs and develop its own value-added product. The third party would
be entitled to include in its own value-added product any UICs that are included in the
information publicly disseminated by any registered SDR pursuant to Rule 902.

158

transaction data that it is required to publicly disseminate.” 393 Thus, if a registered SDR requires
or permits the use of any code or other data element where there is a reasonable threat that a
third-party holder of rights in that code or in other data elements might attempt to enforce those
rights against market observers, the registered SDR would not be acting consistent with Rule 903
by requiring or permitting use of that code for reporting or publicly disseminating security-based
swap transaction information pursuant to Regulation SBSR. If license restrictions or any other
contractual restrictions in the “pre-trade context” could in any way impede usage of the data in a
“post-trade context,” then any codes or other data elements that have license restrictions may not
be used under Rule 903.

Cross-Border Matters
A.

Introduction

In November 2010, 394 the Commission proposed Rule 908(a) to define the scope of
cross-border transactions that would be subject to Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements, and proposed Rule 901(a) to establish a reporting hierarchy
for identifying the person that would have the duty to report the security-based swap in a variety
of contexts, including cross-border contexts. In May 2013, the Commission re-proposed Rules
901 and 908 with substantial revisions as part of the Cross-Border Proposing Release. 395 The
393

Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14761 (emphasis added).

394

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, supra note 5.

395

See supra note 5. Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, would have required regulatory
reporting of any security-based swap that is “executed in the United States or through any
means of interstate commerce.” See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at
75287. When the Commission re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(i) in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, the Commission expressed concern that the language in the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release could have unduly required a security-based swap
to be reported if it had only the slightest connection with the United States. See CrossBorder Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31061.
159

Commission adopted modified versions of re-proposed Rules 901 and 908 as part of Regulation
SBSR. 396 When doing so, the Commission identified certain transactions involving non-U.S.
persons that would not be addressed by Rules 901(a) and 908, as adopted in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release, and stated its intention to seek additional comment regarding how
Regulation SBSR should apply to those transactions. In April 2015, the Commission addressed
those transactions in the U.S. Activity Proposal, which included proposed amendments to Rules
901(a), 908, and related rules in Regulation SBSR. These amendments would, among other
things, apply Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to
security-based swap transactions of a non-U.S. dealing entity that are arranged, negotiated, or
executed by personnel of the non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office, or by the
personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office. 397 In addition, the Commission solicited
comment on whether certain transactions of non-U.S. persons whose obligations under a
security-based swap are guaranteed by a U.S. person should be exempt from the public
dissemination requirement. 398
The Commission received 16 comments regarding the U.S. Activity Proposal, of which
seven discussed the proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR. In February 2016, the
Commission adopted rules that require a foreign dealing entity to count against its de minimis
threshold transactions with non-U.S. persons where the foreign dealing entity is engaging in

ANE activity. 399 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is adopting substantially as
proposed the amendments to Regulation SBSR proposed in the U.S. Activity Proposal.
B.

Existing Rules 901 and 908

Existing Rule 908(a)(1) requires regulatory reporting and public dissemination of any
security-based swap transaction that (1) has a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person
on either or both sides of the transaction, or (2) is accepted for clearing by a clearing agency
having its principal place of business in the United States. Existing Rule 908(a)(2) requires
regulatory reporting but not public dissemination of a transaction that has a direct or indirect
counterparty that is a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based
swap participant on either or both sides of the transaction but does not otherwise fall within Rule
908(a)(1). In other words, Rule 908(a)(2) applies to uncleared security-based swaps of
registered non-U.S. persons when there is no U.S. person on the other side.
Rule 908(b) is designed to specify the types of persons that will incur duties under
Regulation SBSR. If a person does not come within any of the categories enumerated by Rule
908(b), it does not incur any duties under Regulation SBSR. 400
Under Rule 908(a), as re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, security-based
swaps that would have fallen within the proposed definition of “transaction conducted within the
United States” would have been among the security-based swaps subjected to both regulatory
reporting and public dissemination. 401 In adopting Regulation SBSR, the Commission did not

399

400

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14656.

401

Rule 900(ii), as re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, would have defined
“transaction conducted within the United States” to have the same meaning as in
Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3(a)(5)(i), as proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release.

161

include in Rule 908(a)(1) a prong for “transactions conducted within the United States,” noting
that commenters had expressed divergent views on this particular element of the re-proposed
rule. 402 Similarly, the Commission, in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, proposed to expand
Rule 908(b) to include any counterparty to a transaction conducted in the United States.
However, Rule 908(b), as adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, included only U.S.
persons, registered security-based swap dealers, and registered major security-based swap
participants. Thus, under the rules adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, a nonU.S.-person security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant would incur an
obligation under Regulation SBSR only if it were registered. The Commission noted that it
anticipated soliciting additional public comment on whether regulatory reporting and/or public
dissemination requirements should be extended to transactions occurring within the United
States between non-U.S. persons and, if so, which non-U.S. persons should incur reporting duties
under Regulation SBSR. 403 The Commission solicited comment on these questions in the U.S.
Activity Proposal. 404
While Rule 908(a) specifies what types of security-based swap transactions are subject to
regulatory reporting and/or public dissemination and Rule 908(b) specifies the types of persons
that will incur duties under Regulation SBSR, Rule 901(a) assigns the duty to report each
individual transaction. Rule 901(a), as adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, did
not address the reporting of many types of cross-border transactions, and the Commission noted
that it anticipated soliciting additional comment about how to apply Regulation SBSR, including

which side should incur the reporting duty, in a security-based swap transaction between two
unregistered non-U.S. persons and in a transaction between an unregistered U.S. person and an
unregistered non-U.S. person. 405 The U.S. Activity Proposal, among other things, proposed
amendments to Rules 900, 901(a), 906, 907, and 908 of Regulation SBSR to address the
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of transactions involving non-U.S. persons that
were not addressed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. The proposed amendments, the
comments received, and final rules are discussed below.
C.

Extending Regulation SBSR to All ANE Transactions
1.

Description of Proposed Rule

In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission proposed to add a new subparagraph (v) to
Rule 908(a)(1). Proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(v) would require any security-based swap transaction
connected with a non-U.S. person’s security-based swap dealing activity that is arranged,
negotiated, or executed by personnel of such non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or
office—or by personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office—to be reported and
publicly disseminated. This amendment would expand the scope of Regulation SBSR in two
ways. First, it would require that a transaction of a foreign dealing entity be subject to both
regulatory reporting and public dissemination if the non-U.S. person would be required to
include the transaction in its de minimis threshold calculation under Rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C)
under the Exchange Act. 406 Second, the proposed rule would require public dissemination of any
ANE transaction of a foreign dealing entity, even if there is no U.S. person on the other side and
the transaction is not accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place of

163

business in the United States. Under existing Rule 908(a), a transaction of a registered foreign
security-based swap dealer—even if it is an ANE transaction—would be subject to regulatory
reporting but not public dissemination if there is no U.S. person on the other side and the
transaction is not accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place of
business in the United States. 407
As discussed in more detail in Section X, infra, the Commission in the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release did not propose to align Regulation SBSR compliance with
security-based swap dealer registration. Thus, as proposed, there could have been a period of
indefinite length when compliance with Regulation SBSR—including the cross-border reporting
provisions thereof—could have been required when no security-based swap dealers had yet
registered with the Commission. During such a period, the only way a foreign dealing entity
could have been subject to duties under Regulation SBSR would have been if the foreign dealing
entity were using U.S. personnel to engage in ANE activity, and the only way that a transaction
involving only foreign persons would have been subject to reporting and public dissemination
under Regulation SBSR would be if at least one side included a foreign dealing entity that was
using U.S. personnel to engage in ANE activity with respect to that specific transaction. After
security-based swap dealers register as such with the Commission, most foreign dealing entities

407

Under Exchange Act Rule 3a71-1(c), 17 CFR 240. 3a71-1(c), absent a limitation by the
Commission, a security-based swap dealer is deemed to be a security-based swap dealer
with respect to each security-based swap that it enters into, regardless of the type, class,
or category of the security-based swap or the person’s activities in connection with the
security-based swap. Accordingly, for purposes of this rule, any transaction that a
registered security-based swap dealer arranged, negotiated, or executed using personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office would be “in connection with its dealing activity” and
subject to both regulatory reporting and public dissemination.

164

will become subject to Regulation SBSR and assume the highest rung in the reporting hierarchy
because of their registration status.
2.

Discussion of Comments and Final Rule

Several commenters opposed extending Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements to ANE transactions. 408 One of these commenters stated, for
example, that transactions between non-U.S. persons, where there is no guarantee by a U.S.
person on either side, should not be required to be reported or publicly disseminated in the
United States because they “lack the requisite nexus to the United States regardless of the
location of conduct of the counterparties.” 409 A second commenter stated that transactions that
have no U.S.-person counterparty should not be publicly disseminated because they “have
minimal, if any, impact on or relevance for the U.S. SBS markets even if they are arranged,
negotiated or executed in the United States.” 410 A third commenter argued that “[r]equiring nonregistrants to publicly disseminate and report ANE transactions seems unnecessary in light of the
fact that only small numbers of ANE transactions do not involve a registered SBSD or registered
MSBSP and would also be unduly burdensome for non-registrants that are only engaged in de
minimis SBS activities.” 411 Two other commenters expressed concern about the costs that the

408

See IIB Letter at 14-17; ISDA I at 3 (arguing generally that any security-based swap
between two non-U.S. persons that is cleared outside the United States should not be
subject to Regulation SBSR); SIFMA-AMG I at 5-7; SIFMA/FSR Letter at 11-14; UBS
Letter at 3.

409

SIFMA/FSR Letter at 12. In the commenter’s view, public dissemination of transactions
between non-U.S. persons based on U.S.-located conduct could result in the
dissemination of information that is not informative or that gives a distorted view of
prevailing market prices, while the regulatory reporting of these transactions would not
be useful because of the minimal U.S. nexus. See id.

410

See ISDA I at 13.

411

UBS Letter at 3.

165

proposed rule could impose on unregistered foreign dealing entities to report ANE
transactions. 412 One of these commenters stated that there would be significant costs associated
with reporting ANE transactions because market participants that have already designed and
implemented reporting systems based on the CFTC’s “status-based” approach to the scope of
reporting requirements and the rules of other jurisdictions would need to modify their systems to
comply with the Commission’s rules. 413
After carefully considering these comments, the Commission is adopting Rule
908(a)(1)(v) as proposed. Consistent with its territorial application of Title VII requirements, 414
the Commission believes that, when a foreign dealing entity uses U.S. personnel to arrange,
negotiate, or execute a transaction in a dealing capacity, that transaction occurs at least in part

412

See IIB Letter at 16; SIFMA/FSR Letter at 13 (“It is generally not possible to directly
determine the location of counterparty conduct without substantial effort, expense and
operational changes to systematically capture and process this data—burdens on market
participants that will certainly outweigh the perceived regulatory benefits of obtaining
transaction data for security-based swaps required to be reported as a result of U.S.located conduct. These burdens will also fall on unregistered entities that have no
reporting infrastructure and that are not well-equipped to ascertain whether they have a
reporting obligation, as long as there are trades between non-U.S. persons, neither of
which is a dealer”).

413

See IIB Letter at 16 (stating that, to modify its systems in connection with the
Commission’s requirements, a foreign dealing entity, including one operating below the
de minimis threshold, “would need to install or modify a trade capture system capable of
tracking, on a dynamic, trade-by-trade basis, the location of front-office personnel. The
non-U.S. SBSD would then need to feed that data into its reporting system and re-code
that system to account for the different rules that apply to non-U.S. SBS depending on
whether they are arranged, negotiated or executed by U.S. personnel. The non-U.S.
SBSD would also need to train its front office personnel in the use of this new trade
capture system and develop policies, procedures, and controls to require, track, and test
the proper use of that system. In addition, the non-U.S. SBSD would need to seek and
obtain waivers from non-U.S. counterparties—to the extent such waivers are even
permitted—with respect to privacy, blocking and secrecy laws in local jurisdictions”).

414

See, e.g., U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8613-17; Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, 80 FR at 14649-50; Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47287-88.

within the United States and is relevant to the U.S. security-based swap market. The
Commission has previously determined that ANE activity carried out by U.S. personnel warrants
application of the security-based swap dealer registration requirements. 415 The Commission
believes that there is sufficient “nexus” to apply Title VII’s regulatory reporting and public
dissemination requirements to security-based swap transactions involving a foreign dealing
entity that is using U.S. personnel to engage in ANE activity with respect to a particular
transaction. As the Commission has stated previously, declining to apply Title VII requirements
to security-based swaps of foreign dealing entities that use U.S. personnel to engage in ANE
activity would have the effect of allowing such entities “to exit the Title VII regulatory regime
without exiting the U.S. market.” 416 Further, as discussed in Section X, infra, reporting under
Regulation SBSR will commence following security-based swap dealer registration. Thus, for
the vast majority of transactions of foreign dealing entities falling within the scope of Rule
908(a), the reporting obligation under Regulation SBSR will arise from an entity’s status as a
registered security-based swap dealer, and entities that are registered as security-based swap
dealers will not be required to assess whether they have engaged in ANE activity with respect to
a transaction. The costs associated with the reporting of ANE transactions are discussed more
fully below.
a.

Impact on Regulatory Reporting

415

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8614 (“we do not believe that securitybased swap dealing activity must create counterparty credit risk in the United States for
there to be a ‘nexus’ sufficient to warrant security-based swap dealer registration”).

416

U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8616. See also Cross-Border Adopting
Release, 79 FR at 47288 (“Our territorial approach applying Title VII to dealing activity
similarly looks to whether [relevant activities] occur with the United States, and not
simply to the location of the risk”).

167

The Commission notes that all security-based swaps of registered security-based swap
dealers, whether U.S. or foreign, are subject to regulatory reporting under existing Rule
908(a)(2). For transactions involving foreign dealing entities that register with the Commission
as security-based swap dealers, the regulatory reporting requirement stems from the involvement
of the registered person, not from the presence of any ANE activity. Therefore, new Rule
908(a)(1)(v) does not subject any additional transactions involving registered security-based
swap dealers to Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting requirements. 417
New Rule 908(a)(1)(v) extends the regulatory reporting requirements only to transactions
involving an unregistered foreign dealing entity (when it engages in ANE activity) when no other
condition is present that would trigger regulatory reporting (e.g., there is a U.S. person or
registered security-based swap dealer on the other side). Thus, Rule 908(a)(1)(v) imposes
regulatory reporting requirements only to transactions in which an unregistered foreign dealing
entity enters into a transaction with another unregistered foreign person.
As noted in Section II(A)(4)(d), supra, the Commission believes that foreign dealing
entities that will register with the Commission as security-based swap dealers will be
counterparties to the vast majority of security-based swaps involving foreign dealing entities
engaging in U.S. activity. The Commission estimates that only a few foreign dealing entities
will remain below the de minimis threshold and utilize U.S. personnel to engage in ANE
transactions with other unregistered foreign persons. Therefore, new Rule 908(a)(1)(v) will
extend Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting requirements to only a small number of
additional transactions in which an unregistered foreign dealing entity engaged in ANE activity
417

But see infra Section IX(C)(2)(b) (explaining that new Rule 908(a)(1)(v) subjects
additional transactions involving registered security-based swap dealers to Regulation
SBSR’s public dissemination requirements).

168

transacts with another unregistered foreign person. In this release, the Commission estimates
that only four foreign dealing entities likely will engage in ANE transactions and remain below
the de minimis threshold, and thus be counterparties to security-based swaps that fall within Rule
908(a)(1)(v). 418
As noted above, 419 some commenters expressed concern about the costs associated with
requiring ANE transactions of unregistered foreign dealing entities to be reported, which will
require an assessment of whether ANE activity is present in a particular transaction. 420 One
commenter argued, for example, that regulatory reporting of these transactions “seems
unnecessary in light of the fact that only small numbers of ANE transactions” would be captured
by Rule 908(a)(1)(v). 421 The Commission agrees that only a small number of additional
transactions will become subject to regulatory reporting because of Rule 908(a)(1)(v). However,
because all ANE transactions occur at least in part within the United States, reporting these
transactions to a registered SDR will enhance the Commission’s ability to oversee relevant
security-based swap activity within the United States as well as to evaluate market participants
for compliance with specific Title VII requirements (including the requirement that a person
register with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer if it exceeds the de minimis

See supra notes 412-413 and accompanying text.

420

Other comments also discussed the costs of assessing whether ANE activity is present in
a transaction involving only unregistered foreign persons, but under the assumption that
the Commission would require reporting compliance before requiring security-based
swap dealers to register as such. See ISDA I at 11-13; ISDA II at 3-10; ISDA III, passim;
ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 9-12; SIFMA-AMG I at 6-7. These comments are addressed by
Section X, infra, where the Commission revises the proposed compliance schedule and
adopts a final compliance schedule that aligns Regulation SBSR compliance with
security-based swap dealer registration.

threshold). 422 The reporting of these additional ANE transactions also will enhance the
Commission’s ability to monitor for manipulative and abusive practices involving security-based
swaps or transactions in related assets, such as corporate bonds. 423
The Commission believes that certain unregistered foreign dealing entities generally will
already be assessing whether they utilize U.S. personnel and, if so, whether such personnel are
involved in arranging, negotiating, or executing particular security-based swaps, so that they can
count such transactions against their de minimis thresholds. Thus, the Commission believes that
new Rule 908(a)(1)(v) will impose only limited assessment costs beyond those already being
incurred by unregistered foreign dealing entities. 424
The Commission acknowledges that subjecting ANE transactions between unregistered
non-U.S. persons to regulatory reporting requirements under new Rule 908(a)(1)(v) also will
result in certain programmatic costs. 425 The Commission assesses those costs against the
benefits of the rule to the Commission, other relevant authorities, and the market in general. 426
The Commission continues to believe that reporting of these ANE transactions to a registered
SDR will enhance the Commission’s ability to monitor relevant activity related to security-based
swap dealing occurring within the United States as well as to monitor market participants for

b.

Impact on Public Dissemination

While Rule 908(a)(1)(v) will extend Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting
requirements to additional cross-border security-based swaps—those involving unregistered
foreign dealing entities when they engage in ANE transactions with other unregistered foreign
persons—Rule 908(a)(1)(v) will extend Regulation SBSR’s public dissemination requirements to
a potentially larger number of cross-border transactions that are, under existing Regulation
SBSR, subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination. Under existing Rule
908(a)(2), a security-based swap that does not otherwise fall within Rule 908(a)(1) shall be
subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination if there is a registered security-based
swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant on either or both sides of the
transaction. Under existing Rule 908(a)(1), a security-based swap is subject to both regulatory
reporting and public dissemination only if there is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S.
person on either or both sides of the transaction or if the security-based swap is accepted for
clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States. Nothing
in existing Rule 908(a)(1) extends the public dissemination requirements to transactions of
registered security-based swap dealers and registered major security-based swap participants
based on the location of personnel who engage in relevant conduct. Thus, under existing Rule
908(a), a transaction involving only non-U.S. persons on both sides, even if one or both sides
include a registered foreign security-based swap dealer, would not be subject to public
dissemination. Under new Rule 908(a)(1)(v), however, the location of the personnel who engage
in relevant activity on behalf of a foreign dealing entity becomes a dispositive factor for

171

determining whether the transaction is subject to public dissemination. The Commission
anticipates that a significant number of transactions between foreign registered security-based
swap dealers will be with other non-U.S. persons (including other foreign registered securitybased swap dealers). Under existing Rule 908(a), the overwhelming majority of these
transactions would have been subject only to regulatory reporting. However, with the adoption
of Rule 908(a)(1)(v), many of these transactions also will be subject to public dissemination, if
there is a foreign dealing entity on either side that is engaging in ANE activity.
The Commission believes that it is appropriate to apply the public dissemination
requirements to all ANE transactions, even those between two foreign counterparties where only
one side is engaging in ANE activity. Transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by
U.S. personnel of a foreign dealing entity exist at least in part within the United States.
Subjecting such transactions to public dissemination is consistent with the Commission’s
territorial application of Title VII requirements. 427 The Commission believes that the public
dissemination of ANE transactions will increase price competition and price efficiency in the
security-based swap market generally, and enable all market participants to have more
comprehensive information with which to make trading and valuation determinations for
security-based swaps and related and underlying assets. 428
Thus, the Commission disagrees with the commenter who did “not believe the public
dissemination of SBS between non-US Persons increases transparency to the public” 429 and
another commenter who asserted that publicly disseminating such transactions between non-U.S.
427

See, e.g., U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8613-17; Regulation SBSR Adopting

persons could result in the dissemination of information that is not informative or that gives a
distorted view of prevailing market prices. 430 The Commission believes, to the contrary, that
public dissemination of transactions between non-U.S. persons, where one or both sides are
engaging in ANE activity, will be informative and will provide useful information about
prevailing market prices in the U.S. security-based swap market. The fact that a foreign dealing
entity uses U.S. personnel to arrange, negotiate, or execute a transaction suggests that these
personnel were selected because they have familiarity with the U.S. security-based swap market,
and that the instruments involved in such transactions between non-U.S. persons are typically the
same or similar to instruments traded between foreign dealing entities and U.S. persons. 431 The
Commission believes, therefore, that public dissemination of all ANE transactions will
contribute to price discovery and price competition in the U.S. security-based swap market. The
Commission further believes that—rather than providing a distorted view of prevailing market

430

See SIFMA/FSR Letter at 12.

431

Various commenters noted, for example, that foreign dealing entities typically utilize
U.S. personnel because such personnel have familiarity with instruments traded in the
U.S. market. See ISDA I at 5 (“The prudent risk management of global market
participants therefore requires sales and trading experts in SBS transactions to typically
be located in the region of the underlying asset. Accordingly, experts in SBS products
that are linked to U.S.-based underliers will usually tend to be located in the United
States”); IIB Letter at 2 (“we believe that it would be desirable to foster the continued use
of U.S. personnel by non-U.S. SBSDs to engage in market-facing activities. These
activities are important to effective risk management by non-U.S. SBSDs in connection
with SBS involving U.S. reference entities. This is because the traders with the greatest
expertise and familiarity with those types of SBS are best-positioned to risk manage those
positions and are typically located in the United States. . . . Centralization of pricing,
hedging and risk management functions and workable integration of these functions with
sales activity by non-U.S. SBSDs also helps to promote U.S. market liquidity by
integrating trading interest from non-U.S. counterparties into the U.S. market”);
SIFMA/FSR Letter at 6 (“For U.S.-listed products and security-based swaps based on
those products, many non-U.S. dealing entities concentrate that expertise in the United
States to better serve client demands”).

173

prices, as these commenters suggest—the dissemination of ANE transactions will provide a more
comprehensive view of activity in the U.S. market.
Another commenter questioned the transparency benefits of publicly disseminating
uncleared bilateral trades that may include bespoke terms. 432 However, as the Commission
previously discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, even bespoke transactions have
price discovery value and thus should be publicly disseminated. 433 Requiring the public
dissemination of all ANE transactions, whether cleared or uncleared, will increase price
competition and price efficiency in the security-based swap market generally, and enable all
market participants to have more comprehensive information with which to make trading and
valuation determinations for security-based swaps and related and underlying assets. 434
Another commenter expressed concerns about the market possibly front-running the
hedges of a foreign dealing entity if all ANE transactions were subject to public dissemination.
The Commission does not find this a persuasive argument against imposing the public
dissemination requirements on all ANE transactions. The concern about public dissemination
triggering adverse market impact, such as higher prices to hedge, is common to all security-based
swap transactions, regardless of whether a transaction is subject to public dissemination because
it involves a U.S. counterparty or because it is an ANE transaction. Therefore, as the

432

See IIB Letter at 15.

433

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14611 (“The disseminated price [of a
bespoke transaction] could, for example, still have an anchoring effect on price
expectations for future negotiations in similar or related products, even in thinly-traded
markets. Furthermore, even if it is difficult to compare price data across customized
transactions, by disseminating reports of all bespoke transactions market observers can
understand the relative number and aggregate notional amounts of transactions in
bespoke products versus standardized products”).

434

See infra Section XIII(H)(2).

174

Commission decided in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, all transactions will during the
first phase of Regulation SBSR have up to 24 hours from the time of execution to be reported
(and then immediately disseminated by a registered SDR). 435
One commenter argued that the proposed rule would not enhance transparency in the
U.S. security-based swap market because it would create incentives for non-U.S. counterparties
to avoid interactions with U.S. personnel. 436 The commenter believed that the Commission’s
analysis of the trade-off between transparency and liquidity did not fully address the costs and
benefits of applying a U.S.-personnel test to the public dissemination requirement. 437 Such
fragmentation, in the commenter’s view, would lead to adverse effects on effective risk
management, market liquidity, and U.S. jobs. The commenter also expressed concern that the
costs associated with reporting ANE transactions could lead some non-U.S. security-based swap
dealers to prevent their U.S. personnel from interacting with non-U.S. counterparties, and some
non-U.S. counterparties to avoid interactions with U.S. personnel. 438
The Commission acknowledges, as this commenter suggests, that to avoid public
dissemination some foreign dealing entities might prevent their U.S. personnel from interacting

435

See Rule 901(j); Appendix to Rule 901 (Reports Regarding the Establishment of Block
Thresholds and Reporting Delays for Regulatory Reporting of Security-Based Swap
Data); Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14616-25.

436

See IIB Letter at 14. According to this commenter, a non-U.S. counterparty whose
transaction was subject to public dissemination would receive a worse execution price
because a dealer might widen its quotes for the transaction to counteract the risk that
other market participants would front-run the dealer’s hedges. The commenter suggested
that, although a U.S. counterparty would have a similar incentive to avoid public
dissemination of its trades, U.S. counterparties would not be in the same position as nonU.S. counterparties to avoid the application of U.S. public dissemination requirements.

with non-U.S. counterparties, and some non-U.S. counterparties might avoid interactions with
U.S. personnel. The Commission believes, nevertheless, that public dissemination of all ANE
transactions is necessary to advance the Title VII objectives of enhancing transparency in the
security-based swap market. The Commission notes that new Rule 908(a)(1)(v) extends the
public dissemination requirements only to ANE transactions of foreign dealing entities with nonU.S. persons; transactions of foreign dealing entities with U.S. persons—regardless of whether
they are arranged, negotiated, or executed by U.S. personnel—are already subject to existing
Rule 908(a)(1)(i) by virtue of a U.S. person’s involvement in the transaction. The Commission
believes, therefore, that extending the public dissemination requirements to ANE transactions
involving non-U.S. persons will promote a level playing field. Without Rule 908(a)(1)(v), the
U.S. personnel of a foreign dealing entity might be able to offer liquidity to non-U.S. persons at
lower prices than to U.S. persons, because the foreign dealing entity would not have to embed
the potential costs of public dissemination into the prices offered to non-U.S. persons. By
contrast, the prices offered by the foreign dealing entity to U.S. persons would likely reflect any
such additional costs, to the extent that public dissemination of a particular transaction imposes
costs on the counterparties. 439 While the benefit of lower prices obtained by non-U.S. persons
would depend on the magnitude of the perceived costs of public dissemination, the Commission
believes that it is appropriate to place the transactions of U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons on a
more equal footing, so that non-U.S. persons do not have a competitive advantage over U.S.

439

However, to the extent that transactions of foreign dealing entities are subject to public
dissemination requirements under the rules of a foreign jurisdiction, the costs of public
dissemination should already be factored into the prices offered to their non-U.S.
counterparties, and Rule 908(a)(1)(v) should not affect the prices that foreign dealing
entities that engage in ANE transactions offer to their non-U.S. counterparties.

176

persons when engaging in security-based swap transactions that, due to the involvement of U.S.
personnel of the foreign dealing entity, exist at least in part within the United States.
The commenter also argued that it would be problematic for foreign dealing entities to
assess for ANE activity, which would trigger the public dissemination requirement. 440 However,
such an assessment is not required unless a foreign dealing entity wishes to exclude the
transaction from public dissemination because relevant activity does not occur within the United
States (and there is no other basis for public dissemination under Rule 908(a)(1)). For any
transaction report, the default assumption is that it is subject to public dissemination, unless the
person submitting the report has appropriately flagged it as “do not disseminate.” 441 A registered
foreign security-based swap dealer that does not wish to assess a transaction for ANE activity
could simply refrain from applying the flag and the transaction would be publicly
disseminated. 442
c.

Impact of Substituted Compliance

Commenters also stated that the proposed rule could result in duplicative reporting
because transactions covered by the proposed rule also would likely be reported in another
440

See ISDA III at 11 (noting that, even if the Commission were to defer Regulation SBSR
compliance until after security-based swap dealer registration, “there would still be a
need to exchange ANE on transactions between Non-U.S. Persons engaged in SBS
dealing activity (including between non-U.S. registered SBSD) only so the reporting side
will know that it needs to send a separate message or otherwise indicate to the SDR . . .
that a SBS is subject to public reporting”).

441

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14610 (“A registered SDR would not
be liable for a violation of Rule 902(c) if it disseminated a report of a transaction that fell
within Rule 902(c) if the reporting side for that transaction failed to appropriately flag the
transaction as required by Rule 907(a)(4)”).

442

Cf. U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8628 (“a dealer may choose to count all
transactions with other non-U.S. persons towards its de minimis threshold, regardless of
whether counting them is required, to avoid the cost of assessing the locations of
personnel involved with each transaction”).

177

jurisdiction. 443 These commenters recommended that the Commission obtain information about
these transactions through information-sharing arrangements with foreign regulatory authorities,
rather than establishing duplicative reporting requirements. 444 One of these commenters
expressed concern that the potential for duplicative reporting could overstate trading volumes in
the security-based swap market, which would not advance the G20’s goal of improving
transparency for derivatives. 445 Two commenters argued that foreign regulators would have a
greater interest than the Commission in establishing transparency requirements for securitybased swaps involving non-U.S. counterparties. 446
The Commission acknowledges that some ANE transactions of foreign dealing entities
could be subject to reporting and/or public dissemination requirements in other jurisdictions.
Substituted compliance could mitigate the concerns of these commenters if the Commission
issues a substituted compliance order for regulatory reporting and public dissemination of
security-based swaps with respect to a particular foreign jurisdiction. In such case, a crossborder transaction involving that jurisdiction would not be subject to any direct reporting and
public dissemination requirements under Regulation SBSR. A substituted compliance order
would eliminate duplication with the comparable reporting and public dissemination
requirements of the other jurisdiction, and concerns regarding overstated trading volumes and

443

See SIFMA/FSR Letter at 12; SIFMA-AMG I at 6.

444

See id.

445

See SIFMA-AMG I at 2, 6. The commenter also stated that reporting the same
transaction to trade repositories in the United States and the European Union could
undermine the quality of publicly disseminated information because of errors caused by
reporting the same transaction in multiple jurisdictions. See id. at 6.

446

See IIB Letter at 15; SIFMA/FSR Letter at 12.

178

distortions of the market would thus not arise. 447 A person relying on substituted compliance in
this manner would remain subject to the applicable Exchange Act requirements but would be
complying with those requirements in an alternative fashion.
The Commission recognizes that, in practice, there will be limits to the availability of
substituted compliance. For example, if the Commission were unable to make a favorable
comparability determination with respect to one or more foreign jurisdiction’s security-based
swap reporting and dissemination requirements because they do not achieve a comparable
regulatory outcome, or because the foreign trade repository or foreign authority that receives and
maintains transaction reports is not subject to requirements comparable to those imposed on
SDRs, the Commission would not issue a substituted compliance order with respect to that
jurisdiction. The availability of substituted compliance also will depend upon the availability of
supervisory and enforcement arrangements among the Commission and relevant foreign
financial regulatory authorities. Although comparability assessments will focus on regulatory
outcomes rather than rule-by-rule comparisons, the assessments will require inquiry regarding
whether foreign regulatory requirements adequately reflect the interests and protections
associated with the particular Title VII requirement. Further, only transactions in which at least

447

The Commission further notes that, to the extent that ANE transactions involving foreign
dealing entities are subject to comparable requirements for reporting and public
dissemination in another foreign jurisdiction—a necessary but not sufficient condition for
the Commission to issue a substituted compliance order—a foreign dealing entity would
not have an incentive to avoid Regulation SBSR’s public dissemination requirements by,
for example, relocating its personnel, because the transaction would in any case be
subject to the public dissemination requirements of the other jurisdiction. Relocating
personnel or curtailing the activities of personnel who remain in the United States would
be effective in avoiding public dissemination only if public dissemination requirements
applied to the transaction pursuant only to Regulation SBSR.

179

one of the direct counterparties to the security-based swap is a non-U.S. person or a foreign
branch are eligible for substituted compliance.
Finally, one commenter asserted that, “[w]ith respect to Non-U.S. SBS cleared outside
the United States, foreign regulators have a relatively greater interest than the Commission in
establishing applicable transparency requirements.” 448 The Commission acknowledges that
foreign regulatory authorities have a regulatory interest in security-based swaps that are cleared
in their jurisdictions. However, for the reasons discussed above, the Commission also has a
regulatory interest when a transaction involves ANE activity conducted by U.S. personnel of one
or both sides of the transaction—even if the transaction is subsequently cleared outside the
United States. Public dissemination of all ANE transactions should increase transparency and
facilitate price discovery and price competition in the U.S. security-based swap market;
regulatory reporting of all ANE transactions will enhance the Commission’s ability to oversee
the U.S. security-based swap market and the activities of U.S. personnel who are involved in
arranging, negotiating, or executing such transactions. The Commission believes, therefore, that
it has a compelling interest in establishing regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements for all ANE transactions.
D.

Extending Regulation SBSR to All Transactions Executed on a U.S. Platform
Effected By or Through a Registered Broker-Dealer

In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission proposed a new subparagraph (iii) to Rule
908(a)(1) that would have subjected any security-based swap transaction that is executed on a
platform having its principal place of business in the United States to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination. The Commission also proposed a new subparagraph (iv) to Rule 908(a)(1)

448

See IIB Letter at 15.

180

that would subject any security-based swap transaction that is effected by or through a registered
broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) to regulatory reporting and public dissemination.
The Commission notes that many types of security-based swap transactions that are executed on
a platform or effected by or through a registered broker-dealer are already subject to Regulation
SBSR—for example, if either side includes a U.S. person 449 or a registered person, 450 or if the
transaction is accepted for clearing at a clearing agency having its principal place of business in
the United States. 451 Thus, proposed Rules 908(a)(1)(iii) and 908(a)(1)(iv) would have had the
effect of extending regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to transactions
occurring on a platform having its principal place of business in the United States or executed by
or through a registered broker-dealer only when the counterparties consist exclusively of
unregistered non-U.S. persons. In addition, proposed Rules 908(a)(1)(iii) and 908(a)(1)(iv)
would have extended the public dissemination requirement to transactions involving a registered
foreign security-based swap dealer that are executed on a platform or through a registered
broker-dealer and not otherwise subject to public dissemination (e.g., because there is a U.S.
person on the other side). 452
Two commenters generally opposed these amendments. 453 One of these commenters
stated that transactions between non-U.S. persons that have no U.S.-person guarantor—which

449

See Rule 908(a)(1)(i).

450

See Rule 908(a)(2).

451

See Rule 908(a)(1)(ii).

452

Under existing Rule 908(a)(2), transactions involving a registered foreign security-based
swap dealer or registered foreign security-based swap market participant that do not
otherwise fall within existing Rule 908(a)(1) are subject to regulatory reporting but not
public dissemination.

453

See IIB Letter at 15, 17; SIFMA/FSR Letter at 12-14.

181

would include transactions covered by proposed Rules 908(a)(1)(iii), (iv), and (v)—should not
be subject to regulatory reporting or public dissemination in the United States because they lack
the requisite nexus to the United States. 454 The other commenter expressed the view that these
requirements should not apply to the security-based swaps of non-U.S. persons unless they
involve a registered security-based swap dealer. 455 The commenter added that proposed Rule
908(a)(1)(iv) could provide incentives for non-U.S. counterparties to avoid transacting through
registered broker-dealers, resulting in market fragmentation that would lead to adverse effects on
risk management, market liquidity, and U.S. jobs. 456
The Commission continues to believe that any transaction executed on a platform that has
its principal place of business in the United States should be subject to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination, even when the transaction involves two non-U.S. persons that are not
engaged in dealing activity in connection with the transaction. 457 Transactions executed on a
platform having its principal place of business in the United States are consummated within the
United States and therefore exist, at least in part, in the United States. 458 Requiring these
security-based swaps to be reported will permit the Commission and other relevant authorities to
observe, in a registered SDR, all transactions executed on U.S. platforms and to carry out
oversight of such transactions. With respect to public dissemination of platform-executed
security-based swaps, the Commission notes that it would be inconsistent if a subset of the

454

See SIFMA/FSR Letter at 12.

455

See IIB Letter at 15-17.

456

See id. at 16-17. As discussed in the subsection immediately above, the commenter also
raised these concerns with respect to ANE transactions.

457

See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27484.

458

See id.

182

transactions executed on U.S. platforms—those involving unregistered non-U.S.
counterparties—were not subject to public dissemination, while all other transactions executed
on U.S. platforms were subject to public dissemination. Furthermore, the Commission
understands that platforms typically engage in the practice of disseminating information about
completed transactions to their own participants. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it
would be anomalous for a platform to broadcast information about a transaction involving two
non-U.S. counterparties to its participants if such transaction were not also included within
Regulation SBSR’s public dissemination requirements.
As the Commission previously noted in the U.S. Activity Proposal, 459 registered brokerdealers play a key role as intermediaries in the U.S. financial markets. To improve the integrity
and transparency of those markets, the Commission believes that the Commission and other
relevant authorities should have ready access to detailed information about the security-based
swap transactions that such persons intermediate. Furthermore, the Commission believes that
public dissemination of security-based swap transactions intermediated by a registered brokerdealer will provide useful information about prevailing market prices in the U.S. security-based
swap market, and that regulatory reporting of such transactions will assist the Commission and
other relevant authorities in overseeing the U.S. security-based swap market. Such reporting also
will assist the Commission in overseeing the activities of market intermediaries that it registers.
The Commission agrees that there is some possibility that requiring the regulatory
reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps between unregistered non-U.S.
persons that are intermediated by registered broker-dealers could create an incentive for those
non-U.S. persons to avoid transacting through a registered broker-dealer. However, a rule that
459

See 80 FR at 27485.

183

failed to capture these transactions could provide unregistered non-U.S. persons a competitive
advantage over unregistered U.S. persons. The security-based swap transactions of U.S. persons
effected by or through a registered broker-dealer are subject to Regulation SBSR, while the
transactions between unregistered non-U.S. persons effected by or through a registered brokerdealer would not be subject to Regulation SBSR. Absent Rules 908(a)(1)(iii) and 908(a)(1)(iv),
a registered broker-dealer (or platform) might be able offer its services at a lower price to nonU.S. persons than to U.S. persons, because the platform or registered broker-dealer would not
have to embed the potential costs of regulatory reporting and public dissemination when pricing
services offered to non-U.S. persons. By contrast, the price offered by the platform or registered
broker-dealer to U.S. persons would likely reflect these additional costs. The Commission does
not see a basis for permitting non-U.S. persons to enjoy this competitive advantage over U.S.
persons when engaging in security-based swap transactions that, due to the involvement of a
U.S. platform or registered broker-dealer, exist at least in part within the United States.
Accordingly, the Commission declines to adopt the commenters’ recommendation that the
Commission exclude from Regulation SBSR the transactions of unregistered non-U.S. persons
that are effected by or through a registered broker-dealer.
E.

Public Dissemination of Covered Cross-Border Transactions

Existing Rule 908(a)(1)(i) requires regulatory reporting and public dissemination of a
security-based swap if there is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either or
both sides of the transaction. This would include, for example, a security-based swap having, on
one side, a direct counterparty who is not a U.S. person but has a U.S. guarantor, and the other
side includes no counterparty that is a U.S. person, registered security-based swap dealer, or

184

registered major security-based swap participant (a “covered cross-border transaction”). 460 As
discussed in the U.S. Activity Proposal, this treatment of covered cross-border transactions
represented a departure from the re-proposed approach described in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, which would have excepted covered cross-border transactions from the public
dissemination requirement. 461 The Commission noted, however, that it had determined to
continue considering whether to except covered cross-border transactions from the public
dissemination requirement and that it would solicit additional comment regarding whether such
an exception would be appropriate. 462
In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission expressed its preliminary view that—in
light of its determination to require all security-based swap transactions of U.S. persons,
including all transactions conducted through a foreign branch, to be publicly disseminated—it
did not think that it would be appropriate to exempt covered cross-border transactions from the
public dissemination requirement. 463 As the Commission had previously noted in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release, 464 a security-based swap transaction involving a U.S. person that
guarantees a non-U.S. person exists, at least in part, within the United States, and the economic
reality of these transactions is substantially identical to transactions entered into directly by a
U.S. person (including through a foreign branch). Subjecting transactions through a foreign
460

As in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, a “covered cross-border transaction” refers
to a transaction that meets the description above and will not be submitted to clearing at a
registered clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States. See
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14653, n. 827.

branch to public dissemination but excluding transactions involving a U.S.-person guarantor
would treat these economically substantially identical transactions differently, and could create
competitive disparities among U.S. persons, depending on how they structured their businesses.
Thus, a U.S. person that engages in security-based swap transactions through a guaranteed
foreign subsidiary could carry out an unlimited volume of covered cross-border transactions
without being subject to the public dissemination requirement, while another U.S. person that
engaged in similar transactions through a foreign branch would be subject to the public
dissemination requirement. 465
Two commenters disagreed with the Commission’s proposed treatment of covered crossborder transactions. 466 One of these commenters argued that the financial risks of such
transactions lie outside the United States, and that the presence of a U.S.-person guarantor would
not make the pricing information relating to the transaction relevant to the U.S. market. 467 The
other commenter argued not only that covered cross-border transactions should be exempt from
public dissemination, but that the Commission should expand this exemption to include
transactions in which both sides include a U.S.-person guarantor but neither side includes a
registered security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, or a U.S. person
as a direct counterparty. 468 The commenter argued that, because these transactions take place

465

See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27485. The Commission notes that, if the
transactions of the U.S. guarantor and its foreign subsidiary are subject to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements in a foreign jurisdiction, such
transactions could be eligible for substituted compliance if the Commission determines
that the foreign requirements are comparable to those imposed by Regulation SBSR and
other necessary conditions are met. See Rule 908(c).

outside the United States and are between two unregistered non-U.S. persons, “there is
insufficient U.S. jurisdictional nexus to justify the public dissemination of the security-based
swap data in the United States.” 469
The Commission disagrees with the commenter’s assertions that the financial risks of
covered cross-border transactions lie outside the United States and that there is insufficient U.S.
jurisdictional nexus to justify the public dissemination of these transactions in the United States.
As the Commission noted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, a security-based swap
having an indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person is economically equivalent to a securitybased swap with a U.S.-person direct counterparty, and both kinds of security-based swaps exist,
at least in part, within the United States. 470 The presence of a U.S. guarantor facilitates the
activity of the non-U.S. person who is guaranteed and, as a result, the security-based swap
activity of the non-U.S. person cannot reasonably be isolated from the U.S. person’s activity in
providing the guarantee. 471 The financial resources of the U.S. guarantor could be called upon to
satisfy the contract if the direct counterparty fails to meet its obligations; thus, the extension of a
guarantee is economically equivalent to a transaction entered into directly by the U.S.
guarantor. 472 Because a U.S. guarantor might be obligated to perform under the guarantee, the
Commission disagrees with the commenter’s assertion that the financial risks of covered crossborder transactions lie outside the United States.

reporting to a registered SDR. See id.

472

187

With respect to the commenter’s view that covered cross-border transactions lack
sufficient jurisdictional nexus to justify their public dissemination in the United States, the
Commission takes the position that, under the territorial approach to Title VII described in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 473 any security-based swap guaranteed by a U.S. person
exists at least in part within the United States, which triggers the application of Title VII
requirement for public dissemination. 474 In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the
Commission noted that the transparency benefits of requiring public dissemination of securitybased swaps involving at least one U.S.-person direct counterparty would inure to other U.S.
persons and the U.S. market generally, as other participants in the U.S. market are likely to
transact in the same or related instruments. 475 In addition, the economic reality of covered crossborder transactions is substantially identical to transactions entered into directly by a U.S. person
(including through a foreign branch). 476 Excluding covered cross-border transactions from
public dissemination would treat these economically similar transactions differently, potentially
creating competitive disparities among U.S. persons, depending on how they have structured
their business. 477 To avoid such competitive disparities and to further the transparency goals of

transaction entered into directly by the U.S. guarantor”).

475

See 80 FR at 14651.

476

See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27485.

regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements in a foreign jurisdiction and
the Commission finds that the foreign requirements are comparable to those imposed by
Regulation SBSR and other conditions set forth in Rule 908(c) are met, such transactions
could be eligible for substituted compliance.

188

Title VII, the Commission believes that it is necessary and appropriate to require the public
dissemination of covered cross-border transactions.
F.

Expanding Rule 908(b)

Existing Rule 908(b) provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of Regulation
SBSR, a person shall not incur any obligation under Regulation SBSR unless it is a U.S. person,
a registered security-based swap dealer, or a registered major security-based swap participant.
Rule 908(b) is designed to clarify the cross-border application of Regulation SBSR by specifying
the types of counterparties that would and would not be subject to any duties under Regulation
SBSR; if a person does not fall within any of the categories enumerated by Rule 908(b), it would
not incur any duties under Regulation SBSR. 478 Rule 908(b) was designed to reduce regulatory
assessment costs and provide greater legal certainty to counterparties engaging in cross-border
security-based swaps.
1.

Expanding Rule 908(b) to Include All Platforms and Registered Clearing
Agencies

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission expressed the
preliminary view that all platforms and registered clearing agencies should incur the reporting
duties specified in the proposed amendments to Rule 901(a), 479 even if they are not U.S. persons.
Consistent with this view, the Commission proposed to expand Rule 908(b) to include any
platform or registered clearing agency as among the persons that may incur duties under
Regulation SBSR. 480 To the extent that a platform or registered clearing agency is a U.S. person,
such entity falls within existing Rule 908(b)(1). Thus, the effect of this proposed amendment to

189

Rule 908(b) would be to include within the rule any platform or registered clearing agency that is
not a U.S. person.
Three commenters generally supported expanding Rule 908(b) to include all platforms
and registered clearing agencies. 481
The Commission is adopting the amendments to Rule 908(b) as proposed. For the
reasons explained above, the Commission continues to believe that all platforms and registered
clearing agencies should incur the duties specified in the amendments to Rule 901(a), even if
they are not U.S. persons. Without this amendment, U.S.-person platforms and registered
clearing agencies would be subject to regulatory obligations from which non-U.S.-person
platforms and registered clearing agencies would be free.
2.

Expanding Rule 908(b) to Include Non-U.S. Persons Engaging in ANE
Transactions

In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission proposed to add a new subparagraph (5) to
Rule 908(b) to include any non-U.S. person that, in connection with such person’s security-based
swap dealing activity, arranges, negotiates, or executes a security-based swap using its personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office, or using personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or
office. Consistent with the proposed amendments to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E) that would bring
foreign dealing entities engaging in ANE transactions into the reporting hierarchy, 482 the
Commission also proposed to add all non-U.S. persons engaging in ANE transactions into Rule
908(b). Because existing Rule 908(b)(2) already covers a non-U.S. person that is registered as a
security-based swap dealer, the effect of proposed Rule 908(b)(5) would be to cover a non-U.S.
481

See DTCC Letter at 18; LCH.Clearnet Letter at 11; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 29 (“a
registered platform or clearing agency should be responsible for reporting [security-based
swaps] as specified in Proposed SBSR regardless of its U.S. person status”).

See supra Section IX(C).

190

person that engages in dealing activity in the United States but that does not meet the de minimis
threshold and thus would not be required to register as a security-based swap dealer. 483
The Commission received no comments that specifically addressed this proposed
amendment 484 and, for the reasons discussed in the U.S. Activity Proposal, is adopting Rule
908(b)(5) as proposed. Accordingly, Rule 908(b)(5) provides that a non-U.S. person that, in
connection with such person’s security-based swap dealing activity, arranged, negotiated, or
executed the security-based swap using its personnel 485 located in a U.S. branch or office, or
using personnel of an agent located in a U.S. branch or office, may incur reporting duties under
Regulation SBSR.

Reporting Duties of Unregistered Persons

Description of Proposed Rules

the duty to report a security-based swap, taking into account the types of entities present on each

483

See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27486.

484

However, two commenters noted that requiring the reporting of ANE transactions would
place burdens on unregistered entities that do not have reporting infrastructure in place
and would be compelled to engage third-party providers to report transactions. See ISDA
I at 11; SIFMA/FSR Letter at 13. In addition, as discussed in Section IX(C)(2), supra,
one commenter urged the Commission to eliminate the application of the U.S. Activity
Proposal to Regulation SBSR. See ISDA I at 2; ISDA II at 3. These comments are
addressed in Sections X(C)(7) and XII(A)(1)(d), infra.

485

The Commission intends the final rule to indicate the same type of activity by personnel
located in the United States as described in Section IV(C)(3) of the U.S. Activity
Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8624. Moreover, for purposes of Rule 908(b)(5), the
Commission interprets the term “personnel” in a manner consistent with the definition of
“associated person of a security-based swap dealer” contained in Section 3(a)(70) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(70), regardless of whether such non-U.S. person or such

side. Existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) does not assign reporting obligations for transactions involving
unregistered non-U.S. persons. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission
stated that it anticipated soliciting further comment regarding the duty to report a security-based
swap where neither side includes a registered security-based swap dealer or a registered major
security-based swap participant and neither side includes a U.S. person or only one side includes
a U.S. person. 486 In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E) that would assign the duty to report such transactions.
As discussed in the U.S. Activity Proposal and in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, one commenter raised concerns about burdens that the previously re-proposed reporting
hierarchy might place on U.S. persons in transactions with certain non-U.S.-person
counterparties. 487 Under the previous proposal, in a transaction between a non-U.S. person and a
U.S. person where neither side included a security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant, the U.S. person would have had the duty to report. The commenter noted that
in such transactions the non-U.S.-person counterparty might be engaged in dealing activity but at
levels below the security-based swap dealer de minimis threshold and the U.S. person might not
be acting in a dealing capacity in any of its security-based swap transactions. The commenter
argued that, in such cases, the non-U.S. person may be better equipped to report the transaction
and, accordingly, that when two unregistered persons enter into a security-based swap, the
counterparties should be permitted to select which counterparty would report, even if one
counterparty is a U.S. person. 488

The U.S. Activity Proposal included proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2), which the
Commission proposed to address concerns arising when a non-U.S. person is engaged in ANE
transactions. Under the proposed rule, in a transaction between an unregistered U.S. person and
an unregistered non-U.S. person who is engaging in ANE activity, the sides would be required to
select which side is the reporting side. Also under proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2), if both
sides are unregistered non-U.S. persons and both are engaging in ANE activity, the sides would
be required to select the reporting side.
Proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3) was designed to address the scenario where one side is
subject to Rule 908(b) and the other side is not—i.e., one side includes only unregistered nonU.S. persons and that side does not engage in any ANE activity. When the other side includes an
unregistered U.S. person or an unregistered non-U.S. person that is engaging in ANE activity,
the side with the unregistered U.S. person or the unregistered non-U.S. person engaging in ANE
activity would be the reporting side. The Commission preliminarily believed that the U.S.
person or the non-U.S. person engaged in ANE activity generally would be more likely than the
other side to have the ability to report the transaction given that it has operations in the United
States. 489 The Commission also noted that, in a transaction where neither side includes a
registered person, placing the duty on the side that has a presence in the United States should
better enable the Commission to monitor and enforce compliance with the reporting
requirement. 490
Proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) was designed to address the scenario where neither
side includes a counterparty that falls within Rule 908(b)—i.e., neither side includes a registered

person, a U.S. person, or a non-U.S. person engaging in ANE activity—but the transaction is
effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF). In such case,
the proposed rule would require the registered broker-dealer to report the transaction. The
Commission preliminarily believed that the registered broker-dealer generally would be more
likely than the unregistered non-U.S. counterparties (none of which are engaging in ANE activity
with respect to that particular transaction) to have the ability to report the transaction given its
presence in the United States and its familiarity with the Commission’s regulatory
requirements. 491

Discussion of Comments and Final Rules
a.

Transactions Where One or Both Sides Consist Only of
Unregistered Persons

After careful consideration of all the comments, to which the Commission responds
below, the Commission is adopting Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) and 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3) as proposed.
Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) contemplates that both sides of a security-based swap include only
unregistered persons yet both sides include a person who is subject to Rule 908(b). In such case,
the sides generally will have equal capacity to carry out the reporting duty; therefore, the
Commission believes that it is appropriate to require them to select the reporting side. Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3) contemplates that both sides include only unregistered persons and only one
side includes a person who is subject to Rule 908(b). In such case, Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3)
assigns the reporting duty to the side that includes the person who is subject to Rule 908(b). The
Commission believes that this result will help to ensure compliance with the reporting
requirements of Regulation SBSR.

491

194

Two commenters expressed concerns about the expense and difficulty of determining
which of these two rules to apply when one side is an unregistered foreign dealing entity who
might or might not be utilizing U.S. personnel in a particular transaction. 492 These commenters
warned that the burdens associated with determining whether a transaction was arranged,
negotiated, or executed using U.S. personnel would unduly fall on unregistered entities that are
not well-equipped to carry out a reporting obligation. 493 In raising these concerns, the
commenters assumed that the Commission would require compliance with Regulation SBSR
before security-based swap dealers register as such with the Commission. Requiring compliance
with Regulation SBSR prior to security-based swap dealer registration would have resulted in a
large number of foreign dealing entities becoming subject to reporting requirements with respect
to individual transactions in which they are engaging in ANE activity before security-based swap
dealer registration was required. Because these foreign dealing entities would not yet have been
required to be registered as security-based swap dealers, U.S. non-dealing entities could have
been required to assume greater duties in reporting such transactions and to assess on a
transaction-by-transaction basis whether the other side was engaging in ANE activity. 494

494

See ISDA II at 6 (“The burden of exchanging and using this data is much greater in
advance of SBSD registration since instead of relying on party level static data (such as
for registration status) to apply the reporting hierarchy in SBSR in most cases, the parties
may instead need to obtain and rely on transaction level party data for the U.S. Person
status of the indirect counterparty or an indication of whether a non-U.S. Person with
dealing activity has used U.S. personnel for ANE on each SBS”) (emphasis added). The
other commenter also argued that there would be significant costs and problems
associated with the Commission’s proposed rule. See SIFMA/FSR Letter at 12. The
commenter recommended, however, that, “[i]f the Commission does expand the
application of Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting requirements to include
transactions between two non-U.S. persons, reporting obligations triggered by U.S.located conduct should only be triggered for registered security-based swap dealers,” and
195

As discussed in Section X, infra, the Commission is adopting a revised compliance
schedule that aligns Regulation SBSR compliance with the registration of security-based swap
dealers. The Commission believes that foreign dealing entities that will register with the
Commission as security-based swap dealers will be counterparties to the vast majority of
security-based swaps involving foreign dealing entities engaging in U.S. activity. 495 Such
entities will thus occupy the highest rung of the reporting hierarchy. U.S. non-dealing entities
that transact with registered foreign security-based swap dealers will not have to engage in any
assessment of or negotiation with the other side, because reporting duties associated with these
transactions will arise from the foreign security-based swap dealers’ registration status rather
than any ANE activity in which they might engage.
The Commission recognizes that, even after security-based swap dealer registration
occurs, there likely will be a small number of foreign dealing entities that remain below the de
minimis threshold and thus will not have to register as security-based swap dealers. Such an
unregistered foreign dealing entity—when utilizing U.S. personnel to arrange, negotiate, or
execute a security-based swap—would be subject to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) if it transacts with a
U.S. person or another unregistered foreign dealing entity that is engaging in ANE activity with
respect to that transaction. In such case, the sides generally will have equal capacity to carry out
the reporting duty; therefore, Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) requires the sides to select the reporting
side. An unregistered foreign dealing entity would be subject to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3) if it
acknowledged that requiring compliance after security-based swap dealers were
registered “would lessen the burden imposed by the expansion of reporting requirements
on unregistered entities and those parties not acting in a dealing capacity.” Id. at 13.
495

See supra Section II(A)(5), where the Commission notes that ISDA-recognized dealers
(both U.S. and foreign) are involved in 74% of North American corporate single-name
CDS transactions. The Commission believes that all ISDA-recognized dealers will be
registered as security-based swap dealers.

196

transacts with any unregistered foreign entity (including a foreign non-dealing entity or a foreign
dealing entity that is not engaging in ANE activity with respect to that transaction). This
approach places the duty to report directly on the only side that includes a person that is subject
to Rule 908(b). The Commission estimates that only four foreign dealing entities will incur
reporting obligations under new Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) and 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3). 496
Requiring additional ANE transactions of these foreign dealing entities to be reported—
and requiring the foreign dealing entity and the other side to select the reporting side in a tie
situation under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) or requiring the foreign dealing entity to become the
reporting side directly when it falls under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3)—will enhance the
Commission’s ability to oversee security-based swap dealing activity occurring with the United
States and to monitor for compliance with specific Title VII requirements, including the
requirement that a person register with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer if it
exceeds the de minimis threshold. The Commission recognizes that unregistered foreign dealing
entities (and other unregistered persons when they transact with unregistered foreign dealing
entities) may incur costs in assessing whether these rules apply to their transactions. 497
However, requiring these ANE transactions to be publicly disseminated will further enhance the
level of transparency in the U.S. security-based swap market, potentially promoting greater price
efficiency by reducing implicit transaction costs.
One commenter recommended that, in a transaction between an unregistered U.S. person
and an unregistered non-U.S. person engaged in ANE activity, the Commission should not

See infra Section XII(B).

497

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8626-29 (estimating assessment costs of
foreign dealing entities to count transactions toward the de minimis thresholds under
Exchange Act Rules 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C) and 3a71-5(c), even if some of them do not
cross the thresholds and thus are not required to register as security-based swap dealers).

197

require the sides to select the reporting side, but should instead place the reporting obligation on
the non-U.S. person, because it is engaged in dealing activity. 498 The side engaged in dealing
activity would, in the commenter’s view, have a greater capacity to fulfill the reporting
obligation and would likely face minimal incremental costs, because many dealing entities
already have in place arrangements to report derivatives transactions. 499 The commenter
expressed concern that U.S. funds “may not have the economic leverage to require their non-U.S.
dealers to report” and, if an unregistered non-U.S. person did have to report, it would incur
“considerable expense.” 500
The Commission does not believe that it is appropriate to modify Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2)
to assign the reporting duty for this transaction pair to the unregistered non-U.S. person who is
engaging in ANE activity. While the Commission acknowledges the commenter’s concern about
the potential expense that an unregistered U.S. person could incur if it were required to report a
security-based swap transaction with an unregistered foreign dealing entity, the Commission
believes that it is unlikely that U.S. non-dealing entities will incur costs associated with reporting
transactions themselves or costs of assessing whether an unregistered foreign dealing entity is
utilizing U.S. personnel to engage in ANE activity. The foreign dealing entity’s willingness to
clearly indicate whether it is using U.S. personnel and to assume the reporting obligation should
be a factor that a U.S. non-dealing entity likely would consider when selecting a non-U.S. person
with whom to transact. If an unregistered foreign dealing entity were unable or unwilling to be
selected as the reporting side (or to agree to be the reporting side only at a cost that is prohibitive

to the U.S. person), the U.S. person could elect to trade with one of several registered securitybased swap dealers, both U.S. and foreign, for whom reporting obligations would attach by
operation of Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(B), 501 and negotiation about which side would incur the reporting
duty would not be necessary.
b.

Transactions Involving a Registered Broker-Dealer

Two commenters disagreed with proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), 502 which would
require a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) to report a security-based
swap that it effects between two unregistered non-U.S. persons who are not engaged in ANE
activity. One commenter stated that the rule would require registered broker-dealers to
implement costly and robust data capturing mechanisms and requirements regarding the status of
direct and indirect counterparties or the use of U.S. personnel to determine whether one side of a
security-based swap is obligated to report the transaction, or whether the registered broker-dealer
would have the reporting obligation. 503 Another commenter stated that the proposed rule would
create a disproportionate burden on registered broker-dealers relative to the small percentage of
the market represented by the transactions between non-U.S. persons that would be covered by
the proposed rule. 504 Both commenters asserted that the registered broker-dealer that reports the
transaction would be unable to report life cycle events for the transaction. 505 Thus, in the view

501

Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(B) provides that, if only one side of a security-based swap includes a
registered security-based swap dealer, that side shall be the reporting side.

199

of one commenter, the Commission would be unable to rely on the reported information as
current and accurate. 506
The Commission continues to believe that, to improve the integrity and transparency of
the U.S. financial markets, the Commission and other relevant authorities should have ready
access to transaction reports of security-based swap transactions that registered broker-dealers
intermediate. 507 The Commission further believes that public dissemination of these transactions
will have value to participants in the U.S. security-based swap market, who are likely to trade the
same or similar products. 508 The Commission acknowledges that registered broker-dealers are
required to implement policies and procedures to comply with the reporting obligation under
Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), including procedures for determining the status of direct and indirect
counterparties and the use of U.S. personnel to arrange, negotiate, or execute a transaction. 509
However, the Commission is not mandating specific policies and procedures, and registered
broker-dealers will have flexibility in developing the appropriate processes.
The Commission further acknowledges that life cycle events for the transactions covered
by Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) will not be reported. Under Rule 901(e), the reporting side for a
security-based swap transaction is obligated to report life cycle event information for the
transaction. Security-based swaps covered by Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) must be reported by a
registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF), not one of the sides. Thus, securitybased swaps covered by Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) do not have a reporting side, and neither side
will have an obligation to report life cycle event information for the transaction. The

508

509

See Rule 906(c).

200

Commission believes, however, that the reports of these transactions, even without subsequent
life cycle event reporting, will provide important information to the Commission and to market
participants at the time of execution. In any event, the Commission expects that relatively few
transactions will fall within Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). 510
Finally, the Commission is modifying Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) so that the reporting
requirement for a registered broker-dealer under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) parallels the reporting
requirement for a platform under final Rule 901(a)(1). The Commission believes that this
change is appropriate because a registered broker-dealer, like a platform, is unlikely to know and
could not without undue difficulty obtain many of the data elements contemplated by Rule
901(d). Furthermore, in many cases, a registered broker-dealer that falls within Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) also will be an SB SEF. Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), as proposed, would have
required a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) to report the information
required under Rules 901(c) and 901(d). In contrast, final Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) requires a
registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) to report only the information set forth
in Rules 901(c) (except that, with respect to Rule 901(c)(5), the registered broker-dealer
(including a registered SB SEF) will be required to indicate only if both direct counterparties are
registered security-based swap dealers), 901(d)(9), and 901(d)(10)—in other words, the same
information that a platform is required to report when it incurs a reporting duty under new Rule
901(a)(1). By eliminating the need for a registered broker-dealer to report certain data elements
under Rule 901(d) that the registered broker-dealer is unlikely to know and could not learn

510

See infra note 663 (estimating that only 540 of 3,000,000 reportable events under
Regulation SBSR will result from broker-dealers having to report transactions pursuant to
new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4)).

201

without undue difficulty, 511 the Commission believes that the revision will help to avoid placing
undue reporting burdens on registered broker-dealers (including registered SB SEFs) that incur
duties as a result of new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4).
H.

Conforming Amendments
1.

Expanding Definition of “Participant”

Rule 900(u), as adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, defined a
“participant” of a registered SDR as “a counterparty, that meets the criteria of [Rule 908(b) of
Regulation SBSR], of a security-based swap that is reported to that [registered SDR] to satisfy an
obligation under [Rule 901(a) of Regulation SBSR].” In the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, the Commission proposed an amendment to expand the definition of
“participant” to include registered clearing agencies and platforms 512 and, as described above,
has adopted that amendment as proposed. In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission
proposed to further amend the definition of “participant” to include a registered broker-dealer
that is required by Rule 901(a) to report a security-based swap if it effects a transaction between
unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed Rule 908(b)(5). 513

511

While the registered broker-dealer would presumably know the primary economic terms
of a transaction that it is effecting, it might not know or be in a position to easily learn
about the bilateral documentation that exists between the counterparties to support
transactions between those counterparties. Thus, the registered broker-dealer might not
be in a position to report the title and date of any master agreement, collateral agreement,
margin agreement, or other agreement incorporated by reference into a security-based
swap, as contemplated by Rule 901(d)(4).

512

See supra Section V(A).

513

See 80 FR at 27487. As in Section IX(G), supra, Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), as adopted
herein, requires a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) to report a
security-based swap in cases where the registered broker-dealer effects a transaction
between unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within Rule 908(b)(5).

202

The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed amendment to Rule
900(u) to include these registered broker-dealers and is adopting this amendment as proposed.
The Commission continues to believe, as it stated in the U.S. Activity Proposal, that these
registered broker-dealers should be participants of any registered SDR to which they are required
to report security-based swap transaction information because, as SDR participants, they become
subject to the requirement in Rule 901(h) to report security-based swap transaction information
to a registered SDR in a format required by the registered SDR.
2.

Rule 901(d)(9)

Existing Rule 901(d)(9) requires the reporting, if applicable, of the platform ID of the
platform on which a security-based swap is executed. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, the Commission recognized the importance of identifying the venue on which a
security-based swap is executed because this information should enhance the ability of relevant
authorities to conduct surveillance in the security-based swap market and understand
developments in the security-based swap market generally. 514 In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the
Commission proposed to amend Rule 901(d)(9) also to require the reporting, if applicable, of the
broker ID of a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) that is required by Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) to report a security-based swap effected by or through the registered brokerdealer.
The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed amendment to Rule
901(d)(9) and is adopting this amendment as proposed. The Commission continues to believe, as
discussed in the U.S. Activity Proposal, 515 that being able to identify the registered broker-dealer
514

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14589.

515

See 80 FR at 27487.

203

that effects a security-based swap transaction in the manner described in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4)
will enhance the Commission’s understanding of the security-based swap market and improve
the ability of the Commission and other relevant authorities to conduct surveillance of securitybased swap market activities.
3.

Limitation of Duty to Report Ultimate Parent and Affiliate Information

As discussed above, Rule 900(u), as amended herein, expands the definition of
“participant” to include a registered broker-dealer that incurs the reporting obligation if it effects
a transaction between two unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within Rule 908(b)(5).
Existing Rule 906(b) generally requires a participant of a registered SDR to provide the identity
of any ultimate parent and any of its affiliates that also are participants of that registered SDR.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed to except
platforms and registered clearing agencies from Rule 906(b) 516 and, as described above, is
adopting that amendment today. 517 In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission proposed to
further amend Rule 906(b) to except from the duty to provide ultimate parent and affiliate
information a registered broker-dealer that becomes a participant solely as a result of making a
report to satisfy an obligation under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). 518
The Commission received no comments regarding the amendment to Rule 906(b)
proposed in the U.S. Activity Proposal and is adopting this amendment as proposed. The

516

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14645.

517

See supra Section V(D).

518

However, a registered broker-dealer would have to comply with Rule 906(b) if it became
a participant of a registered SDR for another reason—e.g., the broker-dealer is a U.S.
person and is a counterparty to a security-based swap that is reported to the registered
SDR on a mandatory basis.

204

Commission continues to believe, as it stated in the U.S. Activity Proposal, 519 that the purposes
of Rule 906(b)—namely, facilitating the Commission’s ability to measure derivatives exposure
within the same ownership group—would not be advanced by applying the requirement to a
registered broker-dealer that incurs reporting obligations solely because it effects a transaction
between two unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within Rule 908(b)(5). A registered
broker-dealer acting solely as a broker with respect to a security-based swap is not taking a
principal position in the security-based swap. To the extent that such a registered broker-dealer
has an affiliate that transacts in security-based swaps, such positions could be derived from other
transaction reports indicating that affiliate as a counterparty.
The Commission proposed to make a conforming amendment to Rule 907(a)(6). In the
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed, and today is
adopting, 520 an amendment to Rule 907(a)(6) that will require a registered SDR to have policies
and procedures “[f]or periodically obtaining from each participant other than a platform or a
registered clearing agency information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any
participant(s) with which the participant is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and counterparty
IDs.” 521 In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission proposed to further amend Rule
907(a)(6) to except a registered broker-dealer that incurs reporting obligations solely because it
effects a transaction between two unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within Rule

519

See 80 FR at 27488.

520

See supra Section V(D).

521

Once a participant reports parent and affiliate information to a registered SDR, Rule
906(b) requires the participant to “promptly notify the registered [SDR] of any changes”
to its parent and affiliate information.

205

908(b)(5). 522 The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed amendment to
Rule 907(a)(6) and is adopting the amendment as proposed. Because such a broker-dealer has no
duty under Rule 906(b), as amended, to provide such information to a registered SDR, no
purpose would be served by requiring the registered SDR to have policies and procedures for
obtaining this information from the broker-dealer.
I.

Availability of Substituted Compliance

Existing Rule 908(c)(1) describes the possibility of substituted compliance with respect
to regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swap transactions. Substituted
compliance could be available for transactions that will become subject to Regulation SBSR
because of the amendments to Rule 908 being adopted today. Under Rule 908(c)(1), a securitybased swap is eligible for substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination if at least one of the direct counterparties to the security-based swap is either a
non-U.S. person or a foreign branch. As discussed in the U.S. Activity Proposal, existing Rule
908(c) does not condition substituted compliance eligibility on where a particular transaction was
arranged, negotiated, or executed. 523 Thus, Rule 908(c) permits a security-based swap between a
U.S. person and the New York branch of a foreign bank (i.e., a non-U.S. person utilizing U.S.located personnel) potentially to be eligible for substituted compliance, if the transaction is also
subject to the rules of a foreign jurisdiction that is the subject of a Commission substituted
compliance order.
The rules adopted today, among other things, subject to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination both ANE transactions and security-based swaps executed on a U.S. platform or
522

See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27488.

523

See id.

206

effected by a registered broker-dealer. The Commission did not propose, and is not adopting,
any amendment to Rule 908(c) that would limit the availability of substituted compliance for
such transactions based on the location of the relevant activity. Thus, a transaction that is
required to be reported and publicly disseminated because it is an ANE transaction, or because it
is executed on a U.S. platform or effected by or through a registered broker-dealer, could be
eligible for substituted compliance if the Commission issues a substituted compliance order with
respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps applying to that
jurisdiction. This approach is consistent with the Commission’s decision when adopting Rule
908(c) that certain transactions involving U.S.-person counterparties could be eligible for
substituted compliance (i.e., when the transaction is through the foreign branch of the U.S.
person) even if the non-U.S.-person counterparty has engaged in dealing activity in connection
with the transaction in the United States. One commenter who generally opposed the regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements proposed in the U.S. Activity Proposal
specifically supported the Commission’s approach to substituted compliance. 524
Finally, several commenters expressed the view that reporting pursuant to Regulation

Compliance Schedule for Regulation SBSR
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission established a compliance

date only for Rules 900, 907, and 909 of Regulation SBSR. 527 In the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, the Commission proposed a new compliance schedule for Rules 901, 902,
903, 904, 905, 906, and 908 of Regulation SBSR. 528 The Commission believed that proposing a
new compliance schedule was necessary in light of the fact that industry infrastructure and
capabilities had changed since the initial proposal, 529 particularly because the CFTC regime for
swap data reporting and dissemination had become operational. The Commission received 13
comments that discuss the proposed compliance schedule. After careful consideration of these
comments, the Commission is adopting a revised compliance schedule, as described in detail
below.

flows necessary to comply with [the U.S. Activity Proposal] only to later be granted

short-term benefits”).

208

The Commission proposed the following phased-in compliance schedule for Rules 901,
902, 903, 904, 905, 906, and 908 of Regulation SBSR. 530 First, the Commission proposed a
Compliance Date 1 to be the date six months after the first registered SDR that can accept reports
of security-based swaps in a particular asset class commences operations as a registered SDR.
On proposed Compliance Date 1, persons with a duty to report security-based swaps under
Regulation SBSR would have been required to report all newly executed security-based swaps in
that asset class to a registered SDR. After proposed Compliance Date 1, persons with a duty to
report security-based swaps also would have a duty to report any life cycle events of any
security-based swaps that previously had been required to be reported. In addition, under the
proposed compliance schedule, transitional and pre-enactment security-based swaps would also
have been reported, to the extent information was available, to a registered SDR that accepts
reports of security-based swap transactions in the relevant asset class by proposed Compliance
Date 1. 531 The Commission also proposed a Compliance Date 2, which would have been nine
months after the first registered SDR that can accept security-based swaps in a particular asset
class commences operations as a registered SDR (i.e., three months after proposed Compliance
Date 1). On proposed Compliance Date 2, each registered SDR in that asset class would have
had to comply with Rules 902 (regarding public dissemination), 904(d) (requiring dissemination
of transaction reports held in queue during normal or special closing hours), and 905 (with
530

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14762-70.

531

A transitional security-based swap is “a security-based swap executed on or after July 21,
2010, and before the first date on which trade-by-trade reporting of security-based swaps
in that asset class to a registered security-based swap data repository is required pursuant
to §§ 242.900 through 242.909.” See Rule 900(nn). A pre-enactment security-based
swap is “any security-based swap executed before July 21, 2010 (the date of enactment of
the Dodd-Frank Act (Pub. L. 111-203, H.R. 4173)), the terms of which had not expired as
of that date.” See Rule 900(y).

209

respect to public dissemination of corrected transaction reports) for all security-based swaps in
that asset class—except for covered cross-border transactions. 532
The proposed compliance schedule with respect to security-based swaps in a particular
asset class was tied to the commencement of operations of a registered SDR that can accept
reports of security-based swaps in that asset class. In the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, the Commission noted that both registered SDRs and persons with a duty
to report would need time to make preparations related to the reporting of security-based
swaps. 533 The proposed compliance schedule was not, however, linked to security-based swap
dealer registration.
B.

General Summary of Comments Received

Commenters expressed a variety of concerns with the proposed compliance schedule.
Most of the comments that addressed the proposed compliance schedule urged the Commission
to delay implementation of Regulation SBSR until after security-based swap dealers are
registered as such with the Commission.534 Commenters generally expressed concerns with the
costs and burdens of implementing Regulation SBSR ahead of the SBS entities registration
compliance date, particularly the costs for buy-side U.S. persons. Commenters also expressed
concerns that allowing the SBS entities registration compliance date to follow the

532

A covered cross-border transaction is a security-based swap that has, on one side, a direct
counterparty who is not a U.S. person but has a U.S. guarantor, and on the other side has
no counterparty that is a U.S. person, registered security-based swap dealer, or registered
major security-based swap participant. Such a transaction will not be submitted to
clearing at a registered clearing agency having its principal place of business in the
United States. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14653, n. 827.

implementation of Regulation SBSR would complicate reporting in the interim period between
the two dates. Many of these commenters also expressed concerns that the reporting of historical
security-based swaps would be significantly more difficult if compliance for reporting were
required before the SBS entities registration compliance date. 535
Some commenters expressed concerns about basing the compliance schedule for an asset
class on the registration of the first SDR that can accept security-based swaps in that asset class,
which, they argued, could confer an unfair “first mover” advantage. 536 One of these commenters
recommended that the Commission consider a compliance schedule that would base the first
compliance date on the registration of a “critical mass” of SDRs. 537
Other commenters expressed concern about how the reporting requirements contained in
Regulation SBSR could be implemented before the Commission finalizes its rules regarding SB
SEFs. 538 Some commenters urged the Commission to defer compliance with Regulation SBSR
until the Commission makes one or more substituted compliance determinations with respect to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swap transactions in foreign
jurisdictions. 539 Still others suggested that the Commission defer compliance with the
requirement to report certain UICs until international standards for UICs are developed. 540
Several commenters expressed concerns that differences between Regulation SBSR and the

parallel CFTC rules would present significant implementation challenges for SDRs and market
participants that seek to operate in both the swap and security-based swap markets. 541 Various
commenters generally urged the Commission to provide adequate time for the development and
implementation of the required compliance systems and procedures. 542
These comments and the Commission’s responses thereto are discussed in more detail
below. The Commission is adopting the primary features of the proposed compliance schedule
but is making several revisions in response to comments. Most notably, as described below, the
Commission had decided to align the compliance dates for Regulation SBSR with the SBS
entities registration compliance date.
C.

Compliance Date 1

Under the compliance schedule adopted today, with respect to newly executed securitybased swaps in a particular asset class, Compliance Date 1 for Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR is
the first Monday that is the later of: (1) six months after the date on which the first SDR that can
accept transaction reports in that asset class registers with the Commission; or (2) one month
after the SBS entities registration compliance date. Every security-based swap in that asset class
that is executed on or after Compliance Date 1 must be reported in accordance with Rule 901. 543
541

See DTCC Letter at 21 (“SB SDR applicants would be forced to expand their operations
considerably, particularly to address the confirmation functions and code issuance
responsibilities”); ICE Letter at 8; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 8 (“reporting sides and market
infrastructure providers will need to engage in significant builds and development of new
industry standards in order to comply”); WMBAA Letter at 5.

542

See Financial InterGroup Letter at 1; WMBAA Letter at 5-6; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 818.

543

Every security-based swap in that asset class that is executed on or after July 21, 2010,
and up and including to the day immediately before Compliance Date 1 is a transitional
security-based swap. As discussed in Section X(E), infra, the Commission’s final
compliance schedule establishes a separate Compliance Date 3 for pre-enactment and
transitional security-based swaps.
212

Furthermore, Rule 901—which imposes reporting duties on specified persons beginning
on Compliance Date 1—must be read in connection with Rules 908(a) and 908(b) on
Compliance Date 1. Thus, for example, a non-U.S. person who falls within one of the categories
set forth in Rule 908(b) could, under Rule 901(a), be required on Compliance Date 1 to report a
cross-border security-based swap if the security-based swap falls within one of the categories set
forth in Rule 908(a). Also, when persons with reporting duties begin mandatory reporting on
Compliance Date 1, they must do so in a manner consistent with Rule 903, which addresses the
use of coded information in the reporting of security-based swaps.
Beginning on Compliance Date 1, registered SDRs must comply with Rule 904, which
addresses the operating hours of registered SDRs, except for Rule 904(d). 544
Also beginning on Compliance Date 1, counterparties and registered SDRs must comply
with Rule 905 regarding the correction of errors in previously reported information about
security-based swaps in that asset class, except that the registered SDR will not yet be subject to
the requirement in Rule 905(b)(2) to publicly disseminate any corrected transaction reports
(because it will not yet be required to publicly disseminate a report of the initial transaction).
Furthermore, beginning on Compliance Date 1, each registered SDR must comply with the
requirement in Rule 906(a) to provide to each participant of that SDR a report of any missing
UICs, and any participant receiving such a report must comply with the requirement in Rule
906(a) to provide the missing UICs to the registered SDR. By Compliance Date 1, participants
enumerated in Rule 906(c) must establish the policies and procedures required by Rule 906(c).

544

Rule 904(d) addresses how a registered SDR must publicly disseminate information
about security-based swap transaction reports that were submitted during its closing
hours. As discussed in Section X(D), infra, public dissemination will commence on
Compliance Date 2.

213

1.

Compliance With Regulation SBSR Follows Security-Based Swap Dealer
Registration

Several commenters strongly urged the Commission to defer Compliance Date 1 until
security-based swap dealers must register with the Commission.545 These commenters correctly
observed that, during any interim period beginning on the date that the Commission requires
reporting of newly executed security-based swaps in a particular asset class but before the SBS
entities registration compliance date (the “Interim Period”), there would be no registered
security-based swap dealers or registered major security-based swap participants to occupy the
highest rungs of the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii). Therefore, during any such
Interim Period, any security-based swap covered by the reporting hierarchy would either be a
“tie”—because both sides are unregistered persons who fall within Rule 908(b)—or one side
would become the reporting side because only that side includes a person that falls within Rule
908(b). 546 The commenters argued generally that the absence of registered security-based swap
dealers at the top of the reporting hierarchy during the Interim Period would create a number of
difficulties in negotiating and carrying out reporting duties. 547 Commenters pointed out
particular difficulties with ascertaining reporting duties for cross-border transactions under Rule
901(a)(2)(ii) during the Interim Period 548 and emphasized that buy-side U.S. persons that transact

545

One commenter submitted several comments regarding this issue. See ISDA I at 4, 1113; ISDA II at 1-14; ISDA III at 1-2, 9-12; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 6-9. Other
commenters raised similar issues. See IIB Letter at 17; SIFMA-AMG II at 6-7;
SIFMA/FSR Letter at 15.

546

If one side of a security-based swap includes no person that falls within Rule 908(b), that
side does not incur any reporting duties under Regulation SBSR.

547

See, e.g., ISDA I at 11-13; ISDA II at 1-12; ISDA III at 1-2; ISDA/SIFMA at 6-7.

548

See ISDA II at 1-10; ISDA III at 2-11; SIFMA/FSR Letter at 13-14; SIFMA-AMG II at
6-7. One commenter expressed the general view that costs to buy-side U.S. persons of
negotiating with counterparties regarding reporting responsibilities, constructing
214

with foreign dealing entities during the Interim Period would find it particularly difficult to make
assessments of whether their non-U.S. counterparties were engaged in ANE activity.
Furthermore, according to the commenters, attempts to address difficulties arising during the
Interim Period would be costly, complicated, and inefficient, 549 and such interim solutions would
not be useful for the period after the SBS entities registration compliance date. 550
The Commission acknowledges the commenters’ concerns that requiring compliance
with Regulation SBSR before the SBS entities registration compliance date would have raised
numerous challenges, and that addressing these challenges would have necessitated time and
investment to create interim solutions that might not be useful after the SBS entities registration
compliance date. Therefore, the Commission has determined that market participants will not be
required to comply with Regulation SBSR until after the SBS entities registration compliance
date. As noted above, the second prong of Compliance Date 1 is one month after the SBS

reporting mechanisms, or engaging third parties to aid in their reporting are substantial
and outweigh the benefits of beginning reporting prior to the SBS entities registration
compliance date. See ISDA II at 4.
549

One commenter, for example, presented a complex set of possible options for facilitating
industry compliance with Regulation SBSR during the Interim Period. See ISDA III,
passim. These suggestions included the Commission adopting an “interim reporting side
hierarchy” as well as “a publicly available industry declaration for entities willing to
assume the role of a SBS dealing entity in such hierarchy,” regardless of whether or not
they were engaging in ANE activity in a particular transaction. See id. at 9-10. The
commenter also provided a detailed discussion of potential costs associated with these
suggested interim solutions. See id. at 6-9.

550

See, e.g., ISDA II at 7; UBS Letter at 2; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 9 (arguing that requiring
compliance with the reporting duties before the SBS entities registration compliance date
“creates unjustified additional costs to implement interim solutions” and that “[t]he cost
and effort of such implementation will be wasted once dealer registration is required”).
This commenter presented several potential alternatives for addressing concerns about
implementing Regulation SBSR before the SBS entities registration compliance date,
while stressing that its first choice was for the Commission to delay Compliance Date 1
until after the SBS entities registration compliance date. See ISDA III at 3-5, 9-10.

215

entities registration compliance date. This one-month period is designed to allow all securitybased swap market participants to become familiar with which firms have registered as securitybased swap dealers, and for registered security-based swap dealers to ensure that they have the
systems, policies, and procedures in place to commence their primary reporting duties under
Regulation SBSR. Without providing an additional period between the SBS entities registration
compliance date and Compliance Date 1, unnecessary confusion could result if market
participants were forced to readjust their reporting hierarchies within a very short period,
particularly if several firms were to register only days before or actually on the SBS entities
registration compliance date.
One commenter who urged that the Commission defer compliance with Regulation SBSR
until after security-based swap dealers register also recommended that, “[i]f the Commission
decides to require regulatory reporting of ANE transactions despite [comments] to the contrary,
reporting should be required only with respect to those ANE transactions that are relevant for
SBSD registration (i.e., executed from the later of (a) February 21, 2017 or (ii) two months
before the SBS registration compliance date).” 551 In light of the Commission’s final Compliance
Date 1 schedule, this comment is now moot because dealing entities will not be required to
report any security-based swap transactions before the SBS entities registration compliance date.
2.

At Least Six Months Between First SDR to Register and Compliance
Date 1

Final Compliance Date 1 retains a prong that generally follows the principle in proposed
Compliance Date 1 of allowing six months between the registration of the first SDR that can
accept transaction reports of security-based swaps in an asset class. The Commission continues

551

UBS Letter at 3.

216

to believe that it is appropriate to give market participants at least six months after the
registration of the first SDR that can accept transaction reports of security-based swaps in an
asset class before they are required to report transactions in that asset class. This period will
enable market participants to prepare their systems for reporting to that SDR and to fully
familiarize themselves with the SDR’s policies and procedures. However, as discussed below,
final Compliance Date 1 eliminates the proposed reference to the date on which such SDR
“commences operations” as a registered SDR.
One commenter expressed the view that the proposed compliance timeline would give
reporting sides and SDRs adequate time to implement Regulation SBSR. 552 A second
commenter, however, argued that Compliance Date 1 should be extended to 12 months after the
registration of the first SDR in an asset class. 553 A third commenter recommended that
Compliance Date 1 be nine months after the later of (1) the date by which security-based swap
dealers and major security-based swap participants are required to register with the Commission;
and (2) the date on which the Commission announces SDR readiness in an asset class. 554
The Commission believes that six months is an appropriate minimum period between
registration of the first SDR in an asset class and Compliance Date 1 with respect to that asset
class, particularly in view of the Commission’s decision not to require compliance with
Regulation SBSR until after the SBS entities registration compliance date. The Commission
further notes that, before the Commission grants registration to any SDR, the application would

See ICE Letter at 7.

553

See LCH.Clearnet Letter at 4, 12-13. The commenter believed that the proposed
timeframe would not provide enough time to connect to all registered SDRs. See id. at 4.

554

See ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 17; UBS Letter at 2.

217

be published for comment. 555 The minimum six-month period between the Commission’s grant
of an SDR’s registration and Compliance Date 1 should allow prospective participants sufficient
time to analyze the final form of the SDR’s policies and procedures under Regulation SBSR,
make inquiries to the SDR about technological and procedural matters for connecting to the SDR
to report the necessary data, build or adapt existing connections as necessary, and conduct
systems testing. 556 The Commission staff intends to monitor participant readiness during the
period between the granting of the first SDR registration and Compliance Date 1.
Certain commenters suggested establishing dates certain for compliance with Regulation
SBSR. 557 While the Commission appreciates commenters’ desire to have certainty about when
their duties under Regulation SBSR will commence, the Commission notes that there are not yet
any registered SDRs and the Commission cannot predict when one or more SDRs will be granted
registration. Furthermore, the SBS entities registration compliance date is contingent on the
completion of several other rulemakings. The Commission believes, therefore, that the more
practical approach is to base Compliance Date 1 on the later of these two events, rather than to
establish dates certain.
Finally, two commenters noted that, although proposed Compliance Date 1 would have
been tied to the commencement of operations of a registered SDR in an asset class,
“commencement of operations” is not defined and it was not clear to the commenters how this

555

See SDR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14465.

556

See WMBAA Letter at 6 (“Platforms’ compliance with the Proposed Rules will depend
on the permissibility of functionality of services provided by third-party vendors and
SDRs. These vital infrastructure components will determine how quickly platforms and
market participants can comply with the Proposed Rules”).

557

See DTCC Letter at 3; DTCC/ICE/CME Letter at 4.

218

date would be determined or how market participants would be made aware of that date. 558 The
Commission has determined to eliminate the “commencement of operations” as one of the
triggering events in Compliance Date 1. The Commission acknowledges that this change from
“commencement of operations” to the date of SDR registration in this prong could reduce the
number of days between the issuance of this release and Compliance Date 1, if there is in fact a
lag between registration and the “commencement of operations” for that registered SDR.
However, the Commission believes that market participants will benefit from eliminating
uncertainty about precisely when an SDR “commences operations” and how the fact of such
commencement would be conveyed.
Finally, the Commission notes that it is setting Compliance Date 1 as the first Monday
following the later of the two stipulated events. Beginning mandatory transaction reporting on a
Monday will give registered SDRs and their participants at least one final weekend to conduct
any final systems changes or testing.
3.

There May Be Separate Compliance Dates for Separate Asset Classes

The Commission is adopting the proposed approach that the compliance dates are
specific to a security-based swap asset class. One commenter expressed concern that the
potential for varying compliance dates for different asset classes “would inject unnecessary
complexity into the implementation process and potentially cause confusion among market
participants.” 559 The Commission notes, however, that there is no requirement that a person that
seeks registration as an SDR must accept security-based swaps in both the credit and equity asset
classes. Thus, a person might submit an application to register as an SDR only with respect to a
558

See DTCC Letter at 12; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 17.

559

DTCC Letter at 12, n. 25.

219

single asset class. 560 If the Commission were to grant registration of an SDR applicant that could
receive transactions in only a single asset class and assuming that the other prong of Compliance
Date 1 were met, it would be impossible for market participants to report transactions in other
asset classes to that SDR. Delaying Compliance Date 1 until an SDR has been registered in all
security-based swap asset classes would prevent reporting from beginning in the asset class or
classes that the first registered SDR is ready to accept. Therefore, the Commission believes that
it is appropriate to make the compliance dates specific to each asset class.
4.

“First-Mover” Concerns

Several commenters expressed concerns about triggering compliance based on the first
SDR in an asset class to register with the Commission. 561 One commenter recommended that, to
minimize these concerns, the Commission should “coordinate its processing of SDR applications
received within a reasonable window and time its announcement of SDR registration and
readiness to include all SDRs for an asset class that will be approved ahead of Compliance
Date 1.” 562 Likewise, a second commenter urged the Commission “to uniformly review and

560

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 77699, Notice of Filing of Application for
Registration as a Security-Based Swap Data Repository by ICE Trade Vault, LLC (April 22,
2016) (SBSDR-2016-01) (requesting registration with the Commission as an SDR only
for the credit asset class).

561

See DTCC Letter at 12 (noting that market participants will likely be compelled to begin
the onboarding process with the first registered SDR); DTCC/ICE/CME Letter at 4
(noting that market participants would have no choice but to join the first registered SDR
to guarantee that they meet any compliance date tied to the first SDR); ICE Letter at 8;
ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 18 (stating that a reporting side may not be able to freely select
the SDR of its choice if another SDR is first to register and the desired SDR cannot
complete the registration process before participants would be compelled to report to the
first SDR).

562

ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 18.

220

approve SDR applicants that are acting in good faith to complete the application process in order
to minimize ‘first mover’ advantages.” 563
With respect to commenters’ concerns about multiple SDR applications for registration,
the Commission previously stated in the SDR Adopting Release that it “intends to process such
applications . . . within the same period of time so as to address competition concerns that could
arise if such SDRs were granted registration at different times.” 564 However, if an SDR
application meets the criteria of Rule 13n-1(c)(3) under the Exchange Act, 565 the Commission
does not believe that it should be necessary to delay granting the registration because of the
status of other pending applications. As the Commission also noted in the SDR Adopting
Release: “Certain unexpected events that raise compliance concerns with respect to one
applicant but not another, such as deficiencies identified in connection with the Commission’s
consideration of whether an applicant meets the criteria of Rule 13n-1(c), may interfere with the
Commission’s ability to process initial applications for registration within the same period of
time.” 566
The Commission acknowledges that, by requiring compliance based on the first SDR in
an asset class to register with the Commission, a participant might not be able to report securitybased swaps to its preferred SDR. However, this situation implies that the participant’s preferred
SDR for reporting security-based swap transactions has not yet met the criteria for registration
563

ICE Letter at 8. This commenter also urged the Commission to “focus equally on each
application,” “provide applicants equal opportunities to address the Commission’s
comments and amend their applications,” and “make best efforts to approve SDR
applicants at the same time.” Id.

granting the registration of an SDR).

566

80 FR at 14467, n. 340.

221

under Rule 13n-1(c)(3). The Commission believes that commencing reporting with only a single
registered SDR in an asset class, should this prove necessary, would be preferable to any
alternative. When the Commission grants the first SDR registration, delaying compliance with
Regulation SBSR until additional registrations are granted would not further the objectives of
Title VII. 567 The opposite approach, whereby the Commission would not require compliance
with Regulation SBSR until two or more SDRs had registered with the Commission, could have
the effect of giving an applicant that has not met the criteria for registration the power to delay
the reporting regime contemplated by Title VII. The Commission believes that this outcome
would unfairly retard the ability of a successful applicant to begin providing SDR services.
Finally, the Commission notes that, even if there is only one registered SDR for some
period of time, other Commission rules are designed to minimize any undue advantage that the
first SDR might otherwise enjoy. For example, every SDR, even the first and only registered
SDR in a particular asset class, must offer fair, open, and not unreasonably discriminatory access
to users of its services. 568 Furthermore, any fees that it charges would have to be fair and
reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory. 569

jurisdictions. 570 In the view of one of these commenters, this approach could “save reporting
sides the effort and cost of building to the SBSR requirements if their current builds will
suffice.” 571 Another commenter stated that “[r]equiring the changes to systems, personnel and
trade flows necessary to comply with the Commission’s Proposal only to later be granted
substituted compliance would impose significant and unnecessary burdens for negligible shortterm benefits.” 572
The Commission declines to accept this suggestion and does not believe that compliance
with Title VII’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements, as implemented by
Regulation SBSR, should be delayed until the Commission has made any substituted compliance
determinations. The Commission has not yet received any substituted compliance applications
and, therefore, does not yet have sufficient information regarding any foreign jurisdiction to
make the findings necessary to issue a substituted compliance order. In addition, because many
other jurisdictions are, like the Commission, still in the process of establishing and implementing
their regulatory requirements, the Commission cannot predict when—or even if—any
jurisdictions ultimately will have regulatory systems that are comparable to Regulation SBSR. If
the Commission were to accept the commenters’ suggestion, the Commission might have to

the reporting and public dissemination regime.

No Delay for Adoption of SB SEF Rules

Two commenters urged the Commission to delay Compliance Date 1 until the
Commission adopts final rules relating to SB SEFs and provides sufficient time for entities to
register with the Commission as SB SEFs. 573 One of these commenters argued, for example, that
“the Commission should prepare alternative compliance regimes in the chance that all of the SB
swap trading rules are not in place (and, as a result, market participants cannot meet the reporting
obligations of Rule 901) by Compliance Date 1.” 574
The Commission declines to act on the commenters’ suggestion. Delaying compliance
with Regulation SBSR until final rules relating to SB SEFs are adopted would result in the
Commission and other relevant authorities continuing to lack complete records of all securitybased swap transactions, which will facilitate market and systemic risk oversight. The
Commission believes that Regulation SBSR can be successfully implemented even before the
adoption of final SB SEF rules and the registration of SB SEFs with the Commission. The
Commission understands that, currently, many security-based swaps trade off-platform and it is
likely that a sizeable portion of the security-based swap market will continue to trade offplatform, even after SB SEFs have the opportunity to register with the Commission. The
Commission believes that delaying Compliance Date 1 until SB SEFs have registered would
unnecessarily delay the reporting of security-based swaps that trade off-platform.

224

The Commission understands that there are a small number of existing entities that likely
meet the definition of “security-based swap execution facility” at present but are not yet
registered with the Commission as such. However, Rule 901(a)(1) applies to all platforms,
including unregistered SB SEF. Moreover, the Commission does not believe that the finalization
of its SB SEF rules would affect their capability to report such transactions to a registered SDR
because the Commission understands that such entities are likely to be swap execution facilities
that already have incurred swap reporting duties under CFTC rules. 575 Thus, these entities
already have substantial reporting infrastructure that can likely be used to support security-based
swap reporting duties. 576 For transactions that occur on exempt SB SEFs, the Commission
considered an alternative of requiring a side to report each transaction effected on the SB SEF
that will be submitted to clearing until SB SEFs have an opportunity to register with the
Commission. However, this alternative is unworkable because platform transactions that will be
submitted to clearing may be anonymous, and the sides cannot be expected to ascertain the
reporting side or report the necessary counterparty information if they are anonymous to each
other. 577

Compliance With UIC Requirements

Several commenters urged the Commission to defer compliance with Regulation SBSR’s
UIC requirements until international standards for these UICs are developed and can be used

See Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements, 77 FR 2136 (January 13,

across multiple SDRs and multiple jurisdictions. 578 Two of these commenters expressed concern
that requiring each registered SDR to establish its own UIC system ahead of an internationally
recognized standard would generate significant complexities and costs and would frustrate data
aggregation efforts. 579 One commenter argued that the Commission generally should “consider a
separate compliance schedule for UIC fields to allow sufficient time for SB SDRs to work
collaboratively with market participants, including prospective UIC issuers, to develop an
industry standard or, at minimum, an SB SDR-specific methodology.” 580
After carefully considering the issues raised by commenters, the Commission believes,
for the reasons described below, that use of the various UICs must commence on Compliance
Date 1:
a.

UICs for Legal Entities

For any UIC that can be represented with a Legal Entity Identifier (“LEI”), compliance is
required on Compliance Date 1. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission
recognized the Global Legal Entity Identifier System (“GLEIS”) as an internationally recognized
standards-setting system (“IRSS”) that satisfies the requirements of Rule 903. 581 Under Rule
903(a), if an IRSS recognized by the Commission has assigned a UIC to a person, unit of a
person, or product, each registered SDR must employ that UIC for reporting purposes under
Regulation SBSR, and SDR participants must obtain such UICs for use under Regulation SBSR.

should allow “sufficient time for the IDs to be developed in collaboration with the
industry”).

581

See 80 FR at 14631-32.

226

Counterparties, ultimate parents, brokers, execution agents, platforms, registered clearing
agencies, and registered broker-dealers typically are legal entities and typically already have or
will be able to obtain an LEI. Accordingly, compliance with the LEI requirements under
Regulation SBSR is required on Compliance Date 1.
b.

Branch ID, Trading Desk ID, and Trader ID

Regulation SBSR also requires UICs for three types of “sub-legal entities”: branches,
trading desks, and individual traders. As commenters note, neither the GLEIS nor any other
potential IRSS assigns identifiers to any sub-legal entities at this time. 582 Although the GLEIS
has begun exploring the possibility of assigning identifiers to branches and certain natural
persons, 583 it is unclear when any final decision to do so might be taken. Given the uncertainty
about when or even if an IRSS will eventually be able to issue identifiers for all branches, trading
desks, and traders, the Commission does not believe that it would be appropriate to delay
compliance with these UIC requirements until an IRSS can provide them.
The Commission recognizes that this approach raises the possibility that different SDRs
could, in theory, assign different UICs to the same person, unit of a person, or product. If this
were to occur, the Commission could have to map the UICs assigned by one registered SDR to
the corresponding UICs assigned by one or more other SDRs to maintain a complete picture of
the market activity pertaining to a particular person or sub-legal entity. The Commission

specifically addressed this issue in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. 584 However, the
Commission previously noted a mechanism whereby a participant could use the same UICs at
multiple SDRs. 585 Regulation SBSR does not prohibit a participant from making suggestions to
a registered SDR regarding the UICs that the SDR is required to assign, particularly for sub-legal
entities. 586 Through this mechanism for assignment, a person who is a participant of two or more
registered SDRs could—with the concurrence of these SDRs—utilize the same UICs across
multiple SDRs. 587

584

See 80 FR at 14632 (“UICs, even if SDR-specific, will provide a streamlined way of
reporting, disseminating, and interpreting security-based swap information. The
Commission believes that requiring registered SDRs to develop their own UICs—but
only for UICs that are not assigned by or through an IRSS that has been recognized by
the Commission—will result in less confusion than the currently available alternatives,
such as allowing each reporting side to utilize its own nomenclature conventions, which
would subsequently have to be normalized by registered SDRs or by the Commission”).

585

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14723, n. 1371 (“assume that a person
becomes a participant of a registered SDR and obtains UICs for its trading desks and
individual traders from that SDR. Later, that person becomes a participant at a second
registered SDR. The second SDR could issue its own set of UICs for this person’s
trading desks and individual traders, or it could recognize and permit use of the same
UICs that had been assigned by the first registered SDR”).

586

This could also be true for identifying counterparties that do not fall within Rule 908(b)
and do not otherwise have an LEI that could be used for the counterparty ID.

587

In connection with its comments regarding how Regulation SBSR’s compliance dates
should address UIC issues, one commenter recommended that the Commission “consult
and agree with market participants” on how to assign various UICs, including branch ID,
trading desk ID, trader ID, and product IDs. See DTCC Letter at 10-11. The commenter
then recommended compliance dates of different lengths after a standard for each type of
UIC had been agreed upon. See id. The Commission already has established a
mechanism for how these UICs must be assigned: Rule 903(a), as adopted in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, provides that, in the absence of a Commissionrecognized IRSS that can supply the UIC, a registered SDR must assign the UIC using its
own methodology. Furthermore, in light of the guidance above regarding how a
registered SDR may confer with a participant to assign a mutually agreeable set of
UICs—and how, through this process, the same UICs could be used for a particular
participant across multiple SDRs—the Commission does not believe that it is necessary
228

c.

Transaction ID

Also beginning on Compliance Date 1, each registered SDR must comply with Rule
901(g), which requires the SDR to assign a transaction ID to each security-based swap, or
establish or endorse a methodology for transaction IDs to be assigned by third parties. Because
of the potential importance of identifying individual transactions for systemic risk and market
oversight purposes, the Commission believes that it is essential for registered SDRs to comply
with Rule 901(g) from the moment that they begin receiving mandatory transaction reports. 588
One commenter expressed the belief that SDRs will be able to assign transaction IDs to
pre-enactment and transitional security-based swaps by the date that the Commission had
proposed in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release. 589 Since the proposed
compliance schedule would have required historical security-based swaps to be reported by or
before proposed Compliance Date 1, the comment implies that registered SDRs also should be
able to assign transaction IDs to newly executed transactions beginning on Compliance Date 1.
A second commenter urged the Commission to “recognize the ‘first touch principle’ as an
acceptable standard for SB SDRs to meet their 901(g) obligations.” 590 The commenter explained
that, under the existing CFTC swap data reporting rules, an SDR is not required to issue a
transaction ID and can rely on the reporting side to submit its internal transaction ID. 591 As

or appropriate to establish different compliance dates for each type of UIC in the manner
recommended by the commenter.
588

Also beginning on Compliance Date 1, each registered SDR must comply with the
companion requirement in Rule 901(f) that a registered SDR time-stamp all incoming
transaction reports.

589

See ICE Letter at 8.

590

DTCC Letter at 20.

591

See id. The Commission notes, however, that, under CFTC Rule § 45.5(c), 17 CFR
45.5(c), a swap data repository must create and transmit a unique swap identifier for an
229

provided in existing Rule 901(g), a registered SDR may endorse a methodology for third parties
to assign a transaction ID to an individual security-based swap. If an SDR wishes to allow third
parties (such as platforms or counterparties) to assign transaction IDs, the SDR must explain in
its policies and procedures under Rule 907(a)(5) 592 any form or content requirements imposed by
the SDR that the third party would be required to follow.
d.

Product ID

One commenter argued that, before requiring compliance with the product ID
requirement, the Commission should “consult and agree with market participants on a standard
to be applied. An agreed upon public standard would provide greater certainty to reporting sides
and SB SDRs to build to one uniform standard as opposed to bespoke models for each SDR.” 593
After careful consideration of this comment, the Commission has determined not to delay
compliance with the product ID requirement. At the present time, it is unclear if or when market
participants could agree upon and implement standards for a product ID. Therefore, in the
absence of an IRSS that can assign product IDs, registered SDRs must by Compliance Date 1
begin assigning product IDs, and persons with a duty to report transactions must use these SDRassigned product IDs in their mandatory reports. To enable their participants to report
transactions using the appropriate product IDs on Compliance Date 1, registered SDRs must set
out in their written policies and procedures how they will assign product IDs (and all other UICs
other than those available through an IRSS recognized by the Commission) in a manner
off-facility swap if the reporting counterparty for that swap is a non-swap dealer/major
swap participant.
592

Rule 907(a)(5) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and
procedures for assigning UICs, including but not limited to transaction IDs, in a manner
consistent with Rule 903.

593

DTCC Letter at 10.

230

consistent with Rule 903. A registered SDR should consider publishing as far in advance of
Compliance Date 1 as possible the product IDs of the products most likely to be traded on or
shortly after Compliance Date 1. The Commission recognizes, however, that it is not practical
for a registered SDR to publish a list of all possible products with their product IDs, as many
products have not yet been created (or certain types of contracts have not yet become sufficiently
standardized as to become products, as that term is defined in Rule 900(aa), and thus require a
product ID). Therefore, as a practical matter, the Commission does not believe that a registered
SDR could comply with Rule 907(a) unless its policies and procedures include a mechanism or
process for the registered SDR to assign a product ID to a new product before or simultaneously
with the initial transaction in that product, and to make available the product ID so that reports of
transactions in that new product can include the correct product ID.
8.

Switching of Reporting Side Designation

One commenter’s analysis of the problems that could result from a Commission
determination to require reporting compliance ahead of the SBS entities registration compliance
date was premised on the assumption that a U.S. non-dealing entity that was the reporting side
for a security-based swap executed during the Interim Period would remain the reporting side for
the life of the security-based swap. 594 The commenter argued that Regulation SBSR should not
permit the reporting side designation to “switch” from one side to the other over life of a
security-based swap contract. 595 The Commission disagrees with this comment.

594

See ISDA I at 13; ISDA II at 7.

595

See ISDA I at 8 (“Switching the reporting side during the term of a trade is in every
respect an enormous challenge . . . [and] will likely have a significant impact on the
completeness, integrity and correctness of reported SBS data”).

231

Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) sets forth a reporting hierarchy that has two possible outcomes for any
transaction pair: (1) one side occupies a higher rung in the hierarchy than the other side, in
which case the side that occupies the higher rung “shall be the reporting side”; or (2) the
outcome is a tie, and “the sides shall select the reporting side.” Sides in a tie situation, after
having made an initial selection of the reporting side, can select a new reporting side later in the
life of the contract. 596
Over the life of a security-based swap, a registered SDR needs to know the reporting side
of a security-based swap so that it knows whether it is receiving a report of a life cycle event or
an error report from the entity that is obligated to report that information. A registered SDR
should consider incorporating into its policies and procedures how it would accommodate any
change to the reporting side designation. A registered SDR may, for example, seek to obtain, in
the case of an elective switch, information from one or both sides that confirms the switch.
D.

Compliance Date 2

Compliance Date 2 is the date on which all registered SDRs that can accept securitybased swaps in a particular asset class must begin public dissemination, pursuant to Rule 902, of
transactions in that asset class. On Compliance Date 2, each such SDR will be required to
comply with Rules 902 (regarding public dissemination generally), 904(d) (requiring
dissemination of transaction reports held in queue during normal or special closing hours), and
905(b)(2) (with respect to public dissemination of corrected transaction reports) for all security-

596

If the sides insisted on selecting a new reporting side but Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) did not permit
them to do so, they could accomplish the new selection by tearing up the existing
security-based swap and immediately replacing it with a new security-based swap having
exactly the same terms, except that they select a different reporting side for the new
transaction.

232

based swaps in that asset class, except as provided by Rule 902(c). As discussed further below,
Compliance Date 2 is the first Monday that is three months after Compliance Date 1.
One commenter expressed the view that commencing the requirement for public
dissemination nine months after SDR registration would be sufficient, provided that other
compliance issues arising earlier in the compliance schedule are resolved. 597 Likewise, a second
commenter believed that Compliance Date 2 should be three months after Compliance Date 1,
but only after stating its belief that Compliance Date 1 should be 12 months rather than six
months after the first registered SDR commences operations. 598 A third commenter believed that
three months after Compliance Date 1 was not sufficient time for SDRs to comply with the data
dissemination requirements in Regulation SBSR and recommended six months instead. 599 A
fourth commenter recommended that Compliance Date 2 be three months after the later of
Compliance Date 1 and the date on which the Commission has determined appropriate
exceptions, delays, and/or notional caps to preserve the identity, business transactions, and
market positions of any person. 600 The fourth commenter asserted that the longer time was
necessary for Compliance Date 2 because “concerns regarding the compromise of market
anonymity for illiquid and large notional trades have not adequately been addressed during the
interim period.” 601
The Commission has revised its proposed approach to Compliance Date 2 as it relates to
the handling of covered cross-border transactions. In the Regulation SBSR Proposed

233

Amendments Release, the Commission proposed that the public dissemination requirements
associated with Compliance Date 2 would not have applied to covered cross-border
transactions. 602 However, as discussed in Section IX(E), supra, the Commission in the U.S.
Activity Proposal sought additional comment on whether public dissemination of covered crossborder transactions should be made effective 603 and, in this release, the Commission has
determined that all transactions described in Rule 908(a)(1), including covered cross-border
transactions, shall be subject to public dissemination, except as otherwise provided by Rule
902(c). Therefore, compliance with the public dissemination requirements shall commence on
Compliance Date 2 for covered cross-border transactions along with other security-based swaps,
and there is no longer any reason to consider an effective or compliance date for covered crossborder transactions separate from all other transactions that are subject to public dissemination.
The Commission proposed and is now adopting a three-month period between
Compliance Date 1 and Compliance Date 2. This three-month period is designed to give
registered SDRs and persons having a duty to report an opportunity to identify and resolve any
issues related to trade-by-trade reporting by participants and further test their data dissemination
systems. The Commission staff intends to monitor the implementation of Regulation SBSR
between Compliance Dates 1 and 2.
Also, similar to the approach taken for Compliance Date 1, the Commission believes that
it will be helpful to the industry to begin public dissemination on a Monday, which ensures that
602

See supra note 460 (explaining that term). One commenter supported excluding covered
cross-border transactions from public dissemination on Compliance Date 2, as well as the
Commission’s decision to seek public comment before determining if and when to
include them in the scope of transactions subject to public dissemination. See
ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 18. The Commission addressed this comment in Section IX(E),
supra.

603

See 80 FR at 27485.

234

registered SDRs have at least the immediately preceding weekend to conduct any final systems
changes or testing before public dissemination begins. Therefore, Compliance Date 2 is the first
Monday that is three months after Compliance Date 1.
Finally, Compliance Date 2 is the date by which participants of registered SDRs that are
subject to Rule 906(b) must comply with that rule. 604 This represents a change from the
proposed compliance schedule, under which covered participants would have been required to
comply with Rule 906(b) on Compliance Date 1. 605 A person does not become subject to Rule
906(b) until it becomes a participant of a registered SDR. A counterparty to a security-based
swap becomes a participant of a registered SDR only when a security-based swap to which it is a
counterparty is reported to that SDR on a mandatory basis. 606 Thus, a security-based swap
counterparty cannot become a participant until Compliance Date 1 at the earliest, because
transactions will not be reported to a registered SDR on a mandatory basis until Compliance
Date 1. A large number of security-based swap counterparties will become participants on
Compliance Date 1 or the first days and weeks following Compliance Date 1. This could, in the

604

Rule 906(b) requires each participant of a registered SDR to provide to the SDR
information sufficient to identify the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s)
of the participant that also are participants of that registered SDR. Rule 906(b) further
provides that a participant must “promptly” notify the registered SDR of any changes to
that information. Rule 907(a)(6) requires each registered SDR to establish and maintain
written policies and procedures for periodically obtaining from each participant
information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any participant(s) with
which the participant is affiliated.

See Rule 900(u).

235

Commission’s view, cause unnecessary difficulties for registered SDRs and their new
participants if participants were required to comply with Rule 906(b) on Compliance Date 1. 607
In light of this concern, the Commission now believes that it is appropriate to delay
compliance with Rule 906(b) for an additional three months to avoid triggering a large number
of new filings and amendments that likely would have been required if the Commission had
required compliance with Rule 906(b) on Compliance Date 1. Accordingly, the Commission is
not requiring compliance with Rule 906(b) until Compliance Date 2. This will allow for a
number of security-based swaps to be reported over the three-month period between Compliance
Dates 1 and 2 that will create a critical mass of participants, thereby permitting the filing of
initial reports under Rule 906(b) that are less likely to require repeated updating because of the
addition of new participants that are affiliated with existing participants. 608

607

For example, assume that S, T, and U are affiliated and all have a single ultimate parent
(P) and the Commission had required compliance with Rule 906(b) on Compliance
Date 1. At 09:30:02 UTC on Compliance Date 1, a security-based swap involving S as a
counterparty is reported to SDR A on a mandatory basis. This is the first time that S is a
counterparty to a transaction reported to SDR A on a mandatory basis, and no affiliates of
S are counterparties to security-based swaps that have been reported to SDR A. Upon
becoming a participant of SDR A, S must report to SDR A that it has an ultimate parent
(P) and no affiliates that are also participants. At 10:30:57 UTC, a security-based swap
involving T as a counterparty is reported to SDR A on a mandatory basis. T also
becomes a participant of SDR A and must report to SDR A that it has an ultimate parent
(P) and one affiliate (S) that also is a participant of SDR A. Because Rule 906(b) also
requires S to promptly notify SDR A of any changes to its ultimate parent and affiliate
information, S must amend its submission to SDR A to reflect that its affiliate T has just
become a participant. At 11:30:33 UTC, a security-based swap involving U as a
counterparty is reported to SDR A on a mandatory basis. U must report to SDR A that it
has an ultimate parent (P) and two affiliates that are participants (S and T). U’s
becoming a participant also triggers revisions to S and T’s reports to reflect that their
affiliate U has just become a participant. Thus, the creation of new participants in the
first hours and days after Compliance Date 1 could trigger the requirement to file a large
number of amended reports under Rule 906(b).

608

The Commission recognizes, however, that several Rule 906(b) reports could have to be
amended to reflect the addition of a new participant, even after Compliance Date 2. For
236

E.

New Compliance Date 3 for Historical Security-Based Swaps

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed that
persons with a duty to report historical security-based swaps in the relevant asset class would
have been required to report these transactions to a registered SDR that accepts transactions in
that asset class, in accordance with Rule 901(i), by Compliance Date 1. As discussed further
below, the Commission is adopting a new Compliance Date 3 for the reporting of historical
security-based swaps. Compliance Date 3 is two months after Compliance Date 2.
One commenter expressed the view that requiring reporting of historical security-based
swaps in advance of the SBS entities registration compliance date would place the bulk of the
reporting burden on U.S. persons, including buy-side U.S. persons, because U.S. persons would
be the reporting side for all historical security-based swaps entered into with a foreign dealing
example, assume that ultimate parent P has 20 subsidiaries, each of which is a participant
of SDR A. Rule 906(b) requires a report from each subsidiary showing P as the ultimate
parent and each of the other 19 subsidiaries as affiliates. Now assume that a new 21st
subsidiary of P is a counterparty to a transaction reported to SDR A on a mandatory
basis. This would trigger amendments to the existing 20 reports to reflect the addition of
a new affiliate participant. Because these reports would be unnecessarily duplicative, the
Commission interprets Rule 906(b) as being satisfied if one member of a financial group
provides all of the required ultimate parent and affiliate information on behalf of each
group member that is a participant of that registered SDR. While the registered SDR
could seek to obtain a separate report from each group member that is a participant, the
Commission encourages registered SDRs to consider establishing policies and procedures
under Rule 907(a)(6) that would allow for abbreviated reporting for the entire group.
Such abbreviated group reporting would still be subject to the requirement that any
changes be reported to the registered SDR “promptly.” Furthermore, a participant in the
group would still be subject to a requirement to separately disclose any ultimate parent or
affiliate information that differs from that of other members of the group. In the example
above, assume that the 17th subsidiary of P is a 50-50 joint venture with Q. Under the
approach suggested here, one member of the P group could file an abbreviated Rule
906(b) report on behalf of all members of the P group (that would identify all 20
subsidiaries, including the 17th). However, the 17th subsidiary would be subject to a
separate requirement to notify the registered SDR that, unlike all of the other P group
affiliates, it has two ultimate parents (P and Q) and would have to identify any additional
participant affiliates that it might have through its Q parent.

237

entity that did not involve ANE activity. 609 Furthermore, this commenter expressed concern that
it could not be reliably determined whether U.S. personnel were used to engage in ANE activity
for historical security-based swaps because parties were not required to capture or exchange such
information at the time the transactions were executed. 610 The commenter concluded that it
would be significantly easier to ascertain the reporting side for historical transactions after the
SBS entities registration compliance date, because most would involve a counterparty that will
register as a security-based swap dealer. 611 This commenter, in a joint letter with another
association, also expressed the view that the volume of non-live historic security-based swaps
“will be enormous” and that “reporting over five years of security-based swap transaction data
will require tremendous effort and coordination between reporting sides and their SDR.” 612
These comments recommended an extended period for reporting non-live historical securitybased swaps after the SBS entities registration compliance date, and argued that the
commencement of reporting under Regulation SBSR would be more effective if the reporting of
non-live historic security-based swaps were done separately and after security-based swap dealer
registration. 613
These commenters also argued that “[d]ealer registration will greatly expand the scope of
SBS subject to reporting at a later date, essentially creating additional individual compliance
dates for registrants and their counterparties to report additional SBS activity and historic SBS,”
which “will also trigger the question as to who has the reporting obligation for historical

SBS.” 614 This comment is premised on the correct observation that a historical security-based
swap between two unregistered non-U.S. persons, neither of whom engaged in ANE activity,
would fall within Rule 908(a) only after one side or the other registers with the Commission as a
security-based swap dealer. One of these commenters also expressed the view that “existing
TIW functionality cannot be leveraged to accomplish reporting [of historical security-based
swaps] in advance of registration.” 615 Therefore, in the commenter’s view, to satisfy obligations
to report historical transactions before the SBS entities registration compliance date, market
participants would need to expend “significant effort and cost to develop appropriate new
industry agreements, conduct significant outreach to U.S. Persons and build interim reporting
logic.” 616
In light of these considerations, the Commission is adopting a new Compliance Date 3,
which is designed to minimize the concerns raised by the commenters. Persons with a duty to
report historical security-based swaps in an asset class must do so by the date that is two months
after Compliance Date 2. To the extent that historical transactions involve a non-U.S.
counterparty that is likely to register as a security-based swap dealer, deferring compliance with
the requirement to report historical transactions until security-based swap dealers are registered
will significantly reduce undue burdens on non-dealing persons who are their counterparties.
After the SBS entities registration compliance date, registered security-based swap dealers will
be clearly identifiable as such and will bear the responsibility for reporting any historical
transactions with unregistered persons to the extent that information about such transactions is

239

available. The two-month gap between Compliance Date 2 and Compliance Date 3 is designed
to avoid problems that could arise if registered SDRs and their participants had been required to
achieve major compliance milestones on the same day or in close proximity.
The Commission notes that the relevant transactions need not be reported on Compliance
Date 3, but rather by Compliance Date 3. The Commission encourages reporting sides to report
historical security-based swaps as far in advance of Compliance Date 3 as possible, to avoid
difficulties that might arise if reporting sides attempt to report a large number of historical
transactions in the last few days or hours before Compliance Date 3.
The Commission believes that a new Compliance Date 3, occurring after the SBS entities
registration compliance date, for reporting of historical transactions represents an appropriate
consideration of the benefits of mandatory reporting in light of the likely costs. Before securitybased swap dealers register as such with the Commission, the only way a foreign dealing entity
could incur any duty under Regulation SBSR is if it were engaging in ANE activity with respect
to a particular transaction. The Commission is persuaded by commenters who argued that it
could be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether historical transactions of foreign dealing
entities involved ANE activity, as information about the involvement of U.S. personnel in
particular transactions might not exist or might be difficult to reconstruct for transactions that
were executed, in some cases, many years ago. 617 Because the Commission anticipates that
foreign dealing entities that account for the vast majority of cross-border transactions will
register as security-based swap dealers, the issues associated with identifying whether a foreign
dealing entity has engaged in ANE activity will not arise for the vast majority of historical crossborder transactions. After the SBS entities registration compliance date, the reporting hierarchy
617

See ISDA II at 10; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 16-17.

240

can easily be applied because at least one side will likely include a registered security-based
swap dealer. This approach will minimize instances where unregistered U.S. persons could
become the reporting side when they are counterparties with foreign dealing entities.
A registered SDR that accepts reports of transactions in the relevant asset class may allow
persons with a duty to report historical transactions in that asset class on a rolling basis at any
time after Compliance Date 1. When it begins accepting reports of historical security-based
swaps submitted on a mandatory basis, a registered SDR must comply with Rule 901(f) and
time-stamp, to the second, any security-based swap data that it receives pursuant to Rule 901(i).
The registered SDR also must comply with Rule 901(g) with respect to transaction IDs for each
historical security-based swap that it receives.
As participants begin reporting historical security-based swaps to a registered SDR,
participants and registered SDRs also must comply with Rules 901(e) and 905 regarding any
historical security-based swaps that are so reported. A report of a life cycle event of a historical
transaction that relates to information required by Rule 901(c) would trigger public
dissemination of the life cycle event if the report is submitted on or after Compliance Date 2. 618
The Commission notes that registered SDRs and their participants need not comply with
Rule 906(a) with respect to historical security-based swaps. Rule 906(a) requires a registered
SDR to identify security-based swaps for which the SDR lacks counterparty ID and (if
applicable) broker ID, branch ID, execution agent ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID. Regulation
SBSR requires reporting of historical security-based swaps only “to the extent that information
618

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14609 (“life cycle events relating to
the primary trade information of historical security-based swaps must, after the public
dissemination requirement goes into effect, be publicly disseminated”). However, an
error correction of a historical security-based swap involving Rule 901(c) information
would not trigger public dissemination, even after Compliance Date 2. See id.

241

about such transactions is available”—including information pertaining to the remaining UICs.
Because broker IDs, branch IDs, execution agent IDs, trading desk IDs, and trader IDs will not
be assigned by registered SDRs until they become operational, these UICs likely will not have
existed or been recorded in connection with any historical security-based swaps. Therefore,
because these UICs are not applicable to historical security-based swaps, a registered SDR is not
required by Rule 906(a) to query non-reporting sides for those UICs with respect to any
historical transactions, and non-reporting sides are not required by Rule 906(a) to provide any
UICs with respect to historical transactions.
F.

No Separate Compliance Dates for Cross-Border Transactions

Compliance Dates 1, 2, and 3 apply equally to all security-based swaps that fall within
Rule 908(a), as amended herein, and all security-based swap counterparties that fall within Rule
908(b), as amended herein. Compliance Dates 1, 2, and 3 apply to all transactions contemplated
by the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2), as amended herein, including the cross-border
provisions of new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E). Thus, U.S.-to-U.S. transactions do not have different
compliance dates than the cross-border transactions that fall within Rule 908(a).
One commenter, responding to the proposed compliance schedule in the Regulation
SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, warned that, if the Commission required regulatory
reporting before security-based swap dealer registration, U.S. non-dealing entities would incur
the reporting duty when they traded against large foreign dealing entities 619 and that U.S.-to-U.S.
transactions would be subject to public dissemination before U.S.-to-non-U.S. transactions. 620
As a result, the commenter argued, “U.S. person end-users may avoid trading with other U.S.
619

See ISDA/SIFMA at 7.

620

See id. at 7-8.

242

persons until after dealer registration to avoid their data being publicly disseminated.” 621 The
commenter concluded that U.S. non-dealing entities’ avoidance of other U.S. counterparties
would disadvantage U.S. dealing entities and result in less liquidity for U.S. non-dealing
entities. 622 The commenter also cautioned that “[w]ith a limited list of counterparties and an
even narrower list of dealers to such transactions, public dissemination of this smaller segment of
SBS data bears the risk that counterparty identity could be disclosed to the public.” 623
As noted in Section IX, supra, the Commission is adopting amendments to Rules 901(a)
and 908 substantially as proposed to cover additional types of cross-border transactions, and
Compliance Dates 1, 2, and 3 will apply equally to all counterparties that fall within Rule 908(b)
and all security-based swaps that fall within Rule 908(a). Thus, because Regulation SBSR’s
compliance dates for U.S.-to-U.S. transactions are the same as for U.S.-to-non-U.S. transactions,
there is no incentive for U.S. counterparties to trade only with non-U.S. persons to avoid any
Regulation SBSR requirements. 624
G.

Exemptions Related to the Compliance Schedule

In June 2011, the Commission exercised its authority under Section 36 of the Exchange
Act 625 to exempt any person from having to report any pre-enactment security-based swaps, as

621

624

The Commission believes that this result is generally consistent with the commenter’s
statement that “SBS data will be more comprehensive and useful if upon the first day that
reporting is required under SBSR, broadly all participants that will be a reporting side
will have those obligations and such obligation is evident to all other participants in
covered SBS.” Id. at 6.

243

required by Section 3C(e)(1) of the Exchange Act, 626 until six months after an SDR that is
capable of receiving security-based swaps in that asset class is registered by the Commission.627
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed to extend the
exemption from the requirement to report pre-enactment security-based swaps to ensure
consistency between the proposed compliance schedule and the exemption. 628 Because
Compliance Date 1, as proposed in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, would
have required the reporting of pre-enactment security-based swaps within six months after the
commencement of operations of the first registered SDR in that asset class rather than six months
after the date of the registration of the first SDR, the Commission also proposed to extend the
exemption from Section 3C(e)(1) exemption to synchronize it with proposed Compliance Date 1.
The Commission received one comment on this aspect of its proposed exemption. The
commenter agreed that the exemption for the reporting of pre-enactment security-based swaps
should be extended to and terminate on Compliance Date 1. 629
As discussed above, the Commission is adopting new Compliance Date 3 relating to the
reporting of historical security-based swaps, which includes pre-enactment security-based swaps.
To harmonize the existing exemption with the compliance date for reporting of pre-enactment
security-based swaps, the Commission is exercising its authority under Section 36 of the
Exchange Act to exempt any person from having to report any pre-enactment security-based
swaps, as required by Section 3C(e)(1) of the Exchange Act, in a particular asset class until
Compliance Date 3. The Commission finds that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in
626

15 U.S.C. 78c-3(e)(1).

244

the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors, because such action
prevents the existing exemption from expiring before persons with a duty to report preenactment security-based swaps are able and are required to report them to a registered SDR.
In conjunction with the proposed extension of the Section 3C(e)(1) exemption included in
the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission also proposed that, with
respect to security-based swaps in a particular asset class, the exemption from Section 29(b) of
the Exchange Act, 630 in connection with Section 3C(e)(1), would terminate on proposed
Compliance Date 1. One commenter agreed with this proposed extension of the Section 29(b)
exemption in connection with Section 3C(e)(1). 631 In addition, one commenter asked that the
Commission clarify how Section 3C(e)(1) of the Exchange Act relates to the Section 29(b)
exemption.632 The commenter noted that the Commission’s Section 29(b) exemption applies to
630

15 U.S.C. 78cc(b). In the Effective Date Release, the Commission exercised its authority
under Section 36 of the Exchange Act to temporarily exempt any security-based swap
contract entered into on or after July 16, 2011, from being void or considered voidable by
reason of Section 29(b) of the Exchange Act, because any person that is a party to the
security-based swap contract violated a provision of the Exchange Act that was amended
or added by Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd Frank Act and for which the Commission
has taken the view that compliance will be triggered by registration of a person or by
adoption of final rules by the Commission, or for which the Commission has provided an
exception or exemptive relief, until such date as the Commission specifies. See Effective
Date Release, 76 FR at 36305. Section 29(b) of the Exchange Act provides, in relevant
part: “Every contract made in violation of any provision of this title or of any rule or
regulation thereunder, and every contract . . . heretofore or hereafter made, the
performance of which involves the violation of, or the continuance of any relationship or
practice in violation of, any provision of this title or any rule or regulation thereunder,
shall be void (1) as regards the rights of any person who, in violation of any such
provision, rule, or regulation, shall have made or engaged in the performance of any such
contract, and (2) as regards the rights of any person who, not being a party to such
contract, shall have acquired any right thereunder with actual knowledge of the facts by
reason of much the making or performance of such contract was in violation of any such
provision rule or regulation . . .”

security-based swap entered into on or after July 16, 2011, and that Section 3C(e)(1) applies only
to pre-enactment security-based swaps, i.e., those entered into before July 21, 2010. 633
The Commission confirms that the existing exemption from Section 29(b) set forth in the
Effective Date Release applies only to security-based swaps entered into on or after July 16,
2011. 634 Section 3C(e)(1) applies only to pre-enactment security-based swaps. 635 As a result, an
extension of the Section 29(b) exemption in connection with Section 3C(e)(1) would have had no
effect. Therefore, there is no need for the Commission to revise or extend the exemption from
Section 29(b) in connection with Section 3C(e)(1). 636
H.

Substituted Compliance Requests

Rule 908(c) permits a person that potentially would become subject to Regulation SBSR
or a foreign financial regulatory authority to submit a substituted compliance request with
respect to the rules of a foreign jurisdiction pertaining to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swap transactions. The submission of a substituted compliance
request is elective; therefore, the Commission is not establishing a “compliance date” for Rule
908(c). Nevertheless, such persons may begin submitting substituted compliance requests
pursuant to the requirements of Rule 908(c) upon the effective date of this release.

The same commenter also asked for confirmation that the Commission provided the
Section 29(b) exemption solely to promote legal certainty and to avoid doubt as to the
applicability of Section 29(b) to other Exchange Act provisions and that the Commission
has “not taken any view as to whether, when, or under what circumstances Section 29(b)
might apply to any provision of Title VII of Dodd-Frank or rule or regulation thereunder,
including SBSR.” ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 18. Because the Commission is not today
providing any relief related to the Section 29(b) exemption, the Commission is not
modifying the view set forth in the Effective Date Release. See Effective Date Release,
76 FR at 36305-306.

Paperwork Reduction Act
Certain amendments to Regulation SBSR that the Commission is adopting today contain

“collection of information requirements” within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1995 (“PRA”). 637 The Commission published notices requesting comment on the collection of
information requirements relating to Regulation SBSR in the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release 638 and the U.S. Activity Proposal 639 and submitted relevant information to
the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with the PRA. 640 In
addition, the Commission adopted portions of Regulation SBSR that contain collections of
information requirements in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. 641 The titles of the
collections for Regulation SBSR are: (1) Rule 901—Reporting Obligations—For Reporting
Sides; (2) Rule 901—Reporting Obligations—For Registered SDRs; (3) Rule 901—Reporting
Obligations—For Platforms; (4) Rule 901—Reporting Obligations—For Registered Clearing
Agencies; (5) Rule 901—Reporting Obligations—For New Broker-Dealer Respondents; (6) Rule
902—Public Dissemination of Transaction Reports; (7) Rule 903—Coded Information; (8) Rule
904—Operating Hours of Registered Security-Based Swap Data Repositories; (9) Rule 905—
Correction of Errors in Security-Based Swap Information—For Reporting Sides; (10) Rule
905—Correction of Errors in Security-Based Swap Information—For Non-Reporting Sides;

requirements is mandatory. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required
to respond to, a collection of information unless the agency displays a currently valid control
number.
The Commission is adopting the amendments to Regulation SBSR largely as proposed,
with certain revisions. These amendments impact Rules 900, 901, 902, 905, 906, 907, and 908
of Regulation SBSR.
The hours and costs associated with complying with Regulation SBSR constitute
reporting and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information. Certain estimates (e.g.,
the number of reporting sides, the number of non-reporting sides, the number of participants, and
the number of reportable events 642 pertaining to security-based swap transactions) contained in

642

Reportable events include initial security-based swap transactions, life cycle events, and
corrections of errors in previously reported information.

248

the Commission’s earlier PRA assessments have been revised to reflect the amendments to
Regulation SBSR being adopted today, as well as additional information and data now available
to the Commission. The revised paperwork burdens estimated by the Commission herein are
consistent with those made in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release and the U.S.
Activity Proposal. However, as described in more detail below, certain estimates have been
modified, as necessary, to reflect the most recent data available to the Commission.
The Commission requested comment on the collection of information requirements
associated with the amendments to Regulation SBSR proposed in the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release and the U.S. Activity Proposal. As noted above, the Commission received
25 comment letters on the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release and the U.S.
Activity Proposal that specifically address Regulation SBSR. Any comments related to the
collection of information burdens potentially arising from the proposed amendments are
addressed below.
A.

Definitions—Rule 900

Rule 900 sets forth definitions of various terms used in Regulation SBSR. In this release,
the Commission is adopting certain amendments to Rule 900, including amendments to the
definition of “participant” in existing Rule 900(u) 643 and a new defined term “widely accessible”
in Rule 900(tt). 644 These changes, in themselves, will not result in any new “collection of

643

Rule 900(u) has been amended such that the definition of “participant” now includes
platforms, registered clearing agencies that are required to report alpha dispositions
pursuant to new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), and registered broker-dealers that incur the duty to
report security-based swap transactions to a registered SDR pursuant to new Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). See supra Section V(A).

644

The adopted definition of “widely accessible” has the effect of prohibiting a registered
SDR from charging fees for or imposing usage restrictions on the security-based swap
249

information” requirements within the meaning of the PRA. Changes in definitions that might
impact a collection of information requirement are considered with the respective rule that
imposes the requirement. 645
B.

Reporting Obligations—Rule 901
1.

Existing Rule 901

Existing Rule 901 specifies, with respect to initial security-based swap transactions and
life cycle events (and adjustments due to life cycle events), who is required to report, what data
must be reported, when it must be reported, where it must be reported, and how it must be
reported. Existing Rule 901(a) sets forth a “reporting hierarchy” that specifies the side that has
the duty to report a security-based swap. Existing Rule 901(b) states that if there is no registered
SDR that will accept the report required by Rule 901(a), the person required to make the report
must report the transaction to the Commission. Existing Rule 901(c) sets forth the primary trade
information and Rule 901(d) sets forth the secondary trade information that must be reported.
Existing Rule 901(e) requires the reporting of life cycle events and adjustments due to life cycle
events. Existing Rule 901(f) requires a registered SDR to timestamp, to the second, any
information submitted to it pursuant to Rule 901, and existing Rule 901(g) requires a registered
SDR to assign a transaction ID to each security-based swap, or establish or endorse a
methodology for transaction IDs to be assigned by third parties. Existing Rule 901(h) requires
transaction data that it is required to publicly disseminate under Regulation SBSR. See
supra Section VIII(A).
645

For example, as a result of the expanded definition of “participant,” additional entities
now are subject to the requirement in Rule 906(c) to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with
any obligations to report information to a registered SDR in a manner consistent with
Regulation SBSR. See infra Section XI(D)(2)(c). The new defined term “widely
accessible,” however, will not create a new collection of information requirement or
affect an existing collection of information requirement.

250

reporting sides to electronically transmit the information required by Rule 901 in a format
required by the registered SDR. Existing Rule 901(i) requires reporting of pre-enactment
security-based swaps and transitional security-based swaps to the extent that information about
such transactions is available. Existing Rule 901(j) generally provides the person with the duty
to report 24 hours from the time of execution to report the required information.
For Reporting Sides. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission
estimated that existing Rule 901 will impose an estimated total first-year burden of
approximately 1,394 hours 646 per reporting side for a total first-year burden of 418,200 hours for
all reporting sides. 647 The Commission further estimated that existing Rule 901 will impose
ongoing annualized aggregate burdens of approximately 687 hours 648 per reporting side for a
total aggregate annualized cost of 206,100 hours for all reporting sides. 649 The Commission
further estimated that existing Rule 901 will impose initial and ongoing annualized dollar cost

646

See 80 FR at 14676. The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (355
hours (one-time hourly burden for establishing an OMS) + 172 hours (one-time hourly
burden for establishing security-based swap reporting mechanisms) + 180 hours (onetime hourly burden for compliance and ongoing support) = 707 hours (one-time total
hourly burden). See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14676, n. 1074 (436
hours (annual-ongoing hourly burden for internal order management) + 33.3 hours
(revised annual-ongoing hourly burden for security-based swap reporting mechanisms) +
218 hours (annual-ongoing hourly burden for compliance and ongoing support) = 687.3
hours (one-time total hourly burden). See id. (707 one-time hourly burden + 687 revised
annual ongoing hourly burden = 1,394 total first-year hourly burden).

647

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14676. The Commission derived its
estimate from the following: (1,394 hours per reporting side x 300 reporting sides) =
418,200 hours.

648

See id.

649

See id. The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (687 hours per
reporting side x 300 reporting sides) = 206,100 hours.

251

burdens of $201,000 per reporting side, for total aggregate initial and ongoing annualized dollar
cost burdens of $60,300,000. 650
For Registered SDRs. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission
estimated that the first-year aggregate annualized burden on registered SDRs associated with
existing Rules 901(f) and 901(g) will be 2,720 burden hours, which corresponds to 272 burden
hours per registered SDR. 651 The Commission also estimated that the ongoing aggregate
annualized burden associated with existing Rules 901(f) and 901(g) will be 1,520 burden hours,
which corresponds to 152 burden hours per registered SDR. 652
2.

Rule 901—Amendments

The amendments to Rule 901, as adopted herein, establish certain additional requirements
relating to the reporting of security-based swap transactions. These amendments contain
additional “collection of information requirements” within the meaning of the PRA. The
amendments to Rule 901 are contained in three collections: (a) “Rule 901—Reporting
Obligations—For New Broker-Dealer Respondents”; (b) “Rule 901—Reporting Obligations—
For Platforms”; and (c) “Rule 901—Reporting Obligations—For Registered Clearing Agencies.”
The following discussion sets forth the additional burdens resulting from the amendments to
Rule 901 adopted in this release.

650

See id. The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($201,000 per
reporting side x 300 reporting sides) = $60,300,000. See Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR at 31113-15.

651

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14676. See Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75250. This figure is based on the following: [(1,200) +
(1,520)] = 2,720 burden hours, which corresponds to 272 burden hours per registered
SDR.

Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)
i.

Summary of Collection of Information

In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission proposed certain amendments to Rule 901
to assign the duty to report security-based swaps in certain cross-border situations. In this
release, the Commission is adopting those amendments as proposed. Under new Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2), in a transaction between an unregistered U.S. person and an unregistered
non-U.S. person who is engaging in ANE activity, the sides are required to select the reporting
side. In addition, if both sides are unregistered non-U.S. persons and both are engaging in ANE
activity, the sides are required to select the reporting side. New Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3)
addresses the scenario where one side is subject to Rule 908(b) and the other side is not—i.e.,
one side includes only unregistered non-U.S. persons and that side does not engage in any ANE
activity, and the other side includes an unregistered U.S. person or an unregistered non-U.S.
person that is engaging in ANE activity. Under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3), the side with the
unregistered U.S. person or the unregistered non-U.S. person engaging in ANE activity is the
reporting side. New Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) addresses the scenario where neither side includes a
counterparty that falls within Rule 908(b)—i.e., neither side includes a registered person, a U.S.
person, or a non-U.S. person engaging in ANE activity—but the transaction is effected by or
through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF). Under Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), the registered broker-dealer is required to report the transaction. 653

653

In this release, the Commission also is adopting an amendment to Rule 901(d)(9) that
requires a registered broker-dealer, if it is required to report a security-based swap under
Rule 902(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), to include in the transaction report its broker ID. As discussed
in Section XII(A)(6), infra, the requirement to identify itself in such a transaction report
is considered part of the overall burden of establishing and operating the broker-dealer’s
253

ii.

Respondents

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission estimated that
there will be 300 reporting side respondents and that, among the 300 reporting sides,
approximately 50 will likely have to register with the Commission as security-based swap
dealers and approximately five will likely have to register as major security-based swap
participants, restating an estimate contained in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. 654 The
Commission noted that these 55 reporting sides likely will account for the vast majority of
security-based swap transactions and transaction reports, and that only a limited number of
security-based swap transactions would not include at least one of these larger counterparties on
either side. 655
One commenter to the U.S. Activity Proposal recommended that the Commission collect
a more complete set of data to more precisely estimate the number of non-U.S. persons that
would be affected by the proposed rules. 656 In the U.S. Activity Adopting Release, the
Commission stated that, in the absence of comprehensive reporting requirements for securitybased swap transactions, and the fact that the location of personnel that arrange, negotiate, or
execute a security-based swap transaction is not currently recorded by participants, a more
precise estimate of the number of non-U.S. persons affected by the rule is not currently feasible.

reporting infrastructure. As a result, the burdens associated with identifying itself in the
transaction report are included in the burdens discussed below. See infra notes 916-917
and accompanying discussion.

656

See ISDA I at 7. See also id. at 3 (arguing that “the SEC currently lacks the data
necessary to precisely estimate . . . the number of registered broker-dealers that
intermediate SBS transactions; and the number of additional non-U.S. persons that might
incur reporting obligations under the Proposal”).

254

However, because the Commission assumes that all transactions by foreign dealing entities with
other non-U.S. persons on U.S. reference entities are arranged, negotiated, or executed by
personnel located in the United States, the analysis contained in the U.S. Activity Adopting
Release results in an estimate of the upper bound of the number of firms that would likely assess
the location of their dealing activity. The results of such an assessment, already accounted for in
the U.S. Activity Adopting Release, determines the number of new respondents impacted by the
amendments to Rule 901.
The Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E), as adopted
herein, will result in an additional 20 respondents that will be required to report transactions
under the amendments to Regulation SBSR. 657 The Commission estimates that these 20 new
respondents will consist solely of registered broker-dealers that are required to report one or
more security-based swaps by new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). The Commission acknowledges
that amendments to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E) adopted in this release place reporting obligations, in
certain circumstances, on unregistered foreign dealing entities, as explained in Section IX(G),
supra, which may suggest that a larger number of additional respondents is appropriate.
However, the Commission notes that, based on observed transaction data in TIW that provided
the basis for its estimate of the number of respondents used in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release and Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, unregistered foreign dealing entities were

657

The Commission is unable to determine, at this time, how many of the non-U.S. persons
performing the assessments discussed in the U.S. Activity Adopting Release will result in
those entities being required to report transactions under Regulation SBSR. The
Commission is therefore basing these burdens on the assumption that all entities
performing the assessment will be required to report under Regulation SBSR. Further,
the 20 respondents here reflect the 30 registered-broker dealers discussed in the U.S.
Activity Proposal, reduced by ten to account for registered broker-dealers that are likely
also to register as SB SEFs.

255

already included in the subset of 245 unregistered person respondents that will not be registered
security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants. 658
iii.

Total Initial and Annual Reporting Burdens

Pursuant to Rule 901, all security-based swap transactions must be reported to a
registered SDR or to the Commission. Together, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), and (j) of
Rule 901 set forth the parameters that govern how covered transactions are reported. These
reporting requirements impose initial and ongoing burdens on respondents. The Commission
believes that these burdens will be a function of, among other things, the number of reportable
events and the data elements required to be reported for each such event.
Respondents that fall under the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) incur certain
burdens as a result thereof with respect to their reporting of covered transactions. As stated
above, the Commission believes that an estimate of 20 additional respondents will incur the duty
to report under Regulation SBSR. This estimate includes all persons that will incur a reporting
duty under the amendments to Regulation SBSR that are not already subject to burdens under
existing Rule 901, as adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that there will
likely be approximately 3 million reportable events per year under Rule 901. 659 The
Commission further estimated that approximately 2 million of these reportable events will
consist of uncleared transactions. The Commission estimated that 2 million of the 3 million total
reportable events will consist of the initial reporting of security-based swaps as well as the

658

The 245 respondents that are unregistered persons are calculated as follows: (300
reporting sides – 50 registered security-based swap dealers – 5 registered major securitybased swap participants) = 245 unregistered persons that are reporting sides.

659

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14675.

256

reporting of any life cycle events. The Commission also estimated that of the 2 million
reportable events, approximately 900,000 will involve the reporting of new security-based swap
transactions, and approximately 1,100,000 will involve the reporting of life cycle events under
Rule 901(e). 660
Based on the Commission’s assessment of the effect of the amendments to Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E) adopted herein, the Commission believes that there will be approximately 2,700
additional reportable events per year under Rule 901. 661 Using a similar approach to the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 662 while also accounting for security-based swaps that will
be reported by a registered broker-dealer, the Commission estimates that, of the 2,700 new
reportable events, 1,512 will involve the reporting of new security-based swap transactions, and
approximately 1,188 will involve the reporting of life cycle events under Rule 901(e). 663

660

The Commission notes that it is adopting an amendment to Rule 901(e)(2). Existing Rule
901(e)(2) states in relevant part that a life cycle event must be reported “to the entity to
which the original security-based swap transaction was reported” (emphasis added). As
amended, Rule 901(e)(2) now states that a life cycle event would have to be reported “to
the entity to which the original security-based swap transaction will be reported or has
been reported” (emphasis added). This amendment accounts for the possibility that
persons with a duty to report a transaction generally may do so up to 24 hours after the
time of execution, a registered clearing agency might submit a report of a termination of
an alpha to the alpha SDR before the alpha SDR has received the transaction report of the
alpha transaction itself. See supra Section III(I). The Commission does not believe that
this amendment to Rule 901(e)(2) gives rise to any PRA burdens not already accounted
for in its analysis of burdens under Rule 901. See infra Section XI(B)(2)(b).

661

See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27504.

662

See 80 FR at 14676. The Commission notes that, while the approach for determining the
burdens is similar to that used in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the aggregate
burden hours for all aspects of Rule 901differ slightly as a result of these new
respondents having to report a different number of reportable events.

663

See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27504. The Commission expects 540 reportable
events (2,700 x 0.2) to be new security-based swap transactions reported by registered
broker-dealers, and 972 reportable events to be other new security-based swap
transactions that would be required to be reported under the rule ((2,700 – 540) x 0.45),
257

Based on these estimates, the Commission believes that Rule 901(a) will result in the
additional new respondents resulting from amendments to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E), having a total
burden of 7.6 hours attributable to the initial reporting of security-based swaps by respondents to
registered SDRs under Rules 901(c) and 901(d) over the course of a year. 664 The Commission
further estimates that these respondents will have a total burden of 5.9 hours attributable to the
reporting of life cycle events under Rule 901(e) over the course of a year. 665 Therefore, the
Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E), as adopted herein, will result
in a total reporting burden for respondents under Rules 901(c) and (d) along with the reporting of
life cycle events under Rule 901(e) of 14 burden hours per year. The Commission believes that
many reportable events will be reported through electronic means and that the ratio of electronic
reporting to manual reporting is likely to increase over time. The Commission believes that the
bulk of the burden hours will be attributable to manually reported transactions. 666 Thus,

for a total of 1,512 reportable events that are new security-based swap transactions. The
remaining 1,188 reportable events ((2,700 – 540) x 0.55) are estimated to be life cycle
events reportable under Rule 901(e).
664

The Commission calculated the following: ((1,512 x 0.005) / (20 respondents)) = 0.38
burden hours per respondent or 7.6 total burden hours attributable to the initial reporting
of security-based swaps. See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27505 (adjusted to reflect
revised number of respondents). In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the
Commission estimated that it would take approximately 0.005 hours for each securitybased swap transaction to be reported. See 80 FR at 14676, n. 1073. See also Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75249, n. 195.

665

The Commission calculated the following: ((1,188 x 0.005) / (20 respondents)) = 0.30
burden hours per reporting side or 5.9 total burden hours attributable to the reporting of
life cycle events under Rule 901(e). See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27505
(adjusted to reflect revised number of respondents). In the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, the Commission estimated that it would take approximately 0.005 hours for each
security-based swap transaction to be reported. See 80 FR 14676, n. 1073. See also
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75249, n. 195.

258

respondents that capture and report transactions electronically will likely incur fewer burden
hours than those respondents that capture and report transactions manually.
Based on the foregoing and applying the same calculation methods used in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 901
proposed in the U.S. Activity Proposal and adopted herein will impose an estimated total firstyear burden of approximately 1,362 hours per respondent 667 for a total first-year burden of
27,240 hours for all additional respondents that will incur the duty to report under the adopted
amendments to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(1)-(4). 668 The Commission estimates that the amendments
to Rule 901 will impose ongoing annualized aggregate burdens of approximately 655 hours 669
per respondent for a total aggregate annualized burden of 13,100 hours for those respondents. 670
The Commission further estimates that the amendments to Rule 901 will impose initial and

667

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (355 hours (one-time hourly
burden for establishing an OMS) + 172 hours (one-time hourly burden for establishing
security-based swap reporting mechanisms) + 180 hours (one-time hourly burden for
compliance and ongoing support) = 707 hours (one-time total hourly burden). See U.S.
Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27505, n. 454 (436 hours (annual ongoing hourly burden for
internal order management) + 0.68 hours (revised annual ongoing hourly burden for
security-based swap reporting mechanisms as a result of reduced estimate of number of
respondents) + 218 hours (annual-ongoing hourly burden for compliance and ongoing
support) = 654.7 hours (one-time total hourly burden). See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR
at 27505, n. 454 (revised to take into account reduced estimate of number of respondents)
(707 one-time hourly burden + 654.7 revised annual-ongoing hourly burden = 1,362 total
first-year hourly burden).

668

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (1,362 hours per respondent x
20 respondents) = 27,240 hours.

Rule 901—Reporting Obligations for Platforms and Clearing
Agencies Resulting from Amendments to Rules 901(a)(1) and (2)
and Platforms and Reporting Sides Resulting from Amendments to
Rule 901(a)(3)
i.

Summary of Collection of Information

In addition to amendments to Rule 901 to assign the duty to report security-based swaps
in certain cross-border situations proposed in the U.S. Activity Proposal, in this release the
Commission also is assigning the duty to report security-based swaps that are clearing
transactions or are executed on a platform and will be submitted to clearing. To facilitate such
reporting, the Commission is adopting amendments to Rules 901(a)(1), 901(a)(2)(i), and
901(a)(3). Specifically, under new Rule 901(a)(1), if a security-based swap is executed on a
platform and will be submitted to clearing, the platform on which the transaction was executed
shall have the duty to report the transaction to a registered SDR. New Rule 901(a)(2)(i) assigns
the reporting duty for a clearing transaction to the registered clearing agency that is a
counterparty to the security-based swap. New Rule 901(a)(3) requires any person that has a duty
to report a security-based swap that is submitted to clearing—which would be a platform or a
reporting side—to provide the registered clearing agency with the transaction ID of the alpha and
the identity of the registered SDR to which the alpha will be reported or has been reported.

671

Respondents

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($201,000 per respondent x 20
respondents) = $4,020,000. See U.S. Activity Release, 80 FR at 27505 (providing
preliminary estimates based on a higher number of respondents). See also Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14676, nn. 1066 and 1078.

260

The amendments to Rules 901(a)(1) and 901(a)(2)(i) adopted herein assign reporting
duties for security-based swap transactions, in certain enumerated cases set forth in these rules,
to platforms and registered clearing agencies, respectively. The Commission estimates that these
amendments to Rule 901(a) will result in 14 additional respondents incurring the duty to report
under Regulation SBSR: ten platforms and four registered clearing agencies. 672 Amended Rule
901(a)(3) will require a person—either the platform upon which the security-based swap was
executed or the reporting side for those security-based swaps other than clearing transactions—to
report, for those security-bases swaps submitted to a registered clearing agency, the transaction
ID of the submitted security-based swap and the identity of the registered SDR to which the
transaction will be or has been reported. The Commission believes that new Rule 901(a)(3), as
amended, will place reporting obligations on 300 reporting sides 673 and ten platforms. 674

Platforms and Registered Clearing Agencies

672

The Commission made the same preliminary estimate of the number of respondents
resulting from these proposed amendments in the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release. See 80 FR at 14788.

673

As stated above, the Commission has estimated that there would be 300 reporting sides
plus the 20 new broker-dealer respondents discussed in Section XI(B)(2)(a), supra. See
also supra note 657.

674

Although new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) requires a registered broker-dealer to report
security-based swaps in some circumstances, the Commission believes that registered
broker-dealers will not incur duties under Rule 901(a)(3). A registered broker-dealer
would incur the reporting duty only if it effects a transaction for unregistered non-U.S.
counterparties, neither of which is engaging in ANE activity. If the unregistered nonU.S. direct counterparties have guarantors that would clear the transaction on their behalf,
it is likely that one or both of these guarantors would occupy a higher rung on the
reporting hierarchy such that the duty would not fall to the registered broker-dealer under
Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). Therefore, it is unlikely that a broker-dealer that effects such a
transaction would incur the duty under Rule 901(a)(3) to provide the transaction ID and
the identity of the alpha SDR to the registered clearing agency.

261

Pursuant to Rule 901, all security-based swap transactions must be reported to a
registered SDR or to the Commission. Together, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), and (j) of
Rule 901 set forth the parameters that reporting entities must follow to report security-based
swap transactions. Because platforms and registered clearing agencies now have the duty to
report, initial and ongoing burdens will be placed on these entities. The Commission continues
to believe that these burdens will be a function of, among other things, the number of reportable
events and the data elements required to be reported for each such event.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that respondents
will face three categories of burdens to comply with Rule 901. 675 The Commission believes that
platforms and registered clearing agencies will face the same categories of burdens as those
identified in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release for other types of respondents. First, each
platform and registered clearing agency will likely have to develop the ability to capture the
relevant transaction information. 676 Second, each platform and registered clearing agency will
have to implement a reporting mechanism. Third, each platform and registered clearing agency
will have to establish an appropriate compliance program and support for the operation of any
system related to the capture and reporting of transaction information. The Commission
continues to believe that platforms and registered clearing agencies will need to develop
675

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14675-77.

676

In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission discussed the development,
by reporting sides, of an internal order and trade management system. See 80 FR at
14675-76. The Commission continues to believe that the costs of developing a
transaction processing system are comparable to the costs discussed therein. Although
the actual reporting infrastructure needed by platforms and registered clearing agencies
could have some attributes that differ from the attributes of an internal order and trade
management system, the Commission nonetheless believes that the cost of implementing
a transaction processing system, and establishing an appropriate compliance program and
support for the operation of the system, will be similar to the costs for reporting sides
discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release.

262

capabilities similar to those highlighted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release in order to be
able to capture and report security-based swap transactions. The Commission also continues to
believe that, once a platform or registered clearing agency’s reporting infrastructure and
compliance systems are in place, the burden of reporting each individual reportable event will be
small when compared to the burdens of establishing the reporting infrastructure and compliance
systems. 677 The Commission continues to believe that all of the reportable events, for which
platforms and registered clearing agencies will be responsible for reporting, will be reported
through electronic means. 678
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that the total
burden placed upon reporting sides as a result of existing Rule 901 will be approximately 1,361
hours 679 per reporting side during the first year, 680 before taking into account the reporting of

677

In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission reiterated its belief that
reporting specific security-based swap transactions to a registered SDR—separate from
the establishing of infrastructure and compliance systems that support reporting—will
impose an annual aggregate cost of approximately $5,400,000. See 80 FR at 14675-77.

678

As a result of the amendment to Rule 901(h) adopted herein, which replaces “reporting
side” with “person having the duty to report,” all persons who have a duty to report under
Regulation SBSR must electronically transmit the information required by Rule 901 in a
format required by the registered SDR. The Commission believes that the infrastructure
build described above will necessarily include the ability to electronically transmit to a
registered SDR the information required by Rule 901, such that any burdens resulting
from the amendment to Rule 901(h) are included within the Rule 901 burdens for persons
with the duty to report that are not reporting sides.

679

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (355 hours (one-time hourly
burden for establishing an OMS) + 172 hours (one-time hourly burden for establishing
security-based swap reporting mechanisms) + 180 hours (one-time hourly burden for
compliance and ongoing support) = 707 hours (one-time total hourly burden). See
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14789, n. 298 (436 hours
(annual ongoing hourly burden for internal order management) + 218 hours (annualongoing hourly burden for compliance and ongoing support) = 654 hours (one-time total
hourly burden. See id. (707 one-time hourly burden + 654 revised annual-ongoing
hourly burden = 1,361 total first-year hourly burden).

263

individual reportable events. The Commission believes that the per-entity cost will be
comparable for platforms and registered clearing agencies, resulting in a total first-year burden of
1,361 hours and an annual burden of 654 hours for each platform and registered clearing agency,
before taking into account the reporting of individual reportable events, under new Rules
901(a)(1) and 901(a)(2)(i), as adopted herein.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that there will be
approximately 3 million reportable events per year under Rule 901, of which approximately 2
million will consist of uncleared transactions (i.e., those transactions that will be reported by a
reporting side). 681 In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission did not assign
reporting duties for the remaining 1 million annual reportable events, which consist of platformexecuted alphas, clearing transactions, and any life cycle events pertaining to these two types of
transactions.
In this release, the Commission is adopting amendments to Rule 901 that assign the
reporting duty for these 1 million reportable events to platforms and registered clearing agencies.
The Commission estimates that, of the 1 million reportable events, approximately 370,000 will
be new security-based swap transactions. 682 Of these 370,000 new transactions, the Commission
estimates that platforms will be responsible for reporting approximately one-third, or 120,000, of
them. 683 The Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 901(a) will result in platforms

Since only platform-executed security-based swaps that will be submitted to a registered
clearing agency for clearing are subject to this release, platforms are not responsible for
any life cycle event reporting under Rule 901(e). See Regulation SBSR Amendments
Proposing Release, 80 FR at 14777.

264

having a total burden of 600 hours attributable to the reporting of security-based swaps under
Rule 901 over the course of a year, or 60 hours per platform. 684
The Commission estimates that registered clearing agencies will be responsible for
reporting 880,000 reportable events. 685 These reportable events consist of 250,000 initial
security-based swaps along with 630,000 life cycle events. The Commission estimates that the
amendments to Rule 901(a) will result in registered clearing agencies having a total burden of
1,250 hours attributable to the reporting of new security-based swaps to registered SDRs over the
course of a year, or 312.5 hours per registered clearing agency. 686 The Commission estimates
that the amendments to Rule 901(a) will result in registered clearing agencies having a total
burden of 3,150 hours attributable to the reporting of life cycle events to registered SDRs under
Rule 901(e) over the course of a year, or 787.5 hours per registered clearing agency. 687 The

684

The Commission calculates the following: ((120,000 x 0.005) / (10 platforms)) = 60
burden hours per platform or 600 total burden hours attributable to the reporting of
security-based swaps. See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at
14789-90. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that it
would take approximately 0.005 hours for each security-based swap transaction to be
reported. See 75 FR at 75249, n. 195.

685

As is discussed above, the Commission estimates that platforms will be responsible for
reporting only approximately 120,000 of the 1 million new reportable events and
registered clearing agencies will be responsible for reporting the remainder.

686

The Commission calculates the following: ((250,000 security-based swaps x 0.005 hours
per security-based swap) / (4 registered clearing agencies)) = 312.5 burden hours per
registered clearing agency or 1,250 total burden hours attributable to the reporting of such
security-based swaps. See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at
14789-90. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that it
would take approximately 0.005 hours for each security-based swap to be reported. See
75 FR at 75249, n. 195.

687

The Commission calculates the following: ((630,000 security-based swaps x 0.005 hours
per security-based swap) / (4 registered clearing agencies)) = 787.5 burden hours per
registered clearing agency or 3,150 total burden hours attributable to the reporting of life
cycle events under Rule 901(e). See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release,
80 FR at 14789-90. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission
265

Commission continues to believe that the amendments will result in a total reporting burden for
registered clearing agencies under Rules 901(c) and 901(d) along with the reporting of life cycle
events under Rule 901(e) of 4,400 burden hours, or 1,100 hours per registered clearing
agency. 688 The Commission believes that all reportable events that will be reported by platforms
and registered clearing agencies pursuant to these amendments will be reported through
electronic means.
The Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 901 will impose ongoing
annualized aggregate burdens of approximately 714 hours per platform 689 for a total aggregate
annualized burden of 7,140 hours for all platforms. 690 The Commission further believes that the
first year burden on platforms will be 1,421 burden hours per platform 691 for a total first year
burden of 14,210 burden hours for all platforms. 692 The Commission further estimates that the
amendments to Rule 901 will impose initial and ongoing annualized dollar cost burdens of

estimated that it would take approximately 0.005 hours for each security-based swap to
be reported. See 75 FR at 75249, n. 195.
688

As is discussed immediately above, the Commission believes that registered clearing
agencies would incur a burden of 1,250 hours attributable to the reporting of securitybased swaps pursuant to Rule 901(a)(2)(i) along with a burden of 3,150 hours attributable
to the reporting of life cycle events under Rule 901(e). As discussed in note 683, supra, a
platform is not responsible for the reporting of any life cycle events of any platformexecuted security-based swap that will be submitted to clearing.

689

As discussed above, the Commission believes that platforms will incur a burden of 654
hours per year (before taking into account individual transaction reporting) plus a
transaction reporting burden of 60 hours per year resulting in a total annual burden per
platform of 714 burden hours.

690

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (714 hours per platform x 10
platforms) = 7,140 hours.

691

As discussed above, the Commission believes that platforms will incur an initial burden
of 707 hours plus an annual burden of 714 hours for a total burden of 1,421 per platform.

692

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (1,421 hours per platform x 10
platforms) = 14,210 hours.

266

$201,000 per platform, 693 for total aggregate initial and ongoing annualized dollar cost burden of
$2,010,000. 694
The Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 901 will impose ongoing
annualized aggregate burdens of approximately 1,754 hours per registered clearing agency 695 for
a total aggregate annualized burden of 7,016 hours for all registered clearing agencies. 696 The
Commission further believes that the first year burden on registered clearing agencies will be
2,461 burden hours per registered clearing agency697 for a total first year burden of 9,844 burden
hours for all registered clearing agencies. 698 The Commission further estimates that the
amendments to Rule 901 will impose initial and ongoing annualized dollar cost burdens of
$401,000 per registered clearing agency, 699 for total aggregate initial and ongoing annualized
dollar cost burden of $1,604,000. 700

693

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14789, n. 303 (these
burdens reflect the dollar costs of hardware and software related expenses, including
necessary back-up and redundancy, per SDR connection, for two SDR connections, along
with cost of storage capacity, reduced to account only for platforms).

694

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($201,000 per reporting person
x 10 platforms) = $2,010,000.

695

As discussed above, the Commission believes that registered clearing agencies will incur
a burden of 654 hours per year (before taking into account individual transaction
reporting) plus a transaction reporting burden of 1,100 hours per year resulting in a total
annual burden of 1,754 burden hours.

696

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (1,754 hours per registered
clearing agency x 4 registered clearing agencies) = 7,016 hours.

697

As discussed above, the Commission believes that platforms will incur an initial burden
of 707 hours plus an annual burden of 1,754 hours for a total burden of 2,461 per
registered clearing agency.

698

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (2,461 hours per registered
clearing agency x 4 registered clearing agencies) = 9,844 hours.

699

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14789, n. 303 (reduced
to account only for registered clearing agencies). The Commission estimates that a
registered clearing agency, as a result of newly adopted Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), might have to
267

The Commission recognizes that some entities that will qualify as platforms or registered
clearing agencies may have already spent time and resources building the infrastructure that will
support their eventual reporting of security-based swaps. The Commission notes that, as a result,
the burdens and costs estimated herein could be greater than those actually incurred by affected
parties as a result of compliance with the amendments to Rule 901(a). Nonetheless, the
Commission believes that its estimates represent a reasonable approach to estimating the
paperwork burdens associated with the amendments to Rule 901(a).
b)

Rule 901(a)(3) Burdens

Rule 901(a)(3), as adopted herein, requires a person who has the duty to report an alpha
security-based swap to promptly provide the registered clearing agency to which the alpha has
been submitted the transaction ID of the submitted security-based swap and the identity of the
registered SDR to which the transaction will be or has been reported. Entities that report alphas
to registered SDRs also will already have established the infrastructure needed to submit
security-based swaps to a registered clearing agency that acts as a central counterparty; this

establish connectivity to an alpha SDR, to which it might not otherwise establish
connectivity. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that each registered clearing
agency will connect to four registered SDRs. The Commission derived the total
estimated expense for registered clearing agencies as (($100,000 hardware- and softwarerelated expenses, including necessary backup and redundancy, per SDR connection) x (4
SDR connections per registered clearing agency)) + ($1,000 cost of storage capacity) =
$401,000 per registered clearing agency. See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments
Release, 80 FR at 14776 (estimating the hardware- and software-related expenses per
SDR connection at $100,000). This estimate assumes that the systems required to
establish connectivity to a registered SDR to meet requirements under Rule 901(e)(1)(ii)
are similar to those required by reporting sides to meet regulatory reporting requirements.
To the extent that a registered clearing agency is able to utilize a limited purpose
connection to report only the information required by Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), the cost of
establishing such a connection could be less.
700

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($401,000 per registered
clearing agency x 4 registered clearing agencies) = $1,604,000.

268

connectivity to a registered clearing agency is not required by Regulation SBSR. Rule 901(a)(3)
will require the person who reports the alpha to a registered SDR to provide the registered
clearing agency two additional data elements—the transaction ID of the alpha and the identity of
the alpha SDR—along with all of the other transaction information that must be submitted to
clear the transaction. The Commission estimates that the additional one-time burden related to
the development of the ability to capture and submit these two additional data elements will be
10 burden hours per respondent and the additional one-time burden related to the implementation
of a reporting mechanism will be 6 burden hours per respondent. 701 The Commission estimates
that the additional ongoing burden related to the ability to capture the additional specific data
elements required by amended Rule 901(a)(3) will be 10 burden hours and the additional
ongoing burden related to the maintenance of the reporting mechanism will be 2 burden hours,
per platform and reporting side. 702
c)

Bunched Order Executions and Allocations

701

The Commission estimates that the additional burdens related to programming systems to
allow for the reporting of the additional data fields will be: [(Sr. Programmer (5 hours) +
Sr. Systems Analyst (5 hours)) = 10 burden hours (development of the ability to capture
transaction information); (Sr. Programmer (3 hours) + Sr. Systems Analyst (3 hours)) = 6
burden hours (implementation of reporting mechanism)]. The total one-time burden
associated with Rule 901(a)(3) will be 16 burden hours per respondent for a total onetime burden of 4,960 hours (16 x 310 (i.e., 300 reporting sides + 10 platforms)). See
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14790, n. 315.

702

The Commission estimates that the additional burdens related to the reporting of these
additional data fields will be: [(Sr. Programmer (5 hours) + Sr. Systems Analyst (5
hours)) = 10 burden hours (maintenance of transaction capture system); (Sr. Programmer
(1 hour) + Sr. Systems Analyst (1 hour)) = 2 burden hours (maintenance of reporting
mechanism)]. The total ongoing burden associated with amended Rule 901(a) will be 12
burden hours per platform and reporting side for a total ongoing burden of 3,720 hours
(12 x 310 (i.e., 300 reporting sides + 10 platforms)). For the Commission’s preliminary
estimate of the burdens associated with Rule 901(a)(3), see Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14790, n. 316.

269

Bunched order executions and the security-based swaps that result from their allocation
are types of security-based swaps that must be reported pursuant to Rule 901(a). In the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission provided guidance regarding how
Regulation SBSR applies to uncleared bunched order executions and the security-based swaps
that result from their allocation. 703 In Section VI, supra, the Commission provides guidance
regarding how Regulation SBSR applies to bunched order executions that will be submitted to
clearing and the security-based swaps that result from the allocation of any bunched order
execution, if the resulting security-based swaps are cleared.
This guidance does not increase the number of respondents under Regulation SBSR or
increase the burdens for any respondent. 704 The estimates of the number of reportable events
provided by the Commission in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release included bunched order
executions and the security-based swaps that result from their allocation. Thus, there are no
burdens associated with this guidance that the Commission has not already taken into account.
d)

Prime Brokerage Transactions

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission set forth the
application of Regulation SBSR to a prime brokerage transaction involving three security-based
swap legs. In Section VII(B)(2), supra, the Commission supplements its views to account for
cases where the documentation among the relevant market participants provides for a two-legged
structure rather than a three-legged structure. Since the Commission’s initial estimates of the
number of reportable events provided for the reporting of all legs of a prime brokerage

270

transaction, 705 those estimates assumed that prime brokerage transactions involved a threelegged structure. In light of the possibility that some prime brokerage transactions may involve
only two legs, the Commission may have overestimated the total number of reportable events
arising from prime brokerage transactions. However, because prime brokerage transactions are
unlikely to represent a significant percentage of reportable events, the Commission continues to
believe that its previous estimate of reportable events is reasonable. 706
3.

Rule 901—Aggregate Total PRA Burdens and Costs

Based on the foregoing, the Commission estimates the following aggregate total PRA
burdens and costs, by category of entity, resulting from Rule 901, as contained in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release and as amended in this release.
a.

For Platforms

As discussed in Section XI(B)(2)(b)(iii)(a), supra, the Commission estimates that the
hourly burden resulting from the amendments to Rule 901(a)(1) on platforms would be 1,421
hours in the first year and 714 hours annually thereafter, per platform. The Commission further
estimates that the annual dollar cost of the amendments will be $201,000. The Commission also
estimates that the hourly burden resulting from the amendments to Rule 901(a)(3) on platforms
will be 28 hours in the first year and 12 hours annually thereafter, per platform. In aggregate, the
Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 901 will result in a first year burden 1,449
hours per platform for a total first year hourly burden of 14,490 hours. The Commission further
705

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14785, n. 276.

706

Combining the Commission’s estimates in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release and
this release, the Commission believes that there will be approximately 3 million
reportable events per year under Rules 901 and 905. Two million of those reportable
events were required to be reported pursuant to provisions adopted in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release, and 1 million are required to be reported by amendments
adopted herein. See supra Section XI(B)(2)(a)(iv).

271

estimates that the annual aggregate burden resulting from the amendments to Rule 901 will be
726 hours per platform, for a total annual hourly burden of 7,260 hours. Finally, the
Commission estimates that the annual dollar cost of the amendments will be $201,000 per
platform, for a total annual dollar cost of $2,010,000.
b.

For Registered Clearing Agencies

As discussed in Section XI(B)(2)(b)(iii)(a), supra, the Commission estimates that the
hourly burden resulting from the amendments to Rule 901(a)(2) on registered clearing agencies
will be 2,461 hours in the first year and 1,754 hours annually thereafter, per registered clearing
agency. The Commission estimates that the total hourly burden on all registered clearing
agencies will be 9,844 in the first year and 7,016 annually thereafter. The Commission further
estimates that the annual dollar cost of the amendments will be $401,000 per registered clearing
agency, or $1,604,000 for all registered clearing agencies.
c.

For New Broker-Dealer Respondents

The Commission believes that, as a result of amendments to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)
adopted herein, there will be 20 new broker-dealer respondents who will incur reporting
responsibilities, and that they will incur first-year burdens of 1,362 hours. The Commission
further believes that these new respondents will incur annual burdens of 655 hours each year
thereafter. In addition, the Commission believes that these new respondents will incur annual
costs of $201,000.
d.

For Reporting Sides

In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that reporting
sides will incur a first-year burden of 1,394 hours per reporting side and an hourly burden of 687

272

hours annually thereafter. 707 As a result of the amendments to Rule 901(a)(3) adopted herein,
the Commission believes that these burdens will increase. The Commission believes that
reporting sides will have a new first-year burden of 1,422 hours per reporting side, 708 or 426,600
hours for all reporting sides. 709 The Commission further estimates that reporting sides will have
a new annual burden after the first year of 699 hours per reporting side, 710 or 209,700 hours for
all reporting sides. 711 The Commission also believes that the annual dollar cost of Rule 901 to
reporting sides will remain unchanged at $201,000 per reporting side, or $60,300,000 for all
reporting sides.
C.

Correction of Errors in Security-Based Swap Information—Rule 905
1.

Existing Rule 905

Existing Rule 905 sets out a process for correcting errors in reported and disseminated
security-based swap information. Under Rule 905(a)(1), where a counterparty that was not on
the reporting side for a security-based swap transaction discovers an error in the information
reported with respect to such security-based swap, that counterparty must promptly notify the
reporting side of the error. Under existing Rule 905(a)(2), where a reporting side for a securitybased swap transaction discovers an error in the information reported with respect to a security707

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14676.

708

The Commission estimates the new first year burden as follows: (1,394 hours (original
burden resulting from previously adopted rules) + 28 hours (burden resulting from
amendments to Rule 901(a)(3))) = 1,422 hours.

709

The Commission estimates the new aggregate burden as follows: (1,422 hours x 300
reporting sides) = 426,600 hours.

710

The Commission estimates the new annual burden as follows: (687 hours (original
burden resulting from previously adopted rules) + 12 hours (burden resulting from
amendments to Rule 901(a)(3))) = 699 hours.

711

The Commission estimates the new aggregate burden as follows: (699 hours x 300
reporting sides) = 209,700 hours.

273

based swap, or receives notification from its counterparty of an error, the reporting side must
promptly submit to the entity to which the security-based swap was originally reported an
amended report pertaining to the original transaction. An amended report must be submitted to a
registered SDR in a manner consistent with the policies and procedures of the registered SDR
required pursuant to Rule 907(a)(3).
Existing Rule 905(b) sets forth the duties of a registered SDR relating to corrections. If
the registered SDR either discovers an error in a transaction on its system or receives notice of an
error from a reporting side, the registered SDR must verify the accuracy of the terms of the
security-based swap and, following such verification, promptly correct the erroneous information
contained in its system. Rule 905(b)(2) further requires that, if such erroneous information
relates to a security-based swap that the registered SDR previously disseminated and falls into
any of the categories of information enumerated in Rule 901(c), the registered SDR must
publicly disseminate a corrected transaction report of the security-based swap promptly
following verification of the trade by the counterparties, with an indication that the report relates
to a previously disseminated transaction.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that Rule 905(a)
will impose an initial, one-time burden associated with designing and building a reporting side’s
reporting system to be capable of submitting amended security-based swap transactions to a
registered SDR. The Commission further estimated that Rule 905(a) will impose on all reporting
sides an initial (first-year) aggregate burden of 15,015 hours, which is 50.0 burden hours per

274

reporting side, 712 and an ongoing aggregate annualized burden of 7,035 hours, which is 23.5
burden hours per reporting side. 713
With regard to non-reporting-side participants, the Commission estimated in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release that Rule 905(a) will impose an initial and ongoing burden
associated with promptly notifying the reporting side after discovery of an error as required
under Rule 905(a)(1). 714 The Commission estimated that the annual burden will be 998,640
hours, which corresponds to 208.05 burden hours per non-reporting-side participant. 715
Existing Rule 905(b) requires a registered SDR to develop protocols regarding the
reporting and correction of erroneous information. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release,
the Commission noted that the rules adopted in the SDR Adopting Release generally require a
registered SDR to have the ability to collect and maintain security-based swap transaction reports
and update relevant records and, in light of these broader duties, that the burdens imposed by
Rule 905(b) on a registered SDR will represent only a minor extension of these main duties. 716
The Commission also stated that a registered SDR must have the capacity to disseminate
additional, corrected security-based swap transaction reports pursuant to Rule 902. The
Commission concluded that the burdens on registered SDRs associated with Rule 905—
including systems development, support, and maintenance—are addressed in the Commission’s
712

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14681-83.

See id.

715

This figure was based on the Commission’s estimate of (1) 4,800 non-reporting-side
participants; and (2) one transaction per day per non-reporting-side participant. The
Commission noted that the burdens of Rule 905 on reporting sides and non-reporting-side
participants will be reduced to the extent that complete and accurate information is
reported to registered SDRs in the first instance pursuant to Rule 901. See id.

275

analysis of those other rules and, thus, that Rule 905(b) imposes only an incremental additional
burden on registered SDRs. 717
The Commission estimated in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release that the initial
(first-year) aggregate annualized burden on registered SDRs under Rule 905 will be 21,900
burden hours, which corresponds to 2,190 burden hours for each registered SDR. 718 The
Commission further estimated that the ongoing aggregate annualized burden on registered SDRs
under Rule 905 will be 14,600 burden hours, which corresponds to 1,460 burden hours for each
registered SDR. 719
2.

Amendments to Rule 905

In this release, the Commission is adopting amendments to Rule 905 that broaden the
scope and increase the number of respondents that will incur duties under the rule. These
amendments will not increase the number of registered SDRs that are respondents to the rule or
increase the burdens on SDRs.
Certain provisions of Rule 905 of Regulation SBSR contain “collection of information
requirements” within the meaning of the PRA. The title of these collections are: (a) “Rule
905—Correction of Errors in Security-Based Swap Information —For New Broker-Dealer
Respondents”; (b) “Rule 901— Correction of Errors in Security-Based Swap Information—For

The Commission estimated that developing and publicly providing the necessary
procedures will impose on each registered SDR an initial one-time burden of

a.

Summary of Collection of Information

Rule 905, as adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, imposes duties on:
(1) non-reporting sides, to inform the reporting side if the non-reporting side discovers an error;
(2) reporting sides, to correct the original transaction report if the reporting side discovers an
error or is notified of an error by the non-reporting side; and (3) registered SDRs, upon discovery
of an error or receipt of a notice of an error, to verify the accuracy of the terms of the securitybased swap and, following such verification, correcting the record and, if necessary, publicly
disseminating a corrected transaction report. The amendments to Rule 905, as adopted herein,
do not alter the basic duties under Rule 905 but instead are designed to account for the fact that a
person other than a side might, under other amendments adopted herein, have the duty to report
the initial transaction. Thus, Rule 905, as amended herein, requires non-reporting sides to notify
“the person having the duty to report the security-based swap” of the error (not “the reporting
side”), and “the person having the duty to report the security-based swap” (not “the reporting
side”) must correct the original transaction report if such person discovers an error or is notified
of an error by a non-reporting side.
The amendments to Rule 905 adopted herein do not alter the nature of the duties incurred
by registered SDRs. However, amendments to other parts of Regulation SBSR adopted herein
will increase the number of security-based swap transactions that must be reported to a registered
SDR. Because the Commission assumes that some number of those transactions will be reported
with errors and will have to be corrected pursuant to Rule 905, these other amendments will
indirectly increase the burdens imposed on registered SDRs by Rule 905(b), because registered

277

SDRs will have to correct the records for more transactions (and, in appropriate cases,
disseminate more corrected transaction reports). These amendments also will increase the
number of non-reporting sides and “persons having the duty to report the security-based swap”
who will incur duties under Rule 905(a).
b.

Respondents

The Commission previously estimated that Rule 905, as adopted in the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, will have the following respondents: 300 reporting sides that incur the duty to
report security-based swap transactions pursuant to existing Rule 901 and thus might incur duties
to submit error corrections to registered SDRs under Rule 905(a)(2); up to 4,800 participants of
one or more SDRs (or non-reporting sides) that might incur duties under Rule 905(a)(1); and ten
registered SDRs that might incur duties under Rule 905(b). 720
As a result of various amendments being adopted today, the Commission estimates that
ten platforms, four registered clearing agencies, and 20 new broker-dealers respondents
(exclusive of SB SEFs) also will incur duties under Rule 905(a)(2), because these entities will
incur the duty to report initial transactions and thus will likely have to report some error
corrections. The Commission’s estimates of the number of reporting sides (300), non-reporting
sides (4,800), and registered SDRs (10) that will be respondents of Rule 905 remain unchanged.
However, the Commission now believes that four registered clearing agencies, ten platforms, and
20 new broker-dealer respondents will also like have to report some error corrections.
c.

Total Initial and Annual Reporting Burdens
i.

720

New Broker-Dealer Respondents

See 80 FR at 14681.

278

In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission preliminarily estimated that the
incremental burden imposed on registered broker-dealers to comply with the error reporting
requirements of Rule 905 would be equal to 5% of the one-time and annual burdens associated
with designing and building the reporting infrastructure necessary for reporting transactions
under Rule 901, plus 10% of the corresponding one-time and annual burdens associated with
developing the reporting side’s overall compliance program required under Rule 901. 721 The
Commission preliminarily estimated that the new broker-dealer respondents would incur, as a
result of Rule 905(a), an initial (first-year) burden of 48.4 burden hours per respondent, and an
ongoing annual burden of 21.8 burden hours. Based on additional information available to the
Commission, the Commission now estimates that, as a result of amendments to Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E), there will be only 20 new broker-dealer respondents who will be required to
report transactions and other reportable events. These new broker-dealer respondents will have
error correction duties similar to reporting sides; the Commission believes, therefore, that
respondent broker-dealers will incur burdens similar to reporting sides under Rule 905(a). The
Commission estimates that these 20 new broker-dealer respondents will each incur an initial
(first-year) 48.4 burden hours per respondent, 722 and an annualized burden of 21.8 burden hours

721

See 80 FR at 27506.

722

This figure is calculated as follows: [(((172 burden hours for one-time development of
reporting system) x (0.05)) + ((0.68 burden hours annual maintenance of reporting
system) x (0.05)) + ((180 burden hours one-time compliance program development) x
(0.1)) + ((218 burden hours annual support of compliance program) x (0.1))) x (20
respondents)] = 48.4 burden hours per new broker-dealer respondent. See supra nn. 667
and 668 for the discussion of estimates of the burden hours for annual maintenance of the
reporting system for these new broker-dealer respondents.

279

per respondent, 723 which remain unchanged from the Commission’s preliminary estimates in the
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release.
ii.

For Platforms and Registered Clearing Agencies

The Commission is applying the same methodology for calculating the burdens of error
reporting by reporting sides to calculating the burdens of error reporting by platforms, under the
amendments to Rule 905(a). However, the Commission believes that, on average, a platform
will be reporting a greater number of reportable events than, on average, a reporting side. As a
result, the Commission believes that a platform will likely be required to report more error
corrections than an average reporting side, so the burdens imposed by Rule 905(a) on a platform
will likely be greater than the average burden imposed by Rule 905(a) on a reporting side. Thus,
for platforms, the Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 905(a) will impose an
initial (first-year) burden of 51.4 hours per platform, 724 and an ongoing annualized burden of
24.8 hours per platform. 725

723

This figure is calculated as follows: [((0.68 burden hours annual maintenance of
reporting system) x (0.05)) + ((218 burden hours annual support of compliance program)
x (0.1))] = 21.8 burden hours per new broker-dealer respondent. See supra nn. 667 and
668 for the discussion of estimates of the burden hours for annual maintenance of the
reporting system for these new broker-dealer respondents.

724

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14794. This figure is
calculated as follows: [((172 burden hours for one-time development of reporting
system) x (0.05)) + ((60 burden hours annual maintenance of reporting system) x (0.05))
+ ((180 burden hours one-time compliance program development) x (0.1)) + ((218
burden hours annual support of compliance program) x (0.1))] = 51.4 burden hours per
platform. See supra note 679 for the discussion of estimates of the burden hours for
annual maintenance of the reporting system for platforms. The Commission notes that
the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release inadvertently used 33 burden hours
to represent annual maintenance of the reporting system. The correct figure should have
been 60 burden hours for the annual maintenance of the reporting system. As a result, the
Commission preliminarily estimated a first-year burden, as a result of proposed
amendments to Rule 905(a), of 50 hours instead of the correct first-year burden of 51.4
280

The Commission also believes that this methodology is applicable to the error reporting
that will be done by registered clearing agencies as a result of the amendments to Rule 905(a). 726
However, because registered clearing agencies will be responsible for a large number of
reportable events, they will likely be required to report more error corrections. As a result, the
burdens imposed by Rule 905(a) on registered clearing agencies will be greater. Thus, for
registered clearing agencies, the Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 905(a) will

hours. See supra note 684 (calculating the annual reporting burden used to determine the
annual maintenance burden of the reporting system).
725

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14794. This figure is
calculated as follows: [((60 burden hours annual maintenance of reporting system) x
(0.05)) + ((218 burden hours annual support of compliance program) x (0.1))] = 24.8
hours per platform. See supra note 679 for the discussion of estimates of the burden
hours for annual maintenance of the reporting system for platforms. The Commission
notes that the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release inadvertently used 33
burden hours to represent annual maintenance of the reporting system. The correct figure
should have been 60 burden hours for the annual maintenance of the reporting system.
As a result, the Commission originally estimated an annual ongoing burden, as a result of
amendments to Rule 905(a), of 23.5 hours instead of the correct first-year burden of 24.8
hours.

726

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission did not include
estimates for the burdens that would be imposed on registered clearing agencies for the
reporting of errors under Rule 905(a). Upon further review, the Commission recognizes
that registered clearing agencies will be required to report error corrections under Rule
905(a). As a result, the Commission has provided estimates of such burdens herein.

281

impose an initial (first-year) burden of 153.4 hours per registered clearing agency, 727 and an
ongoing annualized burden of 76.8 hours per registered clearing agency. 728
iii.

For Non-Reporting Sides

For non-reporting sides, the Commission estimated in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release that the annual burden (first-year and each subsequent year) will be 998,640 hours,
which corresponds to 208.05 burden hours per non-reporting-side participant. 729 As a result of
the amendments adopted herein, there will be more transactions reported to registered SDRs (i.e.,
clearing transactions and platform-executed transactions that will be submitted to clearing) and
thus more transactions that in theory could have errors. If a non-reporting side were to discover
any such error, it would incur an obligation under Rule 905(a)(1) to notify the person with the
initial duty to report (i.e., the platform or registered clearing agency, as applicable) of the error.
The Commission believes, however, that the expansion of Regulation SBSR to include clearing

727

This figure is calculated as follows: [((172 burden hours for one-time development of
reporting system) x (0.05)) + ((1100 burden hours annual maintenance of reporting
system) x (0.05)) + ((180 burden hours one-time compliance program development) x
(0.1)) + ((218 burden hours annual support of compliance program) x (0.1))] = 153.4
burden hours per registered clearing agency. See also Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, 80 FR at 14681-83 (describing the manner in which similar burdens were
calculated for reporting sides). See supra note 679 (discussing estimates of the burden
hours for annual maintenance of the reporting system for registered clearing agencies).

728

This figure is calculated as follows: [((1100 burden hours annual maintenance of
reporting system) x (0.05)) + ((218 burden hours annual support of compliance program)
x (0.1))] = 76.8 hours per registered clearing agency. See also Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14681-83 (describing the manner in which similar burdens
were calculated for reporting sides). See supra note 679 for the discussion of estimates of
the burden hours for annual maintenance of the reporting system for platforms.

729

This figure is based on the following: [(1 error notifications per non-reporting-side
participant per day) x (365 days/year) x (Compliance Clerk at 0.5 hours/report) x (4,800
non-reporting-side participants)] = 998,640 burden hours, which corresponds to 208.05
burden hours per non-reporting-side participant. See Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, 80 FR at 14681-83.

282

transactions and platform-executed transactions that will be submitted to clearing will not impact
non-reporting sides under Rule 905(a)(1). Such transactions will likely be in standardized
security-based swap products that occur electronically pursuant to the rules of such entities.
Errors, when they occur, will mostly likely be observed and corrected by the platforms or
registered clearing agencies themselves. Therefore, the Commission believes that the
amendments adopted herein will not increase the burdens per non-reporting side or change the
number of non-reporting sides that are required to comply with Rule 905(a)(1). Consequently,
the Commission continues to estimate that the annual burden on non-reporting sides pursuant to
Rule 905(a)(1) will be 998,640 hours, which corresponds to 208.05 burden hours per nonreporting-side participant. 730
iv.

For Registered SDRs

Rule 905(b) requires a registered SDR to undertake certain actions if it discovers or
receives notice of an error in a transaction report. The Commission stated in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release that it believes that this duty will represent only a minor extension of
other duties of registered SDRs for which the Commission is estimating burdens. 731 A registered
SDR is required to have the ability to collect and maintain security-based swap transaction
reports and update relevant records under the rules adopted in the SDR Adopting Release. 732
Likewise, a registered SDR must have the capacity to disseminate additional, corrected security730

This figure is based on the following: [(1 error notifications per non-reporting-side
participant per day) x (365 days/year) x (Compliance Clerk at 0.5 hours/report) x (4,800
non-reporting-side participants)] = 998,640 burden hours, which corresponds to 208.05
burden hours per non-reporting-side participant. See Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, 80 FR at 14681-83.

based swap transaction reports under Rule 902, the burdens for which were calculated in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. 733 Thus, the burdens associated with Rule 905—including
systems development, support, and maintenance—are addressed in the Commission’s analysis of
those other rules.
As discussed above, the Commission estimated in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release that the initial (first-year) aggregate annualized burden on registered SDRs under Rule
905 will be 21,900 burden hours, which corresponds to 2,190 burden hours for each registered
SDR. 734 The Commission further estimated that the ongoing aggregate annualized burden on
registered SDRs under Rule 905 will be 14,600 burden hours, which corresponds to 1,460
burden hours for each registered SDR. 735 With respect to Rule 905(a)(2), the Commission stated
that the submission of amended transaction reports required under Rule 905(a)(2) likely will not
result in a material burden because this will be done electronically though the reporting system
that the reporting side must develop and maintain to comply with Rule 901. The overall burdens
associated with such a reporting system were addressed in the Commission’s analysis of Rule
901. 736
The amendments adopted herein do not increase the number of registered SDRs that are
respondents to Rule 905(b), but they do increase the number of error reports that will have to be
processed by each registered SDR. The Commission notes, however, consistent with its analysis
in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, that any burdens associated with Rule 905 for
registered SDRs are a result of systems development, support, and maintenance and are not

dependent on the number of error reports received or processed. Consequently, for registered
SDRs, the Commission estimates that the initial (first-year) aggregate annualized burden on
registered SDRs under Rule 905, as previously adopted and as amended herein, will be 21,900
burden hours, which corresponds to 2,190 burden hours for each registered SDR. 737 The
Commission further estimates that the ongoing aggregate annualized burden on registered SDRs
under Rule 905, as previously adopted and as amended herein, will be 14,600 burden hours,
which corresponds to 1,460 burden hours for each registered SDR. 738
v.

Aggregate Reporting Burdens Under Rule 905

As discussed above, the Commission estimates that Rule 905(a) will impose an initial
(first-year) burden on each reporting side of 50 hours for a total aggregate first-year burden on all
reporting sides of 15,000 hours 739 and an ongoing annualized burden on each reporting side of
23.5 hours, for a total aggregate annual burden on all reporting sides of 7,050 hours 740 The
Commission estimates that the 20 new broker-dealer respondents will each incur an initial (firstyear) 48.4 burden hours per respondent, for a total aggregate first-year burden on all new brokerdealer respondents of 968 hours, 741 and an ongoing annualized burden of 21.8 burden hours per

737

This figure is based on the following: [(730 burden hours to develop protocols) + (1,460
burden hours annual support)) x (10 registered SDRs)] = 21,900 burden hours, which
corresponds to 2,190 burden hours per registered SDR. See id. at 14681-83.

738

This figure is based on the following: [(1,460 burden hours annual support) x (10
registered SDRs)] = 14,600 burden hours, which corresponds to 1,460 burden hours per
registered SDR. See SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14681-83.

739

This figure is calculated as follows: (50.0 burden hours per reporting side x 300
reporting sides) = 15,000 burden hours.

740

This figure is calculated as follows: (23.5 burden hours per reporting side x 300
reporting sides) = 7,050 burden hours.

This figure is calculated as follows: (48.4 burden hours per new broker-dealer
respondent x 20 new respondents) = 968 burden hours.

285

respondent, for a total aggregate annual burden on all new broker-dealer respondents of 436
hours. 742
Furthermore, for platforms, the Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule
905(a) will impose an initial (first-year) burden of 51.4 hours per platform for a total aggregate
first-year burden on all platforms of 514 hours, 743 and an ongoing annualized burden of 22.1
hours per platform for a total aggregate annual burden on all platforms of 221 hours. 744 The
Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 905(a) will impose an initial (first-year)
burden of 153.4 hours per registered clearing agency for a total aggregate first-year burden of
612.6 hours, 745 and an ongoing annualized burden of 76.8 hours per registered clearing agency
for a total aggregate annual burden of 307.2 hours. 746
The Commission estimates that the annual burden on non-reporting sides will remain
unchanged at 208.1 burden hours per non-reporting-side participant, for a total aggregate annual
burden (first-year and each subsequent year) of 998,640 hours for all non-reporting-side
participants. 747

742

This figure is calculated as follows: (21.8 burden hours per new broker-dealer
respondent x 20 new respondents) = 436 burden hours.

743

This figure is calculated as follows: (51.4 burden hours per platform x 10 platforms) =
514 burden hours.

744

This figure is calculated as follows: (22.1 burden hours per platform x 10 platforms) =
221 burden hours.

745

This figure is calculated as follows: (153.4 burden hours per registered clearing agency x
4 registered clearing agencies) = 612.6 burden hours.

746

This figure is calculated as follows: (76.8 burden hours per registered clearing agency x
4 registered clearing agencies) = 307.2 burden hours.

747

This figure is calculated as follows: (208.05 burden hours per non-reporting-side
participant x 4,800 non-reporting-side participants) = 998,640 burden hours.

286

The Commission estimates that the initial (first-year) aggregate annualized burden on
registered SDRs will be 2,190 burden hours for each registered SDR, for a total aggregate firstyear burden of 21,900 hours on all registered SDRs. 748 The Commission estimates that the
ongoing aggregate annualized burden on registered SDRs will be 1,460 burden hours for each
registered SDR, which equals a total aggregate annual burden of 14,600 burden hours for all
registered SDRs. 749
In summary, the Commission estimates that the aggregate first-year burden of Rule 905
for all entities will be 1,037,635 hours. 750 The Commission estimates that the annual burden
(after the first year) of Rule 905 for all entities will be 1,021,254 hours. 751
D.

Other Duties of Participants—Rule 906
1.

Existing Rule 906

Existing Rule 906(a) sets forth a procedure designed to ensure that a registered SDR
obtains relevant UICs for both sides of a security-based swap, not just of the reporting side. Rule
906(a) requires a registered SDR to identify any security-based swap reported to it for which the
registered SDR does not have a counterparty ID and (if applicable) broker ID, trading desk ID,
748

This figure is calculated as follows: (2,190 burden hours per registered SDR x 10
registered SDRs) = 21,900 burden hours.

749

This figure is calculated as follows: (2,190 burden hours per registered SDR x 10
registered SDRs) = 21,900 burden hours.

750

This figure is calculated as follows: (15,000 burden hours for reporting sides) + (968
burden hours for new broker-dealer respondents) + (514 burden hours for platforms) +
(612.6 burden hours for registered clearing agencies) + (998,640 burden hours for nonreporting-side participants) + (21,900 burden hours for registered SDRs) = 1,037,634.6
burden hours during the first year.

751

This figure is calculated as follows: (7,050 burden hours for reporting sides) + (436
burden hours for new broker-dealer respondents) + (221 burden hours for platforms) +
(307.2 burden hours for registered clearing agencies) + (998,640 burden hours for nonreporting-side participants) + (14,600 burden hours for registered SDRs) = 1,021,254.2
burden hours during each year following the first year.

287

and trader ID of each direct counterparty. Rule 906(a) further requires the registered SDR, once
a day, to send a report to each participant identifying, for each security-based swap to which that
participant is a counterparty, the security-based swap(s) for which the registered SDR lacks
counterparty ID and (if applicable) broker ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID. Finally, Rule
906(a) requires a participant that receives such a report to provide the missing ID information to
the registered SDR within 24 hours.
Existing Rule 906(b) requires each participant of a registered SDR to provide the
registered SDR with information sufficient to identify the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any
affiliate(s) of the participant that also are participants of the registered SDR.
Existing Rule 906(c) requires each participant that is a registered security-based swap
dealer or registered major security-based swap participant to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with any
security-based swap transaction reporting obligations in a manner consistent with Regulation
SBSR. In addition, Rule 906(c) requires each such participant to review and update its policies
and procedures at least annually.
For Registered SDRs. Rule 906(a) requires a registered SDR, once a day, to send a
report to each of its participants identifying, for each security-based swap to which that
participant is a counterparty, any security-based swap(s) for which the registered SDR lacks
counterparty ID and (if applicable) broker ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID. In the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that there will be a one-time, initial burden
of 112 burden hours for a registered SDR to create a report template and develop the necessary

288

systems and processes to produce a daily report required by Rule 906(a). 752 The Commission
estimated that there will be an ongoing annualized burden of 308 burden hours for a registered
SDR to generate and issue the daily reports, and to enter into its systems the UIC information
supplied by participants in response to the daily reports. 753
Accordingly, in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that
the initial aggregate annualized burden for registered SDRs under Rule 906(a) will be 4,200
burden hours for all SDR respondents, which corresponds to 420 burden hours per registered
SDR. 754 The Commission estimated that the ongoing aggregate annualized burden for registered
SDRs under Rule 906(a) will be 3,080 burden hours, which corresponds to 308 burden hours per
registered SDR. 755
For Participants. Existing Rule 906(a) requires any participant of a registered SDR that
receives a report from that registered SDR to provide the missing UICs to the registered SDR
within 24 hours. All SDR participants will likely be the non-reporting side for at least some
transactions to which they are counterparties; therefore, all participants will be impacted by Rule
906(a). In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that the initial and
ongoing annualized burden under Rule 906(a) for all participants will be 199,728 burden hours,
which corresponds to 41.6 burden hours per participant. 756

This figure is based on the Commission’s estimates of 4,800 participants and
approximately 1.14 transactions per day per participant. See id.

289

Existing Rule 906(b) requires every participant of a registered SDR to provide that SDR
an initial ultimate parent/affiliate report and updates as needed. In the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that there will be 4,800 participants, that each
participant will connect to two registered SDRs on average, and that each participant will submit
two Rule 906(b) reports each year. 757 Accordingly, the Commission estimated that the initial
and ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 906(b) will be 9,600 burden
hours, which corresponds to 2 burden hours per participant. 758
Existing Rule 906(c) requires each participant that is a registered security-based swap
dealer or registered major security-based swap participant to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with
applicable security-based swap reporting obligations, and to review and update such policies and
procedures at least annually. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission
estimated that the one-time, initial burden for each covered participant 759 to create these written
policies and procedures will be approximately 216 burden hours. 760 The Commission also
estimated the burden of maintaining such policies and procedures, including a full review at least

757

See id. The Commission estimated that, during the first year, each participant will submit
an initial report and one update report and, in subsequent years, will submit two update
reports.

758

See id. This estimated aggregate burden represents an upper estimate for all participants;
the actual burden could be reduced to the extent that the registered SDR permits one
member of the group to report the ultimate parent(s) and affiliates on behalf of each
participant member of the group. See supra note 608.

759

Only some participants of registered SDRs are subject to the requirements of Rule 906(c).
As used in this release, any participant that is “covered” by Rule 906(c) is deemed a
“covered participant.”

760

This figure is based on the estimated number of hours to develop a set of written policies
and procedures, program systems, implement internal controls and oversight, train
relevant employees, and perform necessary testing. See 80 FR at 14684.

annually, will be approximately 120 burden hours for each covered participant. 761 Accordingly,
the Commission estimated the initial aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 906(c) to
be 18,480 burden hours, which corresponds to 336 burden hours per covered participant. 762 The
Commission estimated the ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 906(c) to
be 6,600 burden hours, which corresponds to 120 burden hours per covered participant. 763
In sum, the Commission in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release estimated that the
total initial aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 906 will be 230,370 burden hours,
and that the total ongoing aggregate annualized burden will be 217,370 burden hours for all
participants. 764

Amendments to Rule 906
a.

Rule 906(a)

In this release, the Commission is making only a minor amendment to Rule 906(a) 765
which does not affect the estimated number of respondents or the estimated burdens for existing
respondents to the rule.
However, because of the amendments to Rule 901(a) adopted herein, the scope of
transactions covered by Regulation SBSR is increasing. As a result, a registered SDR will have
to review a larger number of transactions to assess whether there is missing UIC information.
The Commission believes that the process whereby a registered SDR reviews transactions and

controls systems, and performing necessary testing. See id.

generates the associated reports will be automated, and that the costs of performing this
automated review will be approximately the same even if the review covers a larger set of
transactions. Furthermore, although Rule 906(a) notices sent by a registered SDR could in some
cases be longer because they cover more transactions, the amendments to Rule 901(a) will not
increase the number of participants (4,800) to which the registered SDR will likely have to send
such notices. Therefore, the Commission does not believe that the larger number of transactions
will result in any burdens on registered SDRs under Rule 906(a) that were not already accounted
for in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. 766 Thus, the Commission believes that its
original burden estimates for registered SDRs to comply with Rule 906(a) remain appropriate.
With respect to the 4,800 participants that will likely be required to provide missing UIC
information to a registered SDR for at least some transactions, the Commission is revising its
original estimate of the burdens imposed by Rule 906(a) because participants will have to
provide missing UIC information for a larger number of transactions. Although a registered
SDR’s process for generating a Rule 906(a) notice is likely to be automated, at least some
participants might rely on manual procedures to reply. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, the Commission estimated that the initial and ongoing annualized burden under Rule

766

The Commission estimated that a registered SDR will incur an initial, one-time burden of
112 hours to create a report template and develop the necessary systems and processes to
produce a daily report required by Rule 906(a). The Commission also estimated that a
registered SDR will incur an ongoing annualized burden of 308 hours to generate and
issue the daily reports, and to enter into its systems the ID information supplied by
participants in response to the daily reports. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80
FR at 14684.

292

906(a) for all participants will be 199,728 burden hours, which corresponds to 41.6 burden hours
per participant. 767
The Commission continues to believe that there will be approximately one million
additional reportable events under Regulation SBSR. 768 Of these one million reportable events,
the Commission estimates that approximately 120,000 platform-executed alphas reflected in
estimates in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release could have missing UIC information. Both
sides of a platform-executed alpha might have to report missing UIC information since neither
side is the reporting side and thus both sides are non-reporting sides. Therefore, the Commission
believes that each participant, on average, will now be required provide missing UIC information
for 1.27 transactions each day. 769 As a result, the Commission believes that the burden placed on
each participant by Rule 906(a) will be 46.4 hours annually, 770 for a total burden of 222,504
hours for all participants.

767

This figure is based on the Commission’s estimates of (1) 4,800 participants; and (2)
approximately 1.14 transactions per day per participant. See id.

768

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14675-76.

769

The Commission originally estimated that participants could have to provide missing
UIC information for up to two million security-based swap transactions annually. This
results in each participant, on average, having to provide missing information for 1.14
transactions each day. As a result, the Commission originally estimated the total burden
to be 199,728 hours, or 41.6 hours annually for each participant. See 80 FR at 14684.
The Commission now believes that these same participants will be responsible for
providing missing UIC information for a greater number of security-based swap
transactions. The Commission estimates: [(((2,000,000 original estimate of annual
security-based swap transactions for which mission UIC information would need to be
provided to the SDR) + ((120,000 additional security-based swap transactions for which
UIC information is required) x (2 since both sides could be required to provide missing
UIC information))) / 4,800 participants) / (365 days/year)] = 1.27 average security-based
swap transactions per day for which each participant will need to provide missing UIC
information.

770

The Commission estimates that the total burden for all participants will be 222,504
calculated as follows: (1.27 missing information reports per day) x (365 days per year) x
293

b.

Rule 906(b)—Amendments

Existing Rule 906(b) requires each participant of a registered SDR to provide the
registered SDR information sufficient to identify its ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s) of the
participant that also are participants of the registered SDR, using ultimate parent IDs and
participant IDs. In this release, the Commission is adopting amendments to Rule 906(b) to
exclude from this reporting requirement participants that are platforms, registered clearing
agencies, externally managed investment vehicles, and registered broker-dealers (including SB
SEFs) that become participants of a registered SDR solely as a result of making a report to
satisfy an obligation under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). Therefore, this amendment does not create
any new respondents that have burdens under the rule or increase burdens for any existing
respondents.
Platforms and registered clearing agencies were not covered respondents to Rule 906(b)
when the Commission estimated the burdens of Rule 906(b), as adopted in the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release. Therefore, the amendment to Rule 906(b) adopted today that specifically
excludes them does not affect the Commission’s estimate in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release of the burdens associated with Rule 906(b).
However, externally managed investment vehicles were considered respondents of Rule
906(b), as adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, and the estimated burdens on all
participant respondents in that adopting release included burdens imposed on externally managed
investment vehicles. 771 Therefore, the amendment to Rule 906(b) adopted herein that excludes
externally managed investment vehicles has the effect of reducing the number of respondents
(Compliance Clerk at 0.1 hours/report) x (4,800 participants) = 222,504 hours/year or
46.4 hours for each participant.
771

See 80 FR at 14684.

294

and the associated burdens of Rule 906(b) that the Commission estimated in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release. Based on an analysis of TIW transaction data, the Commission
believes that, of the 4,800 estimated participants, approximately 1,920 are externally managed
investment vehicles. 772 Therefore, the Commission now estimates that there are only 2,880
participant respondents to Rule 906(b), as amended herein. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, the Commission further estimated that each respondent to Rule 906(b) will submit two
reports per year and that each report will result in one burden hour. 773 The Commission
continues to believe that each respondent will incur two burden hours per year in connection
with Rule 906(b), but is reducing its estimate of total burden hours for all participants from 9,600
(estimated in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release) to 5,760 (2,880 respondents x 2
hours/respondent = 5,760 hours).

registered broker-dealers that will become subject to Rule 906(c).

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping
Burdens

For Registered Clearing Agencies and Platforms. In the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that the one-time, initial burden
for each registered clearing agency or platform to adopt written policies and procedures as
required under the amendment to Rule 906(c) would be similar to the Rule 906(c) burdens for
other covered participants. 774 In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission
estimated that Rule 906(c) will impose a burden of approximately 216 hours on each registered
security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant (together,
“covered participants”). 775 In addition, the Commission estimated that the burden of maintaining
such policies and procedures, including a full review at least annually, will be approximately 120
burden hours for each covered participant. 776 The Commission continues to believe that, by
amending Rule 906(c) to apply the policies and procedures requirement to registered clearing

See id. This figure is based on the following: [(Sr. Programmer at 40 hours) +
(Compliance Manager at 40 hours) + (Compliance Attorney at 40 hours) + (Compliance
Clerk at 40 hours) + (Sr. Systems Analyst at 32 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 24
hours)] = 216 burden hours per registered clearing agency or platform. This figure is
based on the estimated number of hours to develop a set of written policies and
procedures, program systems, implement internal controls and oversight, train relevant
employees, and perform necessary testing.

hours)] = 120 burden hours per registered clearing agency or platform. This figure
includes an estimate of hours related to reviewing existing policies and procedures,
making necessary updates, conducting ongoing training, maintaining internal controls
systems, and performing necessary testing.

agencies and platforms, these entities will face burdens similar to those of the existing covered
participants. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the initial aggregate annualized burden
associated with the amendments to Rule 906(c) will be 4,704 burden hours, which corresponds to
336 burden hours per registered clearing agency or platform. 777 The Commission estimates that
the ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with the amendments to Rule 906(c) will be
1,680 burden hours, which corresponds to 120 burden hours per registered clearing agency or
platform. 778
For Registered Broker-Dealers. The amendments to Rule 906(c) will require each
registered broker-dealer that becomes a participant solely as a result of incurring a reporting duty
under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) (a “respondent broker-dealer”) to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with
applicable security-based swap transaction reporting obligations. The amendments to Rule
906(c) also will require each respondent broker-dealer to review and update such policies and
procedures at least annually.
In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission preliminarily estimated that the one-time,
initial burden for each respondent broker-dealer to adopt written policies and procedures as
required under the amendment to Rule 906(c) would be similar to the Rule 906(c) burdens for
existing covered participants. 779 In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission
estimated that Rule 906(c) will impose a burden of approximately 216 hours on each covered

777

This figure is based on the following: [(216 + 120 burden hours) x (14 registered
clearing agencies and platforms)] = 4,704 burden hours.

778

This figure is based on the following: [(120 burden hours) x (14 registered clearing
agencies and platforms)] = 1,680 burden hours.

participant. 780 In addition, the Commission estimated that the burden of maintaining such
policies and procedures, including a full review at least annually, will be approximately 120
burden hours for each covered participant. 781 The Commission continues to believe that, by
amending Rule 906(c) to impose the policies and procedures requirement on respondent brokerdealers, these entities will face burdens similar to those of other covered participants.
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the initial aggregate annualized burdens on
respondent broker-dealers associated with the amendment to Rule 906(c) will be 6,720 burden
hours, which corresponds to 336 burden hours per respondent broker-dealer. 782 The Commission
estimates that the ongoing aggregate annualized burdens on all respondent broker-dealers
associated with the amendments to Rule 906(c) will be 2,400 burden hours, which corresponds to
120 burden hours per respondent broker-dealer. 783

Rule 906—Aggregate Total PRA Burdens and Costs

Based on the foregoing, the Commission estimates the following aggregate total PRA
burdens and costs, by category of entity, resulting from Rule 906. These figures add the burdens
and costs estimated in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release for the existing covered
participants with the burdens and costs estimated for the additional covered participants resulting
from the amendments to Rule 906(c) adopted herein.

783

This figure is based on the following: (120 burden hours) x (20 respondent brokerdealers) = 2,400 burden hours.

298

The Commission estimates that the one-time, initial burden for each registered clearing
agency or platform to adopt written policies and procedures as required under the amendments to
Rule 906(c) will be similar to the Rule 906(c) burdens discussed in the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release for covered participants, and will be approximately 216 burden hours per
registered clearing agency or platform. 784 This figure is based on the estimated number of hours
to develop a set of written policies and procedures, program systems, implement internal controls
and oversight, train relevant employees, and perform necessary testing. In addition, the
Commission estimates the burden of maintaining such policies and procedures, including a full
review at least annually, as required by Rule 906(c), will be approximately 120 burden hours for
each registered clearing agency or platform. 785 This figure includes an estimate of hours related
to reviewing existing policies and procedures, making necessary updates, conducting ongoing
training, maintaining internal controls systems, and performing necessary testing. Accordingly,
the Commission estimates that the initial, or first year, aggregate annualized burden associated
with the amendments to Rule 906(c) will be 4,704 burden hours, which corresponds to 336
burden hours per registered clearing agency or platform. 786 The Commission estimates that the
ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with the amendments to Rule 906(c) will be
1,680 burden hours, which corresponds to 120 burden hours per registered clearing agency or
platform. 787

For Registered SDRs

299

As a result of changes in other rules, registered SDRs will have to identify missing UIC
information from a larger number of transactions and send more requests to non-reporting sides
seeking such missing UIC information.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that there will be a
one-time, initial burden of 112 burden hours for each registered SDR to create a report template
and develop the necessary systems and processes to produce a daily report required by Rule
906(a), or 1,120 burden hours for all SDRs. 788 The Commission believes that this estimate
continues to be valid, as an SDR’s initial investment in the infrastructure necessary to carry out
its duties under Rule 906(a) should be unaffected by the precise number of transactions covered
by Regulation SBSR.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that there will be
an ongoing annualized burden of 308 burden hours for each registered SDR to generate and issue
the daily reports, and to enter into its systems the UIC information supplied by participants in
response to the daily reports, or 3,308 burden hours for all SDRs. 789 Although the scope of
security-based swap transactions covered by Regulation SBSR has increased, the Commission
continues to believe that there will be an ongoing annualized burden of 308 burden hours for a
registered SDR to generate and issue the daily reports, and to enter into its systems the UIC
information supplied by participants in response to the daily reports.
c.

For Participants

The Commission estimates that, as a result of the amendments adopted herein, the initial
and ongoing annualized burden under Rule 906(a) for all participants will be 222,504 burden
788

See 80 FR at 14683-85.

789

See id.

300

hours, which corresponds to 46.4 burden hours per participant. 790 The Commission notes that
each participant will, on average, have to provide missing UIC information for more securitybased swap transactions than it would have prior to the amendments adopted in this release. The
revised estimates account for these additional transactions.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that the initial and
ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 906(b) will be 9,600 burden hours,
which corresponds to 2 burden hours per participant. 791 The amendment to Rule 906(b) does not
create any new respondents or impose any new burdens on existing respondents, as the
amendment excludes platforms, registered clearing agencies, registered broker-dealers, and
externally managed investment vehicles from having to report ultimate parent and affiliate
information to registered SDRs of which they are participants. Therefore, the Commission’s
estimate of the burdens imposed by Rule 906(b) on individual participants remains unchanged.
However, because of the exclusions discussed above, only 2,880 participants will be subject to
the requirement of Rule 906(b). As a result, the aggregate annualized burden associated with
Rule 906(b) will fall from 9,600 hours (estimated in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release) to
5,760 hours.
d.

For New Broker-Dealer Respondents

In this release, the Commission is adopting an amendment to Rule 906(c) that extends the
requirement to establish policies and procedures for carrying out reporting duties under
Regulation SBSR to platforms, registered clearing agencies, and registered broker-dealers that
790

See supra note 770 and accompanying text.

791

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14683-85. This figure is based on the
following: [(Compliance Clerk at 0.5 hours per report) x (2 reports/year/SDR
connection) x (2 SDR connections/participant) x (4,800 participants)] = 9,600 burden
hours, which corresponds to 2 burden hours per covered participant.

301

incur a duty to report security-based swaps under new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). The
Commission estimates 20 registered broker-dealers will become subject to Rule 906(c). The
Commission discussed the burdens placed upon platforms and registered clearing agencies as a
result of the amendments to Rule 906(c) in Section XI(D)(3)(a), supra. The Commission
believes that the per-respondent costs of establishing and updating the required policies will be
the same for new broker-dealer respondents identified in this release as well as the respondents
identified in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, as discussed in Section XI(D)(1), supra.
Therefore, the Commission estimates that the new broker-dealer respondents will incur a onetime, initial burden of 216 burden hours per new broker-dealer respondent, or 6,480 hours for all
new broker-dealer respondents, and an ongoing annual burden of 120 hours per new brokerdealer respondent, or 2,400 hours for all new broker-dealer respondents.
e.

Aggregate Rule 906 Burdens

In sum, Rule 906(a) will place a total first-year burden on registered SDRs of 1,120
hours. 792 Rule 906(a) will place a total annual burden on registered SDRs and covered
participants of 269,384 hours. 793 Rule 906(b) will place a total annual burden on covered
participants of 5,760 hours. 794 Rule 906(c) will place a total first-year burden on covered

792

The Commission calculated this estimate as follows: (112 hours (first year burden on
SDRs as a result of Rule 906(a)) x 10 SDRs) = 1,120 hours.

793

The Commission calculated this estimate as follows: ((308 hours (annual burden on
SDRs as a result of Rule 906(a)) x 10 SDRs)) + ((55.5 hours (annual burden on
participants as a result of Rule 906(a)) x 4,800 participants) = 269,384 hours.

794

The Commission calculated this estimate as follows: (2 hours (annual burden on
participants as a result of Rule 906(b)) x 2,880 revised number of participants impacted
by Rule 906(b)) = 5,760 hours.

302

participants of 19,224 hours. 795 Rule 906(c) will place a total annual burden on covered
participants of 10,680 hours. 796 These figures combine the burdens associated with Rule 906
estimated in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release with the revisions to these burdens
associated with the amendments to Rule 906 adopted herein.
E.

Policies and Procedures of Registered SDRs—Rule 907
1.

Existing Rule 907

Existing Rule 907(a) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies
and procedures with respect to the receipt, reporting, and public dissemination of security-based
swap transaction information. Existing Rule 907(c) requires a registered SDR to make its
policies and procedures available on its website. Existing Rule 907(d) requires a registered SDR
to review, and update as necessary, the policies and procedures that it is required to have by
Regulation SBSR at least annually. Existing Rule 907(e) requires a registered SDR to provide to
the Commission, upon request, information or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and
completeness of data reported to it pursuant to Regulation SBSR and the registered SDR’s
policies and procedures established thereunder.
2.

Rule 907—Amendments

In this release, the Commission is making only one amendment to Rule 907: The
Commission is revising Rule 907(a)(6) to carve out platforms, registered clearing agencies,
externally managed investment vehicles, and registered broker-dealers (including SB SEFs) that
795

The Commission calculated this estimate as follows: (216 hours (first-year burden on
each respondent) x 89 respondents (i.e., 55 registered security-based swap dealers +
registered major security-based swap participants + 20 new broker-dealer respondents +
14 platforms and registered clearing agencies) = 19,224 hours.

796

The Commission calculated this estimate as follows: (120 hours (annual burden per
covered participants) x 89 covered participants) = 10,680 hours.

303

become a participant of a registered SDR solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an
obligation under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) from the requirement in Rule 907(a)(6) that a registered
SDR have policies and procedures for obtaining ultimate parent and affiliate information from its
participants, as contemplated by an amendment to Rule 906(b) adopted herein. The amendment
to Rule 907(a)(6) has the effect of preventing existing respondent SDRs from incurring
additional burdens because they will not have to obtain ultimate parent and affiliate information
from additional types of participants.
However, amendments to other rules in Regulation SBSR will have the effect of
requiring a registered SDR to expand its policies and procedures to cover additional types of
reporting persons and additional types of reporting scenarios. For example, platforms and
registered broker-dealers may now incur duties to report certain security-based swaps and are
required to become participants of registered SDRs to which they report. In addition, a
registered clearing agency also incurs the duty to report to the alpha SDR whether the clearing
agency has accepted an alpha for clearing. Registered SDRs that record alpha transactions will
have to expand their policies and procedures to be able to link the report of the original alpha
transaction (which would be reported either by a reporting side or, if the alpha was platformexecuted and will be submitted to clearing, by the platform) to the report of the clearing
disposition, which would be submitted by the registered clearing agency.
3.

Rule 907—Aggregate Total PRA Burdens and Costs

In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that the one-time,
initial burden for a registered SDR to adopt written policies and procedures as required under
existing Rule 907 will be approximately 15,000 hours. In addition, the Commission estimated
the annual burden of maintaining such policies and procedures, including a full review at least

304

annually, making available its policies and procedures on the registered SDR’s website, and
information or reports on non-compliance (as required under Rule 907(e)) will be approximately
30,000 hours for each registered SDR. The Commission estimated that the total initial
annualized burden associated with Rule 907 will be approximately 45,000 hours per registered
SDR, which corresponds to an initial annualized aggregate burden of approximately 450,000
hours. 797 The Commission further estimated that the ongoing annualized burden associated with
Rule 907 will be approximately 30,000 hours per registered SDR, 798 which corresponds to an
ongoing annualized aggregate burden of approximately 300,000 hours. 799
As a result of amendments made to various provisions of Regulation SBSR in this
release, registered SDRs will need to broaden the scope of the written policies and procedures
that Rule 907 requires them to have. 800 The Commission believes that a registered SDR’s
expansion of its policies and procedures in response to the amendments to Regulation SBSR
797

This figure is based on the following: [((15,000 burden hours per registered SDR) +
(30,000 burden hours per registered SDR)) x (10 registered SDRs)] = 450,000 initial
annualized aggregate burden hours during the first year.

798

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14685. This figure is based on the
following: [(Sr. Programmer at 3,333 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 6,667 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney at 10,000 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 5,000 hours) + (Sr.
System Analyst at 3,333 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 1,667 hours)] = 30,000
burden hours per registered SDR.

799

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14685-86. This figure is based on the
following: [(30,000 burden hours per registered SDR) x (10 registered SDRs)] = 300,000
ongoing, annualized aggregate burden hours.

800

For example, new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) requires a registered clearing agency to report to the
alpha SDR whether or not it has accepted the alpha for clearing. The alpha SDR must
revise its policies and procedures to allow for the information from the registered clearing
agency to be connected to the initial report of the alpha. See supra Section III(G). In
addition, new Rule 902(c)(8) requires a registered SDR to avoid public dissemination of a
security-based swap that has been rejected from clearing or rejected by a prime broker if
the original transaction report has not yet been publicly disseminated. See supra Section
III(J). A registered SDR must adjust its policies and procedures for public dissemination
to comply with new Rule 902(c)(8).

305

adopted in this release represents an “add-on” to the burdens already calculated with respect to
the SDR policies and procedures under existing Rule 907. The Commission estimates the
incremental burden to be an additional 10% of the one-time and annual burdens estimated to
result from existing Rule 907.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that the one-time, initial burden for a registered
SDR to adopt written policies and procedures as required under Rule 907 will be approximately
16,500 hours. 801 In addition, the Commission estimates the annual burden of maintaining such
policies and procedures, including a full review at least annually, making available its policies
and procedures on the registered SDR’s website, and information or reports on non-compliance,
as required under Rule 907(e), will be approximately 33,000 hours for each registered SDR. 802
The Commission therefore estimates that the initial annualized burden associated with Rule 907
will be approximately 45,000 hours per registered SDR, which corresponds to an initial
annualized aggregate burden of approximately 495,000 hours. 803 The Commission further
estimates that the ongoing annualized burden associated with Rule 907 will be approximately
33,000 hours per registered SDR, which corresponds to an ongoing annualized aggregate burden
of approximately 330,000 hours. 804

Cross-Border Matters—Rule 908

801

This figure is calculated as follows: [15,000 one-time written policies and procedures
development x (1.1)] = 16,500.

802

This figure is calculated as follows: [(30,000 one-time written policies and procedures
development x (1.1)] = 33,000.

803

This figure is based on the following: [((16,500 burden hours per registered SDR) +
(33,000 burden hours per registered SDR)) x (10 registered SDRs)] = 495,000 initial
annualized aggregate burden hours during the first year.

804

This figure is based on the following: [(33,000 burden hours per registered SDR) x (10
registered SDRs)] = 330,000 ongoing, annualized aggregate burden hours.

306

1.

Existing Rule 908

Rule 908(a) defines when certain cross-border security-based swap transactions are
subject to regulatory reporting and/or public dissemination. Rule 908(a), as adopted in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, covered security-based swaps consisting of only certain
counterparty pairs. Existing Rule 908(a)(1)(i) provides that a security-based swap shall be
subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if “[t]here is a direct or indirect
counterparty that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of the transaction.,” and existing Rule
908(a)(1)(ii) provides that a security-based swap shall be subject to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination if “[t]he security-based swap is submitted to a clearing agency having its
principal place of business in the United States.” Existing Rule 908(a)(2) provides that a
security-based swap not included within Rule 908(a)(1) would be subject to regulatory reporting
but not public dissemination “if there is a direct or indirect counterparty on either or both sides of
the transaction that is a registered security-based swap dealer or a registered major securitybased swap participant.” Rule 908(a), as adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, did
not otherwise address when an uncleared security-based swap involving only unregistered nonU.S. persons would be subject to regulatory reporting and/or public dissemination.
Rule 908(b) defines when a person might incur obligations under Regulation SBSR.
Existing Rule 908(b) provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of Regulation SBSR, a
person shall not incur any obligation under Regulation SBSR unless it is a U.S. person, a
registered security-based swap dealer, or a registered major security-based swap participant.
The Commission stated in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release that Rules 908(a) and
908(b) do not impose any collection of information requirements and that, to the extent that a
security-based swap transaction or a person is subject to Rule 908(a) or 908(b), respectively, the

307

collection of information burdens are calculated as part of the underlying rule (e.g., Rule 901,
which imposes the basic duty to report security-based swap transaction information). 805
Existing Rule 908(c) sets forth the requirements for a substituted compliance request
relating to regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps in a particular
foreign jurisdiction, and is the only part of Rule 908 to impose paperwork burdens. Rule 908(c)
is not being amended by this release. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the
Commission estimated that it will receive approximately ten substituted compliance requests in
the first year and two requests each subsequent year. 806 The total paperwork burden associated
with submitting a request for a substituted compliance determination with respect to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination will be approximately 1,120 hours, plus $1,120,000 for 14
estimated requests. 807 In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated
that it would receive ten requests in the first year resulting in an aggregated burden for the first
year of 800 hours, plus $800,000 for the services of outside professionals. 808 The Commission
further estimates that it would receive two requests in each subsequent year resulting in an
aggregate annual burden, after the first year, of up to 160 hours of company time and $160,000
for the services of outside professionals. 809
2.

Rule 908—Amendments

The Commission today is adopting amendments to Rule 908(a) to subject additional
types of security-based swap transactions to regulatory reporting and public dissemination under
805

See 80 FR at 14686.

806

See id.

807

308

Regulation SBSR, and amendments to Rule 908(b) to clarify that additional types of persons
may incur duties under Regulation SBSR. However, these amendments do not themselves
impose any paperwork burdens. Additional paperwork burdens caused by increasing the number
of respondents or by increasing the burdens imposed on respondents are considered under the
rule that imposes the substantive duties. The Commission is not amending Rule 908(c) herein.
3.

Rule 908—Aggregate Total Burdens and Costs

Because the only part of Rule 908 that imposes any paperwork burdens is paragraph (c),
the Commission’s estimate from the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release of the total paperwork
burden associated with Rule 908(c) remains approximately 1,120 hours, plus $1,120,000 for 14
substituted compliance requests. 810 The Commission continues to believe that the first-year
aggregated burden will be 800 hours, plus $800,000 for the services of outside professionals, and
that the aggregate burden for each year following the first year will be up to 160 hours of
company time and $160,000 for the services of outside professionals. 811

Additional PRA Discussion
1.

Use of Information

The security-based swap transaction information that is required by the amendments to
Regulation SBSR adopted herein will be used by registered SDRs, market participants, the
Commission, and other relevant authorities. The information reported by respondents pursuant
to the amendments to Regulation SBSR adopted herein will be used by registered SDRs to
publicly disseminate reports of security-based swap transactions, as well as to offer a resource
for the Commission and other relevant authorities to obtain detailed information about the
810

See id.

811

See id.

309

security-based swap market. Market participants also will use the information about these
transactions that is publicly disseminated, among other things, to assess the current market for
security-based swaps and any underlying and related securities, and to assist in the valuation of
their own positions. The Commission and other relevant authorities will use information about
security-based swap transactions reported to and held by registered SDRs to monitor and assess
systemic risks, as well as to examine for and consider whether to take enforcement action against
potentially abusive trading behavior, as appropriate.
The policies and procedures required under the amendments to Regulation SBSR will be
used by participants to aid in their compliance with Regulation SBSR, and also used by the
Commission as part of its ongoing efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with the federal
securities laws, including Regulation SBSR, through, among other things, examinations and
inspections.
2.

Recordkeeping Requirements

Apart from the duty to report certain transaction information, Regulation SBSR does not
impose any recordkeeping requirement on reporting sides.
Security-based swap transaction information received by a registered SDR pursuant to
Regulation SBSR is subject to Rule 13n-5(b)(4) under the Exchange Act, 812 which requires an
SDR to maintain such information for not less than five years after the applicable security-based
swap expires and historical positions for not less than five years. Rule 13n-7(b) under the
Exchange Act 813 requires the SDR to keep and preserve at least one copy of all documents,
including all documents and policies and procedures required by the Exchange Act and the rules
812

17 CFR 240.13n-5(b)(4).

310

or regulations thereunder, for a period of not less than five years, the first two years in a place
that is immediately available to representatives of the Commission for inspection and
examination. The Commission does not believe that the amendments to Regulation SBSR
adopted herein will have any impact on the PRA burdens of registered SDRs related to
recordkeeping as they were already accounted for in the SDR Adopting Release. 814
The Commission has proposed recordkeeping requirements for registered clearing
agencies 815 and SB SEFs. 816 The amendments to Regulation SBSR adopted herein do not
impose any recordkeeping requirements on registered clearing agencies or platforms.
3.

Collection of Information is Mandatory

Each collection of information discussed above is mandatory.
4.

Confidentiality of Responses to Collection of Information

An SDR, pursuant to Section 13(n)(5)(F) of the Exchange Act 817 and Rules 13n-4(b)(8)
and 13n-9 thereunder, 818 is required to maintain the privacy of the security-based swap
transaction information that it receives. For the majority of security-based swap transactions, the
information collected pursuant to Rule 901(c) by a registered SDR will be publicly disseminated.
Furthermore, to the extent that information previously reported and publicly disseminated is

about these transactions will not be publicly available. For all security-based swaps, the
information collected pursuant to Rule 901(d) is for regulatory purposes and will not generally
be available to the public, although the Commission or Commission staff may make available
statistics or aggregated data derived from these transaction reports. To the extent that the
Commission receives confidential information pursuant to this collection of information, such

XII.

Economic Analysis
The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act, among other things, to require

regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swap transactions. Regulation
SBSR, which the Commission adopted in February 2015, implements this mandate. At the same
time that it adopted Regulation SBSR, the Commission proposed additional rules and guidance
to address issues that were not resolved in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. 819 Later, in
April 2015, the Commission issued the U.S. Activity Proposal, which (among other things)
proposed further amendments to Regulation SBSR to address the reporting and public
dissemination of additional types of cross-border security-based swaps. 820 In this release, the
Commission is adopting, with certain revisions, the amendments to Regulation SBSR contained
in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release and the U.S. Activity Proposal.
The Commission is sensitive to the economic consequences and effects, including costs
and benefits, of its rules. Some of these costs and benefits stem from statutory mandates, while
others are affected by the discretion exercised in implementing these mandates. The following

economic analysis identifies and considers the benefits and costs that could result from the
amendments adopted herein. The Commission also discusses the potential economic effects of
certain alternatives to the approach taken by these amendments. To the extent applicable, the
views of commenters relevant to the Commission’s analysis of the economic effects, costs, and
benefits of these amendments are included in the discussion below.
A.

Programmatic Costs of Amendments to Regulation SBSR

In this section, the Commission discusses the programmatic costs and benefits associated
with the amendments to Regulation SBSR adopted in this release. This discussion includes a
summary of and response to comments relating to the Commission’s initial analysis of the costs
and benefits associated with these amendments.
1.

Programmatic Costs of Newly Adopted Requirements

New Rule 901(a)(2)(i) provides that the reporting side for a clearing transaction is the
registered clearing agency that is a direct counterparty to the clearing transaction, and allows the
registered clearing agency to select the SDR. New Rule 901(a)(3) requires any person that has a
duty to report a security-based swap that has been submitted to clearing at a registered clearing
agency to promptly provide that registered clearing agency with the transaction ID of the
submitted security-based swap and the identity of the registered SDR to which the transaction
will be reported or has been reported. These amendments to Rule 901 will impose initial and
ongoing costs on platforms, registered clearing agencies, and reporting entities. These costs will
be a function of the number of additional events reportable as a result of these amendments and
the number of data elements required to be submitted for each additional reportable event. 821

821

This release considers only the events that must be reported as a result of the amendments
to Rule 901 being adopted today. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the

a.

For Platforms and Registered Clearing Agencies

The Commission believes that platforms and registered clearing agencies, when carrying
out duties to report security-based swaps, will generally incur the same infrastructure costs that
reporting sides face. Like a reporting side, a platform or registered clearing agency must: (1)
develop a transaction processing system; (2) implement a reporting mechanism; and (3) establish
an appropriate compliance program and support for the operation of the transaction processing
system. 822 Once platforms and registered clearing agencies have established the infrastructure to
report security-based swap transactions, reportable events will be reported through electronic
means and the marginal cost of reporting an additional transaction once the infrastructure to
support the reporting function has been established should be de minimis. The Commission
continues to estimate that there will be ten platforms and four registered clearing agencies that
will incur duties to report security-based swap transactions under the amendments to Rule 901
adopted herein.
For platforms, the costs of reporting infrastructure consist of start-up costs in the first
year and ongoing costs each year thereafter. For each platform, the estimated start-up costs
include: (1) $102,000 for the initial set-up of the reporting infrastructure to carry out duties
under Rule 901; 823 (2) $200,000 for establishing connectivity to a registered SDR; 824 (3) $49,000

Commission estimated the number of reportable events that will result from the rules
adopted in that release and the associated costs. See generally 80 FR at 14700-704.
822

See id. at 14701.

823

This estimate is based on the following: [((Sr. Programmer (160 hours) at $303 per hour)
+ (Sr. Systems Analyst (160 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (10 hours)
at $283 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (5 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance
Attorney (20 hours) at $334 per hour))] = approximately $102,000 per platform. All
hourly cost figures are based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013 (modified by Commission staff to account for an
1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee

for developing, testing, and supporting a reporting mechanism for security-based swap
transactions; 825 (4) $77,000 for order management costs; 826 (5) $1,000 for data storage costs; 827
(6) $54,000 for designing and implementing an appropriate compliance and support program; 828
and (7) $38,500 for maintaining the compliance and support program. 829 Therefore, the

benefits, and overhead). See also Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80
FR at 14775-76.
824

The Commission derived the total estimated expense from the following: ($100,000
hardware- and software related expenses, including necessary backup and redundancy,
per SDR connection) × (2 SDR connections per platform) = $200,000 per platform. See
also Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14776.

825

This figure is calculated as follows: [((Sr. Programmer (80 hours) at $303 per hour) +
(Sr. Systems Analyst (80 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (5 hours) at
$283 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (2 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance
Attorney (5 hours) at $334 per hour))] = approximately $49,000 per platform. See also
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14776.

826

This estimate is based on the following: [((Sr. Programmer (32 hours) at $303 per hour)
+ (Sr. Systems Analyst (32 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (60 hours)
at $283 per hour) + (Compliance Clerk (240 hours) at $64 per hour) + (Director of
Compliance (24 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (48 hours) at $334 per
hour)))] = approximately $77,000 per platform. See also Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14776.

827

This estimate is calculated as follows: [$250/gigabyte of storage capacity x (4 gigabytes
of storage)] = $1,000 per platform. See also Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments
Release, 80 FR at 14776.

828

This figure is calculated as follows: [((Sr. Programmer (100 hours) at $303 per hour) +
(Sr. Systems Analyst (40 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (20 hours) at
$283 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (10 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance
Attorney (10 hours) at $334 per hour)] = approximately $54,000 per platform. See also
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14776.

829

This figure is calculated as follows: [((Sr. Programmer (16 hours) at $303 per hour) +
(Sr. Systems Analyst (16 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (30 hours) at
$283 per hour) + (Compliance Clerk (120 hours) at $64 per hour) + (Director of
Compliance (12 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (24 hours) at $334 per
hour)] = approximately $38,500 per platform. See also Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14776.

315

Commission estimates total start-up costs of $521,500 per platform and $5,215,000 for all
platforms. 830
The Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 901 being adopted today also
will require each platform to incur the following ongoing costs: (1) $200,000 for maintaining
connectivity to a registered SDR; 831 (2) $77,000 for order management costs; (3) $1,000 for data
storage costs; and (4) $38,500 for maintaining its compliance and support program. Therefore,
the total estimated ongoing cost per year is $316,500 per platform, and $3,165,000 for all
platforms. 832
The Commission estimates that a registered clearing agency will have the same reporting
infrastructure cost components as a platform, except that the costs to a registered clearing agency
will be marginally higher because Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), as adopted herein, imposes a burden on
registered clearing agencies that does not apply to platforms. 833 Although a registered clearing
agency might not otherwise establish connectivity to an alpha SDR, the registered clearing
agency will have to establish connectivity to alpha SDRs to comply with new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii).

830

For each platform, the start-up cost is obtained by summing up its components =
$102,000 + $200,000 + $49,000 + $77,000 + $1,000 + $54,000 + $38,500 = $521,500.
The start-up cost for all platforms = 10 platforms x $521,500 = $5,215,000.

831

For each platform, the Commission estimates the cost of maintaining connectivity to an
SDR to be the same as the cost of establishing connectivity to a registered SDR.

832

For each platform, the on-going cost per year is obtained by summing up its components
= $200,000 + $77,000 + $1,000 + $38,500 = $316,500. The ongoing cost per year for all
platforms = 10 platforms x $316,500 = $3,165,000.

833

Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) requires a registered clearing agency to report whether or not it has
accepted an alpha for clearing to the alpha SDR. See supra Section III(G).

316

Accordingly, the Commission estimates that each registered clearing agency will connect to four
registered SDRs. 834
For each registered clearing agency, the estimated start-up costs consist of: (1) $102,000
for the initial setting-up of the reporting infrastructure to carry out duties under Rule 901;
(2) $400,000 for establishing connectivity to a registered SDR; 835 (3) $49,000 for developing,
testing, and supporting a reporting mechanism for security-based swap transactions; (4) $77,000
for order management costs; (5) $1,000 for data storage costs; (6) $54,000 for designing and
implementing an appropriate compliance and support program; and (7) $38,500 for maintaining
its compliance and support program. Therefore, the total estimated start-up cost is $721,500 per
registered clearing agency and $2,886,000 in aggregate for all registered clearing agencies. 836

834

Cf. supra Section XII(A)(1)(a) (estimating that each platform will connect to only two
registered SDRs).

835

The Commission derived the total estimated expense for registered clearing agencies as
($100,000 hardware- and software-related expenses, including necessary backup and
redundancy, per SDR connection) x (4 SDR connections per registered clearing agency)
= $400,000 per registered clearing agency. See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments
Release, 80 FR at 14776 (estimating the hardware- and software-related expenses per
SDR connection at $100,000).

836

For each registered clearing agency, the start-up cost is obtained by summing up its
components = $102,000 + $400,000 + $49,000 + $77,000 + $1,000 + $54,000 + $38,500
= $683,000. The start-up cost for all registered clearing agencies = 4 registered clearing
agencies x $721,500 = $2,886,000. These figures represent an estimate of the costs to a
registered clearing agency to be fully onboarded with a registered SDR to allow reporting
of all of the primary and secondary trade information associated with security-based
swaps, as reporting sides are required to report. To the extent that a registered clearing
agency must report to a registered SDR only alpha clearing dispositions and not entire
transaction reports, the cost incurred by the clearing agency to carry out such reporting
could be less. Regulation SBSR does not require full onboarding with an alpha SDR to
report the limited number of data elements necessary to convey whether or not the
clearing agency has accepted a particular alpha for clearing.

317

For each registered clearing agency, the ongoing estimated annual costs consist of:
(1) $400,000 for maintaining connectivity to a registered SDR; 837 (2) $77,000 for order
management costs; (3) $1,000 for data storage costs; and (4) $38,500 for maintaining its
compliance and support program. Therefore, the Commission estimates the ongoing cost per
year as $516,500 per registered clearing agency and $2,066,000 for all registered clearing
agencies. 838
The Commission previously estimated, using available transaction data from TIW, that
there will be approximately 3 million transaction events per year related to security-based swaps,
including the execution of new transactions and various types of life cycle events. 839 The
Commission also estimated that Rule 901(a), as adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, will require approximately 2 million of those events to be reported under Regulation
SBSR. 840 In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission further
estimated that the proposed amendments to Rule 901 would subject another 1 million events to a
reporting requirement. This estimate of 1 million reportable events included platform-executed
security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing, all clearing transactions, and all life
cycle events associated with such transactions. Specifically, the Commission estimates that
platforms will be responsible for the reporting of approximately 120,000 of the 1 million

837

The Commission estimates that a registered clearing agency’s cost of maintaining
connectivity to an SDR is the same as the registered clearing agency’s cost of
establishing connectivity to an SDR.

838

The ongoing cost per year is obtained by summing up its components = $400,000 +
$77,000 + $1,000 + $38,500 = $516,500. The ongoing cost per year for all registered
clearing agencies = 4 registered clearing agencies x $516,500 = $2,066,000.

additional reportable events per year. 841 Since a platform must report only the security-based
swaps executed on the platform that will be submitted to clearing, the Commission estimates that
essentially all 120,000 platform-executed alphas will be terminated. The Commission estimates
that there will be approximately 760,000 reportable events per year that are clearing transactions
or life cycle events associated with clearing transactions. 842
The Commission estimates that platforms will be responsible for reporting approximately
120,000 security-based swaps per year, at an annual cost of approximately $45,300 or $4,530 per
platform, 843 and that registered clearing agencies will be responsible for reporting approximately
760,000 reportable events at an annual cost of approximately $286,900 or $71,725 per registered
clearing agency. 844 The Commission believes that all reportable events that will be reported by
platforms and registered clearing agencies pursuant to the amendments to Rule 901(a) will be
reported through electronic means.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission stated that, to the extent that
security-based swaps become more standardized and trade more frequently on electronic

841

See supra Section XI(B)(2)(b)(iv).

842

See id.

843

The Commission estimates: ((120,000 × 0.005 hours per transaction) / (10 platforms)) =
60 hours per platform, or 600 total hours. The Commission further estimates the total cost
to be: [((Compliance Clerk (30 hours) at $64 per hour) + (Sr. Computer Operator (30
hours) at $87 per hour)) × (10 platforms)] = approximately $45,300, or $4,530 per
platform. See also Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14777.

844

The Commission estimates: ((760,000 × 0.005 hours per transaction) / (4 registered
clearing agencies)) = 950 hours per registered clearing agency, or 3,800 total hours. The
Commission further estimates the total cost to be: [((Compliance Clerk (475 hours) at
$64 per hour) + (Sr. Computer Operator (475 hours) at $87 per hour)) × (4 registered
clearing agencies)] = $286,900, or $71,725 per registered clearing agency. See also
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14777, which estimates the
time taken to process a transaction at 0.005 hours, the hourly rate of a Compliance Clerk
at $64 per hour, and the hourly rate of a Sr. Computer Operator at $87 per hour.

319

platforms (rather than manually), the act of reporting transactions to a registered SDR should
become less costly. 845 Together, these trends are likely to reduce the number of transactions that
necessitate the manual capture of bespoke data elements, which is likely to take more time and
be more expensive than electronic capture of standardized transactions. New Rules 901(a)(1)
and 901(a)(2)(i), respectively, assign reporting duties to clearing transactions and platformexecuted security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing. To the extent that registered
clearing agencies make standardized security-based swaps available for clearing and platforms
make standardized security-based swaps available for trading, the reporting of transactions
covered by Rules 901(a)(1) and 901(a)(2)(i) should be less costly on average than the reporting
of bespoke security-based swaps.
One commenter argued that the incremental costs of assigning the reporting obligation to
the alpha reporting side would be small compared to the costs associated with registered clearing
agencies incurring the reporting duty and having to establish connectivity to alpha SDRs. 846 The
Commission estimates that a registered clearing agency will connect to four registered SDRs as a
result of Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), 847 but that, in the absence of this rule, a registered clearing agency,
like a platform, would connect to only two registered SDRs. 848 Thus, the Commission estimates
that a registered clearing agency has to connect to two additional alpha SDRs as a result of new
Rule 901(e)(1)(ii). The estimated cost of establishing connectivity to two SDRs is $200,000, and

845

the estimated annual cost of maintaining connectivity to two SDRs is $200,000. 849 The
estimated aggregate cost of establishing connectivity to alpha SDRs is $800,000, and the
estimated aggregate annual cost of maintaining connectivity to alpha SDRs is $800,000. The
Commission estimates that the costs to the alpha reporting side of reporting the initial alpha
transaction are an upper bound estimate of the costs of assigning the duty to report clearing
dispositions of alphas to the alpha reporting side. 850 To estimate the costs to the alpha reporting
side of reporting the initial alpha transaction, the Commission assumes that the total annual
number of platform-executed alpha transactions that will be submitted for clearing is 120,000. 851
The Commission estimates the costs to the alpha reporting sides of reporting the initial alpha
transactions to be the same as the platforms’ costs of reporting the 120,000 platform-executed
alpha transactions. Thus, the aggregate reporting costs are approximately $45,300 per year, 852

849

The cost of establishing SDR connectivity is estimated as ($100,000 hardware- and
software-related expenses, including necessary backup and redundancy, per SDR
connection) x (2 SDR connections per registered clearing agency) = $200,000 per
registered clearing agency. See also Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at
14701. The Commission estimates that a registered clearing agency’s cost of maintaining
connectivity to two alpha SDRs is the same as the registered clearing agency’s cost of
establishing connectivity to two alpha SDRs. These costs do not represent new
compliance costs. They are part of the start-up and ongoing costs incurred by a registered
clearing agency to comply with the amendments to Rule 901 adopted today and discussed
in Section XII(A)(1)(a), supra. The estimated aggregate cost of establishing connectivity
to alpha SDRs is ($200,000 alpha SDR connectivity cost per registered clearing agency)
x (4 registered clearing agencies) = $800,000. The estimated aggregate annual cost of
maintaining connectivity to alpha SDRs is ($200,000 alpha SDR connectivity
maintenance cost per registered clearing agency) x (4 registered clearing agencies) =
$800,000.

850

The costs of reporting the initial alpha trade form an upper bound estimate because the
initial alpha trade report likely requires more data elements to be captured and
transmitted than would a report of whether the alpha trade has been accepted for clearing.

851

See supra Section XII(A)(1)(a).

852

See id.

321

which represent an upper bound estimate of the costs of assigning the reporting obligation to the
alpha reporting side.
The Commission recognizes that its estimate of the costs that an alpha reporting side
would incur to report whether a security-based swap was accepted for clearing are lower than its
estimate of the cost that a registered clearing agency would incur in order to establish
connectivity to alpha SDRs to meet the same regulatory obligation under Rule 901(e)(1)(ii).
Nevertheless, the Commission is adopting Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) as proposed because, as explained
above, this approach is likely to efficiently support data quality at registered SDRs.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that the approach reflected in newly adopted Rule
901(e)(1)(ii) is appropriate even in light of the costs. The Commission notes that existing Rule
901(c)(6) requires reporting of an indication whether the direct counterparties intend that a
security-based swap will be submitted to clearing so that this information will appear in the
transaction records of the alpha SDR. The Commission believes that requiring reporting to the
alpha SDR of whether or not a registered clearing agency accepts the alpha for clearing will
facilitate the Commission’s ability to measure outstanding bilateral exposures, including
exposures to registered clearing agencies.
Moreover, the Commission’s determination that the clearing agency to which the
security-based swap is submitted for clearing should be required to report the disposition of the
alpha rather than the alpha reporting side (or a platform, in the case of a platform-executed
alpha) is designed to improve the integrity of information about cleared security-based swaps.
The Commission believes that centralizing responsibility for reporting this information in a small
number of registered clearing agencies rather than a larger number of alpha reporting sides and
platforms minimizes the likelihood of orphan alphas. The adopted approach should facilitate the

322

ability of alpha SDRs to match clearing disposition reports with the original alpha transaction
reports and help the Commission to obtain a more accurate view of the exposures of
counterparties that intended to clear transactions. A more accurate view of the exposures of
counterparties will enable the Commission to conduct robust monitoring of the security-based
swap market for potential risks to financial markets and financial market participants. 853
Furthermore, Rule 901(e)(1)(ii) is consistent with the Commission’s approach of
assigning the reporting obligation for a transaction to the person with the most complete and
efficient access to the required information at the point of creation. The registered clearing
agency determines whether to accept an alpha for clearing and controls the precise moment when
the transaction is cleared; the Commission believes, therefore, that the clearing agency is best
placed to report the result of its decision. If the alpha reporting side were required to report
whether or not the alpha has been accepted for clearing, it would first need to learn this
information from the registered clearing agency. 854 As the Commission noted in Section III(B),
supra, a rule that required reporting by a person who lacks direct access, at the time of creation,
to the information that must be reported would increase the risks of data discrepancies, errors, or
delays. Accordingly, for the same reasons that the Commission is assigning to registered
clearing agencies the duty to report all clearing transactions, the Commission also believes that it
is more efficient to require a registered clearing agency to report to the alpha SDR whether or not
the clearing agency has accepted the alpha for clearing.
853

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release 80 FR at 14700.

854

The commenter who advocated that the duty to report whether or not the transaction has
been accepted for clearing should be given to the reporting side of the alpha
acknowledged that the alpha reporting side must rely on the clearing agency to provide
information about the disposition of any transaction submitted to clearing. See
LCH.Clearnet Letter at 9-10.

323

b.

For Platforms and Reporting Sides of Alphas

Under new Rule 901(a)(3), a person who has a duty to report an alpha transaction also is
required to promptly provide the registered clearing agency with the transaction ID of the alpha
transaction and the identity of the registered SDR to which the transaction will be or has been
reported.
Reporting sides and platforms are likely already to have in place the infrastructure needed
to report security-based swaps to a registered clearing agency, as voluntary clearing of
standardized single-name CDS has become a significant feature of the existing security-based
swap market in the United States. Furthermore, as additional platforms enter the security-based
swap market, it is likely that they also will seek to establish connectivity to one or more
registered clearing agencies, as there are market incentives to clear platform-executed securitybased swaps and platforms will likely seek to offer their participants the ability to transmit
information about platform-executed transactions directly to a clearing agency. Thus, the
Commission does not believe that new Rule 901(a)(3) will require additional infrastructure or
connectivity that otherwise would not exist.
However, Rule 901(a)(3) will require persons with the duty to report alphas to provide
two additional data elements—the transaction ID of the alpha and the name of the alpha SDR—
to the registered clearing agency. The Commission believes that persons who submit securitybased swap transactions to registered clearing agencies will comply with Rule 901(a)(3) by
including these two data elements along with all of the other transaction data submitted to the
clearing agency. The Commission estimates that the one-time cost for developing the ability to
report these two data elements will be $2,815 per reporting person, and the additional one-time
burden related to the implementation of a reporting mechanism for these two data elements will

324

be $1,689 per reporting person. 855 The Commission believes that the additional ongoing cost
related to the development of the ability to capture the relevant transaction information will be
$2,815 per reporting person and the additional ongoing burden related to the maintenance of the
reporting mechanism will be $563 per reporting person. 856
c.

Total Costs of Platforms, Registered Clearing Agencies, and
Reporting Sides Relating to Amendments to Rule 901

Summing these costs 857, the Commission estimates that the initial, first-year costs of
complying with the amendments to Rule 901 (including the initial reporting and the reporting of
any life cycle events) will be $5,260,300, which corresponds to $526,030 per platform. 858 The
Commission estimates that the ongoing aggregate annual costs, after the first year, of complying

855

The Commission estimates the cost of developing the ability to capture the alpha’s
transaction ID and the alpha SDR as: [(Sr. Programmer (5 hours at $303 per hour) + Sr.
Systems Analyst (5 hours) at $260 per hour) = $2,815 per platform or reporting side.
The Commission estimates the cost of implementing the reporting mechanism as: (Sr.
Programmer (3 hours) at $303 per hour + Sr. Systems Analyst (3 hours) at $260 per hour)
= $1,689 per platform or reporting side.

856

The Commission estimates the additional ongoing development cost as (Sr. Programmer
(5 hours at $303 per hour) + Sr. Systems Analyst (5 hours at $260 per hour)) = $2,815
per platform or reporting side. The Commission estimates the ongoing maintenance cost
as (Sr. Programmer (1 hour at $303 per hour) + Sr. Systems Analyst (1 hour at $260 per
hour)) = $563 per platform or reporting side.

857

In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, platforms’ initial, first-year
costs and ongoing aggregate annual costs included costs incurred under Rule 901(a)(3).
In this release, platforms’ initial, first-year costs and ongoing aggregate annual costs do
not include costs incurred under Rule 901(a)(3). Instead, platforms’ Rule 901(a)(3) costs
have been added to the Rule 901(a)(3) costs of the 300 reporting sides to estimate the
initial, first-year and ongoing aggregate annual costs of Rule 901(a)(3) for 300 reporting
sides and 10 platforms.

858

This estimate is based on the following: (($102,000 + $200,000 + $49,000 +$77,000 +
$54,000 + $1,000 + $38,500 + $4,530) x (10 platforms)) = $5,260,300 which corresponds
to $526,030 per platform.

325

with the amendments to Rule 901 (including the initial reporting and the reporting of any life
cycle events) will be $3,210,300, which corresponds to $321,030 per platform. 859
For registered clearing agencies, the Commission estimates that the initial, first-year costs
of complying with the amendments to Rule 901 (including the initial reporting and the reporting
of any life cycle events) will be $3,172,900, which corresponds to $793,225 per registered
clearing agency. 860 The Commission estimates that the ongoing aggregate annual costs, after the
first year, of complying with the amendments to Rule 901 (including the initial reporting and the
reporting of any life cycle events) will be $2,352,900, which corresponds to $588,225 per
registered clearing agency. 861
For compliance with new Rule 901(a)(3), the Commission estimates that the initial, firstyear costs of complying will be $1,396,240, which corresponds to $4,504 per respondent. 862 The
Commission estimates that the ongoing aggregate annual costs, after the first year, of complying
with Rule 901(a)(3) will be $1,047,180, which corresponds to $3,378 per respondent. 863

859

This estimate is based on the following: (($200,000 + $77,000 + $1,000 + $38,500 +
$4,530) x (10 platforms)) = $3,210,300, or $321,030 per platform.

860

This estimate is based on the following: (($102,000 + $400,000 + $49,000 +$77,000 +
$54,000 + $1,000 + $38,500 +$71,725) x (4 registered clearing agencies)) = $3,172,900,
which corresponds to $793,225 per registered clearing agency.

861

This estimate is based on the following: (($400,000 + $77,000 + $1,000 + $38,500 +
$71,725) x (4 registered clearing agencies)) = $2,352,900, or $588,225 per registered
clearing agency.

862

This estimate is based on the following: ($2,815 + $1,689) x 310 (300 reporting sides +
10 platforms)) = $1,396,240, which corresponds to $4,504 per respondent. In the
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the estimate only included the onetime cost related to the development of the ability to capture the relevant transaction
information ($2,815). The estimation has been revised to also include the one-time cost
of implementing a reporting mechanism for the transaction information ($1,689).

863

This estimate is based on the following: (($2,815 + $563) x 310 (300 reporting sides +
10 platforms)) = $1,047,180, or $3,378 per respondent. In the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release, the estimate only included the ongoing cost related to

Reporting by Unregistered Persons

As noted in Section IX(G), supra, the amendments to existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E) that
are being adopted today expand the reporting hierarchy to assign the duty to report additional
cross-border transactions when there is no registered person on either side. As under existing
Rule 901, the reporting side, as determined by the reporting hierarchy, is required to submit the
information required by Rule 901.
Under newly adopted Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2), in a transaction between an unregistered
U.S. person and an unregistered foreign dealing entity that is engaging in ANE activity, the sides
are required to select which side is the reporting side. Also under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2), if
both sides are unregistered non-U.S. persons and both are engaging in ANE activity, the sides
would be required to select the reporting side. In both scenarios, both sides would be subject to
Rule 908(b) and thus the Commission could impose reporting duties on either side.
Newly adopted Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3) addresses the scenario where one side is subject
to Rule 908(b) and the other side is not—i.e., one side includes only unregistered non-U.S.
persons that do not engage in any ANE activity. When the other side includes an unregistered
U.S. person or an unregistered foreign dealer that is engaging in ANE activity, the side with the
unregistered U.S. person or the unregistered foreign dealing entity would be the reporting side. 864

the development of the ability to capture the relevant transaction information ($2,815).
The estimation has been revised to also include the ongoing cost of implementing a
reporting mechanism for the transaction information ($563).
864

While Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2)-(3) admit the possibility that some of these unregistered
persons are U.S. persons, the Commission does not expect unregistered U.S. persons to
be responsible for reporting a significant amount of additional transaction under Rules
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2)-(3). In current market practice, larger, more sophisticated participants
assume reporting duties. As a result, in cases where an unregistered U.S. person and a
non-U.S. person engaged in dealing activity in the United States select the reporting side,
327

In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 865 the Commission estimated that 300
respondents will incur reporting duties under Regulation SBSR, of which 50 are likely to register
as security-based swap dealers and five are likely to register as major security-based swap
market participants. Unregistered persons covered by new Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) and
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3) are already included in the remaining subset of 245 respondents that are not
likely to register as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants.
Because the Commission had already accounted for the programmatic costs of building reporting
infrastructure and reporting security-based swap transactions incurred by these 300 respondents
in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 866 Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) and 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3)
will not result in additional programmatic costs associated with reporting infrastructure or
transaction reporting. Two commenters noted that requiring the reporting of ANE transactions
would place burdens on unregistered entities that do not have reporting infrastructure in place
and would be compelled to engage third-party providers to report transactions. 867 The
Commission acknowledges that the reporting of ANE transactions will place burdens on
unregistered entities, but in only a limited number of cases. The Commission estimates that the
initial aggregate annual costs associated with Rule 901 will be approximately $2,096,000, which
corresponds to approximately $524,000 per unregistered entity. 868 The Commission estimates

the reporting duty is likely to be assigned to the non-U.S. person. See supra Section
IX(G)(2)(a).
865

See 80 FR at 14674.

866

See id. at 14701-702.

867

See ISDA I at 11; SIFMA/FSR Letter at 13.

868

The initial cost estimates are based on the following: $524,000 x 4 unregistered entities =
$2,096,000, which corresponds to $524,000 per unregistered entity. See Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14702. The four unregistered entities are the
estimated number of unregistered foreign dealing entities that will engage in ANE
328

that the ongoing aggregate annual costs associated with Rule 901 will be approximately
$1,276,000, which corresponds to approximately $319,000 per unregistered entity. 869 As
discussed earlier, these programmatic costs are part of the programmatic costs associated with
Rule 901 that were accounted for in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. Unregistered
foreign dealing entities could fulfil their reporting obligations by incurring the programmatic
costs of building reporting infrastructure and reporting security-based swap transactions.
Alternatively, these entities could engage with third-party service providers to carry out any
reporting duties incurred under Regulation SBSR. 870 The Commission disagrees with the
commenters that unregistered entities would use third-party service providers without
considering alternatives. Though the Commission does not have specific information on the
pricing of third-party reporting services on which to base estimates of the cost of engaging thirdparties to provide reporting services, the Commission notes that unregistered entities will likely
choose the method of compliance that they deem to be most cost efficient. Thus, the
Commission assumes that unregistered entities would engage third-party service providers only
if they provide services at costs less than the programmatic costs of Rule 901 estimated above.
Under new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), a registered broker-dealer would incur the duty to
report a security-based swap that is effected by or through that broker-dealer only when neither
activity. See supra Section II(A)(4)(d). The Commission assumes that unregistered U.S.
persons that fall under Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) and (3) will not assume reporting duties.
See supra Section IX(G)(2)(a).
869

The ongoing cost estimates are based on the following: $319,000 x 4 unregistered
entities = $1,276,000, which corresponds to $319,000 per unregistered entity. See id. for
a discussion of the assumptions underlying the calculations.

870

The Commission does not have data with which to estimate the costs of using third-party
service providers to carry out reporting duties incurred under Regulation SBSR. The two
commenters did not provide such cost estimates in their letters. See ISDA I at 11;
SIFMA/FSR Letter at 13).

329

side includes a person that falls within Rule 908(b)(5). The Commission estimates that a
maximum of 20 registered broker-dealers, excluding registered SB SEFs, will incur this
reporting duty and will report 540 security-based swap transactions per year. Unlike the
unregistered counterparties covered by Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) and (3), these 20 registered
broker-dealers were not part of the 300 respondents the Commission estimated in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release. Therefore, by subjecting the 20 registered broker-dealers to Regulation
SBSR, new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) adds new programmatic costs associated with reporting
infrastructure.
The Commission estimated the costs of reporting on a per-entity basis in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release and has no reason to believe that these per-entity costs are substantially
different for different types of entities. 871 Therefore, the Commission is applying these perentity costs to estimate the Rule 901 programmatic costs for the 20 registered broker-dealers. 872
For a registered broker-dealer, the cost of reporting infrastructure consists of start-up cost
in the first year and, thereafter, ongoing annual costs. For each registered broker-dealer, the
start-up cost is broken down into: (1) $102,000 for the initial set-up of the reporting
infrastructure to carry out duties under Rule 901; (2) $200,000 for establishing connectivity to a
registered SDR; (3) $49,000 for developing, testing, and supporting a reporting mechanism for
871

See id.

872

One commenter argued that Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) “would create a disproportionate
burden on registered broker-dealers relative to the small percentage of the market that
these transactions compromise.” SIFMA/FSR Letter at 14. The Commission notes that
many registered broker-dealers may already have order management systems in place to
facilitate voluntary reporting of security-based swap transactions or clearing activity. As
a result, any additional costs related to systems and infrastructure will be limited to those
broker-dealers that either invest in new systems or must upgrade existing systems to meet
minimum requirements for reporting. To the extent that the cost estimates discussed here
do not take this cost limiting fact into account, they are an upper bound for the estimated
costs. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14701.

security-based swap transactions; (4) $77,000 for order management costs; (5) $1,000 for data
storage costs; (6) $54,000 for designing and implementing an appropriate compliance and
support program; and (7) $38,500 for maintaining the compliance and support program. 873
Therefore, the total start-up cost is $521,500 per registered broker-dealer and $10,430,000 in
aggregate, across all registered broker-dealers. 874
For each registered broker-dealer, the ongoing annual cost consists of: (1) $200,000 for
maintaining connectivity to a registered SDR; 875 (2) $77,000 for order management costs;
(3) $1,000 for data storage costs; and (4) $38,500 for maintaining its compliance and support
program. Therefore, the ongoing cost per year is $316,500 per registered broker-dealer, and
$6,330,000 for all registered broker-dealers. 876 In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 877 the
Commission estimated that there will be 3 million reportable events per year under Rule 901. Of
the 3 million events, 2 million are not clearing transactions. The transactions that will be
reported by registered broker-dealers as a result of new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) were assessed by
the Commission as part of the 2 million non-clearing transactions. The Commission already
accounted for the cost of reporting the 2 million non-clearing transactions in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release.
873

See supra Section XII(A)(1)(a).

874

For each registered broker-dealer, the start-up cost is obtained by summing up its
components = $102,000 + $200,000 + $49,000 + $77,000 + $1,000 + $54,000 + $38,500
= $521,500. The start-up cost for all registered broker-dealers = 20 registered brokerdealers x $521,500 = $10,430,000.

875

See supra Section XII(A)(1)(a).

876

For each registered broker-dealer, the on-going cost per year is obtained by summing up
its components = $200,000 + $77,000 + $1,000 + $38,500 = $316,500. The on-going
cost per year for all registered broker-dealers is estimated to be (20 registered brokerdealers x $316,500) = $6,330,000.

Amendments to Rule 905(a)

The amendments to Rule 905(a) adopted herein provide that any counterparty or other
person having a duty to report a security-based swap that discovers an error in information
previously reported pursuant to Regulation SBSR must correct such error in accordance with the
procedures laid out in Rule 905(a). As the Commission noted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, requiring participants to promptly correct erroneous transaction information should help
ensure that the Commission and other relevant authorities have an accurate view of the risks in
the security-based swap market.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that Rule 905(a)
will impose an initial, one-time burden associated with designing and building a reporting side’s
reporting system to be capable of submitting amended security-based swap transaction
information to a registered SDR. 878 The Commission stated its belief that designing and building
appropriate reporting system functionality to comply with Rule 905(a)(2) will be a component
of, and represent an incremental “add-on” to, the cost to build a reporting system and develop a
compliance function as required under Rule 901. 879 Specifically, the Commission estimated that,
based on discussions with industry participants, the incremental burden will be equal to 5% of
the one-time and annual burdens associated with designing and building a reporting system that
is in compliance with Rule 901, plus 10% of the corresponding one-time and annual burdens
associated with developing the reporting side’s overall compliance program required under Rule
901. 880 This estimate was based on similar calculations contained in the Regulation SBSR

332

Proposing Release, 881 updated to reflect new estimates relating to the number of reportable
events and the number of reporting sides. 882
The Commission continues to believe that the above methodology is applicable to error
reporting by platforms and registered clearing agencies under the amendment to Rule 905(a).
Thus, for these new respondents, the Commission estimates that Rule 905(a) will impose an
initial (first-year) aggregate cost of $165,550, or $11,825 per respondent, 883 and an ongoing
aggregate annualized cost of $55,650, which is $3,975 per respondent. 884
The Commission estimates that four unregistered foreign dealing entities will engage in
ANE activity and incur a duty to report as a result of new Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2)-(3). 885 These
unregistered persons also will incur costs associated with error reporting under Rule 905. As
noted in Section XII(A)(1)(d), supra, these unregistered persons are part of the subset of 300
respondents that were identified in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release as not likely to
register as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants. Because the
Commission already accounted for the programmatic costs of building and maintaining error

reporting capabilities incurred by these 300 respondents in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, 886 the amendments to Rule 905(a) will not result in additional programmatic costs for
the four unregistered persons.
The Commission estimates that 20 registered broker-dealers, excluding SB SEFs, will
incur a duty to report security-based swap transactions because of new Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). 887 Thus, these registered broker-dealers are subject to the amendment to
Rule 905(a) adopted herein and will incur costs associated with error reporting.
The Commission continues to believe that the cost estimation methodology previously
applied in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release is applicable to error reporting by registered
broker-dealers. 888 Thus, for registered broker-dealers, the Commission estimates that the
amendment to Rule 905(a) will impose an initial (first-year) aggregate cost of $236,500, or
$11,825 per respondent, 889 and an ongoing aggregate annualized cost of $79,500, or $3,975 per
respondent. 890
Rule 905(a)(1) as amended herein states that, if a person that was not the reporting side
for a security-based swap transaction discovers an error in the information reported with respect

broker-dealer.

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75254-55. This figure is calculated as
follows: [(($2,500 annual maintenance of reporting system) x (0.05)) + (($38,500 annual

which is $3,975 per registered broker-dealer.

334

to such security-based swap, that person shall promptly notify the person having the duty to
report the security-based swap of the error. Clients of registered broker-dealers likely will incur
costs, because Rule 905(a)(1) requires them to notify registered broker-dealers of errors in
transaction reports made by the registered broker-dealers pursuant to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4).
As stated in Section XII(A)(1)(d), supra, the Commission estimates that registered broker-dealers
will incur the duty to report 540 security-based swap transactions per year under Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). Assuming that each of the 540 transactions is reported in error, the upper
bound estimate of the annual cost associated with this obligation is approximately $17,280,
which corresponds to roughly $576 per respondent. 891
3.

Amendments to Rule 906(c)

Existing Rule 906(c) requires each participant of a registered SDR that is a registered
security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant to establish,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure
compliance with any security-based swap transaction reporting obligations in a manner
consistent with Regulation SBSR. Rule 906(c) also requires each such participant to review and
update the required policies and procedures at least annually. The amendment to Rule 906(c)

891

These figures are based on the assumption that approximately 540 additional securitybased swap transactions per year will have to be reported by registered broker-dealers
pursuant to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), and that these trades involve 30 entities with
reporting duties. Using cost estimated provided in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, if each trade is reported in error, then the aggregate annual cost of error
notification is 540 errors x Compliance Clerk at $64 per hour x 0.5 hours per report =
$17,280, or $576 per participant. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at
14714. Salary figures are taken from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in
the Securities Industry 2013, modified to account for a 1,800-hour work-week and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.

335

adopted herein extends these same requirements to participants of a registered SDR that are
platforms, registered clearing agencies, and registered broker-dealers.
The Commission continues to believe that the cost estimation methodology previously
applied in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release is applicable to the adoption and maintenance
of policies and procedures. 892 Thus, for registered clearing agencies and platforms, the
Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 906(c) will impose an initial (first-year)
aggregate cost of $1,288,000, or $92,000 per registered clearing agency or platform, 893 and an
ongoing aggregate annualized cost of $476,000, or $34,000 per registered clearing agency or
platform. 894 In addition, for registered broker-dealers likely to become participants solely as a
result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) (a “respondent
broker-dealer”), the Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule 906(c) will impose an
initial (first-year) aggregate cost of $1,840,000, or $92,000 per respondent broker-dealer, 895 and
an ongoing aggregate annualized cost of $680,000, or $34,000 per respondent broker-dealer. 896

$92,000 per registered clearing agency or platform.

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14716. This figure is based on the
following: [($34,000 for annual updates to policies and procedures) x 14 registered

agency or platform.

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14716. This figure is based on the
following: [($34,000 for annual updates to policies and procedures) x 20 respondent

costs beyond the paperwork burdens described herein and in Section XI(D)(2)(c), supra.

Amendments That Subject Additional Cross-Border Security-Based
Swaps to Regulation SBSR
a.

ANE Transactions Involving Unregistered Entities

New Rule 908(a)(1)(v) provides that any security-based swap transaction connected with
a non-U.S. person’s security-based swap dealing activity that is arranged, negotiated, or executed
by U.S. personnel is subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination under Regulation
SBSR.
Several commenters expressed concern about the complexities and expense of
implementing the adopted rules. 897 One commenter stated there would be significant costs
associated with reporting because market participants that have already designed and
implemented reporting systems based on the CFTC’s cross-border guidance and the rules of
other jurisdictions would need to modify their systems to comply with the Commission’s
proposed rules. 898

897

See IIB Letter at 16 (stating that regulatory reporting of transactions where neither
reporting side includes a U.S. person, guaranteed affiliate, or registered security-based
swap dealer would come with significant cost); ISDA I at 11 (stating that expanding the
reporting requirements to non-U.S. trades would be burdensome and costly); SIFMAAMG I at 2 (stating that requiring the reporting of transactions that were arranged,
negotiated or executed in the United States would increase the transactional burdens on
“an already taxed system”); SIFMA/FSR Letter at 12 (taking the view that monitoring for
conduct in the United States and building the infrastructure needed for reporting based
purely on conduct will be an unnecessary expense for security-based swap market
participants since the information being added to the public dissemination stream would
not be informative or could give a distorted view of market prices and would result in
data at SDRs that has minimal U.S. nexus).

898

See IIB Letter at 16. The commenter stated that, to modify its systems in connection with
the U.S. personnel test, a non-U.S. dealing entity (including one operating below the de
minimis threshold) “would need to install or modify a trade capture system capable of
337

The Commission agrees that market participants will incur costs to comply with the
reporting requirements of Rule 908(a)(1)(v). However, the Commission notes that all ANE
transactions where a U.S. person is on one side as either a direct or indirect counterparty are
already subject to regulatory reporting under the rules adopted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release. Thus, only a small number of ANE transactions—which the Commission estimates will
result in at most 1,080 reportable events per year—will be subject to regulatory reporting as a
result of new Rule 908(a)(1)(v); accordingly, the attendant costs of complying with Rule
908(a)(1)(v) will also be relatively small. The Commission understands that market participants
may have to incur costs to modify their existing reporting systems to comply with the
Commission’s rules. 899 However, to the extent that these rules and rules in other jurisdictions
require the collection of the same or similar information, the system modification costs will be
minimized. 900
The Commission believes that the reporting and public dissemination of all ANE
transactions will provide benefits to the Commission and relevant authorities and to market
participants. The Commission also believes that requiring the public dissemination of these
tracking, on a dynamic, trade-by-trade basis, the location of front-office personnel. The
non-U.S. SBSD would then need to feed that data into its reporting system and re-code
that system to account for the different rules that apply to non-U.S. SBS depending on
whether they are arranged, negotiated or executed by U.S. personnel. The non-U.S.
SBSD would also need to train its front office personnel in the use of this new trade
capture system and develop policies, procedures, and controls to require, track, and test
the proper use of that system. In addition, the non-U.S. SBSD would need to seek and
obtain waivers from non-U.S. counterparties—to the extent such waivers are even
permitted—with respect to privacy, blocking and secrecy laws in local jurisdictions.” Id.
In the U.S. Activity Adopting Release, the Commission addressed generally the costs that
firms would incur as a result of firms having to register as security-based swap dealers.

transactions could help to increase price competition and price efficiency in the security-based
swap market and enable all market participants to have more comprehensive information with
which to make trading and valuation determinations. Publicly disseminating these transactions
also could reduce implicit transaction costs. 901 In addition, the amendments being adopted today
reflect the Commission’s assessment of the impact that the scope of security-based swap
transactions subject to regulatory reporting may have on the ability of the Commission and other
relevant authorities to detect emerging risks and abusive trading in the security-based swap
market. Regulatory reporting of these transactions to a registered SDR should enhance the
Commission’s ability to oversee relevant activity related to security-based swap dealing
occurring within the United States as well as to monitor market participants for compliance with
specific Title VII requirements (including the requirement that a person register with the
Commission as a security-based swap dealer if it exceeds the de minimis threshold). 902 The
reporting of these transactions also will enhance the Commission’s ability to monitor
manipulative and abusive practices involving security-based swap transactions or transactions in
related underlying assets, such as corporate bonds or other securities transactions that result from
dealing activity, or other relevant activity, in the U.S. market. 903

Transactions Executed on a Platform or By or Through a
Registered Broker-Dealer

New Rule 908(a)(1)(iii) requires any security-based swap transaction that is executed on
a platform having its principal place of business in the United States both to be reported to a
registered SDR and to be publicly disseminated pursuant to Regulation SBSR. New Rule
901

902

903

See id.

339

908(a)(1)(iv) requires the reporting and public dissemination of any security-based swap
transaction that is effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB
SEF). The Commission notes that many security-based swaps that are executed on platforms or
by or through a registered broker-dealer are already subject to Regulation SBSR because they
meet one or both prongs of existing Rule 908(a)(1)—i.e., there is a direct or indirect counterparty
that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of the transaction or the security-based swap is
accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United
States. 904 Thus, new Rules 908(a)(1)(iii) and (iv) extend regulatory reporting and public
dissemination to an additional number of uncleared security-based swaps: those involving only
non-U.S. persons. The costs of reporting these additional cross-border security-based swaps are
considered in the Commission’s analysis of the amendments to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E), which
assigns the duty to report those cross-border security-based swaps. 905 Thus, new Rules
908(a)(1)(iii) and (iv) do not independently impose any additional reporting costs.
One commenter suggested that new Rule 908(a)(1)(iv) could provide incentives for nonU.S. counterparties to avoid transacting through registered broker-dealers, resulting in market
fragmentation that would lead to adverse effects on risk management, market liquidity, and U.S.
jobs. 906 The Commission acknowledges that market fragmentation could result if non-U.S.
counterparties avoid transacting through registered broker-dealers. However, as discussed
above, because of the small number of security-based swaps that are subject to Rule
904

See Rule 908(a)(2) (stating that a security-based swap that is not included within Rule
908(a)(1) shall be subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination if there is a
direct or indirect counterparty on either or both sides of the transaction that is a registered
security-based swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap participant).

905

See supra Section XII(A)(1).

906

See IIB Letter at 16-17.

340

908(a)(1)(iv), any market fragmentation due to the avoidance of registered broker-dealers by
non-U.S. counterparties would be limited. To the extent that adverse effects on risk
management, market liquidity, and U.S. jobs flow from market fragmentation, the Commission
does not believe these effects should be significant, given the limited fragmentation that will
likely arise as a result of the rule.
5.

Amendments to Rule 908(b)

Rule 908(b) clarifies the types of persons that can incur duties under Regulation SBSR.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed to amend
Rule 908(b) by adding platforms and registered clearing agencies to the list of persons that might
incur obligations under Regulation SBSR. 907 The Commission has adopted these changes to
Rule 908(b), as discussed in Section IX(F)(1), supra.
The Commission also is adopting new Rule 908(b)(5) to include a non-U.S. person that,
in connection with such person’s security-based swap dealing activity, arranged, negotiated, or
executed a security-based swap using U.S. personnel. Because existing Rule 908(b)(2) covers a
non-U.S. person that is registered as a security-based swap dealer, the effect of new Rule
908(b)(5) is to cover a foreign dealing entity that engages in ANE activity but that does not meet
the de minimis threshold and thus would not have to register as a security-based swap dealer.
The costs incurred by an unregistered non-U.S. person that falls under Rule 908(b)(5)
include the costs of setting up reporting infrastructure and compliance systems, which have been
discussed in connection with the adoption of new Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) and (3). 908 Once an
unregistered non-U.S. person’s reporting infrastructure and compliance systems are in place, the
907

341

marginal cost of reporting an individual transaction would be minimal 909 when compared to the
costs of putting those systems in place and maintaining them over time. 910
6.

Other Conforming Amendments

As discussed in Section V(A), supra, the Commission today is adopting amendments to
Rule 900(u) to expand the definition of “participant” to include platforms, registered clearing
agencies that are required to report alpha dispositions pursuant to new Rule 901(e)(1)(ii), and
registered broker-dealers that incur the duty to report security-based swap transactions pursuant
to new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4).
Existing Rule 906(b) generally requires a participant of a registered SDR to provide the
identity of its ultimate parent and any affiliates that also are participants of that registered SDR.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed to amend
Rule 906(b) to except platforms and registered clearing agencies from this requirement. In the
U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission further proposed to amend Rule 906(b) to except from
this requirement a registered broker-dealer that becomes a participant solely as a result of making
a report to satisfy an obligation under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). The Commission also proposed
similar amendments to existing Rule 907(a)(6), which requires a registered SDR to have policies
and procedures for periodically obtaining from each participant information that identifies the
participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any participant(s) with which the participant is affiliated, to
avoid extending these policies and procedures to cover platforms, registered clearing agencies,
and registered broker-dealers (assuming that they are not counterparties to security-based swap
909

See infra Section XII(B)(1) (discussing the costs incurred by unregistered non-U.S.
persons to assess whether they engage in ANE transactions and thus could incur reporting
duties under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)).

910

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14702.

342

transactions). For the reasons discussed above, 911 the Commission is adopting these
amendments. Accordingly, platforms, registered clearing agencies, and registered broker-dealers
(assuming they are not counterparties to security-based swap transactions) will not incur costs to
report ultimate parent and affiliate information and, registered SDRs will not incur costs to
extend the scope of their policies and procedures.
Existing Rule 906(c) requires certain participants of a registered SDR to establish,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that
the participant complies with any obligations to report information to a registered SDR in a
manner consistent with Regulation SBSR. Rule 906(c) also requires participants covered by the
rule to review and update their policies and procedures at least annually. In the Regulation
SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission proposed to amend Rule 906(c) by
extending this requirement to platforms and registered clearing agencies. In the U.S. Activity
Proposal, the Commission proposed to amend Rule 906(c) by extending this requirement to a
registered broker-dealer that incurs reporting obligations solely because it effects transactions
between two unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed Rule 908(b)(5). In
this release, the Commission is adopting the amendments to Rule 906(c) as proposed.
The Commission continues to estimate that the cost associated with establishing such
policies and procedures, for each covered participant, will be approximately $58,000 and the cost
associated with annual updates will be approximately $34,000. 912 Accordingly, the Commission
estimates that the initial aggregate annual cost associated with the amendments to Rule 906(c)
911

See supra Sections V (excepting platforms and registered clearing agencies from Rule
906(b)) and IX (excepting registered broker-dealers from Rule 906(b) if they become
participants solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4)).

912

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14716.

343

will be approximately $3,128,000, which corresponds to $92,000 per covered participant. 913 The
Commission further estimates that the ongoing aggregate annual cost associated with the
amendment Rule 906(c) will be approximately $1,156,000, 914 which corresponds to $34,000 per
covered participant. The Commission believes that the costs imposed on participants by these
amendments are necessary because written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed
to ensure that covered participants comply with any obligations to report information to a
registered SDR in a manner consistent with Regulation SBSR will enhance the overall reliability
of security-based swap transaction data reported to registered SDRs.
Finally, existing Rule 901(d)(9) requires the reporting, if applicable, of the platform ID
for a platform on which a security-based swap was executed. In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the
Commission proposed to amend Rule 901(d)(9) to require the reporting, if applicable, of the
broker ID of a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) that is required by Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) to report a security-based swap effected by or through the registered brokerdealer. 915 As discussed above, the Commission has adopted the requirements that the registered
broker-dealer effecting the transaction report the transaction.
As discussed in Section XII(A)(1)(d), supra, the Commission estimates that a maximum
of 20 registered broker-dealers, excluding registered SB SEFs, will incur a reporting duty and
913

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [($58,000 + $34,000) × 34
covered participants (10 platforms + 4 registered clearing agencies + 20 registered
broker-dealers)] = $3,128,000, or approximately $92,000 per covered participant.

914

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [$34,000 × 34 covered
participants (10 platforms + 4 registered clearing agencies + 20 registered brokerdealers)] = $1,156,000, or approximately $34,000 per covered participant.

915

As described above, final Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) requires a registered broker-dealer to
report the information in Rules 901(c) and 901(d) for any transaction between two
unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within Rule 908(b)(5) where the
transaction is effected by or through the registered broker-dealer.

344

together will report 540 security-based swaps per year. These 20 registered broker-dealers are
subject to the amendment to Rule 901(d)(9) adopted herein. To comply with the amendment, a
registered broker-dealer likely will build and maintain its reporting infrastructure to include the
functionality to capture and incorporate its broker ID into transaction reports. The Commission
believes that the cost of creating this functionality is part of the start-up cost of building the
broker-dealer’s reporting infrastructure, 916 while the cost of maintaining this functionality is part
of the annual ongoing cost of the broker-dealer’s reporting infrastructure. 917

Discussion of Comments Received

The Commission received a number of comments relating to its analysis of the
programmatic costs and benefits associated with the amendments described above.
One commenter stated that the Commission lacks complete data to estimate the number
of non-U.S. persons that engage in ANE transactions or the number of registered broker-dealers
that intermediate security-based swap transactions, and recommended that the Commission
collect a more complete set of data to more precisely estimate the number of non-U.S. persons
that would be affected by the proposed rules. The commenter further argued that the lack of
complete data made it difficult for the Commission to estimate the market impact, costs, and
benefits associated with amendments that apply Regulation SBSR to ANE transactions and
transactions intermediated by registered broker-dealers. 918

916

See supra Section XII(A)(1)(d), where the Commission estimates the total start-up cost to
be $521,500 per registered broker-dealer and $10,430,000 in aggregate, across all
registered broker-dealers.

917

See supra Section XII(A)(1)(d), where the Commission estimates the ongoing cost per
year to be $316,500 per registered broker-dealer, and $6,330,000 for all registered
broker-dealers.

918

See ISDA I at 3, 7. This commenter also argued that the data available to the
Commission at the time of the proposal would not have allowed the Commission to
345

The Commission acknowledges that there are limitations in the TIW data but believes
that the data do allow the Commission to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the number of nonU.S. persons affected by the newly adopted rules. In Section II(A)(4)(d), supra, the Commission
notes that it identified four foreign dealing entities that likely engaged in ANE activity in 2015
but, based on the level of relevant activity, would be unlikely to register as security-based swap
dealers. Based on the analysis, the Commission estimates that four unregistered foreign dealing
entities will engage in ANE activity and thus be affected by the newly adopted rules. 919 In
Section XII(A)(1)(d), supra, the Commission estimates the compliance costs associated with
Rule 901 for these four unregistered foreign dealing entities. 920 As discussed earlier, these
programmatic costs are part of the programmatic costs associated with Rule 901 that were
accounted for in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. While data limitations do not allow
the quantification of the benefits associated with the amendments that apply Regulation SBSR to
ANE transactions and transactions intermediated by registered broker-dealers, the Commission
discusses these benefits qualitatively in Section XIII(H), infra.

precisely estimate, among other things, the number of non-U.S. persons that carry out
dealing activity using personnel in the United States. See id. at 7.
919

Because of the relatively low volume of transaction activity of these four entities during
2015 and the existence of affiliations with other entities expected to register as securitybased swap dealers, the Commission believes, even after accounting for growth in the
security-based swap market and acknowledging the limitations of the transaction data
available for analysis, four is a reasonable estimate of the number of unregistered dealing
entities likely to incur assessment costs as a result of new Rule 908(b)(5).

920

The initial aggregate annual costs associated with Rule 901 will be approximately
$3,668,000, which corresponds to approximately $524,000 per unregistered entity. The
Commission estimates that the ongoing aggregate annual costs on an unregistered entity
associated with Rule 901 will be approximately $2,233,000, which corresponds to
approximately $319,000 per unregistered entity.

346

B.

Assessment Costs of Unregistered Entities Related to ANE Transactions
1.

Assessment Costs Of Foreign Dealing Entities Engaging in ANE
Transactions

New Rule 908(b)(5) provides that an unregistered foreign dealing entity that engages in
ANE transactions may incur reporting duties under Regulation SBSR, and the amendments to
Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E) adopted herein provide that such foreign dealing entities will be the
reporting side in certain cases. Thus, unregistered foreign dealing entities will incur costs to
assess whether they engage in ANE transactions and, if so, whether they will incur reporting
duties under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E). The Commission estimates that four unregistered foreign
dealing entities will incur such assessment costs. The four unregistered foreign dealing entities
are in addition to the 20 additional non-U.S. persons that the Commission estimated would incur
assessment costs as a result of the rules finalized in the U.S. Activity Adopting Release. 921 In
what follows, the Commission discusses costs that these four unregistered foreign dealing
entities might incur to assess whether they engage in ANE transactions.
In the U.S. Activity Adopting Release, the Commission discussed the approaches that
market participants may use to determine which transactions involve relevant activity involving
U.S. personnel and thus would apply toward dealer de minimis thresholds. The Commission
notes that, as an initial matter, a foreign dealing entity likely will review its current dealing
operations to ascertain whether it has U.S. personnel that could be used to arrange, negotiate, or
execute security-based swaps. The Commission believes that such a determination will not
result in significant costs because it requires only that the foreign dealing entity check for the
921

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8627. This is calculated as 134 non-U.S.
persons likely to incur assessment costs to determine the level of ANE activity, less the
114 persons that are likely to incur assessment costs associated with the dealer de
minimis rules adopted in the Cross-Border Adopting Release.

347

existence of U.S. personnel. If the foreign dealing entity does not have U.S. personnel that could
be used to arrange, negotiate, or execute security-based swaps, then the foreign dealing entity’s
assessment of whether it has engaged in ANE activity ends.
If, based on the review described above, the foreign dealing entity determines that it has
U.S. personnel that could be used to arrange, negotiate, or execute security-based swaps, then the
foreign dealing entity could choose between a number of alternative means of compliance. 922
One alternative would be for the entity to implement systems to check the location of personnel
used in arranging, negotiating, or executing individual security-based swap transactions. The
Commission believes that the cost of developing and modifying systems to track the location of
persons with dealing activity will be substantially similar to the costs of such systems discussed
in the U.S. Activity Adopting Release, or $410,000 for the average foreign dealing entity. To the
extent that non-U.S. persons already employ systems that track the location of persons with
dealing activity, the costs of modifying such IT systems may be lower than the Commission’s
estimate. 923 In addition to the development or modification of such systems, the Commission
estimates that entities would incur the cost of $6,500 per location per year on an ongoing basis
for training, compliance, and verification costs. 924 Second, the foreign dealing entity could
choose to restrict personnel located in a U.S. branch or office from engaging in ANE activity in
connection with the entity’s dealing activity with non-U.S. counterparties. Such a restriction on
communication and staffing for purposes of avoiding certain Title VII requirements would

922

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8627-28.

923

See id. at 8627.

924

This cost is calculated as (internal cost, 90 hours × $50 per hour = $4,500) + (consulting
costs, 10 hours × $200 per hour = $2,000) = a total cost of $6,500 per location per year.
See also U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8627.

348

reduce the costs of assessing the location of personnel involved in ANE activity and could
remove entirely the need to implement systems to track the activities of U.S. personnel on a pertransaction basis. The Commission estimates that the costs of establishing policies and
procedures to restrict communication between personnel located in the United States employed
by non-U.S. persons (or their agents) and other personnel involved in dealing activity would be
approximately $28,300 for each entity that chooses this approach. 925
Finally, a foreign dealing entity could avoid assessing transactions on a per-transaction
basis by choosing to report all transactions to a registered SDR, regardless of the location of
personnel engaged in ANE activity. Such an alternative may be reasonable for foreign dealing
entities that expect few transactions involving foreign counterparties to be arranged, negotiated,
or executed by personnel located outside the United States, such as foreign dealing entities that
primarily transact in security-based swaps on U.S. reference entities or securities, and generally
rely on personnel located in the United States to perform market-facing activities. 926
The Commission believes that the same principles apply to foreign dealing entities that
rely on agents to arrange, negotiate, or execute security-based swaps on their behalf. The
Commission anticipates that foreign dealing entities may employ any of the strategies above to
comply with the final rules through the choice of their agents. For example, a foreign dealing
entity may choose an agent that does not use U.S.-based personnel for arranging, negotiating, or
executing security-based swap transactions with non-U.S. counterparties to avoid assessment
costs. The Commission also anticipates that a foreign dealing entity might rely on
representations from its agents about whether transactions conducted on its behalf involved
925

See id. at 8628.

926

See id.

349

relevant dealing activity by personnel from a location in the United States. This could occur on a
transaction-by-transaction basis, or, if the agent uses personnel located in the United States in all
or none of its transactions, it could choose to make a representation about the entirety of the
agent’s business.
As in the U.S. Activity Adopting Release, the Commission believes that a foreign dealing
entity will inform its choice between the alternative compliance strategies with a one-time
review of its security-based swap business lines. This review likely will encompass both
employees of the foreign dealing entity as well as employees of agents used by the foreign
dealing entity, and identify whether these personnel are involved in arranging, negotiating, or
executing security-based swaps. The information gathered as a result of this review will allow
the foreign dealing entity to assess the revenues that it expects to flow from transaction activity
performed by U.S. personnel. This information also will help these market participants form
preliminary estimates about the costs associated with various alternative compliance strategies,
including the trade-by-trade analysis outlined above. This initial review may be followed with
reassessment at regular intervals or subsequent to major changes in the market participant’s
security-based swap business, such as acquisition or divestiture of business units. The
Commission estimates that the per-entity initial costs of a review of business lines will be
approximately $104,000. Further, the Commission believes that periodic reassessment of
business lines will cost, on average, $52,000 per year, per entity. 927

927

Assessment Costs Of Unregistered U.S. Persons Engaging in SecurityBased Swaps Against Foreign Entities

See id. at n. 283.

350

New Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) and 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3) create reporting duties for
unregistered U.S. persons that transact security-based swaps with unregistered entities. Under
Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2), in a transaction between an unregistered U.S. person and an
unregistered foreign dealing entity that is engaging in ANE activity, the sides would be required
to select the reporting side. Under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3), in a transaction between an
unregistered U.S. person and an unregistered non-U.S. person that is not engaging in ANE
activity, the unregistered U.S. person is the reporting side. Because of these reporting duties, an
unregistered U.S. person could incur costs to assess whether its foreign counterparty in a
security-based swap transaction is an unregistered foreign dealing entity engaging in ANE
activity.
The Commission believes that unregistered U.S. persons likely will seek to avoid the
costs of assessing whether a foreign counterparty is engaging in ANE activity by choosing to
transact only with registered entities for which assessment is not required. 928 The incentive of
unregistered U.S. persons to avoid transacting with unregistered foreign counterparties is
strengthened by the fact that there will be very few unregistered foreign dealing entities that
might engage in ANE activities, and that they likely will participate in a relatively small number
of security-based swap transactions in the U.S. market. As noted earlier, 929 the Commission
estimates that only four foreign dealing entities will remain below the de minimis threshold and
thus not have to register as security-based swap dealers. 930 Furthermore, to the extent that the

928

See infra Section XIII(H)(1) (discussing the potential competitive effects associated with
assessments for ANE activity by unregistered U.S. persons).

929

See supra note 885 and accompanying text.

930

For foreign dealing entities that register with the Commission as security-based swap
dealers, reporting duties stem from their registration status, not from the presence of any
351

usage of U.S. personnel by such a foreign dealing entity to engage in ANE activity is a question
for a unregistered U.S. person who is a potential counterparty, the foreign dealing entity has an
incentive to readily provide this information to the unregistered U.S. person—thereby obviating
the need for the U.S. person to conduct an assessment—and to agree to be the reporting side. If
the foreign dealing entity did not agree to be the reporting side, the unregistered U.S. person
would have the option of transacting with one of several registered security-based swap dealers,
both U.S. and foreign, for which the U.S. counterparty would not have to assess for ANE activity
or negotiate with the other side about the reporting duty, because the duty would fall to the
registered security-based swap dealer pursuant to existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(B). Therefore, the
Commission believes that any assessment costs incurred by unregistered U.S. persons will be
limited.
3.

Assessment Costs Associated with Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4)

Under new Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), respondent broker-dealers (including SB SEFs) will
be required to report security-based swap transactions that they intermediate if neither side incurs
the duty to report (i.e., neither side includes a U.S. person, a registered security-based swap
dealer, a registered major security-based swap participant, or a non-U.S. person engaging in an
ANE transaction). As a result, respondent broker-dealers will incur certain costs to assess the
circumstances in which they incur the duty to report transactions because neither side incurs the
duty. Any such assessment costs are reflected in the cost estimates for the policies and
procedures that respondent broker-dealers are required to establish, maintain, and enforce under

ANE activity. Therefore, for these entities, no assessment will be needed to know
whether a reporting duty arises from a particular transaction.

352

Rule 906(c). 931 The programmatic costs estimated by the Commission for the amendment to
Rule 906(c) already incorporate the cost incurred by respondent broker-dealers when assessing
whether they have a duty to report security-based swap transactions. Therefore, respondent
broker-dealers will not incur any additional costs beyond the programmatic cost for the
amendment to Rule 906(c) adopted herein. 932

Discussion of Comments Received

The Commission received a number of comments relating to its analysis of the
assessment costs associated with the proposed amendments to Rules 901 and 908 included in the
U.S. Activity Proposal. One commenter pointed out that the Commission’s analysis of
assessment costs was incomplete because the analysis did not account for the additional work
that market participants might undertake to meet reporting requirements during the Interim
Period (i.e., the period beginning on Compliance Date 1 but before the SBS entities registration
compliance date). 933 According to the commenter, this additional work and the associated cost
could be avoided if the Commission scheduled Compliance Date 1 after the SBS entities
registration compliance date. 934 The same commenter also suggested that the Commission’s cost
analysis failed to account for the possibility that some of the documentation and processes

931

See supra Section XII(A)(3) (discussing the costs of amended Rule 906(c)).

932

See id.

933

See ISDA II at 11 (stating that the additional work involves efforts to “exchange
transaction level party data, develop a new approach to use the tie-breaker logic, enter
into reporting side agreements and delegation agreements, and build dual sets of
reporting side logic to develop an organized industry approach to comply with SBSR”);

market participants would spend to develop and implement interim reporting side
agreements, and the “cost that market infrastructure providers would incur to duplicate
efforts in order to support both pre- and post-registration reporting side approaches”).

developed by market participants for Interim Period reporting would become obsolete after
security-based swap dealers register with the Commission. 935
As discussed in Section X(C), supra, the Commission acknowledges the commenters’
concerns that requiring compliance with Regulation SBSR before the SBS entities registration
compliance date would have raised numerous challenges, and that addressing these challenges
would have necessitated time and investment to create interim solutions that might not have been
useful after the SBS entities registration compliance date. Therefore, the Commission has
determined that market participants will not be required to comply with Regulation SBSR until
after the SBS entities registration compliance date.
XIII. Economic Effects and Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act 936 requires the Commission, whenever it engages in
rulemaking and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether
the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. In addition, Section
23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act 937 requires the Commission, when making rules under the
Exchange Act, to consider the impact of such rules on competition. Section 23(a)(2) also
prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not
necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.
The Commission believes that the amendments to Regulation SBSR adopted herein will
result in further progress towards providing a means for the Commission and other relevant

authorities to gain a better understanding of the aggregate risk exposures and trading behaviors
of participants in the security-based swap market; facilitate public dissemination of securitybased swap transaction information, thus promoting price discovery and competition by
improving the level of information to all market participants; and improve risk management by
security-based swap counterparties. 938
The economic effects of these amendments on firms that provide infrastructure services
to security-based swap counterparties and the security-based swap market generally are
discussed in detail below. The Commission also considered the effects that these amendments
might have on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The Commission believes that its
action today is likely to affect competition among firms that provide security-based swap
infrastructure services to market participants and affect efficiency as a result of the way that
these amendments allocate regulatory burdens. The effects of these amendments on capital
formation are likely to be indirect and will result from the way in which these amendments affect
the behavior of registered clearing agencies, counterparties to security-based swaps, and
registered SDRs. To the extent that these amendments promote more efficient provision of
security-based swap market infrastructure services, there would be lower transactions costs, 939
which would free resources for investment and capital formation.
This analysis has been informed by the relationships among regulation, competition, and
market power discussed in Section II(B), supra. An environment in which there is limited
competition in SDR services could impose costs on the security-based swap market, including
938

See 80 FR at 14779.

939

These transactions costs would include both implicit and explicit costs. Implicit
transactions costs are the spread between transaction prices and the fundamental value of
the assets being traded. Explicit transactions costs, by contrast, are commissions and
other fees paid by counterparties for effecting transactions in the market.

355

higher prices or lower quality services from SDRs. For example, a registered SDR that faces few
or no competitors could seek to impose higher prices, because persons with a duty to report
security-based swaps under Regulation SBSR might not be able to identify a competing SDR
that offers prices close enough to marginal cost to make changing service providers efficient.
Further, if consumers of SDR services have few alternative suppliers from which to choose,
SDRs would have fewer incentives to produce more efficient SDR processes and services. This
combination of higher prices for SDR services and/or less efficient SDR services could reduce
security-based swap transaction activity undertaken by market participants to hedge assets that
have cash flows that are related to the cash flows of security-based swaps. A reduction in
hedging activity through security-based swaps could reduce the values of assets held by market
participants and in turn result in welfare losses for these market participants.
However, there could be some offsetting benefit to limited competition in the market for
SDR services for both regulatory authorities and the public. A small set of registered SDRs
could make it simpler for the Commission and other relevant authorities to build a complete
picture of transaction activity and outstanding risk exposures in the security-based swap market,
and could limit the need for market observers to aggregate the security-based swap transaction
data disseminated by multiple SDRs before using it as an input to economic decisions.
The Commission also considered the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation stemming from the amendments to Rules 901 and 908 that will subject additional
cross-border security-based swaps to regulatory reporting and public dissemination, and assign
the duty to report those cross-border transactions. The adopted amendments might affect the
security-based swap market in a number of ways, many of which are difficult to quantify. In
particular, a number of the potential effects that the Commission discusses below are related to

356

price efficiency, liquidity, and risk sharing. These effects are difficult to quantity for a number
of reasons. First, in many cases the effects are contingent upon strategic responses of market
participants. For instance, the Commission notes in Section XIII(H)(2), infra, that under the
adopted approach non-U.S. persons may choose to relocate personnel, making it difficult for
U.S. counterparties to access liquidity in security-based swaps. The magnitude of these effects
on liquidity and on risk sharing depend upon a number of factors that the Commission cannot
estimate, including the likelihood of relocation, the availability of substitute liquidity suppliers,
and the availability of substitute hedging assets. Therefore, much of the discussion below is
qualitative in nature, although the Commission tries to describe, where possible, the direction of
these effects.
Not only can some of these effects be difficult to quantify, but there are many cases
where a rule could have two opposing effects, making it difficult to estimate a net impact on
efficiency, competition, or capital formation. For example, in the discussion of the net effect of
certain amendments to Regulation SBSR on efficiency, the Commission expects that post-trade
transparency may have a positive effect on price efficiency, while it could negatively affect
liquidity by providing incentives for non-U.S. persons to avoid contact with U.S. persons. The
magnitude of these two opposing effects will depend on factors such as the sensitivity of traders
to information about order flow, the impact of public dissemination of transaction information on
the execution costs of large orders, and the ease with which non-U.S. persons can find substitutes
that avoid contact with U.S. personnel. Each of these factors is difficult to quantify individually,
which makes the net impact on efficiency equally difficult to quantify.
A.

Reporting of Clearing Transactions

357

New Rule 901(a)(2)(i) assigns the duty to report a security-based swap that has a
registered clearing agency as a direct counterparty to that registered clearing agency. Existing
Rule 901(a) does not assign reporting obligations for any clearing transactions; thus, in the
absence of Rule 901(a)(2)(i), clearing transactions would not be subject to any regulatory
reporting requirement. Without a requirement for clearing transactions to be reported to a
registered SDR, the Commission and other relevant authorities would have only limited ability to
carry out market oversight functions. For example, while the Commission could access
transaction reports of alphas and uncleared transactions, the Commission would not be able to
obtain from registered SDRs information about the open security-based swap positions of the
relevant counterparties after alpha transactions are cleared. Requiring that clearing transactions
be reported to registered SDRs and delineating reporting responsibilities for these transactions
are particularly important given the level of voluntary clearing activity in the market as well as
the mandatory clearing determinations that will be required under Title VII. 940
The Commission believes that, because a registered clearing agency creates the clearing
transactions to which it is a counterparty, the registered clearing agency is in the best position to
provide complete and accurate information for the clearing transactions resulting from the
security-based swaps that it clears. 941 If the Commission assigned the reporting obligation for
clearing transactions to a person who lacked direct access to the information required to be
reported, that person would be obligated to obtain the required information from the clearing
agency or another party who had access to the information to discharge its reporting obligation.
940

See General Policy on Sequencing, 77 FR at 35636.

941

Although registered clearing agencies might pass on the costs associated with reporting
clearing transactions, at least in part, to their non-reporting counterparties, the costs that
are passed on to non-reporting parties are likely to be lower than the costs that the nonreporting parties would face if they had direct responsibility to report these transactions.

358

Thus, assigning reporting obligations to the non-clearing-agency side could increase the number
of reporting steps, thereby increasing the possibility of discrepancy, error, or delay in the
reporting process. Placing the reporting duty on the non-clearing-agency side could also reduce
data reliability if the data has to be reconfigured to be acceptable by the SDR. 942 Inaccurate or
delayed reporting of clearing transactions would negatively impact the ability of the Commission
and other relevant authorities to understand, aggregate, and act on the transaction information.
New Rule 901(a)(2)(i) also allows the registered clearing agency that is required to report
all clearing transactions to which it is a counterparty to select the registered SDR to which to
report. As noted in Section II(B), supra, because many of the infrastructure requirements for
entrant SDRs are shared by registered clearing agencies, registered clearing agencies might
pursue vertical integration into the market for SDR services at a lower cost relative to potential
entrants from unrelated markets. If the costs of reporting to affiliated SDRs are lower than the
costs of reporting to unaffiliated SDRs, registered clearing agencies will likely choose to report
clearing transactions to an affiliated SDR. Because a registered clearing agency is likely to be
involved in developing an affiliated SDR’s systems, the clearing agency will likely avoid costs
related to translating or reformatting data due to incompatibilities between data reporting by the
registered clearing agency and data intake by the SDR. To the extent that a clearing agency
incurs a lower cost when connecting to an affiliated SDR, the cost of reporting clearing
transactions to an affiliated SDR is likely to be lower than the cost of reporting to an independent
SDR. While both a clearing-agency-affiliated SDR and an independent SDR could lower their
average costs by adding clearing transactions to their existing volume of reported transactions,
only the clearing agency can reduce the cost of connecting to its affiliated SDR.
942

See supra Section III(B).

359

Vertical integration of security-based swap clearing and SDR services could be beneficial
to other market participants if they ultimately share in these efficiency gains. For example,
efficiency gains due to straight-through processing from execution to reporting could lower
transactions costs for market participants and reduce the likelihood of data discrepancies and
delays. Even if registered clearing agencies do not enter the market for SDR services, the
potential for them to pursue a vertical integration strategy could motivate independent SDRs to
offer more competitive service models.
The Commission is aware of the potential costs of allowing registered clearing agencies
to select the SDR to which they report. If Rule 901(a)(2)(i) encourages the formation of
clearing-agency-affiliated SDRs that would not otherwise emerge, the aggregate number of
registered SDRs might reflect an inefficient level of service provision. Once an entity has
established the functionality to offer clearing and central counterparty services for security-based
swaps, only marginal additional investments would likely be needed to offer SDR services. The
ease with which registered clearing agencies set up affiliated SDRs could affect how well all
SDRs exploit economies of scale. As noted in Section II(B)(2), supra, in the market for SDR
services, economies of scale arise from the ability to amortize the fixed costs associated with
infrastructure over a large volume of transactions. With a fixed volume of reportable
transactions, exploitation of economies of scale by each SDR becomes more limited as the
number of SDRs increases. Thus, the entry of clearing-agency-affiliated SDRs could indicate
that each SDR benefits from an affiliation with a clearing agency and might not, in aggregate,
result in the provision of transaction reporting services at a lower per-transaction cost than if
there were fewer SDRs. Inefficiencies could result if the Commission and the public had to
receive and process security-based swap transaction data from a larger number of registered

360

SDRs. Connecting to a larger number of SDRs and merging transaction data with potentially
different data formats could be costly and difficult.
The potential for efficiency gains through vertical integration of clearing agencies and
SDRs could foreclose entry into the market for SDR services except by firms that are already
present in the market for clearing agency services. Registered clearing agencies are more likely
to benefit from efficiencies in shared infrastructure than independent SDRs, given that it is more
difficult for an SDR to enter the market for clearing services than for a clearing agency to enter
the market for SDR services. 943 Moreover, to the extent that an affiliated SDR is not as costeffective as a competing independent SDR, a registered clearing agency could subsidize the
operation of its affiliate SDR to provide a competitive advantage in its cost structure over
independent SDRs. Hence, providing a registered clearing agency with the discretion to select
the registered SDR could provide a competitive advantage for clearing-agency-affiliated SDRs
relative to independent SDRs. If a registered clearing agency subsidizes its affiliated SDR using
revenue generated from its clearing business, the clearing agency’s members would indirectly
bear some of the costs of operating the affiliated SDR. Such an allocation of SDR cost to
clearing members could be inefficient because the benefits of reporting transactions to an SDR
(i.e., the benefits of regulatory reporting and public dissemination) accrue to market participants
generally, and not just to clearing members.

943

A registered clearing agency, particularly one that acts as a central counterparty for
security-based swaps, needs significant financial resources to ensure that it can absorb
losses from clearing member defaults, while SDRs do not. Similarly, a registered
clearing agency requires significant risk management expertise that an SDR does not.
Thus, the barriers to entry into the clearing agency market are higher than the barriers to
entry into the SDR market.

361

As a result of new Rule 901(a)(2)(i), clearing members might find that the records of
their security-based swap transactions are fragmented across multiple registered SDRs (i.e.,
alpha SDRs and, in addition, clearing-agency-affiliated SDRs to which registered clearing
agencies report clearing transactions). The Commission does not believe, however, that
fragmentation in the storage of transaction reports would create significant difficulties or
inefficiencies for a clearing member that wishes to consolidate all its security-based swap
transaction reports at a chosen SDR to facilitate activities such as risk management. Such a
clearing member might contract with a registered clearing agency, for a fee, to transmit data for
its clearing transactions to an SDR of the clearing member’s choice as a duplicate report. This
would allow the registered clearing agency to satisfy its obligations while permitting the clearing
member to establish and maintain access to a consolidated record of all of its security-based
swap transactions in a single SDR. However, in this case, the registered clearing agency could
choose a fee schedule that encourages the clearing member to report its uncleared bilateral
transactions to the affiliated SDR. Such a fee schedule might involve the clearing agency
offering to terminate alpha transactions reported to its affiliate SDR for a lower price than alpha
transactions to an independent SDR.
As discussed in Section XII(B)(1)(a), supra, the Commission has estimated the annual
and on-going costs associated with requiring registered clearing agencies to establish
connections to registered SDRs. The Commission believes that, for a given registered clearing
agency, these costs are likely to be lower for a connection to an affiliated SDR than to an
independent SDR. Because the registered clearing agency is likely to have been involved in
developing its affiliated SDR’s systems, the clearing agency can likely avoid costs related to
translating or reformatting data due to incompatibilities between the clearing agency’s data

362

format and the data format required by the SDR. The reporting of clearing transactions by
registered clearing agencies to their affiliated SDRs could promote efficiency in two ways. First,
a registered clearing agency would incur lower connection costs when reporting to an affiliated
SDR. Second, the quality of transaction data available to the Commission could be improved to
the extent that the Commission gains access to marginally more reliable transaction data because
reporting by a registered clearing agency to an affiliated SDR avoids introducing errors or other
data discrepancies that otherwise could occur when translating or reformatting transaction data
for submission to an independent SDR.
B.

Alternative Approaches to Reporting Clearing Transactions

As part of the economic analysis of the amendments adopted herein, the Commission has
considered the market power that providers of security-based swap market infrastructure might
be able to exercise in pricing the services that they offer and the possibility that these
infrastructures could shift the costs created by regulatory burdens onto their customers. The
Commission included these economic considerations in its evaluation of alternative approaches
to assigning reporting obligations for clearing transactions. As outlined above, the Commission
considered four alternatives for assigning these reporting obligations as well as comments
received related to these alternatives. The following section discusses the likely economic
effects of these alternatives, including their likely impacts on efficiency, competition, and,
indirectly, capital formation.
1.

Alternative 1

The first alternative would be to apply the reporting hierarchy in existing Rule
901(a)(2)(ii) to clearing transactions. Under Alternative 1, a counterparty to a clearing
transaction other than the clearing agency, such as a registered security-based swap dealer,

363

would have the duty to report the clearing transaction. As discussed above, assigning reporting
obligations to the non-clearing-agency side could increase the number of reporting steps, thereby
increasing the possibility of discrepancy, error, or delay in the reporting process. Placing the
reporting duty on the non-clearing-agency side also could reduce data reliability if the data has to
be reconfigured to be acceptable by the SDR. 944
The Commission continues to believe that it is unlikely that non-clearing-agency
counterparties would be subject to significant additional costs associated with building
infrastructure to support regulatory reporting for clearing transactions under this alternative, for
two reasons. 945 First, to the extent that market participants that submit security-based swaps to
clearing also engage in uncleared transactions and sit atop the reporting hierarchy, they likely
already have the required infrastructure in place to support regulatory reporting of alphas and
uncleared transactions. The Commission anticipates that, as a result, there might be only
marginal additional costs for reporting sides to report clearing transactions, if the Commission
selected Alternative 1. Moreover, the Commission anticipates that, once infrastructure is built,
the per-transaction cost of data transmission would not vary substantially between registered
clearing agencies, who are required to report under new Rule 901(a)(2)(i), and reporting sides,
who would be required to report under Alternative 1.
Second, non-clearing agency counterparties, particularly those who engage solely in
cleared trades or who are not high in the reporting hierarchy, could enter into an agreement under
which the registered clearing agency would submit the information to a registered SDR on their
behalf. This service could be bundled as part of the other clearing services purchased, and would
944

See supra Section III(B).

945

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14781.

364

result in an outcome substantially similar to giving the registered clearing agency the duty to
report. One difference, however, is that the customer of the registered clearing agency could,
under this alternative, request that the information be submitted to a registered SDR unaffiliated
with the registered clearing agency, a choice that, under the adopted approach, is at the discretion
of the registered clearing agency. Nevertheless, the Commission believes that, to the extent that
it is economically efficient for the registered clearing agency to report the details of cleared
transactions on behalf of its counterparties, Alternative 1 would likely result in ongoing costs of
data transmission for market participants and infrastructure providers that are, in the aggregate,
similar to the Commission’s approach in Rule 901(a)(2)(i).
If registered clearing agencies reporting to registered SDRs on behalf of counterparties is
not available under Alternative 1, then some counterparties would be required to build
infrastructure to support regulatory reporting for clearing transactions. Analysis of single-name
CDS transactions in 2015 in which a clearing agency was a direct counterparty shows
approximately 54 market participants that are not likely to register as security-based swap
dealers or major security-based swap participants, and therefore might be required to build
infrastructure to support regulatory reporting for clearing transactions in order to maintain
current trading practices in the security-based swap market. 946 One commenter asserted that the

946

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14781-82. To arrive at
this estimate, the Commission staff used single-name CDS transaction data for 2015 to
produce a list of all direct counterparties to a clearing agency and removed those persons
likely to register as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap
participants. The list of likely registrants was constructed using the methodology
described in the Cross-Border Adopting Release. See 79 FR at 47296, n. 150 (describing
the methodology employed by the Commission to estimate the number of potential
security-based swap dealers); id. at 47297, n. 153 (describing the methodology employed
by the Commission to estimate the number of potential major security-based swap
participants).

365

Commission did not adequately address the role of third parties that could perform reporting
duties on behalf of reporting parties. 947 As noted in Section III(B), supra, Regulation SBSR
permits the use of agents to carry out reporting duties and the Commission expects that a market
participant that would be assigned the reporting obligation for clearing transactions under
Alternative 1 would contract with an agent if it expects use of an agent to be less costly than
carrying out the reporting obligation itself. As a result, the ability to use agents could further
reduce costs to market participants under Alternative 1.
Under Alternative 1, non-clearing-agency counterparties would have the ability to choose
which registered SDR receives their reports. Because non-clearing-agency counterparties would
have this choice, registered SDRs under the alternative approach might have additional incentive
to provide high levels of service to attract this reporting business by, for example, providing such
counterparties with convenient access to reports submitted to the registered SDR or by
supporting the counterparties’ efforts at data validation and error correction. Additionally,
ensuring that these counterparties have discretion over which registered SDR receives the
transaction data could allow these counterparties to consolidate their security-based swap
transactions into a single SDR for record-keeping purposes or for operational reasons, though
only to the extent that they can identify a registered SDR that accepts reports for all relevant
asset classes.
In assessing Alternative 1, the Commission recognizes that registered clearing agencies
have a comparative advantage in processing and preparing data for reporting cleared transactions
to a registered SDR. Registered clearing agencies terminate alpha transactions, as well as create
beta and gamma transactions and all subsequent netting transactions, and so already possess all
947

See Markit Letter at 8.

366

of the relevant information to report these transaction events to a registered SDR. Moreover, the
volume of transactions at registered clearing agencies means that they can amortize the fixed
costs of establishing and maintaining connections to a registered SDR over a large quantity of
reportable activity, potentially allowing them to report transactions at a lower average cost per
transaction than many other market participants, particularly non-registered persons.
The Commission believes that, given this comparative advantage, applying to clearing
transactions the same reporting hierarchy that it has adopted for uncleared transactions would
result in a registered clearing agency reporting the transaction data to a registered SDR of a nonclearing-agency counterparty’s choice as a service to the non-clearing-agency counterparties to
its clearing transactions. In this respect, the entity that performs the actual reporting of clearing
transactions would likely be the same as with adopted Rule 901(a)(2)(i), which would assign this
duty to the registered clearing agency. The key difference under Alternative 1 is that the nonclearing-agency counterparty would generate this responsibility through private contract and
could terminate the agreement and assume the reporting responsibility, should it perceive the fee
or service terms as unreasonable. Such an agreement also could specify the registered SDR to
which the clearing agency should send transaction data on behalf of the non-clearing-agency
counterparty. The ability to terminate such an agreement could diminish the potential bargaining
power that the registered clearing agency would otherwise have if the registered clearing agency
were assigned the duty to report. Further, by allowing the non-clearing-agency counterparty to
choose between registered SDRs, such an agreement could promote competition between SDRs.
However, because the non-clearing-agency counterparty might still have to rely on
assistance from the clearing agency to satisfy the reporting obligations—particularly for any
subsequent clearing transactions resulting from netting and compression of multiple betas and

367

gammas—the reduction in clearing agency bargaining power might not be substantial. A
registered clearing agency that supplies this information and converts it into the format
prescribed by a non-clearing-agency counterparty’s chosen SDR so that the counterparty can
fulfill its reporting duty by submitting transaction data to a registered SDR of its choice could
still have significant bargaining power with respect to providing that information.
The Commission believes that the adopted rules are generally consistent with the
outcome under Alternative 1 in a number of key respects. First, under both approaches to
reporting—one in which the Commission assigns the reporting responsibility for clearing
transactions to registered clearing agencies, and the other in which the market allocates the
reporting responsibility in the same way— it is likely that registered clearing agencies will report
clearing transactions to their affiliated SDRs. 948 Under an approach in which the Commission
does not assign any reporting duties to registered clearing agencies, counterparties would likely
be assessed an explicit fee by registered clearing agencies for submitting reports on the
counterparties’ behalf. Under Rule 901(a)(2)(i), the fees associated with these services will
likely be part of the total fees associated with clearing security-based swaps.

948

Unless it preferred a particular registered SDR for operational reasons discussed above, a
non-clearing-agency counterparty to a clearing transaction would likely contract with the
clearing agency to report clearing transactions to the registered SDR that offers the
lowest price, most likely the clearing agency affiliate. As discussed in Section II(B)(1),
supra, a registered clearing agency and its affiliated SDR have greater control over the
reporting process relative to sending transaction data to an independent SDR. This
greater control lowers the cost of transmitting transaction data from the clearing agency
to its affiliated SDR relative to transmitting the same data to an independent SDR. The
lower cost potentially allows the affiliated SDR to charge the lowest price among
competing SDRs.

368

In light of comments received on its proposal, the Commission acknowledges caveats to
this analysis. 949 Under Alternative 1, a non-clearing agency counterparty may alter the
disposition of its clearing transaction data as a result of having the right to select the registered
SDR to which this information is submitted. In particular, a non-clearing agency counterparty
with the duty to report clearing transactions would compare the costs and benefits of contracting
with the clearing agency to fulfil reporting obligations on its behalf by reporting to an affiliated
SDR, 950 with the costs and benefits of alternative arrangements that would place the same data at
an independent SDR of its choice.
Second, under Alternative 1 and under the adopted approach, efficiency gains stemming
from consolidation of the reporting function within registered clearing agencies would be split
between such clearing agencies and security-based swap counterparties. The difference between
these two regulatory approaches turn on how these gains are split.
The Commission believes that Alternative 1 would not necessarily restrict the ability of
registered clearing agencies to exercise market power in ways that may allow them to capture the
bulk of any efficiency gains. 951 First, while a counterparty to a registered clearing agency could
contract with the clearing agency to receive the information about netting and compression
transactions that would enable re-transmission of the cleared transaction data to a registered
SDR, depending on the policies and procedures of the registered clearing agency, these data
might not be in the format that is required for submission to the counterparty’s SDR of choice.
949

See Markit Letter at 12. Although the commenter asserts the benefits of allowing nonclearing agency counterparties discretion over which registered SDR receives their data
in its assessment of Alternative 3, the Commission believes that this analysis applies
equally to the assessment of Alternative 1.

950

See supra note 948.

951

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14782.

369

As a result, counterparties to registered clearing agencies would bear the costs associated with
restructuring the data that they receive from registered clearing agencies before submitting
transaction reports to a registered SDR. Such costs could limit the feasibility of assuming the
reporting responsibility rather than contracting to have the registered clearing agency perform the
duty. However, the Commission acknowledges, in line with comments received on its
proposal, 952 that the use of agents to carry out reporting duties could mitigate these costs, if
agents are able to restructure data more efficiently than counterparties.
Second, in an environment where reporting obligations for clearing transactions rest with
counterparties and there is limited competition among registered clearing agencies, registered
clearing agencies might be able to charge high fees to counterparties who must rely on them to
provide information necessary to make required reports to registered SDRs. A registered
clearing agency could otherwise impair the ability of its counterparties to perform their own
reporting if the clearing agency does not provide sufficient support or access to clearing
transaction data. In particular, the clearing agency might have incentives to underinvest in the
infrastructure necessary to provide clearing transaction data to its counterparties unless the
Commission, by rule, were to establish minimum standards for communication of clearing
transaction data from registered clearing agencies to their counterparties. As a result,
counterparties could face greater difficulties in reporting data and an increased likelihood of
incomplete, inaccurate, or untimely data being submitted to registered SDRs.
Third, under this alternative the registered clearing agency that is party to the transaction
potentially has weaker incentives to provide high-quality regulatory data to the counterparty with
a duty to report, which could reduce the quality of regulatory data collected by registered SDRs.
952

See Markit Letter at 8.

370

The person with the duty to report a transaction has strong incentives to ensure that the
transaction details are transmitted in a well-structured format with data fields clearly defined, and
that contain data elements that are validated and free of errors because, pursuant to Regulation
SBSR, this person is responsible for making accurate reports and, if necessary, making
corrections to previously submitted data. Not only would the registered clearing agency have no
duty under Regulation SBSR to provide information to its counterparty, but additionally, market
forces might not provide sufficient motivation to the registered clearing agency to provide data to
the counterparty in a manner that would minimize the counterparty’s reporting burden. If
registered clearing agencies exercise their market power against counterparties, the
counterparties might have limited ability to demand high-quality data reporting services from
registered clearing agencies and may require the services of agents that clean and validate
transaction data that they receive.
The Commission believes, however, that despite a similarity in ultimate outcomes, and
any benefits that might flow from enabling registered SDRs to compete for clearing transaction
business, this alternative does not compare favorably to the adopted approach. As discussed
above, assigning reporting obligations to the non-clearing-agency side could increase the number
of reporting steps, thereby increasing the possibility of discrepancy, error, or delay in the
reporting process. Placing the reporting duty on the non-clearing-agency side also could reduce
data reliability if the data has to be reconfigured to be acceptable by the SDR. The Commission
believes that discrepancies, errors, and delays are less likely to occur if the duty to report clearing

371

transactions is assigned to registered clearing agencies directly, because there would be no
additional or intermediate steps where data would have to be transferred or reconfigured. 953
2.

Alternative 2

A second, closely related alternative would involve placing registered clearing agencies
within the Regulation SBSR reporting hierarchy, below registered security-based swap dealers
and registered major security-based swap participants but above counterparties that are not
registered with the Commission. Alternative 2 would assign the reporting obligation to a
registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant when it
is a counterparty to a registered clearing agency, while avoiding the need for non-registered
persons to negotiate reporting obligations with registered clearing agencies.
As with Alternative 1, Alternative 2 potentially results in additional reporting steps and
could marginally reduce the quality of regulatory data relative to the adopted approach. A key
difference, however, is that Alternative 2 would reduce the likelihood of reporting obligations
falling on unregistered persons, who would likely have less market power in negotiations with
registered clearing agencies over the terms of reporting to a registered SDR. Larger
counterparties, i.e., those with greater transaction flow, would likely be better able to negotiate
better terms by which clearing agencies report transactions on their behalf or provide the
counterparties with access to the clearing data so that they can perform their own reporting.
In its discussion of Alternative 1, the Commission noted three particular ways in which
limited competition among registered clearing agencies could result in poorer outcomes for nonclearing-agency counterparties. First, when these counterparties obtain clearing data from a
registered clearing agency, they would likely incur any costs related to reformatting the data for
953

See supra Section III(B).

372

submission to a registered SDR, including the costs of outsourcing these activities to an agent.
Second, registered clearing agencies might charge these counterparties high fees for access to
regulatory data that counterparties are required to submit to registered SDRs. Third, registered
clearing agencies might have weak incentives to ensure that the data that they supply to nonclearing-agency counterparties are of high quality, since the non-clearing-agency counterparties
would bear the costs of error correction.
Limiting the extent to which registered clearing agencies can exercise the market power
resulting from limited competition over their counterparties could reduce some of the drawbacks
to the Alternative 1. In particular, registered clearing agencies may be less likely to exercise
market power in negotiations with larger market participants, particularly when these market
participants are also clearing members. Clearing members play key roles in the governance and
operation of registered clearing agencies, often contributing members of the board of directors.
Moreover, clearing members contribute to risk management at registered clearing agencies by,
for example, contributing to clearing funds that mutualize counterparty risk. 954 Nevertheless, the
Commission believes that Alternative 2 does not fully address frictions that arise from limited
competition among registered clearing agencies, such as high clearing fees or low quality
services. The Commission believes that Alternative 2 would be less efficient than requiring the
registered clearing agency to report the transaction information directly to a registered SDR,
because the registered clearing agency is the only person who has complete information about a
clearing transaction immediately upon its creation.

Alternative 3

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 68080 (October 22, 2013), 77 FR 66220, 66267
(November 2, 2012) (“Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release”) (discussing
financial resources of clearing agencies).

373

The Commission considered a third alternative that would make the reporting side for the
alpha responsible for reporting both the beta and gamma. 955 Alternative 3 would require the
reporting side for the alpha also to report information about a security-based swap to which it is
not a counterparty, i.e., the clearing transaction between the registered clearing agency and the
non-reporting side of the alpha. As discussed in Section III(B), supra, Alternative 3 would be
operationally difficult to implement, could create confidentiality concerns, and could increase the
likelihood of data discrepancy, error, and delay because Alternative 3 requires additional
reporting steps. Alternative 3 also would require reporting sides to negotiate with registered
clearing agencies to obtain transaction data and to bear the costs of correcting errors in these
data, exposing them to the market power exercised by registered clearing agencies. Also,
because the reporting side of the alpha would report the beta and gamma, Alternative 3 is
premised on the view that the beta and gamma are life cycle events of the alpha. The
Commission, however, considered and rejected this approach in the Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release.
In addition, Alternative 3 could result in incomplete regulatory data because it could raise
questions about who would report clearing transactions associated with the compression and
netting of beta or gamma transactions. For example, suppose a non-dealer clears two standard
contracts on the same reference entity using a single registered clearing agency, each contract
955

The Commission considered and rejected this approach in the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release. See 80 FR at 14639 (“the new term ‘clearing transaction’ makes clear
that security-based swaps that result from clearing (e.g., betas and gammas in the agency
model) are independent security-based swaps, not life cycle events of the security-based
swap that is submitted to clearing (e.g., alpha security-based swaps)”). However, the
Commission is discussing this alternative in response to a commenter that, in response to
the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, recommended that the
Commission adopt this approach. See Markit Letter at 11-13.

374

having a different registered security-based swap dealer as counterparty. Under this alternative
to the adopted approach, each dealer would be responsible for reporting a gamma security-based
swap between the non-dealer and the registered clearing agency. However, this alternative does
not specify which of four potential persons (the non-dealer, one or the two registered securitybased swap dealers, or the clearing agency) would be required to report the contract that results
from the netting of the two gamma security-based swaps between the non-dealer and the
registered clearing agency.

Commenter Views

One commenter proposed a fourth alternative to assigning reporting duties for cleared
transactions. 956 Under this alternative, “the platform would remain the reporting side for all
platform-executed trades while for bilateral or off platform cleared transactions, the reporting
side would be the clearing agency. However, the clearing agency would be required to submit
beta and gamma trade records to the alpha SDR (which would be determined by the alpha trade
reporting side and not the clearing agency).” 957 For the reasons discussed above, the
Commission considers this alternative less appropriate than the adopted approach. 958 While the
Commission concurs with the approach of requiring the registered clearing agency to report the
resulting beta and gamma transactions, the Commission believes that the registered clearing
agency, when it has the duty to report security-based swaps, should be able to choose the
registered SDR to which it reports. 959

The same commenter stated that requiring registered clearing agencies to report their
clearing transactions “is not supported by an adequate consideration of factors contained in
Section 3(f) of [the Exchange Act]” and provided comments that focused on the proposed rule’s
“considerations of efficiency and competition.” 960 Specifically, this commenter believed that
the proposed rule “ignores the efficiency benefits and reduced costs introduced by middleware
reporting agencies,” and it “needlessly and unjustifiably proposes an approach to cleared
[security-based swap] reporting that imposes a burden on competition.” 961 Further, the
commenter expressed the view that Rule 901(a)(2)(i) would deter competition based on service
quality and cost in the market for SDR services, whereas the three alternatives would encourage
such competition in the same market. 962 The Commission believes that it has adequately
considered the factors contained in Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act in this release and in the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release. 963 Further, the Commission has evaluated four alternative
allocations of reporting obligations, including their likely effects on efficiency and competition.
The Commission appreciates the commenter’s concern that competition in the market for SDR
services could be hindered by Rule 901(a)(2)(i) with the possible result that clearing-agencyaffiliated SDRs might charge higher fees and/or offer lower quality services to their users.

960

See Markit Letter at 3.

961

See id. at 3-4.

962

See id. at 12 (stating that “Proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(i) would deter competition for SDR
and post-trade processing services and lower the utility of SDR services, since SDRs that
are affiliated to clearing agencies and receive their reports for cleared SBS would no
longer need to compete based on quality of service and cost, with no commensurate
marginal benefit for market participants.”) and 13 (stating that “these other alternatives,
relative to the Proposal, encourage competition based on quality of service and cost and
the rule of reporting agents and are more likely to result in outcomes whereby the same
SDR will receive alpha, beta, and gamma trades”).

963

See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, 80 FR at 14779-84.

376

However, the Commission notes that such effects on competition, should they occur, would be
limited because Rule 13n–4(c)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act 964 requires an SDR, including a
clearing-agency-affiliated SDR, to ensure that any dues, fees, or other charges imposed by, and
any discounts or rebates offered by, the SDR are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably
discriminatory. As noted in Section XIII, supra, an affiliated SDR might offer higher quality
services and/or lower fees to its participants to the extent that the affiliated SDR realizes
efficiency gains from vertical integration and shares some of these gains with its participants.
Further, other commenters expressed the view that requiring registered clearing agencies to
report clearing transactions could enhance market efficiency and improve the accuracy of
reported data. Two commenters observed that clearing agencies will be able to leverage existing
reporting processes and the existing infrastructure that they have in place with market
participants and vendors to report clearing transactions. 965 Another commenter observed that
requiring clearing agencies to report clearing transactions in security-based swaps would be
“efficient, cost effective and promote[] global data consistency,” because “clearing agencies
have demonstrated their ability and preference to report data for cleared transactions” under
swap data reporting rules established by the CFTC and in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the
European Union and Canada. 966 One commenter agreed with the Commission’s preliminary
view that proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(i) was superior to alternative reporting workflows that “could
require a person who does not have information about [a] clearing transaction at the time of its

964

17 CFR 240.13n–4(c)(1)(i).

377

creation to report that transaction.” 967 As discussed above, the Commission acknowledges that
Rule 901(a)(2)(i) could place a burden on competition in the market for clearing services and the
market for security-based swap data reporting. However, the Commission rejects the
commenter’s view that the adopted approach needlessly and unjustifiably imposes a burden on
competition. As discussed above, the Commission believes that the adopted approach is
appropriate because it would eliminate additional steps in the reporting process that would be
needed if another market participant were assigned the duty to report a clearing transaction or if
the duty were to remain unassigned. By adopting a reporting methodology with as few steps as
possible, the Commission intends to minimize potential delays, discrepancies, and errors in data
transmission by assigning reporting duties to the person that holds the most complete and
accurate information about clearing transactions at the moment of their creation. 968
C.

Reporting by Platforms

Pursuant to new Rule 901(a)(1), a platform is required to report a security-based swap
transaction executed on that platform that will be submitted to clearing. 969 With the ability to
clear security-based swap transactions, it is possible for two counterparties to trade anonymously
on a platform. In an anonymous trade, because neither counterparty would be aware of the name
or registration status of the other, it might not be possible for either counterparty to use the
reporting hierarchy in existing Rule 901(a)(2)(i) to determine who would be required to report
this alpha transaction. 970 The Commission is requiring a platform to report all alpha transactions
executed on the platform that will be submitted to clearing, even those that might not be

378

anonymous; this approach avoids the need for the platform and the counterparties to ascertain
whether the counterparties are in fact unknown to each other.
Furthermore, the platform is the only entity at the time of execution—i.e., before the
transaction is submitted for clearing—that knows the identity of both sides. Requiring the
platform to report information associated with transactions that will be submitted to clearing also
reduces the number of data transmission steps between execution and reporting to a registered
SDR. A platform that matches orders and executes transactions will possess or can readily
obtain all of the primary trade information necessary to be reported to a registered SDR, and new
Rule 901(a)(1) makes it unnecessary for counterparties to report these transactions. This
approach is designed to result in a more efficient reporting process for platform-executed alphas.
By reducing the number of steps between the creation of transaction data and reporting to a
registered SDR, Rule 901(a)(1) reduces the possibility of data discrepancies and delays.
While the level of security-based swap activity that currently takes place on platforms
and is subsequently submitted for clearing is low, future rulemaking under Title VII could cause
security-based swap trading volume on platforms to increase. 971 Efficiencies resulting from
requiring platforms to report platform-executed alphas will increase to the extent that securitybased swap trading volumes on platforms increases.
As discussed above in the context of reporting obligations for registered clearing
agencies, the Commission believes that the reporting infrastructure costs associated with required
reporting pursuant to the adopted amendments could represent a barrier to entry for new, smaller
platforms that do not yet have the ability to report transactions to a registered SDR. To the

operation of SB SEFs. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10948.

379

extent that the adopted rules and amendments might deter new trading platforms from entering
the security-based swap market, this could negatively impact competition.
1.

Alternative Approaches to Reporting Platform-Executed Transactions

For platform-executed transactions that are submitted to clearing but are not anonymous,
an alternative would be to use the reporting hierarchy in existing Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) to assign the
reporting duty. Under such an alternative, a platform would have to determine which of the
trades that it executes are anonymous and which are not, which would impose additional costs on
platforms. 972 It is likely that platforms would seek to pass on these costs to its participants. The
Commission believes that the due diligence that platforms would have to perform under this
alternative would impose unnecessary costs without enhancing the benefits of regulatory
reporting. Such costs can be avoided by requiring a platform to report all platform-executed
alphas, which is what adopted Rule 901(a)(2)(i) requires.
A second alternative would be to assign the reporting duty for all platform-executed
alphas to the registered clearing agency to which the alphas are submitted. While the registered
clearing agency would likely have the information necessary for reporting—because the clearing
agency will need much of the same information about the alpha to clear it—the Commission
believes that it would be more appropriate to assign the reporting duty to the platform. This
approach creates a more direct flow of information from the point of execution on the platform to
the registered SDR, thus minimizing opportunities for data discrepancies or delays. This
approach also avoids the need for the registered clearing agency to invest resources in systems to

There could be situations where a market participant splits an order into two or more
child orders and some child orders are anonymously executed while other child orders are
not anonymously executed. This could further complicate separation of anonymous and
non-anonymous executions.

receive data elements from platforms beyond what is already required for clearing, and to report
transactions to which it is not a counterparty.
D.

Reporting of Clearing Transactions Involving Allocation

In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission explained the application of
Regulation SBSR to bunched order executions that are not submitted to clearing. 973 In the
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission discussed the application of
Regulation SBSR to bunched order executions that are submitted to clearing, and the securitybased swaps that result from the allocation of the bunched order if the resulting security-based
swaps are cleared. In this release, the Commission discusses how the amendments to Regulation
SBSR that the Commission is adopting today apply to bunched order executions that are cleared.
The discussion is designed to accommodate the various workflows that market participants
employ to execute and allocate bunched order alphas. This guidance does not create any new
duties under Regulation SBSR but does explain the application of Regulation SBSR to events
that occur as part of the allocation process. 974 Additionally, because the guidance explains how
Regulation SBSR applies to a platform-executed bunched order that will be submitted to
clearing—and the security-based swaps that result from the allocation of any bunched order
execution, if the resulting security-based swaps are cleared—the interpretation is not likely to
have consequences for efficiency, competition, or capital formation beyond those stemming from
imposing reporting obligations on registered clearing agencies and platforms, as discussed above
in Sections II and III, respectively.
973

See 80 FR at 14625-27.

974

The Commission’s estimates of events reportable under these amendments includes
observable allocation by clearing agencies in the TIW data. Therefore, the costs
associated with clearing transactions involving allocation are included in the
Commission’s estimate of the programmatic costs of Rules 901(a)(1) and 901(a)(2)(i).

381

E.

Application of Regulation SBSR to Prime Brokerage Transactions

In Section VII, supra, the Commission discussed how Regulation SBSR applies to
security-based swaps arising out of prime brokerage arrangements. This guidance does not
create any new duties; it merely explains how a series of security-based swaps arising from a
prime brokerage arrangement should be reported and publicly disseminated under Regulation
SBSR. Therefore, there are no additional costs or benefits beyond those already considered in
the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release. 975
A prime brokerage arrangement involves a reallocation of counterparty risk, as the prime
broker interposes itself between its client and a third-party executing dealer. Regulatory
reporting of each security-based swap leg will allow the Commission and other relevant
authorities to more accurately conduct market surveillance and monitor counterparty risk. As a
result of public dissemination of all security-based swaps arising from a prime brokerage
arrangement, market observers will have access to information regarding each leg. This could
help market observers infer from these disseminated reports the fees that the prime broker
charges for its credit intermediation service and separate these fees from the transaction price of
the security-based swap.
F.

Prohibition of Fees and Usage Restrictions for Public Dissemination

New Rule 900(tt), as adopted herein, defines the term “widely accessible”—which
appears in the definition of “publicly disseminate” in existing Rule 900(cc)—to mean “widely
available to users of the information on a non-fee basis.” This new definition has the effect of
975

See 80 FR 14700-704. The Commission’s estimates in that release of the total number of
reportable events included all security-based swap legs arising out of prime brokerage
arrangements.

382

prohibiting a registered SDR from charging fees for or imposing usage restrictions on the
security-based swap transaction data that it is required to publicly disseminate under Regulation
SBSR.
Allowing free and unrestricted access to the security-based swap data that registered
SDRs are required to publicly disseminate is designed to reinforce the economic effects of public
dissemination generally, because market observers will be able to enjoy the benefits of public
dissemination without cost and without any restriction on how they use the disseminated data.
Furthermore, new Rule 900(tt) reinforces the benefits of existing Rule 903(b), which provides
that a registered SDR may utilize codes in the reported or disseminated data only if the
information necessary to understand the codes is free and not subject to any usage restrictions.
As the Commission pointed out in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, Rule 903(b) could
improve the efficiency of data intake by registered SDRs and data analysis by relevant
authorities and other users of security-based swap data; improve efficiency by minimizing
operational risks arising from inconsistent identification of persons, units of persons, products, or
transactions by counterparties; and promote competition by prohibiting fee-based licensing of
reference information that could create barriers to entry into the security-based swap market. 976
If the Commission did not prohibit fees and usage restrictions relating to the publicly
disseminated data, a registered SDR that wished to charge (or allow others to charge) users for
the information necessary to understand these UICs—but could not, because of Rule 903(b)—
might seek to do so indirectly by recharacterizing the charge as being for public dissemination.
Such potential action by a registered SDR could reduce the economic benefits of Rule 903(b)

976

See 80 FR at 14723.

383

and public dissemination generally. New Rule 900(tt) is designed in part to reinforce the
economic effects, and help prevent avoidance, of Rule 903(b).
The adopted prohibition on a registered SDR charging fees for public dissemination of
the regulatorily mandated security-based swap transaction data also is consistent with the
CFTC’s current prohibition on CFTC-registered swap data repositories charging for public
dissemination of regulatorily mandated swap transaction data. Such consistency lessens the
incentives for swap data repositories registered with the CFTC to enter the security-based swap
market and also register with the Commission as SDRs and charge for public dissemination of
security-based swap market data. 977 If the Commission did not take this approach, a CFTCregistered swap data repository could enter the security-based swap market and charge for public
dissemination of security-based swap market data, and use revenues from this business to
subsidize its operations in the swap market, where it is not permitted to charge for public
dissemination of swap market data. If an SEC-registered SDR charges fees for security-based
swap data to subsidize its reporting activity in the CFTC regime, then security-based swap
market participants reporting to this SDR could face higher costs than those it would face if the
SDR participated only in the security-based swap market.
The Commission recognizes that, because registered SDRs are prohibited from charging
for the security-based swap data that Regulation SBSR requires them to publicly disseminate,
they must obtain funds for their operating expenses through other means. 978 A registered SDR
could pass the costs of publicly disseminating security-based swap data through to the persons
977

Dual registration is likely to occur independent of the ability to charge for public
dissemination of data in the security-based swap market. However, the ability to charge
for public dissemination would add an additional incentive to do so.

978

It is unlikely, however, in the absence of Rule 900(tt) that registered SDRs would have
relied on charges for public dissemination as the sole means of funding their operations.

384

who report transactions to the registered SDR. Direct fees imposed on market participants would
likely be in proportion to the number of transactions they execute, with more active market
participants, who contribute more to the production of transaction information, paying a larger
share of the cost of disseminating that information. By contrast, it would be more difficult to
equitably calibrate a fee based on the consumption of the publicly disseminated data, because it
would be difficult to measure the intensity of a market observer’s usage of the disseminated data.
As the Commission discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the positive effects of
public dissemination on efficiency, competition, and capital formation derive from the broad
based use of disseminated data by a multitude of users. 979 There are likely to be a large number
of marginal users of the disseminated data who would not obtain the data if they were required to
pay for it. Thus, many potential users of the data might never have the opportunity to develop
new uses for the data. While a funding model relying on fees for transaction reporting could
result in security-based swap market participants subsidizing other users of security-based swap
market data, charging fees for the consumption of publicly disseminated data could drastically
reduce the number of data users and the associated positive effects on efficiency, competition,
and capital formation.
The Commission notes that new Rule 900(tt) does not prohibit a registered SDR from
offering value-added security-based swap market products for sale, provided that the SDR does
not make transaction information available through the value-added product sooner than it
publicly disseminates each individual transaction. This requirement is designed to prevent a

979

See 80 FR 14720-22 (explaining how efficiency, competition, and capital formation
could be enhanced when market participants, market observers, debt issuers, lenders, and
business owners and managers, among others, make use of publicly disseminated
security-based swap data).

385

registered SDR from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage over other firms that might wish
to sell value-added market data products. Any such products could allow market observers to
enjoy the positive impacts of Regulation SBSR on efficiency, competition, and capital formation
more directly, by making it easier for market observers to understand the publicly disseminated
data. Even if the SDR does not make transaction information available through the value-added
product sooner than it publicly disseminates each individual transaction, the SDR retains a time
advantage over a competing provider of value-added data products. This time advantage is the
time taken for the SDR to electronically disseminate transaction information to the public.
While the SDR has such a time advantage, the competitive effect of this advantage depends in
part on the nature of the value-added data product. For value-added data products whose
usefulness is not highly sensitive to data transmission time, such as a summary of monthly
security-based swap trading activity, the SDR’s time advantage would not exert a significant
negative effect on other competitors. On the other hand, for value-added products whose
usefulness decreases with data transmission time, such as a product that predicts security-based
swap prices or volumes over the next minute, the SDR’s time advantage could have a negative
effect on other competitors. Even for such products, the SDR’s time advantage would be limited
if there are multiple competing SDRs accepting data in the same asset class and the SDR is
offering a value-added product that requires not only the data that it accepts but also the data
publicly disseminated by other competing SDRs. Any time advantage that the SDR might enjoy
with respect to the data that it accepts could be offset by the absence of time advantage when
receiving data publicly disseminated by other competing SDRs.
G.

Compliance Schedule for Regulation SBSR

386

The compliance schedule adopted in this release is designed to provide affected persons,
especially registered SDRs and persons with a duty to report security-based swap transactions,
with time to develop, test, and implement systems for carrying out their respective duties under
Regulation SBSR. The new compliance schedule takes into consideration the fact that the
CFTC’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination rules are already in effect. As a result,
several SDRs have provisionally registered and are operating in the swap market under CFTC
rules, and swap market participants have developed substantial infrastructure to support swap
transaction reporting. It is likely that participants in both the swap and security-based swap
markets will seek to repurpose much of the infrastructure implemented in the swap market to
support activities in the security-based swap market, which would enable more efficient
implementation of the Commission’s regime for security-based swap reporting.
Also, as discussed in Section X(C), supra, the new compliance schedule aligns
Regulation SBSR compliance with security-based swap dealer registration. Thus, with respect to
newly executed security-based swaps in a particular asset class, Compliance Date 1 for Rule 901
of Regulation SBSR is the first Monday that is the later of: (1) six months after the date on
which the first SDR that can accept transaction reports in that asset class registers with the
Commission; or (2) one month after the SBS entities registration compliance date. Every
security-based swap in that asset class that is executed on or after Compliance Date 1 must be
reported in accordance with Rule 901. Compliance Date 2, when public dissemination shall
commence, is the first Monday that is three months after Compliance Date 1. Compliance Date
3, by which all historical security-based swaps in that asset class must be reported to a registered

387

SDR (to the extent that information about such transactions is available), is two months after
Compliance Date 2. 980
The proposed compliance schedule would have required affected persons to begin
complying with Regulation SBSR before security-based swap dealers register with the
Commission. A number of comments urged the Commission to delay Regulation SBSR
compliance until after security-based swap dealers register. 981 One commenter provided
extensive estimates of the costs that market participants could have incurred to develop reporting
procedures for the Interim Period that likely would not have been applicable to the period after
security-based swap dealer registration. 982 This commenter also pointed out that the Interim
Period could create a competitive disadvantage for non-U.S. dealing entities because these
entities could assume the responsibility but not the liability for reporting and thus might be less
attractive to buy-side U.S. clients than U.S. dealing entities that could assume both the
responsibility and liability for reporting. 983
The Commission agrees with commenters that it would be more efficient for affected
persons to focus on developing compliance procedures only for the period after security-based
swap dealer registration, rather than require affected persons to expend resources to develop
procedures for both the period after registration as well as for the Interim Period, because Interim

980

Every security-based swap in that asset class that is executed on or after July 21, 2010,
and up and including to the day immediately before Compliance Date 1 is a transitional
security-based swap. As discussed in Section X(E), infra, the Commission’s final
compliance schedule establishes a separate Compliance Date 3 for the reporting of preenactment and transitional security-based swaps.

388

Period procedures might be inapplicable to the period after registration. The Commission
believes that, by eliminating the Interim Period and thus the need to expend resources for
developing interim procedures, the adopted compliance schedule will promote efficiency. The
adopted compliance schedule should also promote capital formation to the extent that persons
that would have incurred reporting obligations during the Interim Period could invest the
resources that would otherwise be expended in developing Interim Period procedures into
productive assets.
Furthermore, the Commission acknowledges the commenters’ concern that the Interim
Period could create competitive disparities between U.S. and foreign dealing entities if buy-side
U.S. persons were less willing to transact with foreign dealing entities if certain foreign dealing
entities could not assume the liability for reporting. The adopted compliance schedule avoids the
need for the Interim Period and thus eliminates any potential competitive disadvantage for
foreign dealing entities described by the commenters. Thus, relative to the proposed compliance
schedule, the adopted compliance schedule should promote competition among U.S. and foreign
dealing entities that supply liquidity to the security-based swap market.
In summary, the Commission now believes, in light of the comments received on its
proposal, that it would better promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation to delay
compliance with the reporting obligations of Regulation SBSR until after the SBS entities
registration compliance date.
The compliance schedule adopted herein also is based on the first SDR in an asset class
to register with the Commission, which could confer a “first-mover advantage.” 984 The first

984

Letter at 4-5; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 18.

389

registered SDR could potentially capture a significant share of the SDR market because reporting
parties, uncertain as to whether or when registration of other SDRs’ applications might be
granted, could feel compelled to onboard with the first registered SDR to secure sufficient time
to prepare for Compliance Date 1. 985 Furthermore, the first registered SDR could hold on to its
share of the SDR market for long periods if reporting persons that are connected to it face high
costs of switching to a different registered SDR. Thus, the first mover advantage could
potentially limit competition by making it more difficult for new SDR entrants to sign on
reporting clients.
The Commission acknowledges that a first mover could emerge. Nevertheless, the
Commission believes that, if one SDR application satisfies the criteria of Rule 13n-1(c)(3) under
the Exchange Act before any others, it would not be appropriate for the Commission to delay
granting its registration because of the status of other SDR applications. 986 The Commission
continues to believe that most persons that have the desire and ability to operate as SECregistered SDRs are already operational in the swaps market as swap data repositories
provisionally registered with the CFTC, and each should have a strong incentive to submit
applications to register with the Commission quickly. 987 Thus, there is less likelihood of
multiple applications arriving over an extended period of time, and consequently, a lower
likelihood of a first mover emerging.
Even if a first mover emerges, other Commission rules are designed to minimize any
potential of a monopoly advantage that the first SDR might otherwise enjoy. All SDRs, even the

first or only registered SDR in a particular asset class, must offer fair, open, and not
unreasonably discriminatory access to users of its services. 988 Moreover, any fees charged by an
SDR must be fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory. 989
The newly adopted compliance schedule could give added incentive to avoid delaying the
submission of an application for registration as an SDR and to commence operation as an SECregistered SDR as quickly as possible. This result would help the Commission and other
relevant authorities obtain information about the security-based swap market for oversight
purposes as quickly as possible, and also allow the public to obtain price, volume, and
transaction information about all security-based swaps as quickly as possible.
As proposed in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, all historical
security-based swaps in a particular asset class would have had to be reported to a registered
SDR by proposed Compliance Date 1. As discussed in Section X(E), supra, the Commission has
revised the compliance schedule to dissociate the requirement to report historical security-based
swaps from Compliance Date 1. With respect to historical security-based swaps in a particular
asset class, new Compliance Date 3 for the reporting of historical transactions is two months
after Compliance Date 2, the date on which public dissemination commences. The Commission
believes that the additional compliance delay for reporting historical security-based swaps
represents an appropriate balancing of the benefits of mandatory reporting against the likely
costs. Mandatory reporting of historical security-based swaps is generally less urgent than the
reporting of newly executed transactions, particularly in light of the fact that most security-based
swaps in the credit derivative asset class are already being reported on a voluntary basis to TIW.

Because only available information about historical transactions must be reported, the
Commission does not anticipate that reports of historical transactions made to registered SDRs
will be significantly more informative than the reports already available through TIW.
Several commenters were concerned that requiring reporting pursuant to Regulation
SBSR to begin before the Commission has made substituted compliance determinations “would
impose significant and unnecessary burdens” on non-U.S. registered persons. Changes made by
non-U.S. persons to their reporting infrastructure to comply with Regulation SBSR may not be
necessary, in the commenters’ views, if the Commission subsequently grants substituted
compliance to these non-U.S. persons. 990 The Commission acknowledges the commenters’
concern regarding burdens that may arise if compliance with Regulation SBSR precedes
substituted compliance determinations. However, as discussed in Section X(C)(5), supra, the
Commission does not believe that it is appropriate to defer compliance with Regulation SBSR
until after the Commission makes one or more substituted compliance determinations. The
Commission understands that changes made by non-U.S. persons to their reporting infrastructure
to comply with Regulation SBSR might become unnecessary if substituted compliance is
granted. However, these changes could be limited to the extent that the Commission and other
jurisdictions require the collection and reporting of similar transaction information.

Amendments Related to Cross-Border Transactions

The amendments to Rules 901 and 908 adopted today will, among other things, apply
Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to all securitybased swap transactions of a foreign dealing entity that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by
U.S. personnel. Such ANE transactions are already subject to regulatory reporting and public
990

See ISDA I at 15; ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 19; SIFMA/FSR Letter at 15.

392

dissemination if the other side includes a U.S. person. The amendments adopted today extend
the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirement to all ANE transactions, even if
the other side is non-U.S. and not engaging in ANE activity. These amendments also for the first
time assign the duty to report transactions between unregistered U.S. persons and unregistered
non-U.S. persons. These amendments will have several effects on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation in the U.S. financial market.
1.

Competition

These amendments to Rules 901 and 908 will have implications for competition among
market participants that intermediate transactions in security-based swaps as well as
counterparties to security-based swaps. These amendments are designed to promote competition
among liquidity providers in the security-based swap market by imposing consistent reporting
and public dissemination requirements on both U.S. and foreign dealing entities, when the latter
are engaging in ANE activity. If only U.S. dealing entities were subject to regulatory reporting
and public dissemination requirements, the costs of these requirements would primarily affect
U.S. dealing entities, their agents, and their counterparties. In contrast, foreign dealing entities
and their agents, who might not be subject to comparable requirements in their home
jurisdictions, could have a competitive advantage over U.S. dealing entities in serving
unregistered non-U.S. counterparties using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, were
their activities not subject to the same requirements. 991

991

See, e.g., Arnoud W.A. Boot, Silva Dezelan, and Todd T. Milbourn, “Regulatory
Distortions in a Competitive Financial Services Industry,” Journal of Financial Services
Research, Vol. 17, No. 1 (2000) (showing that, in a simple industrial organization model
of bank lending, a change in the cost of capital resulting from regulation results in a
greater loss of profits when regulated banks face competition from unregulated banks
than when regulations apply equally to all competitors).

393

These amendments to Rules 901 and 908 also are designed to promote competition
between U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons that trade with foreign dealing entities, when a
foreign dealing entity is utilizing U.S. personnel. A transaction between an unregistered foreign
dealing entity engaging in ANE activity and a U.S. counterparty already is subject to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination under existing Rule 908(a)(1)(i). In the absence of newly
adopted Rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) and (3), however, no one would be assigned to report such a
transaction. Furthermore, in the absence of new Rule 908(b)(5), an unregistered foreign dealing
entity engaged in an ANE transaction would not be subject to Regulation SBSR. This could
create a competitive advantage for non-U.S. persons over similarly situated U.S. persons when
they trade with foreign dealing entities. An unregistered foreign dealing entity might be able
offer liquidity to a non-U.S. person at a lower price than to the U.S. person because the foreign
dealing entity would not have to embed the potential costs of regulatory reporting and public
dissemination into the price offered to the non-U.S. person. By contrast, the price offered by the
unregistered foreign dealing entity to the U.S. person would likely reflect these additional costs,
to the extent that public dissemination of a particular transaction imposes costs on the
counterparties. 992 While the benefit of lower prices obtained by non-U.S. persons would depend
on the magnitude of the perceived costs of public dissemination, the Commission believes that it
is appropriate to place the transactions of U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons on a more equal
footing, so that non-U.S. persons do not have a competitive advantage over U.S. persons when

992

This effect would be diminished to the extent that a transaction of a foreign dealing entity
is subject to public dissemination requirements under the rules of a foreign jurisdiction,
and the costs of public dissemination are already factored into the prices offered to its
counterparties.

394

engaging in security-based swap transactions that, due to the involvement of U.S. personnel of
the foreign dealing entity, exist at least in part within the United States.
The amendments to Rules 901 and 908 adopted herein also apply consistent regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements to transactions between unregistered non-U.S.
persons that are platform-executed or effected by or through registered broker-dealers. Because
there will be very few such transactions, the Commission believes that the application of
regulatory requirements is unlikely to generate competitive frictions between these different
types of providers of intermediation services. 993
As discussed in Section XII(B)(1)(2), supra, unregistered U.S. persons likely will seek to
avoid the costs of assessing whether a foreign counterparty is engaging in ANE activity by
choosing to transact only with registered entities for which assessment is not required. To the
extent that unregistered U.S. persons avoid transacting with unregistered foreign dealing entities
engaging in ANE activity in favor of transacting with registered entities, these foreign dealing
entities could be at a competitive disadvantage when competing with registered entities to
provide liquidity to unregistered U.S. persons. However, this competitive disadvantage could be
limited if unregistered foreign dealing entities readily provide information on their use of U.S.
personnel to unregistered U.S. persons who are potential counterparties, thereby obviating the
need for the U.S. persons to conduct an assessment. Further, the competitive disadvantage could
be eliminated entirely if a foreign dealing entity registers with the Commission as a securitybased swap dealer. An unregistered foreign dealing entity that remains below the de minimis
threshold may seek to register as a security-based swap dealer if the benefits from providing

993

See U.S. Activity Proposal, 80 FR at 27501.

395

liquidity to unregistered U.S. persons are sufficient to justify the costs associated with dealer
registration.
2.

Efficiency

The Regulation SBSR Adopting Release did not address when an uncleared securitybased swap involving only unregistered non-U.S. persons would be subject to regulatory
reporting and/or public dissemination. The amendments to Rules 901 and 908 adopted herein,
by requiring the public dissemination of ANE transactions, including those that are uncleared
security-based swaps involving only unregistered non-U.S. persons, will increase price
competition and price efficiency in the security-based swap market generally, 994 and enable all
market participants to have more comprehensive information with which to make trading and
valuation determinations for security-based swaps and related and underlying assets. The
reporting of all ANE transactions to a registered SDR should enhance the Commission’s ability
to oversee security-based swap activity occurring within the United States and to monitor for
compliance with specific Title VII requirements (including the requirement that a person register
with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer if it exceeds the de minimis threshold).
The reporting of these transactions likely will enhance the Commission’s ability to monitor for
manipulative and abusive practices involving security-based swap transactions or transactions in
related underlying assets, such as corporate bonds or other securities transactions that result from
dealing activity, or other relevant activity, in the U.S. market. The knowledge that the
Commission and other relevant authorities are able to conduct surveillance on the basis of
regulatory reporting could encourage greater participation in the security-based swap market
since surveillance and the resulting increased probability of detection may deter potential market
994

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14720-21.

396

abuse. This could result in improved efficiency, due to the availability of more risk-sharing
opportunities between market participants.
The Commission acknowledges the risk that, in response to the adopted amendments,
foreign dealing entities, trading platforms, and/or registered broker-dealers could restructure their
operations to avoid triggering requirements under Regulation SBSR. For example, a foreign
dealing entity could restrict its U.S. personnel from intermediating transactions with non-U.S.
persons, a trading platform might choose to move its principal place of business offshore, or a
registered broker-dealer might cease to effect transactions in security-based swaps between
unregistered non-U.S. persons. Such restructurings, if they occurred, could have an adverse
effect on the efficiency of the security-based swap market by fragmenting liquidity between a
U.S. security-based swap market—occupied by U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons willing to
participate within the Title VII regulatory framework, with intermediation services provided by
registered broker-dealers and U.S.-based trading platforms—and an offshore market in which
participants seek to avoid any activity that could trigger application of Title VII to their securitybased swap activity. 995 Such market fragmentation could reduce the amount of liquidity
available to market participants whose activity is regulated by Title VII, increase their search
costs, or erode any gains in price efficiency and allocative efficiency that might otherwise result
from regulatory reporting and public dissemination of all security-based swap transactions that
exist at least in part within the United States. If foreign dealing entities use only agents who are
located outside the United States, there could be reduced competition in the market for securitybased swap intermediation services and this smaller pool of competitors could in turn charge
higher prices for intermediation. The result would be higher costs of searching for suitable
995

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47364.

397

counterparties. Higher search costs could in turn reduce the number of risk-sharing trades that
foreign dealing entities execute and thus adversely affect risk-sharing efficiency in the securitybased swap market broadly.
The Commission has already considered the likelihood that foreign dealing entities will
cease using U.S. personnel to avoid Title VII requirements (such as security-based swap dealer
registration). 996 The Commission continues to believe that market fragmentation that results
from relocation of personnel is less likely because foreign dealing entities that elect to use such a
strategy to avoid regulatory reporting requirements under Title VII also would bear the costs of
restructuring their operations and potentially forgoing the benefits of access to local expertise in
security-based swaps that are traded in the U.S. market. 997 Furthermore, the Commission
believes that the amendments adopted herein, by extending Regulation SBSR to a small set of
ANE transactions involving only non-U.S. persons and assigning the duty for reporting them,
will impose only marginal burdens on platforms and registered broker-dealers.
3.

Capital Formation

The amendments adopted herein could affect capital formation by affecting the
transparency, liquidity, and stability of the market in which issuers seek capital. In the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the Commission identified benefits associated with the
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps, such as increased
transparency, improved liquidity, and greater market stability. 998 The Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release did not impose any requirements on transactions between unregistered non-

996

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8629-30.

997

See id. at 8633.

998

See 80 FR at 14719-22.

398

U.S. persons, even if one side was engaging in ANE activity. The amendments adopted in this
release, by extending Regulation SBSR to all ANE transactions, should extend the benefits of
regulatory reporting and public dissemination to all ANE transactions, which in turn could lead
to more efficient allocation of capital by market participants and market observers.
The Commission recognizes that the amendments to Rules 901 and 908 adopted herein
could impede capital formation by fragmenting the security-based swap market. As discussed in
Section XIII(H)(2), supra, fragmentation of the security-based swap market could occur if
market participants restructure their business activities by moving their personnel and operations
offshore or restrict the counterparties to whom such persons may provide services. Such actions
could impede capital formation because resources that market participants expend to restructure
would not be available for investing in productive assets. Furthermore, fragmentation could
create two separate security-based swap markets: a U.S. security-based swap market and an offshore security-based swap market. 999 If fragmentation reduces the pool of market participants in
the U.S. market, the market could experience lower trading activity and liquidity which in turn
could reduce the ability of U.S. market participants to hedge financial and commercial risks and
force them to put more resources into precautionary savings instead of investing those resources
into productive assets.
However, as the Commission noted in Section XIII(H)(2), supra, the amendments
adopted herein, by extending Regulation SBSR to all ANE transactions, will impose only
marginal burdens on foreign dealing entities. The Commission does not believe that these
limited burdens will cause foreign dealing entities to restructure their operations and fragment
the security-based swap market such that capital formation would be adversely affected.

XIV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) requires federal agencies, in promulgating rules,
to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. Section 603(a) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 1000 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to undertake a
regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to determine
the impact of such rulemaking on “small entities.” 1001 Section 605(b) of the RFA 1002 states that
this requirement shall not apply to any proposed rule or proposed rule amendment which, if
adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
In developing the final rules contained in Regulation SBSR, the Commission has
considered their potential impact on small entities. For purposes of Commission rulemaking in
connection with the RFA, a small entity includes: (1) when used with reference to an “issuer” or
a “person,” other than an investment company, an “issuer” or “person” that, on the last day of its
most recent fiscal year, had total assets of $5 million or less; 1003 or (2) a broker-dealer with total
capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior
fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d)
under the Exchange Act, 1004 or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total

1000

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

1001

Although Section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits
agencies to formulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions of
the term “small entity” for the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with
the RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule
0-10 under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 18451 (January 28, 1982), 47 FR 5215 (February 4, 1982) (File No. AS-305).

capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the
preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated
with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small
organization. 1005 Under the standards adopted by the Small Business Administration, small
entities in the finance and insurance industry include the following: (1) For entities engaged in
credit intermediation and related activities, 1006 entities with $550 million or less in assets; (2) for
non-depository credit intermediation and certain other activities, 1007 entities engaged in nondepository credit intermediation and related activities, $38.5 million or less in annual receipts;
(3) for entities engaged in financial investments and related activities, 1008 entities with $38.5
million or less in annual receipts; (4) for insurance carriers and entities engaged in related
activities, 1009 entities with $38.5 million or less in annual receipts, or 1,500 employees for direct

1005

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(c).

1006

Including commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, firms involved in other
depository credit intermediation, credit card issuing, sales financing, consumer lending,
real estate credit, and international trade financing. See 13 CFR 121.201 at Subsector
522.

1007

Including firms involved in secondary market financing, all other non-depository credit
intermediation, mortgage and nonmortgage loan brokers, financial transactions
processing, reserve, and clearing house activities, and other activities related to credit
intermediation. See 13 CFR 121.201 at Subsector 522.

1008

Including firms involved in investment banking and securities dealing, securities
brokerage, commodity contracts dealing, commodity contracts brokerage, securities and
commodity exchanges, miscellaneous intermediation, portfolio management, providing
investment advice, trust, fiduciary and custody activities, and miscellaneous financial
investment activities. See 13 CFR 121.201 at Subsector 523.

1009

Including direct life insurance carriers, direct health and medical insurance carriers, direct
property and casualty insurance carriers, direct title insurance carriers, other direct
insurance (except life, health and medical) carriers, reinsurance carriers, insurance
agencies and brokerages, claims adjusting, third party administration of insurance and
pension funds, and all other insurance related activities. See 13 CFR 121.201 at
Subsector 524.

401

property and casualty insurance carriers; and (5) for funds, trusts, and other financial
vehicles, 1010 entities with $32.5 million or less in annual receipts.
In the U.S. Activity Proposal, the Commission stated its belief that the majority of the
amendments to Regulation SBSR proposed in that release would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities for the purposes of the RFA. 1011 However, the
Commission acknowledged that the proposed amendments would require a registered brokerdealer (including a registered SB SEF) to report a security-based swap transaction that is effected
by or through it. 1012 The Commission further estimated that 30 registered broker-dealers
(including SB SEFs) could be required to report such transactions, although the Commission was
not able to estimate the number of those registered broker-dealers that would be “small
entities.” 1013 As a result, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that it is unlikely that
these registered broker-dealers would be small entities and requested comment on the number of
registered broker-dealers that are small entities that would be impacted by the proposed
amendments, including any available empirical data. 1014
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission certified that
the amendments proposed in that release would not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities for purposes of the RFA. 1015 The Commission believes,

1010

Including pension funds, health and welfare funds, other insurance funds, open-end
investment funds, trusts, estates, and agency accounts, real estate investment trusts and
other financial vehicles. See 13 CFR 121.201 at Subsector 525.

based on input from security-based swap market participants and its own information, that the
majority of security-based swap transactions have at least one counterparty that is either a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, and that these entities—
whether registered broker-dealers or not—would exceed the thresholds defining “small entities”
set out above. The Commission continues to believe that the vast majority of, if not all, securitybased swap transactions are between large entities for purposes of the RFA.
In addition, the Commission believes that persons that are likely to register as SDRs
would not be small entities. Based on input from security-based swap market participants and its
own information, the Commission continues to believe that most if not all registered SDRs will
be part of large business entities, and that all registered SDRs will have assets in excess of the
thresholds discussed above. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that no registered
SDRs will be small entities.
The Commission received no comments on the certification in the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release or, as indicated above, the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
in the U.S. Activity Proposal. Accordingly, the Commission hereby certifies that the final rules
adopted in this release will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities
for the purposes of the RFA.
