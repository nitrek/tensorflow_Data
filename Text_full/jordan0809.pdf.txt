Introduction

Pursuant to 29 C. F. R. 1980.108 (b), the Securities and Exchange
Commission
curiae,

("SEC" or "Commission") submits this brief as amicus

to address the issue of whether an attorney for a public

company who reports evidence of a material violation of the federal
securities laws "up the ladder" within that company, as required by
the

Commission's

rules

promulgated

under

Section

307

of

the

Sarbanes-Oxley Act ("SOX"), may introduce into evidence that report
and any responses to it, when they are material to establishing a

The Attorney-Conduct Rules define "material violation ll to

fiduciary duty arising under United States federal or state
law, or a similar
material violation. 17 C.F.R. 205.2(i).

An "appropriate response ll is "a response to an attorney

When an attorney-whistleblower makes a Part 205 report, and
believes he or she has been retaliated against for having made that
report, one recourse is to file a claim against his or her employer
under SOX Section 806, which prohibits an issuer from retaliating
against an employee who reports potential material violations of
the federal securities laws.
A central issue in a Section 806 whistleblower proceeding
brought by an attorney, including this one, is whether the attorney
may introduce his or her Part 205 report--which may constitute an
attorney-client

communication,

contain

client

confidences,

or

both--in establishing that he or she is a bona fide whistleblower
under SOX.

In promulgating the Part 205 rules,

the Commission

specifically addressed whether attorneys may use Part 205 reports
in proceedings where their compliance with Part 205 is in issue.

Part 205 rules interpreted as not permitting attorneys to use their
Part

205 reports to

substantiate retaliation or discrimination

claims, Congress's interest in protecting whistleblowers, and the
Commission's interest in encouraging_attorneys to comply with its
Part 205 rules, would be seriously undermined.
We understand that public companies may have concerns about
the use of client confidences in attorney-whistleblower proceedings

of

the

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

Jack R. T. Jordan ("Jordan") alleges in this proceeding that
he was terminated from his employment as an in-house attorney in

Governance group

that

See, e.g., Jordan's

Sprint moved to dismiss the

Jordan's

claims

are

entirely

dependent on the disclosure of privileged communications (i. e., his
Part 205 report), and no legally cognizable exception permits the
disclosure of such communications, he has no admissible evidence to
support his claim of having engaged in protected whistleblowing.
On March 14, 2006, the ALJ, relying on federal common law and
the Model Rules, and without any reference to Section 205.3(d) (1)
of the Commission's rules, denied Sprint's motion, explaining that
Jordan is entitled to use attorney-client communications to support
his

SOX retaliation claim.

The ALJ explained that Model Rule

1.6(b) (5), which was adopted in 1983,

"expanded the instances in

which an attorney might rely on otherwise confidential information
to include his. . .

a~firmative

use of suCh information in a claim

of retaliatory discharge against a former employer."

The ALJ further noted that

reporting

Jordan's

evidence

of

material violations of federal securities laws as required under
Part

205

amounted to

conduct

that

"falls

squarely within the

parameters" of the Model Rule.
Sprint petitioned the Board for interlocutory review.

On June

19, 2008, the Board granted Sprint's petition, concluding that the

6

issue of whether attorneys may use client confidences to establish
claims of retaliatory discharge was sufficiently "important" to
warrant interlocutory review.

On appeal,

Sprint maintains that

nothing in Part 205 speaks to whether an attorney can use client
confidences to support his or her SOX· whistleblower claim, and
argues that the federal

common law bars the use of privileged

communications to support such a claim.
Jordan argues,

inter alia,

Commission's Part 205

In his answering brief,

that because his compliance with the

rules

is

"in issue"

in this litigation,

Section 205.3(d) (1) of the Commission's rules permits him to use
his Part 205 report, and any response thereto, in support of his
Section 806 claim.

Sprint initially argued before the ALJ that Kansas law
applied because it is ~the jurisdiction where Jordan was
practicing." See, e.g., Respondent's Supp. Brief in Support
of its Motion for a Protective Order (Feb. 13, 2006) at p.
12, Ex. 8 at p. 1; see Attachment B to Respondent's Motion
for a Protective Order (Jan. 17, 2006) at 2; Respondent's
Reply in Support of its Motion to Dismiss (Mar. 3, 2006) at
4 n. 2, 12. Now, Sprint suggests that New York law applies
because Jordan is a member of the New York bar. Sprint's
Opening Brief at 12-13. As an initial matter, Jordan's New
York bar membership is irrelevant.
The question at issue
here is solely. one of federal law.
See Sprint's Opening
Brief at 9 (~Evidentiary issues, such as the application of
the attorney-client privilege, are governed by federal law
in cases that arise under 'federal question' jurisdiction").
Furthermore, to the extent this issue is governed by state
law, which it is not, Kansas law would govern (1) as the
facts at issue in this litigation occurred in Kansas, where
Sprint was headquartered, and where Jordan resided and
worked during the relevant period, and (2) Jordan acquired
the relevant client confidences in Kansas.
See Allstate
Ins. v. Hague, 449 U.S. 302, 312-13 (1981).
Kansas's state
bar rule, as noted below, is consistent with both Model Rule

Even	 if the Board were to look beyond the plain language of

can

no

question

that

the

Commission

authorized attorney-whistleblowers to use their Part 205 reports as
either a "shield" or a "sword" in proceedings and litigation where
their compliance with Part 205 is in -issue.
Although the Commission's

in promulgating Section

notes that an attorney may use his or her Part 205

"to defend himself or herself,"

and also refeiences the

this

should

not

be

construed

as

meaning

that

the

Commission

intended to limit Section 205.3 (d) (1) , s scope exclusively to purely
defensive uses by attorneys.

To the contrary, it bears repeating

that the Commission expressly stated in its comments that Section

to

be

"effectively

Section 205.3(d) (l)'s permissible use of client confidences is no
broader than that under the federal common law and the law of at
least 45 states.

Thus, its application to SOX whistleblower claims

represents no erosion of client confidentiality.29/

any ambiguity in the plain language of Section 205.3(d) (1), the
Commission's comments on and interpretation of these regulations
are

and deserve

full

consideration.

An

Thus,

Section 806 proceedings is inconsistent with the
Commission's decision not to promulgate in its Part 205
rules a "noisy withdrawal provision, requiring lawyers to
notify the Commission of their withdrawal from the
representation of a client that did not remedy reported
violatlons.
See Release No. 33-8150 (Feb.
6, 2003), 68
Fed. Reg. 6296, 6297; Release 33-8150 (Nov. 21, 2002), 67
Fed. Reg. 71669. This argument would be both inaccurate and
beside the point.
First, the Commission's decision not to
include a "noisy withdrawal provision in its Rules at that
time in no way can be construed to mean that the Commission
sought to bar any disclosure of client confidences outside
of an issuer. ~o the contrary, Section 205.3(d) (2)
explicitly permits attorneys to disclose client confidences
outside the issuer in certain circumstances, including:
(i)
to prevent the issuer from committing a material violation
that is likely to cause substantial injury to the issuer or
investors; (ii) to prevent the issuer from committing
perjury, suborning perjury, or committing any act proscribed
in 18 U.S.C. 1001 that is likely to perpetrate a fraud upon
the Commission; or (iii) to rectify the consequences of ~
material violation by the issuer that caused, or may cause,
substantial injury to the issuer or investors. 17 C.F.~.
205.3(d) (2). Moreover, whether the Commission expressly
permitted or required attorneys to disclose client
confidences ~n the first instance has no bearing on whether
attorneys who are retaliated against for making Part 205
reports may use those reports in subsequent whistleblower
proceedings where their compliance with Part 205 is in
issue. That is a different situation, which Section
205.3(d) (1) squarely addresses.

Evidence 503. It was proposed by the Supreme Court in 1972,
see Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and
Magistrates, 56 F.R.D. 183, 235-36 (1972), but never adopted
by Congress. Nonetheless, it is often cited as a
restatement of the common law of attorney-client privilege

attorney's unconsented use of client confidences

The Fifth Circuit's reading of federal common law in Willy v.
ARB is correct for two reasons.

First, as the Fifth Circuit held,

client confidences where such communications are relevant to a
claim of "breach of 'duty

Certainly Section 806 can be read to

impose a duty on client-issuers not to take adverse action against
their lawyer-employees for reporting potential material violations

. . . against an accusation of wrongful conduct."

It is typical in

whistleblower cases for the employer to allege that any supposed
retaliation was instead a response to the employee's misconduct;
indeed, Sprint makes such claims here. 38 /
Second,

even assuming Standard 503 should be interpreted

narrowly as Sprint urges, that standard merely reflects a static
picture of the federal
(i.e.,

common law at the time of its proposal

1972) and no longer reflects the current state of federal

Since

however,

provision has been replaced by ABA Model Rule 1.6(b) (5), which (as
discussed above) broadly allows the use of client confidences if

ALJs have the authority to minimize the public

disclosure of client confidences and ensure that any use of client
confidences is handled in an appropriate ·and circumspect manner.
Indeed, Section 18.46 of Subpart A of the Rules of Practice and
ProceduTe for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of ALJs,

~

Siedle v. Putnam
, Inv., 147 F.3d 7 (1st Cir. 1998), the
primary case upon which Sprint relies other than the Board's
decision in Willy, is thus distinguishable because it
applies Massachusetts state law (as opposed to federal
common law), which was based upon Disciplinary Rule 4­
101(C) ~ Also, as the Fifth Circuit noted in Willyv. ARB,
to the extent that the Siedle court read Disciplinary Rule
4-101(C) as prohibiting the "offensive" use of client
confidences, it misinterpreted the caselaw applying that
provision. 423 F.3d at 496. The Fifth Circuit also
observed that Siedle "neither explicitly nor implicitly held
that the attorney could never use confidential information
against his employer.
It merely reversed the district
court's order that the seal should be lifted" to make the
privileged materials available to the press.
Id. at 497-98.
Furthermore, the Siedle court relied on the ABA Disciplinary
Rules adopted in 1970 as part of the ABA's Code of
Professional Responsibility. However, in 1983, the ABA
introduced the Model Rules, of which Model Rule 1.6(b) (5) is
a part. Since then, nearly every state has adopted the
Model Rules or most of them, although some continue to rely
on limited portions of the Code of Professional
Responsibility and its Disciplinary Rules.

ALABAMA RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

CLIENT-LAWYER RELATIONSHIP


Ala. Rules o/Prof Conduct Rule 1.6 (2009)
Review Court Orders which may amend this Rule.

Rule 1.6. Confidentiality of information.
(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation ofa client unless the client consents after
consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, and except as
stated in paragraph (b).
(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:
(1) To prevent the client from committing a criminal act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in imminent
death or substantial bodily harm; or
(2) To establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, to
establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was
involved, or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of the client.
NOTES:

Comment
A lawyer, as an officer of the court and as a part of the judicial system, is charged with upholding the law. One of
the lawyer's functions is to advise clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in the proper exercise of their
rights.
The observance of the ethical obligation of a lawyer to hold inviolate confidential information of the client not only
facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper representation of the client but also encourages people to
seek early legal assistance.
.
Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine what their rights are and what is, in the
maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. The common law recognizes that the client's confidences
must be protected from disclosure. Based upon experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the advice given,
and the law is upheld.

Alaska Rules of Professional Conduct

services for the client or perform them in a way contrary to the client's interest. For example, a
lawyer should not enter into an agreement whereby services are to be provided only up to a
stated amount when it is foreseeable that more extensive services probably will be required,
unless the situation is adequately explained to the client. Otherwise, the client might have to .
bargain for further assistance in the midst of a proceeding or transaction. However, it is proper
to define the extent of services in light of the client's ability to pay. A lawyer should not exploit a
fee arrangement based primarily on hourly charges by using wasteful procedures.

Prohibited Contingent Fees
[6] Paragraph (d) prohibits a lawyer from charging a contingent fee in a domestic relations
matter when payment is contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of
alimony or support or property settlement to be obtained. This provision does not preclude a
contract for a contingent fee for legal representation in connection with the recovery of post­
judgment balances due under support, alimony, or other financial orders because such
contracts do not implicate the same policy concerns.

Division of Fee
[7] A division of fee is a single billing to a client covering the fee of two or more lawyers who
are not in the same firm. A division of fee facilitates association of more than one lawyer in a
matter in which neither alone could serve the client as well, and most often is used when the
fee is contingent and the division is between a referring lawyer and a trial specialist.
Paragraph (e) permits the lawyers to divide a fee either on the basis of he proportion of .
services they render or if each lawyer aSSl,Jmes responsibility for the representation as a
whole. In addition, the client must agree to the arrangement, including the share that each
lawyer is to receive, and the agreement must be confirmed in Writing. Contingent fee
agreements must be in a writing signed by the client and must otherwise comply with
paragraph (c) of this Rule. Jornt responsibility for the representation entails financial and
ethical responsibility for the representation as if the lawyers were associated in a partnership.
A lawyer should only refer a matter to a lawyer whom the referring lawyer reasonably believes
is competent to handle the matter. See Rule 1.1.
[8] Paragraph (e) does not prohibit or regulate division of fees to be received in the future for
work done when lawyers were preViously associated in a law firm.

Disputes over Fees
[9] If a procedure has been established for resolution of fee disputes, such as an arbitration or
mediation procedure established by the bar, the lawyer must comply with the procedure when
it is mandatory, and, even when it is voluntary, the lawyer should conscientiously consider
submitting to it. Law may prescribe a procedure for determining a lawyer's fee, for example, in
representation of an executor or administrator, a class or a person entitled to a reasonable fee
as part of the measure of damages. The lawyer entitled to such a fee and a lawyer
representing another party concerned with the fee should comply with the prescribed
procedure.

Rule 1.6. Confidentiality of Information.
(a) A lawyer shall not reveal a client's confidence or secret unless the client gives informed

consent, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the
representation and disclosures permitted by paragraph (b) below or Rule 3.3. For purposes of
this rule, "confidence" means information protected by the attorney-client privilege under
applicable law, and "secret" means other information gained in the professional relationship if
the client has requested it be held confidential or if it is reasonably foreseeable that disclosure
of the information would be embarrassing or detrimental to the client. In determining whether
information relating to representation of a client is protected from disclosure under this rule, the
lawyer shall resolve any uncertainty about whether such information can be revealed against
revealing the information..
(b) A lawyer may reveal a client's confidence or secret to the extent the lawyer reasonably
believes· necessary:
(1) to prevent reasonably certain:
(A) death;
(8) substantial bodily harm; or
(C) wrongful execution orincarceration of another; .
(2) to prevent the client from committing a crime or fraud that is reasonably certain to result in
substantial injUry to the financial interests or property of another and in furtherance of which
the client has used or is using the lawyer's services;
(3) to prevent, mitigate, or rectify substantial injury to the financial interests or property of
another that is reasonably certain to result or has resulted from the client's commission of a
crime or fraud in furtherance of which the client has used the lawyer's services;
(4) to secure legal advice about the lawyer's compliance with these Rules;

•

(5) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer
and the client, to establish a defense toa criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer
based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any
proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of the client; or
(6) to comply with other law or a court order.
(c) A lawyer must act competently to safeguard a client's confidences and secrets against

HISTORY: Amended eff. March 23, 2006 (933 So.2d 417)

NOTES:
COMMENT
The lawyer is part of a judicial system charged with upholding the law. One of the lawyer's functions is to advise
clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in the proper exercise of their rights.
This rule governs the disclosure by a lawyer of information relating to the representation of a client during the
lawyer's representation ofthe client. See rule 4-1.18 for the lawyer's duties with respect to information provided to the
lawyer by a prospective client, rule 4-1.9(b) for the lawyer's duty not to reveal information relating to the lawyer's prior
representation of a former client, and rules 4-1.8(b) and 4-1.9(b) for the lawyer's duties with respectto'the use of such
information to the disadvantage of clients and former clients.
A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that, in the absence ofthe client's informed consent, the
lawyer must not reveal information relating to the representation. See terminology for the definition of informed
consent. This contributes to the trust that is the hallmark of the client-lawyer relationship. The client is thereby
encouraged to seek legal assistance and to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as to embarrassing or
legally damaging subject matter. The lawyer needs this information to represent the client effectively and, if necessary,
to advise the client to refrain from wrongful conduct. Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to
determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. Based upon
experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.
The principle of confidentiality is given effect in 2 related bodies oflaw, the attorney-client privilege (which includes
the work product doctrine) in the law of evidence and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics. The
attorney-client privilege applies injudicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a witness or
otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies in
situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The confidentiality
rule applies not merely to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information relating to the
representation, whatever its source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or required by the
Rules of Professional Conduct or by'law. However, none of the foregoing limits the requirement of disclosure in
subdivision (b). This disclosure is required to prevent a lawyer from becoming an unwitting accomplice in the
fraudulent acts of a client. See also Scope.
,
The requirement of maintaining confidentiality of information relating to representation applies to government
lawyers who may disagree with the policy goals that their representation is designed to advance.
Authorized disclosure
A lawyer is impliedly authorized to make disclosures about a client when appropriate in carrying out the
representation, except to the extent that the client's instructions or special circumstances limit that authority. In
litigation, for example, a lawyer may disclose information by admitting a fact that cannot properly be disputed or in
negotiation by making a disclosure that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion.
Lawyers in a firm may, in the course of the firm's practice, disclose to each other information relating to a client of the
firm, unless the client has instructed that particular information be confined to specified lawyers.
Disclosure adverse to client
The confidentiality rule is subject to limited exceptions. In becoming privy to information about a client, a lawyer
may foresee that the client intends serious harm to another person. However, to the extent a lawyer is required or
permitted to disclose a client's purposes, the client will be inhibited from revealing facts that would enable the lawyer to
counsel against a wrongful course of action. While the public may be protected if full and open communication by the
client is encouraged, several situations must be distinguished.
First, the lawyer may not counselor assist a client in conduct that is criminal or fraudulent. See rule 4-1.2(d).
Similarly, a lawyer has a duty under nile 4-3.3(a)(4) not to use false evidence. This duty is essentially a special instance
of the duty prescribed in rule 4-1.2(d) to avoid assisting a client in criminal or fraudulent conduct.
Second, the lawyer may have been innocently involved in past conduct by the client that was criminal or fraudulent.

RULE 1.6 CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION

-----------_._._---------­
(a) A lawyer shall maintain in confidence all information gained in the professional
relationship with a client, including information which the client has requested to be held
inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would likely be detrimental to
the client, unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are
impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, or are required by these rules
or other law, or by order of the Court..
(b) (1) A lawyer may reveal information covered by paragraph (a) which the lawyer
reasonably believes necessary:
(i) to avoid or prevent harm or substantial financial loss to another as a result
of client criminal conduct or third party criminal conduct clearly in violation of
the law;
(ii) to prevent serious injury or death not otherwise covered by subparagraph
(i) above;
(iii) to establish a claini or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy
between the lawyer and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge
or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was
involved, or to respond to 4lllegations in any proceeding concerning the
lawyer's representation of the client.
(2) In a situation described in Subsection (1); if the client has acted at the time the
lawyer learns of the threat of harm or loss to a Victim, use or disclosure is
permissible only if the harm or loss has not yet occurred.
(3) Before using or disclosing information pursuant to Subsection (1), if feasible, the
lawyer must make a good faith effort to persuade the client either not to act or, jf
the client has already acted, to warn the victim.
(c) The lawyer may, where the law does not otherwise require, reveal information to which
the duty of confidentiality does not apply under paragraph (b) without being subjected to
disciplinary proceedings.
(d) The lawyer shall reveal information under paragraph (b) as the applicable law requires.
(e) The duty of confidentiality shall continue after the client-lawyer relationship has

terminated.

The maximum penalty for a violation of this Rule is disbarment.

NOTES:
COMMENT:
[1] The lawyer is part ofajudicial system charged with upholding the law. One of the lawyer's functions is to
advise clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in the proper exercise of their rights.
)

[2] The observance of the ethical obligation of a lawyer to hold inviolate confidential information of the client not
only facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper representation of the client but also encourages people
to seek early legal assistance.
[3] Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine what their rights are and what is, in the
maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. The common law recognizes that the client's confidences
must be protected from disclosure. Based upon experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the advice given,
and the law is upheld.
[4] A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that the lawyer maintain confidentiality of
information relating to the representation. The client is thereby encouraged to communicate fully and frankly with the
lawyer even as to embarrassing or legally damaging subject matter.
[5] The principle of confidentiality is given effect in two related bodies of law, the attorney-client privilege (which
includes the work product doctrine) in the law of evidence and the rule of confidentiality established in professional
ethics. The attorney-client privilege applies in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a
witness or otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies
in situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The confidentiality
rule applies not merely to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information relating to the
representation, whatever its source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or required by the
Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. See also Scope.
[6] The requirement of maintaining confidentiality of information relating to representation applies to government
lawyers who may disagree with the policy goals that their representation is designed to advance.

Authorized Disclosure
[7] A lawyer is impliedly authorized to make disclosures about a client when appropriate in carrying out the
representation, except to the extent that the client's instructions or special circumstances limit that authority. In
litigation, for example, a lawyer may disclose information by admitting a fact that cannot properly be disputed, or in
negotiation by making a disclosure that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion.
[8) Lawyers in a firm may, in the course of the firm's practice, disclose to each other information relating to a
client of the firm, unless the client has instructed that particular information be confined to specified lawyers.

Disclosure Adverse to Client
[9) The confidentiality rule is subject to limited exceptions. In becoming privy to information about a client, a
lawyer may realize that the client has used or intends to use the lawyer's services in the furtherance of criminal or
fraudulent conduct. Several situations are addressed by other rules. The lawyer may not counselor assist a client in
conduct that is criminal or fraudulent. See Rule 1.2(d). Similarly, a lawyer has a duty under Rule 3.3(a)(4) not to use

NOTES: Commentary
[1] This Rule governs the disclosure by a lawyer of information relating to the representation of a client during the
lawyer's representation of the client. See Rule 1.18 for the lawyer's duties with respect to information provided to the
lawyer by a prospective client, Rule 1.9(c)(2) for the lawyer's duty not to reveal information relating to the lawyer's
prior representation of a former client and Rules 1.8(b) and l:9(c)(I) for the lawyer's duties with respect to the use of

Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct

Page 18 of 121

[5]
An agreement may not be made whose terms might induce the lawyer improperly to curtail
services for the client or perform them in a way contrary to the client's interest. For example, a lawyer should
not enter into an agreement whereby services are to be provided only up to a stated amount when it is
foreseeable that more extensive services probably will be required, unless the situation is adequately explained
to the client. Otherwise, the client might have to bargain for further assistance in the midst of a proceeding or
transaction. However, it is proper to define the extent of serviees in light of the client's ability to pay. A lawyer
should not exploit a fee arrangement based primarily on hourly charges by using wasteful procedures.
Prohibited Contingent Fees
[6]
. Paragraph (d) prohibits a lawyer from charging a contingent fee in a dOq:lestic relations matter
when payment is contingent upon the securing of a dissolution or obtaining custody of a child or upon the .
amount of maintenance or support or property settlement to be obtained.
Division of Fee
[7]
A division of fee is a single billing to a client covering the fee of two or more lawyers who are
not in the same firm. A division of fee facilitates association of more than one lawyer in a matter in which
neither alone could serve the client as well, and most often is used when the fee is contingent and the division is
between a referring lawyer and a trial specialist. Paragraph (e) permits the lawyers to divide a fee either on the
basis of the proportion of services they render or if each lawyer assumes responsibility for the representation as
a whole. In addition, the client must agree to the arrangement, including the share that each lawyer is to receive,
and the agreement must be confirmed in writing. Contingent fee agreements must be in a writing signed by the
client and must otherwise comply with paragraph (c) of this Rule. Joint responsibility for the representation
entails financial and ethical responsibility for the representation as if the lawyers were associated in a
partnership. A lawyer should only refer a matter to a lawyer whom the referring lawyer reasonably believes is
competent to handle the matter. See Rule 1.1.
[8]
Paragraph (e) does not prohibit or regulate division of fees to be received in the future for work
done when lawyers were previously associated
in a law firm.
,
Disputes over Fees
[9]
If a procedure has been established for resolution of fee disputes, such as an arbitration or
mediation procedure established by the bar, the lawyer must comply with the procedure when it is mandatory,
and, even when it is voluntary, the lawyer should conscientiously consider submitting to it. Law may prescribe
a procedure for determining a lawyer's fee, for example, in representation of an executor or administrator, a
class or a person entitled to a reasonable fee as part of the measure of damages. The lawyer entitled to such a
fee and a lawyer representing another party concerned with the fee should comply with the prescribed
procedure.

Comment
[1]
This Rule governs the disclosure by a lawyer of information relating to the representation of a
client during the lawyer's representation of the client. See Rule 1.18 for the lawyer's duties with respect to
information provided to the lawyer by a prospective client, Rule 1.9(c)(2) for the lawyer's duty not to reveal
information relating to the lawyer's prior representation of a former client and Rules 1.8(b) and 1.9(c)( 1) for the
lawyer's duties with respect to the use of such information to the disadvantage of clients and former clients.
[2]
A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that, in the absence of the client's
informed consent, the lawyer must not reveal information relating to the representation. See Rule l.O(e) for the
definition of informed consent. This contributes to the trust that is the hallmark of the client-lawyer relationship.
The client is thereby encouraged to seek legal assistance and to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer
even as to embarrassing or legally damaging subject matter. The lawyer needs this information to represent the
client effectively and, if necessary, to advise the client to refrain from wrongful conduct. Almost without
exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and
regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow
the advice given, and the law is upheld.
[3]
The principle of client-lawyer confidentiality is given effect by related bodies of law: the
attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine and the rule of confidentiality established in professional
ethics. The attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which
a lawyer may be called as a witness or otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of
client-lawyer confidentiality applies in situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer

be called as a witness or otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a
client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies in situations other than those
where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The
confidentiality rule, for example, applies not only to matters communicated in
confidence by the client but also to all information relating to the representation,
whatever its source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as

COMMENT
[I] The lawyer is part ofajudicial system charged with upholding the law. One of the lawyer's functions is to
advise clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in the proper exercise of their rights.
[2] The observance of the ethical obligation of a lawyer to hold inviolate confidential information of the client not
only facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper representation of the client but also encourages people
to seek early legal assistance.
[3] Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine what their rights are and what is, in the
maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. The common law recognizes that the client's confidences
must be protected from disclosure.
[4] A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that the lawyer maintain confidentiality of
information relating to the representation. The client is thereby encouraged to communicate fully and frankly with the
lawyer even as to embarrassing or legally damaging subject matter.
[5] The principle of confidentiality is given effect in two related bodies of law, the attorney-client privilege (and the
related work product doctrine) in the law of evidence and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics.
The attorney-client privilege applies injddicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a witness or
otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies in
situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion oflaw. The confidentiality
rule applies not merely to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to virtually all information relating
to the representation, whatever its source. The term "confidential information" relating to representation of a client
therefore includes information described as "confidences" and "secrets" in former DR 4-101(A) but without the
limitation in the prior rules that the information be "embarrassing" or "detrimental" to the client. Former DR 4-101(A)
provided: "Confidence" refers to information protected by the attorney-client privilege under applicable law, and
"secret" refers to other information gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested be held inviolate
or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would likely to be detrimental to the client." See also Scope.
[5A] The word "virtually" appears in the fourth sentence of paragraph 5 above to reflect the common sense
understanding tharnot every piece of information that a lawyer obtains relating to a representation is protected
confidential information. While this understanding may be difficult to apply in some cases, some information is so
widely available or generally known that it need not be treated as confidential. The lawyer's discovery that there was
dense fog at the airport at a particular time does not fall within the rule. Such information is readily available. While a
client's disclosure of the fact of infidelity to a spouse is protected information, it normally would not-be after the client
publicly discloses such information on television and in newspaper interviews. On the other hand, the mere fact that
information disclosed by a client to a lawyer is a matter of public record does not mean that it may not fall within the
pr~tection of this rule. A client's disclosure of conviction of a crime in a different state a long time ago or disclosure of a
.secret marriage would be protected even if a matter of public record because such information was not generally known.

NOTES:
Comment--1991
This rule governs the disclosure by a lawyer of information relating to the representation of a client during the
lawyer's representation of the client. See Rule 1.18 for the lawyer's duties with respect to information provided to the
lawyer by a prospective client, Rule 1.9(c)(2) for the lawyer's duty not to reveal information relating to the lawyer's
prior representation of a former client and Rules 1.8(b) and 1.9(c)(1) for the lawyer's duties with respect to the use of
such information to the disadvantage of clients and former clients.
A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that, in the absence of the client's informed consent, the
lawyer must not reveal information relating to the representation. See Rule 1.0(f) for the definition of informed consent.
This contributes to the trust that is the hallmark of the client-lawyer relationship. The client is thereby encouraged to
seek legal assistance and to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as to embarrassing or legally damaging
subject matter. The lawyer needs this information to represent the client effectively and, if necessary, to advise the client
to refrain from wrongful conduct. Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine their rights
and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers
know that almost all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.
The principle of client-lawyer confideptiality is given effect by related bodies of law; the attorney-client privilege, the
work-product doctrine and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics. The attorney-client privilege and
work-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a witness or otherwise
required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies in situations other
than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The confidentiality rule, for example,
applies not only to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information relating to the
representation, whatever its source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or required by the
Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. See also Scope.
Paragraph (a) prohibits a lawyer from revealing information relating to the representation of a client. This prohibition
also applies to disclosures by a lawyer that do not in themselves reveal protected information but could reasonably lead
to the discovery of such information by a third person. A lawyer's use of a hypothetical to discuss issues relating to the
representation is permissible so long as there is no reasonable likelihood that the listener will be able to ascertain the
identity of the client or the situation involved.
Authorized Disclosure.
Except to the extent that the client's instructions or special circwnstances limit that authority, a lawyer is impliedly
authorized to make disclosures about a client when appropriate in carrying out the representation. In some situations, for
example, a lawyer may be impliedly authorized to admit a fact that cannot properly be disputed or to make a disclosure
that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion to a matter. Lawyers in a firm may, in the course of the firm's practice, disclose

NOTES:

COMMENT

The lawyer is part ofajudicial system charged with upholding thelaw. One of the lawyer's functions is to advise

clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in the proper exercise of their rights.

The observance of the ethical obligation of a lawyer to hold inviolate confidential information of the client not only
facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper representation ofthe client but also encourages people to
seek early legal assistance.
A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that, in the absence ofthe client's informed consent, the
lawyer must not reveal information relating to the representation. See Terminology for definition of "informed consent."
This contributes to the trust that is the hallmark of the client-lawyer relationship. The client is thereby encouraged to
seek legal assistance and to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as to embarrassing or legally damaging
subject matter. The lawyer needs this information to represent the client effectively and, if necessary, to advise the client
to refrain from wrongful conduct. Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine their rights
and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers
know that almost all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.
The principle of client-lawyer confidentiality is given effect by related bodies of law: the attorney-client privilege
the work product doctrine, and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics. The attorney-client and the
work product doctrine apply in judiciala,nd other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a witness or otherwise
required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies in situations other
than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The confidentiality rule, for example,
applies not only to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information relating to the
representation, whatever the source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or required by the
Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. See also Scope.
The requirement of maintaining confidentiality of information relating to representation applies to government

lawyers who may disagree with the policy goals that their representation is designed to advance.

Paragraph (a) prohibits a lawyer from revealing information relating to the representation of a client. This
prohibition also applies to disclosures by a lawyer that do not in themselves reveal protected information but could
reasonably lead to the discovery of such information by a third person. A lawyer's use of a hypothetical to discuss issues
relating to the representation is permissible so long as there is no reasonable likelihood that the listener will be able to·
ascertain the identity of the client or the situation involved.
Authorized Disclosure. -- Except to the extent that the client's instructions or special circumstances limit that

authority, a lawyer is impliedly authorized to make disclosures about a client when appropriate in carrying out the

representation. In some situations, for example, a lawyer may be impliedly authorized to admit a fact that cannot

properly be disputed or to make adisclosure that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion to a matter.

NOTES:

Ethics Committee Comment
The New Hampshire Rule permits the disclosure of any criminal act involving death or bodily harm or substantial
injury to the financial interest or property of another. Rule 1.6 should not be viewed as a departure from the general rule
of client confidentiality, and should not be interpreted to encourage lawyers to disclose the confidences of their clients.
The disclosure of client confidences is an extreme and irrevocable act. Hopefully no New Hampshire lawyer will be
subject to censure for either disclosing or failing to disclose client confidences, as the lawyer's individual conscience
may dictate.

CASE NOTES

1. Where an attorney had formerly jointly represented the Chapter 7 debtor and an alleged patent infringer in a
patent infringement case, the patent infringer's subsequent malpractice suit against the attorney did not waive the
Chapter 7 debtor's attorney-client privilege, so as to permit the patent owner to obtain discovery from the attorney in its
proceeding against the Chapter 7 debtor seeking to deny the debtor a bankruptcy discharge; permitting discovery in
these circumstances would abrade both the attorney-client privilege and the intent of the Rules ofProfessional Conduct.

2. Attorney who represented defendant in prior bail proceedings was erroneously permitted to defend his
co-defendant at their joint trial for possession of cocaine, in which their defenses were mutually antagonistic, because
the attorney's appearance on behalf of defendant with respect to the bail motion constituted representation under the
prohibition of N.J. R. Prof Conduct 1.9, ,and an attorney's appearance on behalf of an accused at pretrial release
hearings constitutes a significant part of his representation of the client. State v. Sanders, 260 NJ. Super. 491, 616 A.2d

purposes of this Rule, "client" refers to lawyers seeking assistance from lawyers' or judges' assistance programs

. approved by the North Carolina State Bar or the North Carolina Supreme Court.
NOTES: COMMENT
[I] This Rule governs the disclosure by a lawyer of information relating to the representation of a client acquired during
the lawyer's representation of the client. See Rule 1.18 for the lawyer's duties with respect to infonnation provided to
the lawyer by a prospective client, Rule 1.9(c)(2) for the lawyer's duty not to reveal information acquired during a
lawyer's prior representation of a former client and Rules 1.8(b) and 1.9(c)(I) for the lawyer's duties with respect to the
use of such information to the disadvantage of clients and former clients.
[2] A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that, in the absence of the client's informed consent, the
lawyer must not reveal information acquired during the representation. See Rule I.D(e) for the definition of infonned
consent. This contributes to the trust that is the hallmark of the client-lawyer relationship. The client is thereby
encouraged to seek legal assistance and to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as to embarrassing or
legally damaging subject matter. The lawyer needs this information to represent the client effectively and, if necessary,
to advise the client to refrain from wrongful conduct. Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to
determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. Based upon
experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.
[3] The principle of client-lawyer confidentiality is giyen effect by related bodies of law: the attorney-client privilege,
the work product doctrine and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics. The attorney-client privilege
and work-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a witness or
otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies in
situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The confidentiality
rule, for example, applies not only to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information
acquired during the representation, whatever its source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as
authorized or required by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. See also Scope.
[4] Paragraph (a) prohibits a lawyer from revealing information acquired during the representation of a client. This
prohibition also applies to disclosures by a lawyer that do not in themselves reveal protected infonnation but could
reasonably lead to the discovery of such information by a third person. A lawyer's use of a hypothetical to discuss issues
relating to the representation is permissi$le so long as there is no reasonable likelihood that the listener will be able to
ascertain the identity of the client or the situation involved.
Authorized Disclosure
[5] Except to the extent that the client's instructions or special circumstances limit that authority, a lawyer is impliedly
authorized to make disclosures about a client when app.ropriate in carrying out the representation. Insome situations, for
example, a lawyer may be impliedly authorized to admit a fact that cannot properly be disputed or to make a disclosure
that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion to a matter. Lawyers in a firm may, in the course of the finn's practice, disclose
to each other information relating to a client of the firm, unless the client has instructed that particular information be
confined to specified lawyers.
Disclosure Adverse to Client
[6] Although the public interest is usually best served by a strict rule requiring lawyers to preserve the confidentiality of
information acquired during the representation of their clients, the confidentiality rule is subject to limited exceptions.
In becoming privy to information about a client, a lawyer may foresee that the client intends to commit a crime.
Paragraph (b)(2) recognizes that a lawyer should be allowed to make a disclosure to avoid sacrificing the interests of the
potential victim in favor of preserving the client's confidences when the client's purpose is wrongful. Similarly,
paragraph (b)(3) recognizes the overriding value of life and physical integrity and permits disclosure reasonably
necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm. Such harm is reasonably certain to occur if it
will be suffered imminently or if there is a present and substantial threat that a person will suffer such harm at a later
date if the lawyer fails to take action necessary to eliminate the threat. Thus, a lawyer who knows that a client has
accidentally discharged toxic waste into a town's water supply may reveal this infonnation to the authorities ifthere is a
present and substantial risk that a person who drinks the water will contract a life-threatening or debilitating disease and

CASE NOTES

1. In a dispute involving a retention lien, a trial court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of a firm because
the court should have balanced the firm's need for a lien against the prejudice to the client; the firm was required to
mitigate consequences to the client at the termination of the attorney-client relationship. Britton & Gray, Poe. v.
Shelton, 2003 OK CIV APP 40, 69 P.3d 1210, 2003 Okla. Civ. App. LEXIS 17, 74 Okla. BJ 1758 (Okla. Ct. App. Feb,

"3. The SUl?reme Court of Oklahoma hasdefmed three levels of applicable culpability when evaluating the mishandling
of client funds: I) commingling; 2) simple conversion; and 3) misappropriation, i.e., theft by conversion or otherwise.
Commingling, when client monies were combined with the attorney's personal funds, occurrs when an attorney placed
client funds that were not subject to a lien with personal funds, but did not rise to the level of misappropriation since the
client was not deprived of monies; however, the attorney was guilty of mishandling funds by commingling the funds
and converting them by using them for office expenses while the client was told that the initial check received for back
support owed from a former spouse had bounced. State ex reI. Okla. Bar Ass'n v. Meek, 1994 Okla. LEXIS 134,1994

information gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested be held inviolate or the disclosure of
which would be embarrassing or would be likely to be detrimental to the client unless the client consents after

confidential.
(c) A lawyer shall promptly reveal:
(1) the intention of a client, as stated by the client, to commit a crime and the information necessary to prevent the
crime, but before revealing such information, the attorney shall, where feasible, advise the client of the possible legal
consequences of the action, urge the client not to commit the crime, and advise the client that the attorney must reveal
the client's criminal intention unless thereupon abandoned, and, if the crime involves perjury by the client, that the
attorney shall seek to withdraw as counsel;
(2) information which clearly establishes that the client has, in the course of the representation, pewetrated a fraud
related to the subject matter of the representation upon a tribunal. Before reveallng such information, however, the
lawyer shall request that the client advise the tribunal of the fraud. For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph
(b )(3), information is clearly established when the client acknowledges to the attorney that the client has perpetrated a
fraud; or
(3) information concerning the misconduct of another attorney to the appropriate professional authority under Rule
8.3. When the information necessary to report the misconduct is protected under this Rule, the attorney, after
consultation, must obtain client consent. Consultation should include full disclosure of all reasonably foreseeable
consequences of both disclosure and non-disclosure to the client.
NOTES: . [1] The lawyer is part ofa judicial system charged with upholding the law. One of the lawyer's functions is to
advise clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in the proper exercise oftheir rights.
[2] The common law recognizes that the client's confidences must be protected from disclosure. The observance of
the ethical obligation of a lawyer to hold inviolate confidential information of the client not only facilitates the full
development of facts essential to proper representation of the client but also encourages people to seek early legal
assistance.
[2a] Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine what their rights are and what is,in
the maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers know that clients
usually follow the advice given, and the l'aw is upheld.
[2b] A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that the lawyer maintain confidentiality of
information relating to the representation. The client is thereby encouraged to communicate fully and frankly with the
lawyer even as to embarrassing or legally damaging subject matter.
[3] The principle of confidentiality is given effect in two related bodies of law, the attorney-client privilege (which
includes the work product doctrine) in the law of evidence and the rule of confidentiality established in professional
ethics. The attorney-client privilege applies in judicial and oth~r proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a
witness or otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies
in situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The confidentiality
rule applies not merely to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information protected by the
attorney-client privilege under applicable law or other information gained in the professional relationship that the client
has requested be held inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would be likely to be detrimental to
the client, whatever its source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or required by the
Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.
[3a] The rules governing confidentiality of information apply to a lawyer who represents an organization of which
the lawyer is an employee.
. [4] The requirement of maintaining confidentiality of information relating to representation applies to government

NOTES: COMMENT
See also Washington Comment [19].
[1 ] [Washington revision] This Rule governs the disclosure by a lawyer of information relating to the representation
of a client. See Rule 1.18 for the lawyer's duties with respect to information provided to the lawyer by a prospective
client, Rule 1.9(c)(2) for the lawyer's duty not to reveal information relating to the lawyer's prior representation of a
former client and Rules 1.8(b) and 1.9(c)( I) for the lawyer's duties with respect to the use of such information to the
disadvantage of clients and former clients.
[2] A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that, in the absence of the client's informed consent,
the lawyer must not reveal information relating to the representation. See Rule I.O(e) for the definition of informed
consent. This contributes to the trust that is the hallmark of the client-lawyer relationship. The client is thereby
encouraged to seek legal assistance and to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as to embarrassing or
legally damaging subject matter. The lawyer needs this information to represent the client effectiv~ly and, if necessary,
to advise the client to refrain from wrongful conduct. Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to
determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. Based upon
experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.
[3] The principle of client-lawyer confidentiality is given effect by related bodies of law: the attorney-client
privilege, the work product doctrine and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics. The attorney-client
privilege and work-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a
witness or otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies
in situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. The confidentiality
rule, for example, applies not only to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information
relating to the representation, whatever its• source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or
required by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. See also Scope.
[4] Paragraph (a) prohibits a lawyer from revealing information relating to the representation ofa client. This
prohibition also applies to disclosures by a lawyer that do notin themselves reveal protected information but could
reasonably lead to the discovery of such information by a third person. A lawyer's use of a hypothetical to discuss issues
relating to the representation is permissible so long as there is no reasonable likelihood that the listener will be able to
ascertain the identity of the client or the situation involved.
Authorized Disclosure
[5] Except to the extent that the client's instructions or special circumstances limit that authority, a lawyer is
impliedly authorized to make disclosures about a client when appropriate in carrying out the representation. In some
situations, for example, a lawyer may be impliedly authorized to admit a fact that cannot properly be disputed or to
make a disclosure that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion to a matter. Lawyers in a firm may, in the course of the firm's
practice, disclose to each other information relating to a client of the firm, unless the client has instructed that particular
information be confined to specified lawyers.
Disclosure Adverse to Client
[6] [Washington revision] Although the public interest is usually best served by a strict rule requiring lawyers to
preserve the confidentiality of information relating to the representation of their clients, the confidentiality rule is

with upholding the law. One of the lawyer's functions is to advise clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in
the proper exercise of their rights.
[2] The observance of the ethical obligation ofa lawyer to hold inviolate confidential infonnation of the client not
only facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper representation of the client but also encourages people
to seek early legal assistance.
[3] Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to detennine what their rights are and what is, in
the maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. The common law recognizes that the client's
confidences must be protected from disclosure. Based upon experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the
advice given, and the law is upheld.

Page 2
Wyo. Prof. Conduct Rule 1.6

[4] This Rule governs the disclosure by a lawyer of information relating to the representation of a client during the
lawyer's representation of the client. See Rule 1.18 for the lawyer's duties with respect to information provided to the
lawyer by a prospective client, Rule 1.9(c)(2) for the lawyer's duty not to reveal information relating to the lawyer's
prior representation of a former client and Rules 1.8(b) and 1.9(c)(I)' for the lawyer's duties with respect to the use of
such information to the disadvantage of clients and former clients.
[5] A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that, in the absence of the client's informed
decision, the lawyer must not reveal confidential information relating to the representation. See Rule 1.0(b) for the
definition of confidential information and Rule 1.0(f) for the definition of informed decision. This contributes to the
trust that is the hallmark of the client-lawyer relationship. The client is thereby encouraged to seek legal assistance and
to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as to embarrassing or legally damaging subject matter. The
lawyer needs this information to represent the client effectively and, if necessary, to advise the client to refrain from
wn;mgful conduct. Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine their rights and what is, in
the complex oflaws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers know that almost
all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.
[6] The principle of client-lawyer confidentiality is given effect by related bodies of law: the attorney-client
privilege, the work-product doctrine and the rule of confidentiality established in these rules. The attorney-client
privilege and work-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a
witness or otherwise required to produ«e evidence concerning a client. The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies
in situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law, The confidentiality
rule, for example, applies not only to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information
relating to the representation, whatever its source. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or
required by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. See also Scope.
[7] Paragraph (a) prohibits a lawyer from revealing confidential information relating to the representation ofa
client. This prohibition also applies to disclosures by a lawyer that do not in themselves reveal protected information but
could reasonably lead to the discovery of such information by a third person. A lawyer's use of a hypothetical to discuss
issues relating to the representation is permissible so long as there is no reasonable likelihood that the listener will be
able to ascertain the identity of the client,or the situation involved.
Authorized Disclosure. [8] Except to the extent that the client's instructions or special circumstances limit that
authority, a lawyer is impliedly authorized to make disclosures about a client when appropriate in carrying out the
representation. In some situations, for example, a lawyer may be impliedly authorized to admit a fact that cannot
properly be disputed or to make a disclosure that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion to a matter. Lawyers in a finn may,
in the course of the firm's practice, disclose to each other information relating to a client ofthe fmn, unless the client
has instructed that particular infonnation be confined to specified lawyers;
Disclosure Adverse to Client. [9] Several situations must be distinguished.
[10] First, the lawyer may not counselor assist a client in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent.
See Rule 1.2(d). Similarly, a lawyer has a duty under Rule 3.3(a)(3) not to use false evidence. This duty is essentially a
special instance of the duty prescribed in Rule 1.2(d) to avoid assisting a client in criminal or fraudulent conduct.
[11] Second, the lawyer may have been innocently involved in past conduct by the client that was criminal or
fraudulent. In such a situation the lawyer has not violated Rule 1.2(d), because to "counselor assist" criminal or
fraudulent conduct requires knowing that the conduct is of that character.
[12] Third, the lawyer may learn that a client intends prospective conduct that is criminal. As stated in paragraph
(b)(I), the lawyer has professional discretion to reveal information in order to prevent such criminal acts. The lawyer
may make a disclosure in order to prevent the criminal act which the lawyer reasonably believes is intended by the

Page 3
Wyo. Prof. Conduct Rule 1.6

client It is very difficult for a lawyer to "know" when such a purpose will actually be carried out for the client may have
a change of mind.
[13] Fourth, a lawyer appointed to act as a guardian ad litem represents the best interests of that individual, not the
individual. As stated in paragraph (b)(3), the lawyer has professional discretion to reveal information in order to protect
the individual's best interests. Any such disclosure should be no greater than that which the lawyer reasonably believes
necessary to protect the individual's best interests.
[14] A lawyer's confidentiality obligations do not preclude a lawyer from securing confidential legal advice about
the lawyer's personal responsibility to comply with these Rules.. In most situations, disclosing information to secure
such advice will be impliedly authorized for the lawyer to carry out the representation. Even when the disclosure is not
impliedly authorized, paragraph (bX2) permits such disclosure because of the importance of a lawyers complianc~ with
the Rules of Professional Conduct.
[15] Where a legal claim or disciplinary charge alleges complicity of the lawyer in a client's conduct or other
misconduct of the lawyer involving representation ofthe client, the lawyer may respond to the extent the lawyer
reasonably believes necessary to establish a defense. The same is true with respect to a claim involving the conduct or
representation of a former client. Such a charge can arise in a civil, criminal, disciplinary or other proceeding and can be
based on a wrong allegedly committed by the lawyer against the client or on a wrong alleged by a third person, for
example, a person claiming to have been defrauded by the lawyer and client acting together. The lawyer's right to
respond arises when an assertion of such complicity has been made. Paragraph (b)(3) does not require the lawyer to
await the commencement of an action or proceeding that charges such complicity, so that the defense may be
established by responding directly to a third party who has made such an assertion. The right to defend also applies, of
course, where a proceeding has been commenced.
[16] A lawyer entitled to a fee is permitted by paragraph (b)(3) to prove the services rendered in an action to
collect it. This aspect of the rule expresses the principle that the beneficiary of a fiduciary relationship may not exploit it
to the detriment of the fiduciary.
[17] Other law may require that a lawyer disclose information about a client. See Wyoming Statute Sections
14-3-205 and 35-20-103. Whether such a law supersedes Rule 1.6 is a question oflaw beyond the scope of these Rules.
When disclosure of information relating to the representation appears to be required by other law, the lawyer must
discuss the matter with the client to the extent required by Rule 1.4. If, however, the other law supersedes this Rule and
requires disclosure, paragraph (b)(4) permits the lawyer to make such disclosures as are necessary to comply with the
law.
[18] A lawyer may be ordered to reveal information relating to the representation of a client by a court or by
another tribunal or governmental entity claiming authority pursuant to other law to compel the disclosure. Absent an
informed decision of the client to do otherwise, the lawyer should assert on behalf of the client all nonfrivolous claims
that the order is not authorized by other law or that the information sought is protected against disclosure by the
attorney-client privilege or other applicable law. In the event of an adverse ruling, the lawyer must consult with the
client about the possibility of appeal to the extent required by Rule 104. Unless review is sought, however, paragraph
(b)(4) permits the lawyer to comply with the court's order.
[19] Paragraph (b) permits disclosure only to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes the disclosure is necessary
to accomplish one of the purposes specified. Where practicable,.. the lawyer should first seek to persuade the client to
take suitable action to obviate the need for disclosure. ·In any case, a disclosure adverse to the client's interest should be
no greater than the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to accomplish the purpose. If the disclosure will be made in
connection with a judicial proceeding, the disclosure should be made in a manner that limits access to the information to
the tribunal or other persons having a need to know it and appropriate protective orders or other arrangements should be
sought by the lawyer to the fullest extent practicable.

Page 4
Wyo. Prof. Conduct Rule 1.6

[20] Paragraph (b) permits but does not require the disclosure of information relating to a client's representation to
accomplish the purposes specified in paragraphs (b)( I) through (b)(4). In exercising the discretion conferred by this
Rule, the lawyer may consider such factors as the nature of the lawyer's relationship with the client and with those who
might be injured by the client, the lawyer's own involvement in the transaction and factors that may extenuate the
conduct in question. A lawyer's decision not to disclose as permitted-by paragraph (b) does not violate this Rule.
Disclosure may be required, however, by other rules. Some rules require disclosure only if such disclosure would be
permitted by paragraph (b). See Rules 1.2(d), 4.1 (b), 8.1 and 8.3. Rule 3.3, conversely, requires disclosure in some
circumstances regardless of whether such disclosure is permitted by this Rule. See Rule 3.3(c).
Withdrawal. [21] If the lawyer's services will be used by the client in materially furthering a course of criminal or
fraudulent conduct, the lawyer must withdraw, as stated in Rule 1.16(a)(I). After withdrawal the lawyer is required to
refrain from making disclosure of the client's confidences, except as otherwise permitted in Rule 1.6. Neither this Rule
nor Rule 1.8(b) nor Rule 1.16(d) prevents the lawyer from giving notice of the fact of withdrawal, and the lawyer may
also withdraw or disaffirm any opinion, document, affirmation, or the like. Where the client is an organization, the
lawyer may be in doubt whether contemplated conduct will actually be carried out by the organization. Where necessary
to guide conduct in connection with this Rule, the lawyer may make inquiry within the organization as indicated in Rule
1.13(b).
[22] The attorney-client privilege is differently defined in various jurisdictions. If a lawyer is called as a witness to
give testimony concerning a client, absent waiver by the client, paragraph (a) requires the lawyer to invoke the privilege
when it is applicable. The lawyer must comply with the final orders of a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction
requiring the lawyer to give information about the client.
Acting Competently to Preserve Confidentiality. [23] A lawyer must act competently to safeguard confidential
information relating to the representation of a client against inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure by the lawyer or
other persons who are participating in the representation of the client or who are subject to the lawyer's supervision. See
Rules 1.1,5.1 and 5.3.
[24] When transmitting a cOl11Ilfunication that includes information relating to the representation of a client, the
lawyer must take reasonable precautions to prevent the information from coming into the hands of unintended
recipients. This duty, however, does not require that the lawyer use special security measures if the method of
communication affords a reasonable expectation of privacy. Special circumstances, however, may warrant special
precautions. Factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of the lawyer's expectation of confidentiality
include the sensitivity of the information and the extent to which the privacy of the communication is protected by law
or by a confidentiality agreement. A client may require the lawyer to implement special security measures not required
by this Rule or may make an informed decision to the use of a means of communication that would otherwise be
prohibited by this Rule.
Former Client. [25] The duty of confidentiality continues after the client-lawyer relationship has terminated. See
Rule 1.9(c)(2). See Rule 1.9(c)(I) for the prohibition against using such information to the disadvantage of the fonner
client.

Formal Opinion 01-424
September 22, 2001
A Former In-House Lawyer May Pursue a Wrongful Discharge Claim Against Her Former Employer and
Client As Long As Client Information Properly Is Protected
The Model Rules do not prohibit a lawyer from suing herformer client and employerfor retaliatory
discharge. In pursuing such a claim, however, the lawyer. must take care not to disclose client information
beyond that information the lawyer reasonably believes is necessary to establish her claim.
Retaliatory Discharge Claims
In this opinion, we address the constraints that may be imposed on retaliatory or wrongful discharge claims
by in-house lawyers against their former employers and clients under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. We
note at the outset that the Committee does not address the legal question of whether the discharge ofan in-house
lawyer - even one that alleges that the employer has "retaliated" for the lawyer's proper adherence,to her ethical
obligations - gives rise to an enforceable claim. I The Committee only addresses the ethical considerations that arise
under the Model Rules when such an action is permitted under applicable state law. 2
IThis opinion also does not address a retaliatory discharge claim by a lawyer against the law firm by which she is
employed. A retaliatory discharge claim by a former in-house lawyer may be distinguished from a wrongful
discharge suit by a lawyer against a law firm. A law fIrm and lawyer are bound to conduct their practices in
accordance with prevailmg ethical obligations. Wiederv. Skala, 80 N.Y.2d 628, 636,609 N.E.2d 105, 108,593
NY.S.2d 752, 755 (N.y. 1992). The employer of an in-house lawyer necessarily is not bound by legal ethical rules.
See Mourad v. Automobile Club Ins. Ass'n, 465 N.W.2d 395,400 (Mich. Ct. App. 1991). In Wieder, an associate
sued a law fIrm claiming he was fIred for insisting that the fIrm comply with governing disciplinary rules and that it
report the misconduct of another associate. 80 N.Y.2d at 631,609 N.E.2d at 106, 593 N.Y.S.2d at 753. The New
York Court of Appeals held there was an implied obligation that both the fIrm and the associate would carry out the
employment contract in compliance with ethical obligations, meaning the fIrm could not require an associate to
violate ethical obligations in order to keep his job. , 80 N.Y.2d at 636,609 N.E.2d at 108,593 N.Y.S.2d at 755.
2 Courts permit retaliatory discharge claims by former employees as an exception to the employment-at-will
doctrine, which avows that when an employee does not have a written employment contract and the term of
employment is of indefmite duration, the employer can terminate the employee for" good cause, bad cause, or no
cause at all." See generally Pugh v.'See's Candies, Inc., 116 Cal. App. 3d 311,319-21, 171 Cal. Rptr. 917, 920-22
(1st Dist. 1981); Brian F. Berger, Note, Defining Public Policy Torts In At-Will Dismissals, 37 STANFORD L. REv.
153, 153 (1981). The exception providef relief to employees discharged for reasons contrary to public policy, such
as for exercising statutory or constitutional rights or for whistleblowing when an employee refuses to violate the law
and reports an employer's wrongdoing. E.g., Parker v. M & T Chemicals, 236 N.J.Super. 451, 460, 566 A.2d 215,
220 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1989) (court construed state whistleblower act as compelling a retaliating employer
to pay damages to an employee-lawyer who is discharged wrongfully or mistreated for refusing to join a scheme to
cheat a competitor or for any reason that is violative oflaw, fraudulent, criminal, or incompatible with a clear
mandate of the state's public policy concerning public health, safety or welfare); Perks v. Firestone Tire & Rubber
Co., 611 F.2d 1363, 1365-66 (3d. Cir. 1979) (Pennsylvania statute forbidding employer from requiring polygraph
test as condition for employment or continuation of employment embodies a recognized facet of public policy). In
addition, certain states have enacted legislation in this area. For example, in Louisiana, an employment contract in
restrain of membership in labor organizations is contrary to public policy. La. Rev. Stat. Ann § 823 (West 2001).
Employers faced with retaliatory discharge suits from former in-house lawyers assert an absolute right to
discharge their lawyer at any time and for any reason because no client should be forced into representation by a
lawyer in whom that "conftdence and trust lying at the heart of a fIduciary relationship has been lost." General
Dynamics Corp. v. Superior Court, 7 Cal.4th 1164, 1174,876 P.2d 487, 493, 32 CaLRptr.2d 1,7 (Cal. 1994); Parker
v. M & T Chemicals, 236 N.J.super. at 458,566 A.2d at 219. The absolute right to terminate an in-house lawyer
under any circumstances without consequence has been limited, however, by a number of courts in recent years that
have noted that the in-house lawyer uniquely is bound to her client. Where outside counsel face dilemma with
clients, the in-house lawyer faces "a virtually complete dependence on the good will and confIdence of a single
employer to provide livelihood and career success." General Dynamics, 7 Cal.4th at 1182, 876 P.2d at 498.32
Cal.Rptr.2d at 12. Thus, some courts have permitted the retaliatory discharge claim by the former in-house lawyer.
These courts fmd there are compelling reasons of public policy that make it appropriate to impose legal

1

The Model Rules and Retaliatory Discharge Claims
There is nothing in the Model Rules that precludes a lawyer from suing her former client and, in fact, the
Rules contemplate that such actions may occur.3
The principal obligations of a lawyer to her former client are to continue to maintain the confidentiality of
the client information learned during the course of the representation and to neither "use information relating to the
representation to the disadvantage of the former client" nor "reveal information relating to the representation'>'!
except, in both cases, as pennitted by Rule 1.6 or Rule 3.3. 5 Under Rule 1.6(b)(2), a lawyer may reveal information·

consequences for dismissing an in-house lawyer. Specifically, they conclude that the public has an interest in
insuring that lawyers abide by their ethical obligations.
Courts also have recognized state-adopted codes of ethics for lawyers as a reflection of public policy. E.g.,
Mourad v. Automobile Club, 465 N.W.2d 395 at 400 (court refused to address in-house lawyer's retaliatory
discharge claim but held that lawyer could maintain action for breach of contract based on retaliatory demotion and
constructive discharge resulting from his refusal to violate code ofprofessional conduct). In addition to Mourad,
other courts that have provided relief to an in-house lawyer dismissed in retaliation for either insisting on adhering
to mandatory ethical norms of the profession ·or for refusing to violate them include GTE Products Corp. v. Stewart,
421 Mass. 22,29,653 N.E.2d 161, 165 (Mass. 1995) (public interest is better served if in-house counsel's resolve to
comply with ethical and statutorily mandated duties is strengthened by providing judicial recourse when an
employer's demands are in direct and unequivocal conflict with those duties) and General Dynamics Corp., 7 Ca1.4th
at 1186, 876 P.2d at 501,32 Cal.Rptr.2d at 15 (in-house counsel should be permitted to pursue a claim for wrongful
discharge if the claim is "founded on allegations that an in-house attorney was terminated for refusing to violate a
mandatory ethical duty embodied in (the state's code of professional conduct]"). See also Willy v. Coastal Corp.,
647 F. Supp. 116, 118 (S.D. Tex. 1986), rev'd on other grounds, 855 F.2d 1160 (5th Cit. 1988) (implying that code
of ethics reflected public policy, but holding other remedies, such as withdrawal from representation, sufficient to
avoid violating public policy); Herbster v. North American Co., 501 N.E.2d 343,346-48 (Ill. App. Ct. 1986), appeal
dismissed, 114 Ill.2d 545, 108 Ill. Dec. 417, 508 N.E.2d 728 (1987) (stating that code of ethics reflected public
policy despite disallowing vice-president in charge of legal department's retaliatory discharge claim). On the other
hand, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected a lawyer retaliatory discharge claim in Balla v. Gambro, 145 IlUd 492,
501-02,584 N.E.2d 104,108-09,164 Ill. Dec. 892, 896-97 (Ill. 1991), on the grounds that public policy adequately
is safeguarded without extending the tort of retaliatory discharge to in-house counsel and that pennitting such suits
would have an undesirable effect on the lawyer-client relationship.
3See MODEL RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT Rule 1.6 (2001). Rule 1.6 states:
(a) A lawyer shall not reveal kformation relating to representation of a client unless the client consents
after consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the
representation, and except as stated in paragraph (b).
.
(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:
(1) to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that the lawyer believes is likely to result
in imminent death or substantial bodily hann; or
(2) to establish a claw or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer
and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer
based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any
proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of the client.
4 Rule 1.9 states in part:
(c) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter of whose present or former firm has
formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter:
(l) use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except
as Rule 1. 6 or Rule 3.3 would pennit or require with respect to a client, or when the information
has become generally known; or
(2) reveal information relating to the representation except as Rule 1.6 or Rule 3.3 would
pennit or require with respect to a client.
5 Rule 3.3 states in pertinent part:
(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:
(I) make a false statement of material fact Or law to a tribunal;

2

relating to the representation of the client "to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary ... to establish a
claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client ...."
The term "claim" is not defined under the Model Rules. In the predecessor Code of Professional
Responsibility, DR 4-101 (C) allowed a lawyer to reveal "confidences or secrets necessary to establish or collect his
fee or to defend himself or his employees or associates against an accusation of wrongful conduct.,,6 .When the
Model Rules were adopted in 1983, the Comments explained: "With regard to paragraph (b)(2), DR 4-101 (c)(4)
provided that a lawyer may reveal 'confidences or secrets necessary to establish or collect his fee or to defend
himself or his employers or associates against an accusation of wrongful conduct.' Paragraph (b)(2) enlarges the
exception to include disclosure of information relating to claims by the lawyer other than for the lawyer's fee--for
example, recovery of property from the client.,,7 Recently, the Montana Supreme Court concluded that Rule 1.6 of
the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, which is identical to Model Rule 1.6, contemplates revealing
confidential client information by a former in-house lawyer pursuing a retaliatory discharge claim against her former
employer. 8 We conclude that a retaliatory discharge or similar claim by an in-house lawyer against her employer is
a "claim" under Rule 1.6(b)(2).
Only Necessary Information May Be Disclosed
In pursuing a retaliatory discharge claim, however, the lawyer must limit disclosure of confidential client
information to the extent reasonably possible. A comment to Rule 1.6 provides that "[a] lawyer must make every
effort practicable to avoid unnecessary disclosure of information relating to a representation, to limit disclosure to
those having the need to know it, and to obtain protective orders or make other arrangements limiting the risk of
disclosure. ,,9
The measures necessary to protect information that may be disclosed will be unique to each situation. For
example, a lawyer should consider the protections offered by in camera review at a pre-trial evidentiary hearing. To
prevent unnecessary disclosure of confidential information, a lawyer should consider requesting that a court seal the
record of the proceedings 10 and consider in an appropriate case whether the action should go forward without
diseIosing even the names ofthe parties. II
Conclusion
Retaliatory discharge actions provide relief to employees fired for reasons contradicting public policy. The
Model Rules do not prevent an in-house lawyer from pursuing a suit for retaliatory discharge when a lawyer was
discharged for complying with her ethical obligations. An in-house lawyer pursuing a wrongful discharge claim
must comply with her duty of confidentiality to her former client and may reveal information to the extent necessary
to establish her claim against her employer. The lawyer must take reasonable affIrmative steps, however, to avoid
unnecessary disclosure and limit the inf'omlation revealed.!

(2) fail to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a
criminal or fraudulent act by the client,
(3) fail to disclose to the tribunallegai authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the
lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or
(4) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. Ifa lawyer has offered material evidence
and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures.
(b) The duties stated in paragraph (a) continue to the conclusion of the proceeding, and apply even if
compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.

Information Relating to the Representation of a Client:

Lawyer's Wrongful Termination Claim


Facts:
Lawyer is in-house counsel and general manager of Company." In
the course of applying for a patent on behalf of Company, Lawyer
learned that the product was not invented by Company, but was in fact
invented by Company's customer. The patent application required Lawyer
to swear on behalf of Company that Company was the "original and fIrst
inventor." A person who makes a misrepresentation on a patent
application is subject to criminal prosecution. Lawyer refused to make the
representatiori that Company was the original and fIrst inventor, and was .
fIred. Lawyer wishes to pursue a civil action for wrongful termination in
which it will be necessary to disclose information about these events.
Question:
May Lawyer bring a civil action for wrongful termination if
bringing the action requires disclosure of information relating to Lawyer's
representation of Company?
•

Conclusion:
Yes, qualifIed.
Discussion:
Relying on the general rule that "a client may terminate the
relationship between himself and his lawyer with or without cause,"l
some courts decline to recognize the tort of wrongful discharge in the
case of in-house counsel. Some courts reach that conclusion, in part,
because recognizing the claim would permit lawyers to disclose client
confIdences and secrets. Balla v. Gambro, Inc., 585 NE2d 104, 109, 145
I1l2d 492 (1991); Eckhous v. Alfa-Laval, Inc., 764 F Supp 34, 37
(SDNY). There are presently no dispositive Oregon Supreme Court cases
on this issue.

Formal Opinion No. 2005-136

A discussion of whether, or under what circumstances, a fonner in­
house counsel can state a claim for wrongful termination is a matter of
substantive law, and beyond the-scope of this opinion. For purposes of
discussion, however, we assume that such a claim can be stated.
In asserting such a claim, Lawyer is bound by Oregon RPC 1.6,
which provides:
(a)
A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the
representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the
disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation
or the disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).
(b) A lawyer may reveal information relating to the
representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes
necessary:
(l)
to disclose the intention of the lawyer's client to commit a
crime and the information necessary to prevent the crime;

(2)

to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily

harm;
(3) to secure legal advice about the lawyer's compliance with
these Rules;
(4) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in
a controversy between the lawyer and the client, to establish a defense
to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon
conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations
in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of the client;

,

(5)
to comply with other law, court order, or as permitted by
these Rules; or
(6)
to provide the following information in discussions
preliminary to the sale of a -law practice under Rule 1.17 with respect to
each client potentially subject to the transfer: the client's identity; the
identities of any adverse parties; the nature and extent of the legal
services involved; and fee and payment information. A potential
purchasing lawyer shall have the same responsibilities as the selling
lawyer to preserve confidences and secrets of such clients whether or
not the sale of the practice closes or the client ultimately consents to
representation by the purchasing lawyer.

See also ORS 9.460(3). Lawyer is bound to protect infonnation
relating to the representation of Company even after tennination of
employment. OSB Formal Ethics Op No 2005-23.
Because the information at issue here is protected from disclosure
by Oregon RPC 1.6, Lawyer may not use it in the claim for wrongful
termination unless one of the applicable exceptions is satisfied. Oregon
RPC 1.6(b)(4) applies to a "claim or defense on behalf of a lawyer in a
373

Formal Opinion No. 2005-136

controversy between the lawyer and the client." If a legally viable and
nonfrivolous claim exists, disclosure may be made. Nevertheless, there
are limits on how much Lawyer may reveal and the circumstances of the
revelation. The information that Lawyer seeks to disclose must be
reasonably necessary to establish the claim asserted. See OSB Formal
Ethics Op No 2005-104. Lawyer must ensure that any confidential
information is revealed in the least public manner, including insistence
on an appropriate protective order. Cf In re Huffman, 328 Or 567, 983
P2d 534 (1999) (lawyer disciplined for making disclosures of confidential
information that were not required for lawyer to assert viable defense).
