Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) alleges:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

2
3

1.

The Commission brings this action to halt an ongoing fraudulent securities offering

4 and Ponzi scheme perpetrated by defendants Jaswant S. Gill and Javier Rios through Gill’s
5 eponymous investment firm JSG Capital Investments, LLC (“JSG”) and affiliated entities JSG
6 Capital, LLC, JSG Capital LLC, and JSG Enterprises, LLC (collectively, the “JSG Entities”).
7

2.

Since September 2013, Gill and Rios have fraudulently raised approximately $10

8 million from nearly 200 investors in the JSG Entities by promising guaranteed, fixed returns of up to
9 60 percent annually through purported investment in highly coveted, pre-initial public offering (“pre10 IPO”) shares of companies such as Airbnb, Alibaba, and Uber, and other investments in the stock
11 market.
12

3.

Gill and Rios solicit middle-class investors with promises of “access to alternative

13 investment strategies that were previously only available to the one-percenters.” In so doing, Gill and
14 Rios falsely portray JSG as an authentic and prosperous investment firm, and lull investors into
15 believing that their money is safe and secure. For example, defendants claim that investor money is
16 invested in the stock market, and JSG’s website touts its “customized asset allocation strategy,”
17 actively-managed client portfolios “using a broad array of securities” and JSG’s performance relative
18 to well-known benchmarks. JSG’s investor contracts represent that the investments are secured by
19 assets held at established brokerage firms, and that investors are additionally secured against losses
20 by an insurance policy. Gill has also touted his background as a Managing Director at Morgan
21 Stanley and supposed “close ties” with well-known Silicon Valley venture capital firms that provided
22 JSG access to shares in popular “pre-IPO” companies.
23

4.

In reality, JSG is a classic investment scam and Ponzi scheme. Gill and Rios

24 transferred less than 1 percent of investor funds to JSG Entity brokerage accounts, and no “pre-IPO”
25 company shares were ever purchased. The JSG Entities do not hold any accounts at one of the
26 brokerage firms, are not a policyholder of the insurance policy they claim to be, and JSG’s account at
27 the other brokerage firm has never held more than $5,000. Gill has never worked for Morgan

1 Stanley, and neither JSG nor Gill has any relationship with any of the Silicon Valley venture capital
2 firms touted on JSG’s website.
3

5.

Instead, Gill and Rios have used millions in investor money to fund their lifestyle, and

4 to make Ponzi payments to earlier JSG investors. Gill has received over a million dollars of investor
5 money in cash withdrawals, transfers to his personal bank account, the monthly rent at his personal
6 residence, and the use of an expense account to pay for excursions to high-end restaurants and clubs,
7 jaunts to Las Vegas casinos, gentlemen’s clubs, professional sporting events, high-end hotels, and
8 luxury retail stores. Rios has received at least $1.7 million from the scheme, and spent additional
9 investor money from a JSG-affiliated account to pay the monthly rent at his personal residence. In
10 addition, Gill and Rios used over $500,000 in investor funds to pay for excursions to restaurants,
11 nightclubs, and luxury hotels, transportation including airfare and car service, and purchases at
12 retailers for furniture, clothing, and other accessories. To further the scheme, Gill and Rios used
13 money from new investment into JSG to pay existing investors. Since September 2013, defendants
14 have made approximately $4.2 million in Ponzi-like payments to JSG investors.
15

6.

The defendants continue to solicit new investors to join the scheme. To halt their

16 fraud and protect current and future investors, the Commission seeks emergency ex parte relief in this
17 action to enjoin the defendants from continuing their unlawful conduct, freeze assets, and secure
18 other equitable relief.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

18
19

A.

The JSG Entities, Their Principals, and Their Purported Investment Products

20

19.

JSG purports to be a San Francisco-headquartered boutique investment firm with $25

21 million in assets under management. JSG represents itself in marketing materials as “an independent
22 and privately owned Investment Advisory firm” that provides “personal portfolio management
23 attention to every client.” On the firm’s website and in emails to potential investors, the company
24 also markets the fact that one of its employees is a registered investment adviser.
25

20.

Jaswant Gill is the founder and CEO of JSG. He makes investment decisions on

26 behalf of JSG and, for the small percentage of investor funds that are actually invested, conducts
27 trading of investor funds. He has personally advised investors on how to invest their money and, in
28
SEC V. JSG CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, LLC, ET AL.
COMPLAINT

Case 3:16-cv-02814 Document 1 Filed 05/25/16 Page 6 of 19

1 certain cases, recommended the purchase of particular securities. He has also exercised control over,
2 or shared control with Rios over, a number of JSG Entity bank accounts and the transfer of investor
3 funds in those accounts.
4

21.

JSG purports to offer two investment products, both of which promise high returns

5 with no risk of loss. The first product is JSG’s so-called “pre-IPO” program, which claims to allow
6 investors to purchase shares in private companies that JSG tells clients are poised to offer securities
7 publicly through an initial public offering, or “IPO.” Under the so-called “Promissory Conversion
8 Investment Note Agreement” (or some variation thereof), JSG (and, in earlier contracts, JSG Capital
9 LLC) purported to allocate to investors shares in specific, well-known private companies including
10 Alibaba, Airbnb, and Uber prior to the company’s IPO. JSG promised investors a guaranteed fixed
11 interest payment of up to 60 percent annually, until the company completes its IPO and the lockup
12 period expires. JSG represented that, at that point, it would transfer the shares or proceeds from the
13 sale of the shares to the investor, with the investor retaining the ability to demand repayment of the
14 initial investment if the IPO did not occur within a specified period. The terms of the Promissory
15 Conversion Investment Note Agreement were memorialized in contracts signed by Gill.
16

22.

The second product, as set forth in JSG’s “Fixed Index Investment Agreement,”

17 provides that JSG will purchase securities on behalf of investors “via the indices of the NYSE and
18 NASDAQ” using the firm’s proprietary trading models. JSG (and, in earlier contracts, JSG Capital
19 LLC) promised investors a guaranteed fixed interest payment of up to 60 percent annually, with the
20 rate of return dependent upon the amount and length of investment. The firm also guaranteed
21 repayment of the investor’s initial investment in full at the end of the one-year contract term. The
22 terms of the Fixed Index Investment Agreement were memorialized in contracts signed by Gill.
23

23.

Gill and his team of operatives treat the JSG Entities as one in carrying out JSG’s

24 operations and managing investor funds. For example, the contracts Gill signed with investors
25 purported to be between the investor and either JSG Capital Investments, JSG Capital LLC, or “Jason
26 Gill of JSG Capital LLC.” JSG’s website is available at both www.jsgcapital.com and
27 www.jsgcapitalinvestments.com, uses the names JSG Capital Investments, LLC and JSG Capital,

1 LLC, and refers to the “JSG Capital Group.” In addition, defendants JSG Capital LLC and JSG
2 Enterprises LLC, and relief defendant JSG Management Group LLC maintain or have maintained a
3 number of bank accounts into which investor funds were deposited (including an account in San
4 Francisco), and from which interest payments to investors were paid. The accounts have been used
5 interchangeably, as investors who deposited money into one entity account were often issued interest
6 payments from a separate entity account.
7

24.

Rios is authorized to execute JSG’s and JSG Management Group LLC’s banking and

8 financing operations. Indeed, Rios is the sole or joint owner of a number of JSG’s bank accounts,
9 through which the majority of investor funds have flowed since early 2015, and has had full visibility
10 into the flow of money to and from those accounts as he exercised control over, or shared control
11 with Gill over, the accounts and the transfer of investor funds in those accounts. He personally
12 deposited checks from investors, with subject lines showing that the funds were an investment, to
13 JSG’s accounts, and personally wrote checks for the recurring interest payments made by JSG to
14 investors, indicating the purpose of the payment on the subject line. He also personally wrote checks
15 to his own accounts.
16

B.

JSG Solicited Investors Through a Series of Lies and Deceptive Conduct

17

25.

JSG specifically targets middle-class investors. Gill represented in emails to investors

18 that he started the firm to “level the playing field” and bring investment opportunities to average
19 Americans. Gill also asserted in a JSG press release in November 2015 that the firm caters to
20 average retail investors to “give all investors access to alternative investment strategies that were
21 previously only available to the one-percenters.” Many of JSG’s investors, who are scattered
22 throughout the country, have little to no prior investment experience.
23

26.

JSG solicited investors through two primary methods. First, JSG’s website touted JSG

24 investments as both safe and profitable. It features testimonials from purported investors.
25

27.

For example, a retiree is quoted as saying: “[JSG’s] fixed index [investment] has

26 allowed me to not worry about living off SSN benefits and going thru my retirement savings. I know
27
28
SEC V. JSG CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, LLC, ET AL.

1 my weekly return, and I budget accordingly to live comfortably without dipping into my savings.
2 The best investment I have ever made.”
28.

3

Another purported investor testimonial displayed on the JSG website reads: “When I

4 tell people my rate of return they tell me I’m crazy! When I show them my monthly interest deposits
5 they ask if they can invest too!”
29.

6

JSG’s second method of solicitation is through personal pitches made by Gill, Rios,

7 and other JSG employees or affiliates. This team of solicitors, who represented themselves as JSG’s
8 “Capital Raise Division,” communicated directly with potential investors by email and by telephone
9 and provided them with documents and other information regarding potential investment through
10 JSG.
11

30.

Through these solicitations, defendants have made and continue to make numerous,

12 material misrepresentations to investors and have taken additional steps to deceive investors into
13 believing that JSG is a legitimate investment firm offering lucrative opportunities in the stock and
14 “pre-IPO” markets, and that their money is safe and secure. Each of these misrepresentations and
15 deceptive conduct, described below, fall into three general categories: lies regarding the investments
16 themselves, JSG’s ability to procure such investment opportunities, and that investor funds are
17 secured against future loss.
18

1. JSG, JSG Capital LLC, JSG Capital, LLC, Gill, and Rios Falsely Told Investors
That Their Money Was To Be Used To Purchase “Pre-IPO” Shares Or Invested
In the Stock Market.

19
20
31.

JSG’s website features the firm’s investment philosophy beside a picture of the New

21
York Stock Exchange trading floor and sets forth a supposed four-step “investment process” that
22
purports to rely “on concentrated research to identify great businesses that are trading at highly
23
discounted valuations because investors have overreacted to negative macro or company-specific
24
events.” The website also claims that JSG manages a “customized asset allocation strategy” for each
25
client, that a client’s objectives “determine the level of investment in equities, fixed income and
26
alternative investments,” and that JSG “actively manage[s] client portfolios using a broad array of
27
securities.”
28
SEC V. JSG CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, LLC, ET AL.
COMPLAINT

7

Case 3:16-cv-02814 Document 1 Filed 05/25/16 Page 9 of 19

1

32.

JSG’s website also features a number of charts to convey the impression that JSG is

2 actively investing in the stock market. One table reflects JSG’s purported “monthly returns” to
3 investors, based on the duration and amount of investment. Another graph claims that JSG’s fixed
4 index product outperformed benchmarks such as Apple, GE, and the S&P 500 from 2010 to 2015.
5 And a final chart, titled “2015 Yearly Gains of Our AUM,” lists well-known stocks such as Apple,
6 Google, and Netflix that “are a sample of the core equities under management (AUM) that JSG
7 Capital Investments LLC actively trades or holds daily.”
8

33.

The investor contracts themselves represent that JSG placed investor money in the

9 market. Thus, each of the fixed index contracts states: “This is an investment note for the purchase
10 of equities both long and short positions via the indices of the NYSE and NASDAQ.” Similarly, the
11 so-called “pre-IPO” contracts purport to allocate a specific number of IPO shares to the investor at a
12 specific price. Gill signed each of these contracts on behalf of JSG or its affiliate, JSG Capital LLC.
13

34.

Gill also mirrored these representations in communications directly with investors.

14 For example, in an email with one would-be investor, Gill stated that JSG Capital LLC had been
15 allocated “pre-IPO” Alibaba shares, and encouraged the potential investor to take a loan or credit
16 card advance to “purchase as many shares as possible and leverage the return” as such an investment
17 “could change your life.” Gill further represented that the “pre-IPO” contract would confirm the
18 shares, price, and interest payment guarantee relating to the Alibaba investment, and that following
19 the expiration of the lockup period the investor would receive actual stock certificates for any shares
20 purchased.
21

35.

Rios similarly led investors to believe that their funds were being invested. For

22 example, Rios sent an email to a potential investor representing that JSG specializes “in helping the
23 average investor (i.e. middle class) participate in investment vehicles previously only allowed for
24 high net worth clients.” Rios proceeded to describe JSG’s purported investment products and
25 “investment philosophy” and claimed that JSG’s average trading profits ranged from $50,000 to
26 $800,000 per day, and that JSG maintained over 500 clients nationwide.

Case 3:16-cv-02814 Document 1 Filed 05/25/16 Page 10 of 19

1

36.

Other JSG marketing materials perpetuate the myth that the firm was actively

2 managing investor funds in the market. In November 2015, a member of the Capital Raise Division
3 circulated an email to the other members of the team (including Gill and Rios) with an updated
4 “Investor Relations Information Sheet” to be circulated to “any future investors.” The document
5 highlighted JSG’s business as an investment advisory firm, provided information on JSG’s core
6 investment products, and represented that JSG had $25 million in assets under management.
7

37.

In fact, these representations were false. Neither JSG nor its affiliated entities has, and

8 has never had, $25 million in assets under management. More importantly, despite their claims that
9 JSG investor funds are used to purchase so-called “pre-IPO” shares or to otherwise invest in the
10 market, defendants actually operate a classic Ponzi scheme.
11

38.

Since September 2013, investors transferred approximately $10 million into a series of

12 JSG-affiliated bank accounts opened by Gill, Rios, and two other individuals, ostensibly for the
13 purpose of investment in the stock market or to purchase “pre-IPO” shares of private companies.
14 Investors were directed by JSG principals to deposit funds directly in any one of these accounts, in
15 the names of defendants JSG Capital Investments, LLC, JSG Capital LLC, or JSG Enterprises LLC.
16 An additional $1.2 million in cash and other funds from an unknown source has also been deposited
17 in the accounts over the same period.
18

39.

However, of the $11.2 million deposited to date, only $844,400 was ever invested. Of

19 this amount, just $99,800 – less than 1 percent of known investor funds – was transferred to JSG
20 Entity brokerage accounts for investment in the market. Instead, Gill and Rios transferred the
21 overwhelming majority of the $844,400 into their personal brokerage accounts and those of other
22 JSG insiders, where the money was traded in the market and spent on personal expenses. And no
23 investor funds were used for the purpose of buying “pre-IPO” shares of private companies.
24

40.

Gill and Rios misappropriated the remaining investor funds. First, unbeknownst to

25 investors, defendants used money from new investment into JSG to pay existing investors. Since
26 September 2013, defendants have made approximately $4.2 million in Ponzi-like payments to JSG
27 investors.

41.

Second, Gill and Rios have used the balance of the funds to enrich themselves and

2 other JSG insiders, to the detriment and at the expense of JSG’s investors. Collectively, Gill and
3 Rios have misappropriated for their personal use, or have inappropriately diverted to other JSG
4 insiders, at least $6.1 million in total funds deposited to date.
5

42.

Specifically, Rios received approximately $1.7 million in direct transfers into his

6 personal accounts or in cash withdrawals, and Gill received $289,131 into his personal accounts or in
7 cash withdrawals. Rios personally withdrew, in cash, $210,000 of investor money from a JSG
8 account in a single transaction.
9

43.

Additionally, Gill wrongfully obtained nearly $800,000 in cash or other benefits

10 through the use of ATM withdrawals and a prepaid expense card, which he used to pay for, among
11 other things, jaunts to Las Vegas casinos, gentlemen’s clubs, professional sporting events, high-end
12 hotels, and luxury retail stores.
13

44.

None of the documents Gill, Rios, or any of the JSG Entities provided to investors

14 disclosed and/or authorized the use of investor money for these purposes.
15

45.

Gill and Rios knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that investor funds were being

16 used to carry out the scheme. Gill and Rios are account signatories for 17 of the 22 JSG-affiliated
17 bank accounts, with full authority over account transactions. Gill and Rios thus had visibility into,
18 and in many cases the sole ability to direct transactions regarding, the activity on these accounts.
19

46.

Gill knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that his representations made to investors

20 regarding how their funds were to be invested were false. Gill knew that neither JSG nor JSG Capital
21 LLC was allocated any shares in Alibaba, Airbnb, Uber, and others, despite his representations to the
22 contrary. Gill also knew, as the authorized signatory of JSG Entity bank accounts, that investor
23 money was not being used for investment purposes, but instead was used for payments to JSG
24 insiders (including Gill), personal expenses, and to make Ponzi payments to other investors. Despite
25 this knowledge, Gill wrote and signed checks to investors that falsely claimed that the payments were
26 for investment returns, describing those payments as “Reimbursement” or that included “Interest” for
27 certain investments.

Rios knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that his representations made to investors

2 regarding how their funds were to be invested were false. As the person in control of JSG’s bank
3 accounts, Rios had full visibility into JSG’s banking records, which showed that investor money was
4 used for payments to JSG insiders (including Rios), personal expenses, and to make Ponzi payments
5 to other investors. Despite this knowledge, Rios wrote and signed checks to investors that falsely
6 claimed that the payments were for investment returns, stating for example, “Alibaba
7 Reimbursement” and “JSG Monthly Interest.”
8

2. Gill, JSG, and JSG Capital, LLC Lied About Gill’s Background and
Relationships to Perpetuate the Façade That JSG Is a Legitimate Investment
Firm.

9
10
48.

Gill and JSG, and, through the website, JSG Capital, LLC, furthered the scheme by

11
lying about Gill’s background and by pretending that Gill has connections to well-known Silicon
12
Valley venture capital firms, to create the false impression that JSG had access to investment
13
opportunities in private companies before they offered their stock to the general public.
14
49.

JSG’s website claims that its “greatest competitive advantage comes from using our

15
relationships and networking to discuss with top tier analysts on Wall Street and management
16
members of companies we have invested in.” To that end, the site boasts that Gill founded the
17
investment advisory firm following his career as a Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, during
18
which he participated in the initial public offerings of well-known technology companies.
19
50.

JSG’s website also touts Gill’s supposed “close ties” to particular Silicon Valley

20
venture capitalist firms. This assertion is backed by a list of individuals at a few of the firms that
21
comprise JSG’s purported “Partners and Mentors.”
22
51.

Gill himself also used this purported background to woo investors. He claimed in

23
emails that he was previously employed at Morgan Stanley and managed that company’s Investment
24
Banking Division in New York. He also told investors that he worked on “numerous deals” while at
25
Morgan Stanley. He also led investors to believe that his connections enabled him to secure such
26
lucrative and highly-coveted private company shares that were otherwise unavailable to the general
27
public. He told one investor, “Due to my relationship and dealings with Morgan Stanley, my firm
28
SEC V. JSG CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, LLC, ET AL.
COMPLAINT

Case 3:16-cv-02814 Document 1 Filed 05/25/16 Page 13 of 19

1 has been allocated a certain number of shares [of private company Alibaba] that we will be giving to
2 our high net worth clients and investors as well as keeping some for the firm.”
3

52.

In reality, however, Gill has no such background. There is no record of Gill ever

4 being employed at Morgan Stanley, either in the Investment Banking Division or as a Managing
5 Director. As such, he did not participate in the initial public offerings of any technology companies
6 while at Morgan Stanley. And neither Gill nor JSG has ever had a relationship with the above7 referenced venture capital firms.
8

53.

Gill knew, or was reckless in not knowing, and therefore by extension JSG and JSG

9 Capital, LLC knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that these representations regarding Gill’s
10 background and relationships were false.
11

3. Gill, JSG, JSG Capital LLC, and JSG Capital, LLC Deceived Investors Into
Believing That Their Investments Were Secured By JSG Assets and Protected By
an Insurance Policy.

12
13
54.

Gill, JSG, and JSG’s affiliated entities also gave investors a false sense of security by

14
misrepresenting that their investments were secured and protected against losses.
15
55.

Both JSG’s “pre-IPO” and fixed index contracts with investors, which Gill signed on

16
behalf of JSG or JSG Capital LLC, represented that the investments were secured by assets in JSG17
affiliated accounts at two well-known brokerage firms. For example, one investor’s “Pre-IPO”
18
contract stated that “This Note is secured by assets of JSG Capital LLC with portfolio asset accounts
19
at [Firm A] and [Firm B] (Trading Partner).” Similarly, another investor’s “fixed index” contract
20
stated that “This Note is secured by assets of JSG Capital LLC with accounts at [Firm A] and [Firm
21
B] – Trading Desk Partner (Prime Brokerage).”
22
56.

These representations were false. The JSG Entities do not have any accounts at Firm

23
B. Although JSG does maintain an account at Firm A, the account has never had an ending monthly
24
balance of more than $5,000.
25
57.

Gill took additional steps to further the deceit. In a January 2016 email, Gill sent his

26
team a series of documents to aid them in closing deals with potential investors that were “on the
27
fence or [who] need[] assurance.” One attachment purported to be a brokerage statement from Firm
28
SEC V. JSG CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, LLC, ET AL.
COMPLAINT

12

Case 3:16-cv-02814 Document 1 Filed 05/25/16 Page 14 of 19

1 A, reflecting JSG’s account balance of over $32 million as of November 30, 2015. At least one
2 potential investor received a copy of the purported brokerage statement from a member of Gill’s
3 team.
4

58.

However, the November 2015 statement was a fake, as the balance in the account was

5 never more than $5,000. Gill knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the document was fake.
6

59.

Gill, JSG, and JSG Capital, LLC also falsely told investors that their investments were

7 protected against losses through an insurance policy and the firm’s membership in the Securities
8 Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). Until very recently, JSG’s website stated, under “Asset
9 Protection,” that investments through JSG “are Insured by SIPC for securities and cash in the event of
10 broker-dealer failure” and that “SIPC provides up to $500,000 of protection for brokerage accounts
11 held in each separate capacity (e.g., joint tenant or sole owner), with a limit of $250,000 for claims of
12 uninvested cash balances.” The website further represented that investors are additionally protected
13 against loss through a “brokerage insurance” policy issued by a particular insurance company, thus
14 cumulatively providing protection to investors “up to an aggregate of $100 million.”
15

60.

JSG’s and JSG Capital LLC’s contracts with investors, which Gill signed, echo these

16 misrepresentations, stating that the individual investor “will be listed as a beneficiary for his [or her]
17 principal investment amount . . . with [insurance company]” and that “[i]n the event of a loss the
18 ‘Investor’ is eligible to file a claim at [email address].” The contracts also state that the investors are
19 “protected via SIPC insurance for any investment up to $250,000.”
20

61.

These representations are false. Neither JSG nor its affiliated entities have an

21 insurance policy with the company in question, and none of the JSG Entities are members of the
22 Securities Investor Protection Corporation.
23

62.

Gill furthered this fraud in a January 2016 email to his team in which he attached a

24 purported copy of JSG’s “Asset Management Insurance Policy” through the insurance company. He
25 attached another document, known as JSG’s “ASSET PROTECTION SHEET,” which explained that
26 investors were provided “a high level of safety with your investment accounts,” including the
27
28
SEC V. JSG CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, LLC, ET AL.
COMPLAINT

13

Case 3:16-cv-02814 Document 1 Filed 05/25/16 Page 15 of 19

1 protection against loss through JSG’s SIPC membership. At least one investor received the Asset
2 Protection Sheet from a member of Gill’s team.
3

63.

As Gill knew, or was reckless in not knowing, these documents are fake, since JSG

4 had no such insurance policy through the insurance company and is not a member of the SIPC.
5

C.

Defendants Are Operating an Ongoing Ponzi Scheme

6

64.

Gill and Rios, through the JSG Entities, continue to operate a Ponzi scheme, soliciting

7 new investors into JSG and making payments to earlier investors. The defendants also continue to
8 dissipate investor funds. From March 1, 2016 through May 6, 2016, investors placed approximately
9 $2.5 million with JSG. Of this amount, just over $1 million was used to pay back investors, with the
10 remaining $1.4 million primarily used to make payments to JSG insiders or for their benefit. Less
11 than $100,000 now remains in the JSG Entity accounts. Based on the misrepresentations to JSG
12 investors and the misappropriation of millions of dollars in investor assets, emergency relief is
13 needed to preserve the funds presently in the defendants’ and Relief Defendants’ accounts. Indeed,
14 unless restrained and enjoined, defendants are reasonably likely to continue to violate the federal
15 securities laws through their ongoing operations.
