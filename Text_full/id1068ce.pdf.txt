In the Matter of
DYNAMIC VENTURES CORP.

INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
October 14, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Keith A. O’Donnell for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Cameron Elliot, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of Respondent
due to its failure to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On August 12, 2016, the Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP alleges that
Respondent has a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g) and is delinquent in its periodic filings. Respondent was served with the OIP on
September 6, 2016, and its answer was due by September 19, 2016. Dynamic Ventures Corp.,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4186, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3556 (ALJ Sept. 21, 2016).
Following Respondent’s failure to timely file an answer, I ordered Respondent to show cause by
October 3, 2016, why the registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its
failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this proceeding. Id. To date, Respondent has failed
to file an answer, respond to the show cause order, or otherwise defend this proceeding.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondent is in default for failing to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of
Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.

Dynamic Ventures Corp., Central Index Key No. 1454384, is a Delaware corporation
with its principal office located in Scottsdale, Arizona. It has a class of securities registered with
the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its
periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form
10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, which it filed on August 14, 2012. As of July 7, 2016,
the company’s common stock was quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc.
(formerly “Pink Sheets”), had six market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception
of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
In addition to its repeated failure to timely file periodic reports, Respondent failed to heed
a delinquency letter sent to it by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with its periodic filing obligations or, through its failure to maintain a valid address
on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive such a letter.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file
annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R.
§§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be
subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act
Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. See SEC v. McNulty, 137
F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978).
Respondent failed to timely file periodic reports. As a result, Respondent violated Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
its registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondent’s failure to file required periodic reports is serious because it violates a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
2

Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondent’s violations are also recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic
reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC
LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due
over a two-year period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS
1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteenmonth period considered recurrent). Respondent is also culpable because it failed to heed a
delinquency letter sent to it by the Division of Corporation Finance or, through its failure to
maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not
receive such a letter, although that does not lessen its culpability. See China-Biotics, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013)
(holding that revocation may be warranted even without proof that a respondent was aware of its
reporting obligations). Finally, Respondent has not answered the OIP or otherwise participated
in the proceeding to address whether it has made any efforts to remedy its past violations, and
has made no assurances against further violations.
Considering these delinquencies, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registration of each class of Respondent’s registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registration of each class of registered securities of Respondent Dynamic Ventures Corp. is
hereby REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party
may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,
pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is
filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
Also pursuant to Rule 360, this initial decision will not become final until the Commission
enters an order of finality. 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(d). The Commission will enter an order of finality
unless a party files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the
Commission determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision as to a party. Id. If any
of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party. Id.

A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
