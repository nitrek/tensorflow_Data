ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 3724/March 21, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16509

In the Matter of
EDWARD M. DASPIN, a/k/a “EDWARD (ED) MICHAEL”;
LUIGI AGOSTINI; and
LAWRENCE R. LUX

ORDER ON TRANSCRIPT
CORRECTIONS

I held a hearing in this matter on February 11, 2016. The transcript for that hearing
erroneously indicates that it occurred on January 11 rather than February 11. I therefore ORDER
that the transcript be corrected to reflect that the hearing occurred on February 11, 2016. The
corrections should include:


Page 11: In the date field, change “January 11, 2016” to “February 11, 2016.”



Page 79, line 9: Change “January 11, 2016” to “February 11, 2016.”

I direct the court reporter to implement the changes and issue a complete, amended
transcript for that hearing. The amended transcript should also be provided in electronic format
to my office.
