LUCY’S WATER WORLD, INC.

INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
March 4, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of Respondents
Bailey Frances Corp., Kingly Chateau Corp., and Lucy’s Water World, Inc. The revocation is
based on Respondents’ failures to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On February 4, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding with an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP
alleges that Respondents each have a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant
to Exchange Act Section 12(g) and have repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the
Commission, in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13
thereunder.
Respondents were served with the OIP by February 6, 2016, and their answers were due
by February 19, 2016. Bailey Frances Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3630, 2016
SEC LEXIS 647 (ALJ Feb. 22, 2016). On February 22, 2016, I ordered Respondents to show
cause by March 3, 2016, why this proceeding should not be determined against them based on
the failures to file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding. Id. I warned that any
Respondent that failed to respond to the show cause order would be deemed in default and the
registration of its securities would be revoked. Id. To date, Respondents have not filed answers
or responded to the show cause order.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondents are in default for failing to file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule 155(a), I
find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.
Bailey Frances Corp. (CIK No. 1483057), is a revoked Nevada corporation located in
Henderson, Nevada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended October 31, 2012, which reported a net loss of $12,662 since the company’s January 29,
2010, inception to October 31, 2012.
Kingly Chateau Corp. (CIK No. 1520216), is a revoked Nevada corporation located in
Las Vegas, Nevada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended October 31, 2012, which reported a net loss of $139,976 from the company’s March 28,
2011, inception to October 31, 2012.
Lucy’s Water World, Inc. (CIK No. 1539447), is a revoked Nevada corporation located
in Reno, Nevada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission,
having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31,
2013, which reported a net loss of $46,928 from the company’s September 14, 2011, inception to
January 31, 2013. As of August 14, 2015, the company’s stock (symbol “LWWA”) was traded
on the over-the-counter markets.
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations or, through their failures to maintain
valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive
such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers
to file annual reports and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17
C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not
be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange
Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to
establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and rules thereunder. See SEC v. McNulty,
137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). By

2

failing to timely file required periodic reports, Respondents violated Exchange Act Section 13(a)
and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or
rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect investors, the
Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s violations, the
isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved, the extent of the
issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and the credibility of
its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because they violate a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file
periodic reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009
SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports
due over a two-year period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC
LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an
eighteen-month period considered recurrent). Respondents are culpable because they failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance or, through their
failures to maintain valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission
rules, did not receive such letters. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800,
2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that scienter is not necessary to
establish grounds for revocation). Respondents have not answered the OIP or otherwise
participated in the proceeding to address whether they have made any efforts to remedy their past
violations, and have made no assurances against further violations.
For the reasons described above, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registrations of each class of Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrations of each class of registered securities of Bailey Frances Corp., Kingly Chateau
Corp., and Lucy’s Water World, Inc., are REVOKED.

This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party
may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,
pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is
filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
