SUMMARY
5.

This case concerns material misrepresentations made to investors- and a fraudulent

20

scheme perpetrated - by Defendant David B. Kaplan, Esq. and three entities that he controlled:

21

Synchronized Organizational Solutions, LLC ("SOS"); Synchronized Organizational Solutions

22

International, Ltd. ("SOSI"); and Manna International Enterprises, Inc. ("Manna Int'l").

23

6.

From at least May 1, 2012 to the present, Kaplan, directly and through SOSI, offered

24

investments in a purported off-shore investment program ("SOSI Offering") and Kaplan, through

25

SOS and Manna Int'l, received investor funds from the SOSI Offering and misappropriated a

26

portion of those funds as described below.

27
28

7.

During this period, Kaplan made knowing oral misrepresentations to prospective

investors in the SOSI Offering about the use of investor funds. Kaplan told prospective investors

2

Case 3:16-cv-00270-MMD-VPC Document 1 Filed 05/19/16 Page 3 of 16

1

that their funds would be pooled with other investor funds to invest in an off-shore investment

2

account ("Investment Account") to support an international trading program. Kaplan assured

3

potential investors that the Investment Account would be protected against loss and that they would

4

earn monthly profits of approximately 10%.

5
6
7

8.

Based upon these representations, Kaplan was able to raise $15.8 million from at

least 26 investors who reside in at least eight states.
9.

In reality, Kaplan did not use investor funds as promised. While Kaplan sent

8

approximately $10.1 million of the investor funds to certain off-shore entities, Kaplan also

9

transferred $5.6 million in investor funds into other accounts he controlled and used at least $2.3

10

million for his personal benefit and approximately $1.8 million to make Ponzi-like payments to

11

other investors.

12
13
14
15
16

10.

In addition, Kaplan sent approximately $1.1 million to Lisa Kaplan ("L. Kaplan"),

The Water-Walking Foundation, Inc. ("WWF"), and Manna Investments, LLC ("Manna").
11.

Kaplan also used at least $360,000 to invest in an allegedly fraudulent scheme at the

center of a federal criminal indictment in Ohio.
12.

Moreover, from at least June 2015 to March 2016, Kaplan sent approximately

17

$385,000 to St. Kitts and Nevis. Of that amount, Kaplan wired approximately $79,394 to a St. Kitts

18

law firm to obtain passports and/or St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship for himself and his wife in

19

connection with St. Kitts and Nevis' Citizenship-By-Investment program.

20

13.

Kaplan continued to make monthly payments to most investors until approximately

21

September 2015. Soon thereafter, Kaplan told investors that there were issues with the Investment

22

Account, and that the Investment Account was frozen, along with their principal investments.

23

14.

Kaplan continued to lull investors by promising them that he was working to repay

24

their principal, despite the fact that Kaplan has received no payments from any off-shore account

25

since December 2015.

26
27
28

15.

As recently as April4, 2016, Kaplan has made payments to investors, using

misappropriated investor funds, ranging from $7,000-$19,000.
16.

By making repeated material misrepresentations to prospective and existing investors

1

about the nature and perfonnance of their investments, Defendants committed securities fraud in

2

violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C.

3

§78j(b)] and Rule IOb-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5] and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of

4

1933 (the "Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], among other violations.

5

17.

The SEC brings this lawsuit to halt Defendants' ongoing violations of the federal

6

securities laws, to prevent further hann to investors, and to seek disgorgement and civil penalties

7

stemming from Defendants' wrongdoing, among other remedies.

FACTS

12

25.

From at least May 1, 2012, to the present, Kaplan, directly and through SOSI, has

13

been engaged in an ongoing fraudulent scheme to defraud 26 investors who reside in eight states.

14

During that period, Kaplan, through SOS and Manna Int'l, has received at least $15.8 million of

15

investor funds from the SOSI Offering, a purported off-shore investment program.

16

Kaplan Makes Misrepresentations To Investors For SOSI Offering.

17

26.

Kaplan met some of his prospective investors through word-of-mouth

18

recommendations from his current investors. Once introduced, Kaplan made multiple oral

19

representations that described the program. All of these oral representations were intended to

20

convince prospective investors that the SOSI Offering was a low-risk, high-return, private off-shore

21

trading program. Kaplan also highlighted the fact that he is an attorney with most prospective

22

investors, providing them with his California bar number, and referred certain investors to his

23

websites: http://sosforbiz.com and http://water-walking.org.

24

27.

Kaplan represented that such programs typically required high investment amounts

25

in order for investors to participate but, after searching for approximately six to eight years, he

26

found one that would allow investors to participate at lower levels. Kaplan further represented that

27

he had invested in the program prior to bringing other prospective investors into the program.

28

28.

Kaplan told prospective investors that the program requires a minimum investment
5

Case 3:16-cv-00270-MMD-VPC Document 1 Filed 05/19/16 Page 6 of 16

1

of$100,000. Kaplan allowed some prospective investors to pool their money to reach the minimum

2

investment amount, while he told other prospective investors that their investment funds would be

3

pooled with his and/or other prospective investors' funds to participate in the program.

4

5
6

29.

Kaplan guaranteed the safety of the program, assuring investors that their principal

investment will be protected from loss at all times through a purported "SWIFT MT760" block.
30.

Kaplan told prospective investors that, despite the block on their principal funds,

7

they would earn monthly profits of approximately 10% from off-shore trading conducted by private

8

traders and bankers, based on the amount of their principal investment.

9
10
11

31.

Kaplan represented to prospective investors that he would be working with a

Luxembourg Fiduciary ("Fiduciary").
32.

After prospective investors agreed to invest in the program, Kaplan asked them to

12

sign an escrow agreement and wire the investment funds to his Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts

13

("IOLTA Accounts").

14

33.

The escrow agreement stated that the investment funds would remain safely within

15

the IOLTA Accounts until such time as the investor gave Kaplan written instructions to transfer the

16

funds to investments recommended by SOSI.

17

Defendants' Post-Investment Communications Confirm Oral Representations.

18

34.

After investors wired the investment funds to Kaplan, most executed various

19

versions of a Joint Venture Investment Agreements ("JVIA") with SOSI and Kaplan, who signed as

20

the Director ofSOSI.

21

35.

Each version of the JVIA contained written representations about the investment

22

program that were consistent with the pre-investment oral representations that Kaplan made to

23

prospective investors.

24

36.

For example, the JVIA represented that Kaplan would transfer the escrow funds into

25

a specially-created, private Investment Account controlled and blocked by SOSI, in collaboration

26

with its Fiduciary.

27

37.

28

The JVIA further represented that the Investment Account would enjoy "full

protection against loss, while at the same time benefiting from various financial transactions

6

Case 3:16-cv-00270-MMD-VPC Document 1 Filed 05/19/16 Page 7 of 16

managed by private bankers and traders that create monthly profits based on the amount on deposit

2
3

during the transactions."
38.

The JVIA described the financial transactions as "buy/sell trading, execution of

4

Futures, Options, CFD's [sic], Stocks, Forwards, Commodities, Precious Metals (Gold, Silver, etc.),

5

Crude Oil, Forex, and other transactions within the international capital markets through private

6

bankers and traders legally affiliated with SOSI through a confidential, profit sharing agreement."

7

8
9

39.

The JVIA represented that profits were achieved through the use of private traders'

credit lines only, which protected the Investment Account from any loss of principal.
40.

The JVIA further represented that investors would receive monthly disbursements of

10

investment profit in an amount expected to be 10% or between 10% and 15% of the investment for

11

any full month of trading.

12

41.

Throughout the scheme, Kaplan regularly communicated with the investors via email

13

and sent monthly statements on SOSI letterhead that identified their purported monthly profit

14

payments. Kaplan also routinely sent e-mail updates to investors and continued to represent that

15

their principal investments were safe.

16

42.

Kaplan also encouraged investors to re-invest their "profit" payments.

17

43.

Certain investors stopped receiving payments in the summer of2015.

18

44.

When investors inquired with Kaplan about why the payments had stopped, he gave

19

various excuses, including that there were Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act issues with the

20

Investment Account. He later explained that the program had ended as of August 31, 2015.

21

Kaplan's Misuses Investor Funds.

22

45.

As described above, Kaplan told prospective investors that their investment funds

23

would be transferred to an off-shore Investment Account and used to participate in a trading

24

program conducted by private bankers and traders.

25
26
27
28

46.

In reality, Kaplan knew that approximately $5.6 million of the approximate $15.8

million collected from investors were never transferred to any off-shore account or trading program.
47.

Instead, Kaplan directed these funds into U.S. and non-U.S. bank accounts that he

controlled, including personal accounts in his name, at least two off-shore accounts he controls in

7

the name of SOS and Manna Int'l, joint accounts with his wife, his IOLTA accounts, and business

2

accounts in the name ofSOS, SOSI, Manna Int'l, L. Kaplan, WWF, and Manna.

3

48.

In addition, Kaplan spent approximately $2.3 million in investor funds for his

4

personal benefit:

5

a.

From February 9, 2015, to December 29,2015, Kaplan spent approximately
$592,000 to purchase and remodel a condo in Nevada;

6
7

b.

From June 2015 to March 2016, Kaplan sent to St. Kitts and Nevis

8

approximately $385,000, of which at least $79,394 was wired to a St. Kitts

9

law firm to obtain passports and/or St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship for Kaplan
and his wife; and

10

c.

11
12
13

Kaplan also transferred investor funds to his personal and joint accounts that
are being used to pay for his personal expenses.

49.

In October 2013, Kaplan used at least $360,000 in money raised from investors in

14

the SOSI Offering to invest in a United States-based program offered by WMA Enterprises, LLC,

15

which is an allegedly fraudulent scheme at the center of a federal criminal indictment. See United

16

States v. William M Apostelos, eta/., No. 3:15-cr-148 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 29, 2015); see also SEC v.

17

WMA Enterprises, LLC, eta/., No. 1:15-cv-00699 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 29, 2015).

18
19
20

50.

Kaplan also transferred approximately $1.1 million to L. Kaplan, WWF and Manna.

L. Kaplan has joint control over many of Kaplan's personal accounts.

51.

In making the material misrepresentations to investors identified in paragraphs 26

21

through 44, Kaplan, SOS, SOSI, and Manna Int'l acted with scienter. At the time they made the

22

misrepresentations, Kaplan and SOSI knew that:

23

a.

Between May 2012 and the present, Kaplan directed approximately $5.6

24

million of the $15.8 million in investor funds- nearly 113 of investor's

25

money- to bank accounts that Kaplan controlled for non-investment

26

purposes;

27
28

b.

Investors had not made the "profits" contained in the emailed investor
statements on SOSI letterhead; and

8

Case 3:16-cv-00270-MMD-VPC Document 1 Filed 05/19/16 Page 9 of 16

1
2

c.
52.

Investor principal payments were being used to repay other investors.

In addition to the misrepresentations and omissions, Kaplan used SOS, SOSI, and

3

Manna Int'l as part of his fraudulent scheme by transferring investor funds into and through

4

multiple entities in contradiction of his representations to investors.

5

53.

6

and Manna Int'l.

7

54.

8
9

Kaplan acted knowingly and with scienter and his scienter is imputed to SOS, SOSI,

Kaplan transferred the remaining funds that he collected from investors -

approximately $10.1 million - to off-shore accounts.
55.

Kaplan received approximately $7.3 million back from those same off-shore

10

accounts, but paid out approximately $9.1 million to investors, exceeding the payments received

11

from any off-shore accounts by approximately $1.8 million.

12
13

56.

Thus, Kaplan used approximately $1.8 million of investor funds he had initially

diverted to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors.

14

57.

From May 1, 2012 to the present, Kaplan has made payments to at least 26 investors.

15

58.

Accounting for these payments to investors, investors may have suffered a loss of

16
17

approximately $7.8 million.
59.

In late 2015, Kaplan promised investors that he was working to return their principal

18

investment. Kaplan claimed that he was exploring pursuing legal action against the Fiduciary, but

19

in the meantime, he was going to obtain a loan from a purported Hong Kong partner to pay back the

20

principal investments.

21
22
23

60.

Kaplan has been making payments in the range of$7,000- $19,000 to various

investors over the past few months and has made payments to investors as recently as April4, 2016.
61.

Kaplan has repaid certain investors with misappropriated investor funds. Kaplan has

24

no apparent legitimate source for any repayments to investors and has not received any funds from

25

non-U.S. accounts since December 2015.

26

62.

Once the investment program ceased, Kaplan regularly communicated with investors

27

by e-mail and telephone about the status of his efforts to pay back investors' principal payments and

28

his efforts to start a new investment program in 2016. For example, in a December 31, 2015 e-mail
9

Case 3:16-cv-00270-MMD-VPC Document 1 Filed 05/19/16 Page 10 of 16

1

to investors, Kaplan discussed "[t]he extent to which we can 'escape' ongoing scrutiny by the U.S.

2

for our future project funding program and whether and under what conditions our finn would be

3

permitted to take on additional JV project funding investors (such as yourself) in the New Year."

4

Kaplan Invokes His Fifth Amendment Rights.

5

63.

On February 17,2016, as part of its investigation into the securities law violations

6

identified in this Complaint, the SEC issued an investigative subpoena to Kaplan requiring him to

7

appear and provide testimony under oath to the SEC regarding the funds he raised from investors

8

for the SOSI Investment.

9

64.

On May 9, 2015, rather than appear for testimony, Kaplan submitted a declaration to

10

the SEC, confirming that he was asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and

11

that, on that basis, he would refuse to answer any of the SEC's questions regarding, among other

12

topics: (a) SOS, SOSI, Manna Int'l., L. Kaplan, WWF, or Manna; (b) representations he made to

13

prospective investors in connection with the offer or sale of securities; (c) representations he made

14

to prospective investors that he knew to be false; (d) his role in creating or disseminating offering

15

documents to prospective investors; and (e) his use of interstate commerce or the mails in

16

connection with trading programs or joint ventures that he has effected or caused to be effected.
