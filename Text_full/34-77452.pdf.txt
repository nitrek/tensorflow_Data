In the Matter of

ORDER DISMISSING UNTIMELY
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW

JOHN VINCENT BALLARD

Appeal filed:
Last brief received:

February 9, 2016
February 24, 2016

FINRA requests that we dismiss as untimely an application for review filed by John
Vincent Ballard (“Ballard”), an individual formerly associated with a FINRA member. Ballard
failed to comply with the filing deadline established by Section 19(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and our Rule of Practice 420(b) because he filed his application more than 30 days
after he received FINRA’s decision.1 And Ballard has failed to establish extraordinary
circumstances sufficient to support an extension of the deadline for filing an application for
review. Therefore, we dismiss Ballard’s application.
Background
On December 17, 2015, FINRA issued a decision finding that Ballard had engaged in
undisclosed outside business activities, in violation of FINRA Rules 3270 and 2010, and failed to
provide documents or testimony in response to FINRA’s requests, in violation of FINRA Rules
8210 and 2010.2 FINRA found that Ballard violated Rule 3270 because, although Ballard
“disclosed to his supervisor that he might have to seek new employment, he never provided
written notice—or, indeed any notice—to the Firm that he had become employed” with a third
party. With regard to the Rule 8210 violations, FINRA concluded that, although it “repeatedly
attempted to obtain documents and testimony from Ballard as part of an investigation of his

the date [that] notice [of the challenged decision] was filed with [the Commission] and received
by such aggrieved person, or within such longer period as [the Commission] may determine”);
17 C.F.R. § 201.420(b) (providing that such period will not be extended “absent a showing of
extraordinary circumstances”).

activities,” Ballard “never produced any documents, never appeared for his on-the-record
testimony, and never provided FINRA with any explanation for his repeated failures to cooperate
with the investigation.” FINRA also found that “Ballard’s actions throughout the[] disciplinary
proceedings suggest[ed] that his failure to comply with FINRA’s requests [wa]s indicative of a
broader pattern of conduct aimed at stalling FINRA’s investigation and disciplinary process in
perpetuity.” For example, Ballard “delayed briefing, missed filing deadlines, and sought to
postpone oral argument on several occasions.” FINRA barred Ballard for his failure to provide
documents and testimony and imposed costs on him. In light of the bar, FINRA assessed but did
not impose sanctions for Ballard’s failure to disclose his outside employment.
FINRA filed notice of its decision with the Commission and sent the decision to Ballard
by certified mail, first-class mail, and email on December 17, 2015. FINRA sent the certified
and first-class mail to each of two addresses: Ballard’s address of record in the Central
Registration Depository (“CRD”) and an additional address that he provided to FINRA during
the course of the disciplinary proceedings, which he later identified as his address of record in
this proceeding. FINRA emailed the decision to Ballard at an address he used when
corresponding with FINRA during the disciplinary proceedings. In the cover letter that
accompanied the decision, FINRA stated that if Ballard wished to appeal its decision to the
Commission, he would need to “file an application with the [Commission] within 30 days of
receipt.”
On January 6, 2016, Ballard responded to FINRA’s December 17 email and requested
that FINRA direct him to the appropriate FINRA or Commission office that could provide
information regarding appeal of the decision to the Commission. FINRA responded that day by
email and provided Ballard with information regarding the form and service of an application for
review and referred him to the Commission’s Office of the Secretary for questions regarding the
appeal process. Ballard did not ask about, nor did FINRA address, the filing deadline.
On February 9, 2016, Ballard filed an application for review of FINRA’s decision with
the Commission. In his application, Ballard stated that he “was first in receipt, readable receipt
of the [FINRA] decision on or about January 6,” and explained that he had corresponded with
FINRA about it on the same date. Ballard also requested an additional 60 days to “fully state
[the] basis” for his appeal because he was a pro se filer and because the Commission might
conclude that his appeal was complex.
On February 10, 2016, the Commission issued an order directing the parties to submit
briefs on the question of whether Ballard’s appeal should be dismissed as untimely.3 FINRA
filed a brief requesting dismissal on February 24, 2016.4 Although Ballard was ordered to file an

the briefing order on the parties by certified mail at their addresses of record. Although Ballard
received notice of the mailing, he did not collect it.

opening brief by the same date, he failed to do so, and he has not otherwise responded to the
briefing order or FINRA’s request to dismiss this proceeding.
Analysis
Under Exchange Act Section 19(d), a person who wishes to appeal a FINRA decision
imposing a “final disciplinary sanction” must file an application for review with the Commission
“within thirty days after the date” notice of the decision “was filed with [the Commission] and
received by such aggrieved person.”5 Although Section 19(d)(2) permits us to entertain
applications that are filed “within such longer period as [we] may determine,”6 our Rule of
Practice 420(b), which is “the exclusive remedy for seeking an extension of the 30-day period,”
provides that we will not grant an extension “absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances.”7
We dismiss Ballard’s application for review because (1) he filed it more than 30 days after
receiving notice of the decision, and (2) he has not made a showing of extraordinary
circumstances that would justify an extension of the filing deadline.
Ballard’s application for review was untimely because he failed to file it by January 19,
2016. FINRA served notice of its decision on Ballard at his CRD and alternate address on
December 17, 2015, by certified and first-class mail, and emailed him a copy on the same date.
This service “started the running of the appeal period.”8 Because FINRA served Ballard by mail,
we add an additional three days to the 30-day appeal period.9 Therefore, Ballard had until
(…continued)
be dismissed as untimely.” FINRA sent its brief to Ballard at his address of record via overnight
delivery and also emailed it to him at the address he used in the disciplinary proceedings.

January 19, 2016, to file his application for review. Ballard filed his application for review on
February 9, 2016—21 days after the appeal period expired.
Ballard has failed to identify extraordinary circumstances sufficient to extend the
deadline for his filing.10 Because “strict compliance with filing deadlines facilitates finality and
encourages parties to act timely in seeking relief,” the extraordinary circumstances exception to
the 30-day filing deadline “is to be narrowly construed and applied only in limited
circumstances.”11
In his application, Ballard claims that he did not have “readable receipt” of FINRA’s
decision until January 6, 2016, when he responded to FINRA’s email sending him the decision.
He offers no explanation for this statement and provides no evidence that the decision he
received was unreadable. A decision served on Ballard at the addresses he provided is deemed
received as of the date of service.12 In any event, Ballard’s email response to FINRA’s
December 17, 2015 email attaching the decision demonstrates that he received actual notice on
December 17, 2015.
Ballard also sought additional time because of his pro se status and the possible
complexity of his case. Neither of these reasons qualifies as extraordinary circumstances.
Ballard’s pro se status does not justify an extension of time.13 “[W]e expect even
unrepresented parties to comply with our rules,” and “[p]arties, including those appearing pro se,

are obligated to familiarize themselves with the Rules of Practice.”14 The filing deadline is
clearly set forth in our rules,15 and FINRA advised Ballard that he needed to file his brief within
30 days of receipt of the decision. Moreover, an applicant need not identify every contention or
argument in an application for review appealing an SRO decision.16 Ballard suggests no reason
why he could not have filed a two-page application within 30 days of receiving FINRA’s
decision.
Ballard’s unexplained assertion and speculation that we might find this case complex also
does not constitute grounds for extending the deadline to file his appeal.17
Ballard was directed, after his untimely filing, to submit a brief addressing the timeliness
of his application, and he could have identified any extraordinary circumstances that would
justify an extension of the deadline to file. He has submitted no such brief.
Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth above, IT IS ORDERED that John Vincent
Ballard’s application for review is DISMISSED.
By the Commission.

See Pennmont Sec., 2010 WL 1638720, at *5 (“We believe that the measure of whether
an untimely application presents an extraordinary circumstance is not simply the relative weight
of the arguments presented on appeal—otherwise, the ‘extraordinary circumstances’ requirement
would be read out of Commission Rule of Practice 420.”).
