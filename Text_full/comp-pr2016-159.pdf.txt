Defendants.

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") alleges as follows:
SUMMARY

1.

From 2010 to 2016, Defendants Merrill Robertson,Jr. and Sherman C. Vaughn, Jr.

used theircompany. Cavalier Union Investments, LLC ("Cavaliei^'), to jfraudulently induce over60
investors to invest more than $10 million in Cavalier investments. Defendants operated a Ponzi-like

schemeusingmoney from new investors to pay backold investors and finance their luxurious
personal lifestyles.

2.

Defendants targetedunsophisticated seniorcitizens and former football coaches,

donors, alumni, and employees of schools Robertson had attended and induced them to buy

Cavalier's promissorynotes that allegedlypaid a fixed rate ofreturn between 10 and 20 percent
annually.

Case 3:16-cv-00667-JAG Document 1 Filed 08/10/16 Page 2 of 16 PageID# 2

3.

To commit this fraud Defendants liedabouttheir sophistication, the safetyand

security ofthe Cavalier promissory notes, and Cavalier's financial condition. Defendants portrayed
themselves as experienced investment experts and Cavalier as a sophisticated company with various
divisions, investment funds, and investment advisers. They claimed that Cavalier used investor

money to invest in a broad range ofbusiness ventures, such as restaurants, real estate, alternative
energy, and assisted living facilities, and that Cavalier's investment portfolio was "secured by
tangible assets that yield higher returns than investments while providing safety and security for our
investors."

4.

All of these representations were false. Cavalier did not have any divisions,

investment funds, or investment advisers. Nor did it havea diversified investment portfolio.

Cavalier was functionally insolvent shortly afterit was formed and it relied on cashfi-om investors

to stay afloat and payinvestors who requested their money back. Thefew investments it made were
in restaurantsthat suffered substantial losses and ultimately failed. Defendants knew that Cavalier

could notpayall its obligations. They began bouncing checks shortly afterstarting the business.
And, by at least October2013, Defendants could not makea required interestpaymentto its largest

investor. By the end of August2014,the restaurants that Cavalier had invested in had all closed.
This did not stop Defendants fi-om soliciting and collecting more money from unsuspecting
investors.

5.

Unbeknownst to investors, Robertson and Vaughn treated Cavalier like their

personal piggybank. They stole nearly$6 million in investor money and used it for themselves on
things like cars, family vacations, spa visits, luxury goods, educational expenses for family
members, and a luxury suite at a football stadium.

Vaughn, and Cavalier violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) ofthe Securities Act of1933
("Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), and 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) ofthe Securities

FACTS

L

DEFENDANTS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED INVESTORS TO BUY
CAVALIER'S PROMISSORY NOTES.

14.

Robertson and Vaughn formed Cavalier in 2010 and jointly ran the company.

Cavalierclaimedto be a "leading private investment firm" cateringto IRA account holdersand
offering investments opportunities in restaurants, real estate, and alternative energy. Defendants

targeted their schemeat unsophisticated seniorcitizens and former football coaches, donors, alumni,
and employees of schoolsRobertson had attended. At all relevant times, Cavalieractedby and
through Robertson and Vaughn.

Case 3:16-cv-00667-JAG Document 1 Filed 08/10/16 Page 5 of 16 PageID# 5

15.

Defendants marketed Cavalier'spromissory notesand other Cavalier investments

using Cavalier's website, marketing materials, and face-to-face meetings with prospective investors.

Defendants represented to prospective investors in Virginia and in other states that Cavalier used
investor money to invest in safe investments and investors would receive an annual fixed retum of
10 to 20 percent.

16.

In total, Defendants used the material misstatements andomissions discussed herein

to induce more than60 investors located in multiple states to invest more than$10 million in

Cavalier promissory notes andother Cavalier-related investments.
A.

Defendants Misled Investors About Cavalier^s Operations.

17.

Defendants lied to investorsaboutthe operations ofCavalier, its investment

portfolio, and its financial condition. Defendants falsely portrayed Cavalier asa sophisticated,
successfiil company that generated strong fixed returns with limited risk. None ofthese things were
true.

18.

To mislead investors by creating an air of sophistication and legitimacy. Defendants

falsely stated on Cavalier's website andin itsoffering materials thatCavalier operated an
investment fund and employed investment advisers whomanaged Cavalier's investments.
19.

Cavalier's website stated that:

a.

investors could "depend on the professionaland ethicaljudgment of

[Cavalier]'s investment advisors to makedecisions aboutthe fund's
portfolio of investments";
b.

Cavalier's "investment advisors also meet with company executives,

employees, suppliers, customers, and competitors to maximize value
creation"; and

Case 3:16-cv-00667-JAG Document 1 Filed 08/10/16 Page 6 of 16 PageID# 6

c.

20.

Cavalier had a "Food Division" and "CUI Energy."

A Cavalier prospectus stated that the "investment advisor uses a system ofmultiple

portfolio counselors inmanaging the ftmd's assets" and that Cavalier "relies on the professional
judgment ofits investment advisor tomake decision[s]" concerning its fund.
21.

None of these statements were true. Cavalier had no funds, employed no investment

advisers, and had no divisions. Cavalierwas solely Robertson and Vaughn.
22.

At the same tune Defendants were lying about their investment sophistication, they

were hiding important facts about their true financial acumen. Indeed, Defendants failed to disclose
thatVaughn filed forpersonal bankruptcy four times, including twice during theperiod when
Defendants were soliciting investors to for Cavalier.
B.

Defendants Misled Investors About Cavalier*s Investment Portfolio.

23.

Defendants claimed that Cavalier used investor money to acquire a diversified

portfolio of tangible assets. On the Cavalier website. Defendants claimed that Cavalier owned
restaurants, real estate, alternative energy, natural resourceassets, a bottled water company,

apartments and assisted livingfacilities. Similarly, Cavalier's website claimed that Cavalier
intended to use investor money primarily to invest in cash producing tangible assets and "companies
that offer superior opportunities for long-term capital growth[.]"
24.

In the Cavalier prospectus. Defendantspromised investors that their investments

would be used to purchase cash-producing tangible assets that would enable Cavalier to pay the rate
of return specified on the promissory notes.
25.

Contrary to Defendants' assertions, Cavalier did not own any real estate, altemative

energy, natural resource assets, apartments, or assisted living facilities. In fact, Cavalier only

Case 3:16-cv-00667-JAG Document 1 Filed 08/10/16 Page 7 of 16 PageID# 7

invested in a few restaurants, and those entitiesall suffered substantial losses and failed duringthe
course of the scheme.

26.

Even after their businesses faltered and failed. Defendants continued to raise money

from investors without disclosing the true performance of the company. For example, in 2016,
Cavalier's website still listedGame Day Pizzeria andSweetFrog restaurants as assets, eventhough
both businesses had failed and been closed since 2014.

27.

By August 31,2014, the handful of restaurants Defendants had invested in had

ceased operating. However, Defendants raised close to $1,000,000 from unsuspecting investors
after that date.

28.

Defendants also falsely claimed that Cavalier held certain specific investments that it

did not actually hold. For example, the Cavalierwebsite listedBurger King as part of the

investment portfolio, but Cavalier neverowned or even invested in a Burger Kingfranchise.
C.

Defendants Misled Investors About Cavaiier's Financial Condition.

29.

Defendants touted Cavalier as a "safe" investment and misled investors into

believing that Cavalier couldpay the promised rates of returns from its mvestment operations. That
was false.

30.

Shortly after Robertson and Vaughn formed Cavalier, it became functionally

insolvent. Cavalier depended on money from new investors to maintain Defendants' lifestyle and

pay back old investors returns on their previous investments. Indeed, in Ponzi-like fashion,
Defendants used new investor money to pay money owed to old investors.

31.

Despite the inability to pay existing investors from Cavalier's ongoing operations.

Defendants continued to solicit and accept funds from new investors without disclosing that

Case 3:16-cv-00667-JAG Document 1 Filed 08/10/16 Page 8 of 16 PageID# 8

Cavalier could not meet its obligations to existing investors or thatit had already failed to perform
on its agreements with earlier investors.
32.

To avoid detection, Defendants sent investors phony and meaningless account

statements. These statements contained a representation of the currentvalue ofa given investor's
Cavalier investments. But this value was worthlessand did not accurately represent the value of

Cavalier's assets or its abilityto pay the promised returns.

33.

Someof the statements represented that an investor'sassets were held in a particular

investment fund, suchas "CavalierUnionInvestments LLC Bond Fund B." But no suchfund
existed.

34.

Defendants provided these statements withimaginary values to Cavalier investors to

ensure that the investors would not discover the fraud or Cavalier's true precarious financial
condition.

D.

Defendants Lied About Securing The Investments With A Security
Agreement or Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement

35.

In an effort to deceive investors into believing that their individual investment was

"secured," the Cavalier promissory notes Robertson and Vaughn provided to Cavalier's investors

falsely stated that theinvestment would besecured by a security agreement and UCC financing
statement. Specifically, the notes state:

Borrower agrees that until the principal and interest owed underthis
promissory noteare paidin fiill, this note will be secured by a security
agreement and Uniform Commercial Code Financing statement giving
Lender a securityinterestin the equipment, fixtures, and inventory and
accoimts receivable of the business known as Cavalier Union Investments.

36.

Despite these representations, Defendants never created any security agreements or

filed anyUniform Commercial Code financing statements. Moreover, anypurported security
interestin Cavalier's "equipment, fixtures, and inventory and accounts receivable" was itself

8

Case 3:16-cv-00667-JAG Document 1 Filed 08/10/16 Page 9 of 16 PageID# 9

worthless since Cavalier was effectively insolvent since its inception in 2010, but this fact was not
disclosed to investors.

37.

The promissorynotes givento investors were signed by Robertsonand, on at least

one occasion, also by Vaughn.
11.

DEFENDANTS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED THEIR LARGEST INVESTOR TO
INVEST ANOTHER $2 MILLION IN A NONEXISTENT WATER COMPANY.

38.

In March 2013, Defendants fraudulently induced an existing Cavalier investor to

invest an additional $2 million in a purported water-bottling company called Drops, Inc. ("Drops").
39.

Defendants told the investor that Drops used a "unique" seven-step process to

energize the waterthat Drops bottledand distributed to customers.
40.

In written materials that Robertson emailed to the investor's agent, Defendants

falsely claimed thatDrops wasa public company, withactual sales, and withsubstantial projected
sales and profits in the near future.
41.

In the same written materials. Defendants sent the investor fabricated Drops invoices

and a fictitious Drops financial statement. The Drops invoices purported to show sales of hundreds
of thousands of bottles of water, generating over$400,000 in revenues. The fictitious pro forma

financial statement projected that Drops' revenue would increase to $30 million over five years.

These projections were not grounded inany study, analysis, orevaluation, and were entirely created
by Defendants to defraud the investor.

42.

In the Drops solicitation materials, Defendants also misrepresented Robertson's and

Vaughn's qualifications. The documents stated that Robertson previously managed a $250,000,000
portfolio and that he formed "Black Bull Wealth Management," which was "theonly minority firm
on the east coastthat manages flmds, ranging from apartment funds, opportunity funds,
development funds, as well as REITS." It stated further that"Black Bull Wealth Management

Case 3:16-cv-00667-JAG Document 1 Filed 08/10/16 Page 10 of 16 PageID# 10

covers all aspects onfinancing ranging from stocks, bonds, mutual funds, CD, Real Estate,
insurance." These representations werealsofalse. While Robertson ownedBlackBull Wealth

Management, it never had any clients or managed any funds. The documents falsely stated that

Vaughn was a former professional football player and that heearned an MBA from Virginia
Commonwealth University.

43.

To further induce the investor to invest in Drops, Defendants emailed the investora

fabricated letter purportedly from a large U.S. bank, which stated that Cavalier had $11,000,000 in
its account with that bank. The letter was a fake. Cavalier never had $ 11,000,000 in any account

and it neverhad an account withthat particular bank. Vaughn drafted the phony letterandprovided
a copyto Robertson before it was sent to the investor.
44.

Defendants knowingly fabricated andtransmitted these false documents to the

investor to induce him to invest additional funds with them.

m.

ROBERTSON AND VAUGHN MISUSED AND MISAPPROPRIATED
INVESTOR FUNDS.

45.

Defendants did not tell investors that Robertsonand Vaughn used Cavalier as their

personal piggy bank. Robertson and Vaughn misappropriated nearly $6 million ofinvestors' funds
for their own benefit, spending themisappropriated funds onthings like cars, family vacations,

personal debt repayments (such asmortgage debt and credit-card debt), luxuiy goods, clothing,
entertainment, educational expenses for family members, and a luxury suite at a football stadium.

They also misused investor flmds bymaking various donations and gifts to alma maters, churches,
and otherthird-parties who performed no services for Cavalier.
46.

Defendants never disclosed that Robertson and Vaughn used this investor money for

their own personal benefit. Defendants also did not disclose that that they used money from new
investors to pay debtsowed to other, earlierinvestors.

10

Case 3:16-cv-00667-JAG Document 1 Filed 08/10/16 Page 11 of 16 PageID# 11

IV.

DEFENDANTS VIOLATED THE SECURITIES LAW THROUGH THE
MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS THEY MADE TO
DEFRAUDED INVESTORS.

47.

During the relevant period, Robertson and Vaughn operated and controlled Cavalier.

48.

All ofthemisrepresentations and omissions setforth herein, individually and inthe

aggregate, are material, and were made inconnection with the offer, purchase, orsale ofsecurities.
There is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the misrepresented facts

andomitted information important, and/or thatdisclosure of the omitted facts or accurate
information would alter the "total mix" of information available to investors.

49.

In connection with the conduct described herein. Defendants acted knowingly and/or

recklessly. Among other things. Defendants knew orwere reckless in not knowing that they were

making material misrepresentations and omitting tostate material facts necessary tomake certain
statements not misleading under thecircumstances inconnection with selling oroffering to sell
Cavalier promissory notes or other Cavalier-related investments.
50.

Robertson and Vaughn were each the ultimate authority for individual false and

misleading statements each made orally orinwritings directly attributable tothem. Robertson

signed all ofthe promissory notes sold to investors, and he directed his son to generate the fictitious
investor statements using numbers Robertson provided. For other material attributable only to

Cavalier, including material onthe company website and inpromotional materials including

investor packets, because Robertson and Vaughn were the only two individuals engaged inthe
marketing and sale ofCavalier promissory notes, one orthe other ofthem (or possibly both ofthem
acting together) had ultimate authority.

51.

Through their material misrepresentations and omissions, Defendants knowingly,

recklessly, or negligently obtained money or property from investors. Defendants took over $10

II

Case 3:16-cv-00667-JAG Document 1 Filed 08/10/16 Page 12 of 16 PageID# 12

millionfrom investors, and Robertson and Vaughn misappropriated nearly$6 million for
themselves.

52.

Through this scheme, Defendants knowingly, recklessly, or negligently engaged in

acts, transactions or courses of business that operated as a fraud or deceit uponofferees, purchasers
and prospective purchasers of the Notes.

53.

TheCavalier promissory notes defendants sold to investors are securities within the

meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of theSecurities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(l)] and Section 3(a)(10) ofthe
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)].
V.

DEFENDANTS VIOLATED THE SECURITIES ACT BY SELLING
UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.

54.

The Defendants sold or offered to sell Cavalier's promissory notes, even thoughthey

hadnotfiled a registration statement with theCommission and the promissory notes were not

exempt from the registration requirements ofthe Securities Act.
55.
