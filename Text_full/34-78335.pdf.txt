In the Matter of

ORDER MAKING FINDINGS AND
REVOKING REGISTRATION OF
SECURITIES PURSUANT TO
SECTION 12(j) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934 AS TO MIT HOLDING, INC.

MIT Holding, Inc.,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors to accept the Offer of Settlement submitted by MIT
Holding, Inc. (“MITD” or “Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 240(a) of the Rules of Practice of the
Commission, 17 C.F.R. § 201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement of these proceedings initiated
against Respondent on June 15, 2016, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order
Making Findings and Revoking Registration of Securities Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to MIT Holding, Inc. (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
1.
MITD (CIK No. 1367416) is a delinquent Delaware corporation located in
Los Angeles, California with a class of securities registered with the Commission under
Exchange Act Section 12(g). As of June 8, 2016, the common stock of MITD (symbol
MITD) was quoted on OTC Link (formerly Pink Sheets) operated by OTC Markets Inc.,
had eight market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange
Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
2.
MITD has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules
13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder because it has not filed any periodic reports with the
Commission since the period ended September 30, 2015.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, the registration of each class of
Respondent’s securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be, and hereby is,
revoked.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
