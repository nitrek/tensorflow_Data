In the Matter of
EDWARD M. DASPIN, a/k/a “EDWARD (ED) MICHAEL”;
LUIGI AGOSTINI; and
LAWRENCE R. LUX

ORDER

In advance of a hearing scheduled to take place on February 11, 2016, the Division of
Enforcement requested—and I issued—a number of subpoenas, including one directed to Joan
B. Daspin, who is married to Respondent Edward M. Daspin. Mrs. Daspin has moved to quash
the subpoena directed to her.
Her motion is based on (i) an assertion of “marital privilege law,” (ii) the fact of the
Second Circuit’s stay of this proceeding as to Respondent Luigi Agostini, (iii) the claim that I
was not properly appointed under the Constitution, and (iv) the method by which she was served
with the subpoena. The first three arguments fail for reasons I have already explained. See
Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3564, 2016 SEC LEXIS 332, at *2 (ALJ
Feb. 1, 2016) (addressing Second Circuit stay); Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3372, 2015
SEC LEXIS 4956, at *5-6 (ALJ Dec. 4, 2015) (addressing marital privilege); Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3263, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4435, at *8 (ALJ Oct. 28, 2015) (addressing
constitutional arguments).1 The final argument fails because Mrs. Daspin does not argue that the
subpoena (which she admits receiving by mail at her home) was served improperly under
Commission rules; those rules do not require personal service of subpoenas. See 17 C.F.R.
201.232(c); see also 17 C.F.R. § 201.150(c). Therefore, Mrs. Daspin’s motion is DENIED.

Concerning the Appointments Clause argument, I further note that Section 21(b) of the
Exchange Act grants the Commission the authority to designate “any officer” to issue subpoenas.
15 U.S.C. § 78u(b). Given that it is this authority which empowers Division attorneys to issue
subpoenas during investigations, it follows that the term “any officer,” as used in Section 21(b),
does not refer to one’s status as a constitutional officer, but rather to one’s status as a designated
Commission employee. Thus, my authority to issue subpoenas is independent of whether I am a
constitutional officer or not. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(b); SEC v. Pac. Bell, 704 F. Supp. 11, 14
(D.D.C. 1989).

Additionally, to the extent that Mr. Daspin has separately moved to quash subpoenas in
connection with the upcoming February 11 hearing, his arguments lack merit. Accordingly, any
such motion is DENIED.
