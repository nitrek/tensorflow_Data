INITIAL DECISION

DEVEN SELLERS and
ROLAND BARRERA

APPEARANCES:

Timothy S. McCole for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
Deven Sellers, pro se
Roland Barrera, pro se

BEFORE:

Cameron Elliot, Administrative Law Judge
Summary

In October 2015, Respondents Deven Sellers and Roland Barrera were permanently
enjoined in federal district court from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of
1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5
thereunder. The district court found that Respondents acted as unregistered brokers during the
period in which their violations of the antifraud provisions occurred, and they were ordered to pay
substantial disgorgement and civil penalties. The Division of Enforcement now asks that I bar both
Respondents from associating with a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer,
municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from
participating in an offering of penny stock (industry bar). In this initial decision, I grant in part and
deny in part the Division of Enforcement’s motion for summary disposition, and deny Barrera’s
motion for summary disposition. I find that it is in the public interest that Sellers be barred from the
industry, and find that the public interest is appropriately served by barring Barrera from the
industry with a right to reapply in five years.
Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting administrative
proceedings (OIP) against Respondents on December 15, 2015, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the
Exchange Act. The OIP alleges that Respondents solicited investors to purchase limited partnership

interests issued by a Texas company called Vendetta Royalty Partners and by two of its affiliated
companies, without either registering with the Commission as brokers or associating with a
registered broker. OIP at 1-2. The OIP also describes the Commission’s allegation in the
underlying civil proceeding that Sellers and Barrera misrepresented the amount of their combined
commission on the sale at issue. Id. at 2. It further alleges that both Respondents were permanently
enjoined by the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas from future violations
of Securities Act Section 17(a), Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 15(a), and Exchange Act Rule
10b-5. Id.
Respondents were served with the OIP by December 26, 2015. Deven Sellers, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3547, 2016 SEC LEXIS 299 (ALJ Jan. 28, 2016). Respondents and the
Division filed a joint prehearing conference statement on January 25, 2016, in which Respondents
stipulated to the existence of the permanent injunctions against them and to the admissibility of
certain documents from the district court proceeding. The parties also agreed to a briefing schedule
for motions for summary disposition, which I adopted. Id. A telephonic prehearing conference was
held on February 4, 2016, at which all parties appeared. Based on the stipulations made by
Respondents and their representations at the conference, I dispensed with the requirement that they
file answers to the OIP. Tr. 7.
The Division filed a motion for summary disposition against Respondents on February 29,
2016, with an appendix containing: (1) the district court’s memorandum opinion and order on the
Division’s motion for summary judgment, (2) Barrera’s motion for reconsideration of that order, (3)
the district court’s order denying Barrera’s motion for reconsideration, (4) the final judgment
against Sellers, Barrera, and their two co-defendants, (5) the parties’ joint prehearing conference
statement filed in this proceeding, and (6) the Division’s complaint in the district court proceeding.
Neither Barrera nor Sellers filed an opposition to the Division’s motion, but Barrera requested and
was granted an extension to March 25, 2016, to file his own motion for summary disposition.
Deven Sellers, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3720, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1030 (ALJ Mar. 17,
2016). Barrera filed his motion for summary disposition on March 29, 2016, and the Division filed
an opposition on April 8, 2016. Barrera did not file a reply.
Summary Disposition Standard
A motion for summary disposition may be granted if there is no genuine issue with
regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to summary disposition as
a matter of law. 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(b). The facts of the pleadings of the party against whom
the motion is made shall be taken as true, except as modified by stipulations or admissions made
by that party, by uncontested affidavits, or by facts officially noticed pursuant to Rule 323. 17
C.F.R. § 201.250(a). The Commission has repeatedly upheld the use of summary disposition in
cases such as this, where the respondent has been enjoined or convicted and the sole
determination concerns the appropriate sanction. See Gary M. Kornman, Exchange Act Release
No. 59403, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *40-41 (Feb. 13, 2009), pet. denied, 592 F.3d 173 (D.C.
Cir. 2010); Jeffrey L. Gibson, Exchange Act Release No. 57266, 2008 SEC LEXIS 236, at *1920 & n.21 (Feb. 4, 2008) (collecting cases), pet. denied, 561 F.3d 548 (6th Cir. 2009). Under
Commission precedent, the circumstances in which summary disposition in a follow-on

2

proceeding involving fraud is not appropriate “will be rare.” John S. Brownson, 55 S.E.C. 1023,
1028 n.12 (2002), pet. denied, 66 F. App’x 687 (9th Cir. 2003).
Despite its approval of the use of motions for summary disposition in this context, the
Commission has expressed concern about relying on certain types of evidence when ruling on
such motions. In Gary L. McDuff, the Commission found that “the law judge erred in relying on
[a] default judgment as a basis for finding that [the respondent] acted as [a] . . . broker or dealer
at the time of his alleged misconduct,” one of the prerequisites for liability under Exchange Act
Section 15(b). Exchange Act Release No. 74803, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1657, at *6 (Apr. 23, 2015);
see 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(6). But the Commission explained that a default judgment could have
preclusive effect in a follow-on proceeding if there were “substantive findings that . . . accompanied
the entry of default.” Gary L. McDuff, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1657, at *8. The Commission cited
several prior decisions in which it imposed sanctions based on default injunctions, briefly describing
the circumstances of each case. Id. at *8 n.14. McDuff echoed the Commission’s prior opinion in
Don Warner Reinhard, in which it criticized the law judge’s reliance on a district court’s “limited
findings regarding the allegations made in the injunctive complaint.” Exchange Act Release No.
61506, 2010 SEC LEXIS 1010, at *14 (Feb. 4, 2010). As in McDuff, the Commission alluded in
Reinhard to situations in which a district court could “receive[] evidence and make[] findings
following entry of a default judgment with relevance to our sanctions analysis.” Id. at *14 n.25.
Sellers and Barrera defaulted in the civil case underlying this proceeding; the court clerk
entered defaults against each Respondent on April 18, 2014. SEC v. Helms, No. 1:13-cv-1036
(W.D. Tex.), ECF Nos. 58-59 (SEC v. Helms).1 The Division thereafter filed a motion for summary
judgment, which the court granted on August 21, 2015. Div. App. at 1. But the court did not grant
the motion because Respondents had defaulted; indeed, its order does not even acknowledge the
existence of the defaults entered by the court clerk. Id. at 1-42. While the court noted that neither
Respondent had responded to the Division’s motion for summary judgment, it also explained that
despite this failure it was “not permit[ted] . . . to enter a ‘default’ summary judgment in favor of the
SEC.” Id. at 2 & n.1. The court instead went on to analyze in detail the unrebutted evidence
attached to the Division’s motion, including emails, financial documents, and excerpts of the
investigative testimony of both Sellers and Barrera, and ultimately concluded that the Division had
proven the alleged violations. Id. at 13-17, 29-34; see SEC v. Helms, ECF No. 261-1.
Other than answering the complaint and sitting for a deposition, Sellers did not participate in
the district court proceeding. SEC v. Helms, ECF Nos. 61, 261-1 at 2. But though the clerk entered
a default against him, the court went on to make findings regarding his activities as a broker and his
related misconduct based on a thorough review of the substantial documentary and testimonial
evidence attached to the Division’s motion for summary judgment. Its order contains the type of
“substantive findings” described in McDuff that, though arising in the context of a default,
nonetheless provide an adequate basis to determine appropriate sanctions in a follow-on proceeding
and can have preclusive effect. See Gary L. McDuff, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1657, at *7-8. Like the
cases cited in McDuff and the circumstances described in Reinhard, the district court made specific
findings of fact and accepted and considered evidence related to Sellers’ activities as a broker, his

misconduct, and the public interest. See id. at *8 n.14; Don Warner Reinhard, 2010 SEC LEXIS
1010, at *14 n.25. Although Sellers did not respond to the Division’s motion for summary
judgment in the district court action, the district court explicitly noted that it could not decide the
proceeding against him on default. Div. App. at 2 n.1. Instead, the issues were actually litigated
despite his lack of participation. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27 cmt. d (1982)
(“When an issue is properly raised, by the pleadings or otherwise, and is submitted for
determination, and is determined, the issue is actually litigated . . . . An issue may be submitted and
determined on . . . a motion for summary judgment[.]”). This initial decision therefore relies on the
district court’s summary judgment order in evaluating what sanctions are appropriate for Sellers.
Unlike Sellers, Barrera did not remain inactive in the district court proceeding. On October
9, 2015, he filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its summary judgment ruling. Div. App. at
43. Attached to his motion were emails and other documents supporting his contention that he did
not violate the antifraud or broker registration provisions of the securities laws. Id. at 59-79. As an
initial matter, the court rejected the Division’s argument that Barrera’s motion should be considered
under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) or 60(b) as an amendment to or request for relief from
the court’s summary judgment order.2 Id. at 81. The district court determined that it retained
plenary power to review its previous order, and it “therefore consider[ed] Barrera’s arguments and
evidence under the ordinary standard applicable to a nonmovant resisting a motion for summary
judgment.” Id. Even after considering Barrera’s motion in the light most favorable to him,
however, the court concluded that “[e]ven under [that] generous standard, the argument and
evidence . . . fail[ed] to raise any issue of material fact with regard to Barrera’s liability.” Id. at 82.
A final judgment enjoining Respondents was entered on October 21, 2015. Id. at 88.
The district court treated Barrera’s motion as an opposition to the Division’s motion for
summary judgment; the court ignored the fact that Barrera had defaulted and previously failed to
file a response to the Division’s motion. Div. App. at 81-82. Practically speaking, the case against
Barrera was actually litigated at the summary judgment stage and was decided against him on the
merits, after a careful review of the documentary and testimonial evidence. As a result, my reliance
on the district court’s summary judgment and reconsideration orders is appropriate and does not
implicate the concerns expressed in McDuff and Reinhard. See, e.g., Daniel Imperato, Exchange
Act Release No. 74596, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1377, at *15 nn. 23-24, *22 (Mar. 27, 2015) (giving
preclusive effect to a district court’s factual findings and legal conclusions in the context of a
litigated summary judgment motion).
The findings and conclusions in this initial decision are based on the record and on facts
officially noticed pursuant to Rule of Practice 323. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.323. The parties’ filings
and all documents and exhibits of record have been fully reviewed and carefully considered.
Preponderance of the evidence has been applied as the standard of proof. See Steadman v. SEC,

Rule 59(e) governs a party’s motion to alter or amend a judgment, which must be filed no later
than twenty-eight days after the entry of the judgment. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 59(e). Rule 60(b)

such as mistake, newly discovered evidence, or fraud by an opposing party. Fed. R. Civ. Proc.
60(b).

450 U.S. 91, 101-04 (1981). All arguments and proposed findings and conclusions that are
inconsistent with this initial decision have been considered and rejected.
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6) authorizes the Commission to impose industry bars
against Respondents if: (1) at the time of the alleged misconduct, Respondents were associated
with a broker; (2) Respondents were enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in
Exchange Act Section 15(b)(4), including “engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice . . .
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security”; and (3) the sanction is in the public
interest. 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(4)(C), (6)(A)(iii).
The district court found that Respondents acted as brokers during the time of their
misconduct, satisfying the first element. Div. App. at 33-34; see David F. Bandimere, Securities
Act Release No. 9972, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at *99-100 (Oct. 29, 2015) (holding that a person
acting as a broker satisfies Section 15(b)(6)’s requirement of association with a broker). The
second element is also satisfied because both Respondents were enjoined from violations of
Exchange Act Sections 15(a) and 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) and Securities Act Section 17(a), i.e.,
“conduct . . . in connection with the purchase or sale of any security” within the meaning of
Exchange Act Section 15(b)(4)(C). 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(4)(C). Accordingly, a sanction will be
imposed if it is in the public interest.
Sanctions
The Division seeks full industry bars against Sellers and Barrera. Div. Mot. at 7. The
criteria to determine whether this sanction is in the public interest are the Steadman factors: (1)
the egregiousness of the respondent’s actions; (2) the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction; (3) the degree of scienter involved; (4) the sincerity of the respondent’s assurances
against future violations; (5) the respondent’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct;
and (6) the likelihood that the respondent’s occupation will present opportunities for future
violations. Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450
U.S. 91 (1981); see Gary M. Kornman, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *22. The Commission also
considers the age of the violation, the degree of harm to investors and the marketplace resulting
from the violation, and the deterrent effect of administrative sanctions. See Schield Mgmt. Co.,
58 S.E.C. 1197, 1217-18 & n.46 (2006); Marshall E. Melton, 56 S.E.C. 695, 698 (2003). The
Commission’s inquiry into the appropriate sanction to protect the public interest is flexible, and
no one factor is dispositive. Gary M. Kornman, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *22. In deciding
whether the public interest warrants an industry bar, I must determine that “such a remedy is
necessary or appropriate to protect investors and markets.” Ross Mandell, Exchange Act Release
No. 71668, 2014 WL 907416, at *2 (Mar. 7, 2014), vacated in part on other grounds, Exchange
Act Release No. 77935, 2016 WL 3030883 (May 26, 2016).
A.

Background of Respondents’ Misconduct

Respondents’ two co-defendants in the district court proceeding, Robert Helms and
Janniece Kaelin, operated and controlled a company called Vendetta Royalty Partners and
5

several other affiliated entities. Div. App. at 3. Vendetta was organized and marketed as a
standard limited partnership that would hold and distribute royalty interests from approximately
two thousand oil and gas wells located primarily in Texas. Id. It began soliciting investors in at
least July 2011, and ultimately raised approximately $31,422,861 by selling limited partnership
interests to as many as 129 investors. Id. The district court concluded that Helms and Kaelin
operated Vendetta and its affiliates as a Ponzi scheme, and misappropriated over $8 million for
their personal use. Id. at 25-26, 40.
Sellers is Kaelin’s cousin. Div. App. at 13. Sellers worked for Vendetta during 2012,
selling the company’s securities in the form of limited partnership interests. Id. at 13, 24. In
mid-2012, he invited Barrera to join him in selling Vendetta securities and the securities of
several of its affiliated entities. Id. at 13. The two agreed to split any commissions earned on
investments brought in by Barrera. Id. Barrera then contacted and set up a meeting with his
friend, Jamie Moore, who represented an investment company called Lacova Capital LLC. Id.
Sellers, Barrera, and Moore all met to discuss the investment opportunity, and Sellers and
Barrera remained in contact with Moore after the meeting to negotiate the terms of the
investment. Id. at 14. Lacova ultimately invested $3,050,000 in Vendetta on August 13 and 14,
2012. Id. at 15. In return, Vendetta paid Sellers $212,500 and Barrera $211,000. Id.
These substantial commissions were not disclosed to Moore. Div. App. at 15. During
the initial meeting, Sellers claimed that he and Barrera would receive a “small” payment for
securing the investment, a characterization that Barrera did not dispute. Id. Moore asked
Barrera after the meeting whether Barrera “was going to get anything,” but Barrera considered
the subject none of Moore’s business and said only that Sellers “was going to take care of
[him].” Id. Sellers also emailed Moore a private placement memorandum (PPM), copying
Barrera, which represented that Vendetta would use no more than $50,000 of the offering
proceeds for “Promotional Expenses” such as commissions. Id. Sellers admitted that he read the
PPM prior to distributing it; Barrera claimed he did not read the document. Id. Contrary to the
statement in the PPM, Respondents’ combined commissions totaled $423,500. Id. at 16.
Respondents were also involved in the offer of limited partnership interests in Vesta
Royalty Partners, one of the companies affiliated with Vendetta. Div. App. at 16. Sellers
emailed Moore an offer to sell Vesta securities, copying Barrera, and he also offered to sell
Moore’s business partner securities issued by a third entity. Id. at 16-17. Neither Respondent
has ever registered as a broker or become associated with a registered broker. Id.
B.

An Industry-Wide Bar Against Sellers is in the
Public Interest

1. Egregiousness, recency, and recurrence
Sellers’ conduct was egregious. He made material misrepresentations regarding the size
of his and Barrera’s commissions, thereby failing to provide complete and non-misleading
information to Moore and violating his duty to disclose information necessary to rectify his
misleading statements. Div. App. at 29-31; David F. Bandimere, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at
*40-41. This conduct violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, and is therefore
6

“especially serious and subject to the severest of sanctions.” Peter Siris, Exchange Act Release
No. 71068, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3924, at *23 (Dec. 12, 2013) pet. denied, 773 F.3d 89 (D.C. Cir.
2014). Placing his own financial interests above his client’s also supports a finding of
egregiousness. See Ralph Calabro, Securities Act Release No. 9798, 2015 WL 3439152, at *41
(May 29, 2015). And by acting as a broker without registering with the Commission or
associating with a registered broker, Sellers evaded the Commission’s standards with respect to
the training, experience, and recordkeeping required of those acting in such an important
capacity. See Div. App. at 34.
Sellers’ misconduct appears to be limited to a fairly recent, though relatively short, period
in 2012. See Div. App. at 13. But during that period, Sellers attempted to solicit investments
from at least two different investors for several Vendetta-related entities, and he communicated
and negotiated with Moore repeatedly. Id. at 14, 16-17, 33. His conduct was therefore
somewhat recurrent. Cf. id. at 35 (finding that Sellers’ violations “were not particularly
repetitive or numerous”).
2. Scienter
The district court found that Sellers’ violations of the antifraud provisions were made
with scienter. Div. App. at 31. Sellers admitted that he had no basis for telling Moore that his
commission would be small. Id. at 16, 30. He also admitted that he read the PPM he provided to
Moore, which contained a purported maximum for promotional expenses that the commissions
ultimately exceeded by over $370,000. Id. at 15, 30-31. He was, “at the very least, . . .
severe[ly] reckless[ ] in failing to know that [his] commission was a violation of the PPM to the
detriment” of all of Vendetta’s limited partners.3 Id. at 31.
3. Assurances against future violations, recognition of the wrongful nature of his
conduct, and opportunities for future violations
Although “[c]ourts have held that the existence of a past violation, without more, is not a
sufficient basis for imposing a bar[,] . . . ‘the existence of a violation raises an inference that it
will be repeated.’” Tzemach David Netzer Korem, Exchange Act Release No. 70044, 2013 SEC
LEXIS 2155, at *23 n.50 (July 26, 2013) (alteration in internal quotation omitted) (quoting
Geiger v. SEC, 363 F.3d 481, 489 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). In this proceeding, Sellers did not oppose
the Division’s motion and has submitted nothing to rebut that inference. He has also not made
any assurances against future violations or demonstrated that he understands the wrongful nature
of his conduct. This mirrors his conduct in the district court proceeding, in which the court
observed that he had not “expressed remorse or recognized [his] transgressions.” Div. App. at
36.
The Division did not introduce any evidence regarding Sellers’ past or current
occupation. Instead, it points only to the district court’s statement that Respondents had “shown
3

Respondents’ violations of the broker registration provision did not require a finding of
scienter, and the district court did not make findings regarding their states of mind when
violating Exchange Act Section 15(a). Div. App. at 31-34.
7

themselves capable of soliciting and negotiating with investors for millions of dollars in
securities transactions.” Div. Mot. at 7; Div. App. at 36. Without any additional insight into
Sellers’ occupational history, this factor does not weigh in favor of an industry bar.
4. Other considerations
The district court found that Respondents’ misconduct caused investor losses exceeding
$3 million, “a significant loss.” Div. App. at 41. And despite the limited time period and
absence of occupational evidence, an industry bar will “prevent [Sellers] from putting investors
at further risk and serve as a deterrent to others from engaging in similar misconduct.” Montford
& Co., Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3829, 2014 WL 1744130, at *20 (May 2,
2014), pet. denied, 793 F.3d 76 (D.C. Cir. 2015). His misconduct was egregious, relatively
recent, and committed with at least severe recklessness, further supporting the imposition of a
bar. On balance, the public interest factors weigh in favor of an industry bar against Sellers.
C.

1.

An Industry-Wide Bar Against Barrera, with the Right to Reapply in Five
Years, is in the Public Interest
Egregiousness, recency, and recurrence

Barrera argues in his motion for summary disposition that he “has never in his life sold a
security” and “simply introduced a childhood friend (Mr. Sellers) to another friend (Mr. Moore)
regarding a business opportunity.” Resp. Mot. at 1. But the district court’s reconsideration order
forecloses this attempt to minimize his involvement. The court found that the “undisputed facts
establish Barrera did more than simply introduce Moore to Sellers – he capitalized on his
friendship with Moore to solicit and help close the investment deal between Lacova and
Vendetta.” Div. App. at 82, 85. It also found that his “conduct in withholding information about
the structure and amount of his compensation, even after Moore asked him a direct question
about it, amounts to an intentional breach of [his] duty” to disclose material facts to Moore. Id.
at 86; see David F. Bandimere, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at *40-41.
But Barrera is correct that his conduct was less egregious and recurrent than Sellers’. He
was not an employee of Vendetta, and Moore was the only person he was actively involved in
soliciting. Div. App. at 13-14, 33. Even the district court acknowledged that “it could be argued
Barrera was not necessarily participating in securities transactions ‘regularly,’” despite the fact
that he was hired by Sellers to do so. Id. at 33. While Barrera arranged the initial meeting with
Moore and continued to act as an occasional intermediary between Vendetta and Moore, Sellers
appears to have done the bulk of the work required to secure Lacova’s investment. See id. at 14,
33. An affidavit submitted by Sellers supports Barrera’s claim that his role was comparatively
limited. See Sellers Aff. ¶¶ 1-2. And unlike Sellers, Barrera did not make an affirmative
misrepresentation about his commission; instead, he failed to correct Sellers’ statement in the
initial meeting and did not provide a direct answer to Moore’s question after the meeting. Div.
App. at 29 n.26, 85-86. I conclude that his actions, though relatively recent, were only
moderately egregious and recurrent.

8

2. Scienter
Barrera represents that he had no knowledge of the securities industry or its regulations at
the time he engaged in the conduct at issue. Resp. Mot. at 2. And I agree with Barrera’s
assertion that there is no evidence that he intentionally participated in the Ponzi scheme
orchestrated by Helms and Kaelin. See id. But the district court still found that he acted with
scienter – it concluded that he acted with a reckless disregard of his duty to disclose material
facts to Moore, and that his withholding of information about his commission amounted to an
intentional breach of that duty. Div. App. at 86. He remained silent when Sellers represented
that their commissions would be small, even though he knew he would receive two to three
percent of the $3,050,000 Moore invested. Id. at 16. And even if it is true that Barrera did not
read the PPM, he acted with “severe recklessness in failing to know that [his] commission was a
violation of the PPM to the detriment of all limited partners at Vendetta Partners.” Id. at 31. The
fact that he had no familiarity with securities regulation, and failed to read the PPM sent to
Moore, supports rather than undercuts a finding of recklessness.
3. Assurances against future violations, recognition of the wrongful nature of his
conduct, and opportunities for future violations
As with Sellers, the district court noted that Barrera did not express remorse or recognize
his misconduct during the underlying proceeding. Div. App. at 36. In his motion for summary
disposition, Barrera continues to insist that he “did not do anything wrong” and “just introduced
a couple friends,” though he does express remorse that his “introduction hurt these people.”
Resp. Mot. at 3. I conclude that Barrera has failed to adequately recognize the wrongful nature
of his conduct. His assurances against future violations are also tepid, centering primarily
around his insistence that he has no desire to return to the securities industry. See id. On the
other hand, the likelihood that his occupation will present opportunities for future violations
appears to be relatively low. Barrera asserts that his work for Sellers was an isolated deviation
from a career focused on design, contracting, and music production. Id. at 1, 3-4. He attaches an
affidavit in which a friend named Johnny Gehris corroborates this description of his employment
history. Gehris Aff. ¶¶ 1-3. Though he alludes to a new business venture in which unnamed
“business allies” are supporting him, his description does not necessitate the Division’s
conclusion the venture involves securities. Resp. Mot. at 3; Div. Opp. at 2.
4. Other considerations
Barrera’s misconduct caused over $3 million in investor losses, and there is a significant
need to deter others from reckless participation in an industry about which they are completely
ignorant. Div. App. at 41. But his conduct was neither particularly egregious nor recurrent, and
Barrera’s background and professed intention suggest that he will have few opportunities for
future violations. On the other hand, his willingness to participate in a securities offering with
zero knowledge or experience of the industry presents a potential risk to future investors, as does
his continued insistence that he did nothing wrong in connection with the investment at issue.
Based on the balance of the public interest factors, I have concluded that an industry bar for a
minimum of five years is appropriate.
