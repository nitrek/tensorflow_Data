Securities Act of 1933, Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against Sandra

$1,000,000, prejudgment interest of $164,000 and civil penalties of $250,000 to the
Commission and created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
