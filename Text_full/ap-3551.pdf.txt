On January 7, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. On January 20, I postponed the hearing in this matter and scheduled a prehearing
conference for February 18, 2016. Cinema Internet Networks Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3524, 2016 SEC LEXIS 216.
Respondents were served with the OIP by January 15, 2016, and their answers were due
by January 28, 2016. Id. To date, no Respondent has filed an answer.
Accordingly, I ORDER that by February 8, 2016, Respondents shall SHOW CAUSE

file answers or otherwise defend this proceeding. Any Respondent that fails to respond to this
order will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the registration
