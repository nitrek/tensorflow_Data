ORDER DENYING
RESPONDENTS’ MOTION FOR
SUMMARY DISPOSITION

On December 3, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings (OIP) against Respondents. The
hearing is scheduled to commence in Chicago on May 4, 2016.
Respondents filed their answers on January 15, 2016. At a prehearing conference held on
January 11, 2016, Respondents confirmed, through counsel, that they had received copies of the
investigative file. See Jan. 11, 2016, Tr. 4. On February 25, 2016, Respondents filed a motion
for summary disposition. The Division of Enforcement timely filed an opposition, Respondents
timely filed a reply, and the motion is now ripe for decision.
BACKGROUND
The OIP alleges two fraudulent schemes, only one of which, the “customer priority”
scheme, is addressed in the motion. The OIP alleges in pertinent part as follows:
Certain options exchanges distinguished between “professionals” (high-volume traders)
and “customers” (low-volume traders), and, as to customers, prioritized trade execution, charged
lower fees, and gave higher rebates. OIP at 2. A “customer priority” order was an order for the
account of a non-broker-dealer, where the non-broker-dealer’s orders in the aggregate fall below
the 390-order average daily threshold for each calendar month in a quarter. Id. at 6. Whether an
order was customer priority for a particular quarter was determined by the broker, in this case,
Lightspeed Trading, LLC, by analyzing orders from the previous quarter.
Id. at 6-7.
Respondents Fineline Trading Group LLC and Makino Capital LLC had separate accounts at
Lightspeed, but Respondent Behruz Afshar had an interest in both companies, and the individual
Respondents divided the two companies’ trading profits among themselves. Id. at 7-8.

Lightspeed therefore should have determined whether Fineline and Makino had customer
priority by aggregating orders in the two companies’ accounts. See id. at 6-7.
However, “[t]o avoid account aggregation, the [individual Respondents] misrepresented
to Lightspeed that Fineline and Makino did not share common ownership.” Id. at 7. The
individual Respondents then placed orders in only one company’s Lightspeed account during
each quarter, while the second company’s account lay dormant, so that each quarter one
company’s account would exceed the 390-order threshold and the other’s would not. Id. The
next quarter’s orders were placed only in the account of the second (customer priority) company,
while the account of the first (now-“professional” designated) company would lie dormant, so
that it would revert to customer priority the following quarter. Id. By alternating use of the two
company’s accounts, without full disclosure to Lightspeed, the individual Respondents were
consistently afforded customer priority when they should not have been, thereby obtaining over
$2 million in transaction fees wrongly avoided and higher rebates wrongly received between
October 2010 and December 2012. Id. at 2-3.
DISCUSSION
A. Summary Disposition Standard
After a respondent’s answer has been filed and documents have been made available to
that respondent for inspection and copying, a party may make a motion for summary disposition
of any or all allegations of the OIP with respect to that respondent. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a).
A motion for summary disposition may be granted if there is no genuine issue with regard to any
material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to summary disposition as a matter of
law. 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(b). When a respondent moves for summary disposition, the
allegations of the OIP must be taken as true, except as modified by stipulations or admissions
made by the Division, by uncontested affidavits, and by facts officially noticed pursuant to Rule
323. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). “The facts on summary disposition must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party.” Jay T. Comeaux, Securities Act of 1933 Release No.
9633, 2014 WL 4160054, at *2 (Aug. 21, 2014). Nonetheless, “[o]nce the moving party has
carried its burden of establishing that it is entitled to summary disposition on the factual record[,]
the opposing party may not rely on bare allegations or denials, but instead must present specific
facts showing a genuine issue of material fact for resolution at a hearing.” Id.
Respondents assert that Lightspeed used Merrill Lynch as an executing broker; the
Division does not dispute this assertion, and I have treated it as a stipulation. Compare Motion
at 7 n.6, with Opposition at 3-5. Otherwise, Respondents have offered no stipulations,
admissions, or uncontested affidavits, and although they cite to several officially noticeable
documents, those documents are immaterial. See Motion at 2-4. Indeed, the motion reads more
like a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(b)(6) than a motion for summary disposition. E.g., Motion at 1 (the disputed issues “are
distinctly appropriate for summary disposition taking the allegations of the OIP as true”). Except
as to the stipulation regarding Merrill Lynch, therefore, I have simply taken the OIP as true.

B. Rule 10b-5(b)
Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder make it unlawful for any
person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities to “make any untrue statement of a
material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,” among other
requirements. 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b); see 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); SEC v. Jakubowski, 150 F.3d
675, 678 (7th Cir. 1998). In order for primary liability under Rule 10b-5(b) to attach, the alleged
violator must be the “maker” of the misleading statements. See SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F.3d 1249,
1257 (10th Cir. 2008). The “maker” of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority
over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it. Janus Capital
Grp., Inc. v. First Derivative Traders, 564 U.S. 135, 142 (2011).
The OIP alleges that “[t]o avoid account aggregation, the [individual Respondents]
misrepresented to Lightspeed that Fineline and Makino did not share common ownership.” OIP
at 7. The OIP recites a specific example, in which Respondent Richard F. Kenny, IV, allegedly
“falsely represented [to Lightspeed] that only [Respondent] Shahryar [Afshar] would be trading
in each of the sub-accounts and that Shahryar was the only member of Makino, attaching trade
authorization forms signed by Shahryar listing only his name for each sub-account.” Id. at 10.
The alleged scheme “was intended to deceive, and did deceive, the exchanges” regarding the
status of the persons placing options orders. Id. at 11.
Taking the OIP’s allegations as true, Respondents are not entitled to summary disposition
as a matter of law. Unlike the defendants in Janus, who did not “make” the misrepresentations
at issue in that case, the OIP adequately alleges that the misrepresentations in suit were made by
“the Afshars and Kenny,” that is, that the individual Respondents had “ultimate authority” over
the misrepresentations at issue. Janus, 564 U.S. at 142. United States v. Finnerty, 533 F.3d 143
(2d Cir. 2008), on which Respondents rely, is inapposite. See Motion at 7. Unlike the customers
in Finnerty, who were not deceived, the alleged victims in this proceeding were left with the
false impression that Respondents were entitled to customer priority, a false impression created
by Respondents’ misrepresentations to Lightspeed. See 533 F.3d at 148-49; Motion at 6-7. And
even assuming that Respondents did not make affirmative misrepresentations, Rule 10b-5(b)
imposed a duty on Respondents to disclose material facts necessary in order to make their other
statements not misleading. See 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b); Motion at 8.
Respondents argue that they were not the makers of the “alleged misrepresentations
communicated to the supposedly aggrieved parties – i.e. the exchanges and other market
participants.” Reply at 4. The Division contends that Respondents were the makers of such
misrepresentations because they retained control over how their orders were designated, even
though the orders were communicated to the exchanges by Merrill Lynch. See Opposition at 45. SEC v. Pentagon Capital Mgmt. PLC, 725 F.3d 279 (2d Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct.
2896 (2014), is closely on point, and supports the Division’s position. In Pentagon, the
defendant was an investment adviser who was found liable for executing a late trading scheme in
mutual funds, involving orders bearing misleading timestamps placed with Pentagon’s broker,
who transmitted the orders to a clearing broker. See 725 F.3d at 282-83, 285-86. The court held
that Pentagon retained control over the relevant misrepresentations: “[t]o the extent that late
3

trading requires a ‘statement’ in the form of a transmission to a clearing broker, we find that in
this case, [defendants] were as much ‘makers’ of those statements as were the brokers.” Id. at
286. The OIP here similarly alleges misrepresentations, followed by transmission of information
derived from those misrepresentations to the victims, with no direct contact between the alleged
fraudfeasor and the victims. See OIP at 7-12. Therefore, assuming the Division proves that
Respondents retained “ultimate authority” over the misrepresentations to the exchanges, and
taking the OIP’s other allegations as true, Respondents could be found liable under Rule 10b5(b), notwithstanding Janus.1 564 U.S. at 142. Viewing the OIP’s allegations in the light most
favorable to the Division, Lightspeed and Merrill Lynch – in transmitting those
misrepresentations – are more akin to “[o]ne who . . . publishe[d] a statement on behalf of
another [and were] not its maker.” Id. Accordingly, insofar as Respondents argue that Janus
forecloses the Division’s Rule 10b-5(b) claim because the misrepresentations were not made by
them but rather made by the brokers to the exchanges, summary disposition is inappropriate.
Furthermore, Respondents have not identified any authority foreclosing Rule 10b-5(b)
liability in an enforcement action on the basis that a person made material misstatements to a
broker – rather than directly to the ultimate victim – in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities. Unlike Janus and Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552
U.S. 148 (2008), which involved private litigation, to establish liability here the Division need
not prove that a victim relied upon a misrepresentation. See John P. Flannery, Securities Act
Release No. 9689, 2014 WL 7145625, at *13 (Dec. 15, 2014), rev’d on other grounds, 810 F.3d
1 (1st Cir. 2015). It may be that the remoteness of a misrepresentation is as irrelevant under Rule
10b-5(b), as here, as it is under Section 17(a)(2), as in Flannery.
But the Commission did not explicitly rule on this issue in Flannery. See 2014 WL
7145625, at *10-11. And in a recent opinion, the Commission noted – regarding the
respondent’s argument that he should not be held liable for fraudulent statements that he did not
transmit directly to investors – that Janus did not preclude a finding that the respondent was
secondarily liable for misstatements made by an intervening firm. Bernerd E. Young, Securities
Act Release No. 10060, 2016 WL 1168564, at *19 (Mar. 24, 2016). In view of the relatively
limited summary disposition briefing and evidence the parties have provided, and of the apparent
dearth of authority addressing this precise issue, it would be imprudent to rule on it now. I
therefore deny summary disposition on the Rule 10b-5(b) claim as to Respondents’ alleged
misstatements to Lightspeed, without prejudice to renewal of Respondents’ arguments in posthearing briefing.
C. Rule 10b-5(a) and (c)
Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder make it unlawful for
any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities to “employ any device, scheme,
or artifice to defraud” or to “engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or
would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person.” 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(a), (c); see 15
1

I also assume that Merrill Lynch’s misrepresentations to the exchanges and respondents’ role in
causing those misrepresentations are properly alleged in the OIP. Because Merrill Lynch is not
referenced in the OIP, this assumption may not be warranted.
4

U.S.C. § 78j(b). “Conduct itself can be deceptive,” and there is no requirement that “there must
be a specific oral or written statement before there [can] be liability under § 10(b) or Rule 10b5.” Stoneridge, 552 U.S. at 158. At the same time, “scheme liability does not preclude, outright,
claims based upon a scheme to misrepresent or omit material facts.” SEC v. Goldstone, 952 F.
Supp. 2d 1060, 1206 (D.N.M. 2013); see generally John P. Flannery, 2014 WL 7145625, at *12*13, *24-*25.
Respondents correctly observe that their alleged misrepresentations were important
elements of the customer priority scheme outlined in the OIP. See Motion at 9. However, their
contention that the OIP “contains no allegations of additional deceptive conduct beyond the
‘misrepresentation’ itself” is wrong. Motion at 9. As only one example, the alleged use of Third
Rail to “facilitate money transfers between Fineline and Makino,” in lieu of transferring funds
between Fineline and Makino directly, is just such an additional allegation of deceptive conduct.
OIP at 10-11; see generally Opposition at 8-9 (summarizing allegations supporting scheme
liability). Respondents dispute the OIP’s allegation that such fund transfers were intended to
conceal the affiliation between Fineline and Makino, but offer no evidence to rebut that
allegation; in the absence of such evidence, I must take the allegation as true. See Reply at 7.
Summary disposition on the claim of scheme liability is not warranted.
D. Exchange Rules
Respondents argue that “violation of an exchange rule simply is not enough” to constitute
securities fraud. Motion at 9, 11. Respondents mischaracterize the OIP. The OIP does not
allege that they violated an exchange rule and thereby necessarily committed securities fraud; it
alleges that they committed securities fraud by, among other things, repeatedly deceiving their
broker regarding facts necessary to the broker’s implementation of an exchange rule. See OIP at
7. Respondent’s reliance on Finnerty, in which the government failed to prove the requisite
deceptive conduct or misrepresentations, is therefore misplaced. See 533 F.3d at 148.
E. Purchases Under Section 17
Respondents argue that “mismarked orders in which Respondents were the purchasers”
are not actionable under Securities Act Section 17, which prohibits misconduct only in the “offer
or sale of any securities.” Motion at 12; 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a). To be sure, if Respondents are
found liable for Section 17 violations but not for Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 violations, any
sanctions in the public interest, such as disgorgement, will have to account for the differences
between the two statutes. But calculation of disgorgement is “a fact intensive [exercise] that
many courts suggest should be considered only after a finding of liability.” SEC v. Conaway,
No. 2:05-CV-40263, 2009 WL 902063, at *19 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2009). Respondents will be
afforded a full and fair opportunity to address this issue in post-hearing briefing. Ruling on the
proper method of such calculation at this juncture, however, is impractical and inappropriate.
F. Section 17(a)(3)
Respondents argue in the motion that Securities Act Section 17(a)(3) does not apply to
the customer priority scheme because no purchasers were defrauded. See Motion at 12-13
5

(citing 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(3)). As the Division correctly notes, the OIP contains no Section
17(a)(3) allegation as to the customer priority scheme. Opp. at 12; see OIP at 16-17.
ORDER
Respondents’ motion for summary disposition is DENIED.
