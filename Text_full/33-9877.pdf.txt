I. BACKGROUND
A. Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act
Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(the “Dodd-Frank Act”) 5 directs us to amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K (“Item 402”) 6 to
require each registrant, other than an emerging growth company, as that term is defined in Section
3(a) of the Exchange Act, to disclose in any filing of the registrant described in Item 10(a) of
Regulation S-K (or any successor thereto) 7: (A) the median of the annual total compensation of
all employees of the registrant, except the chief executive officer (“CEO”) (or any equivalent
position) of the registrant; (B) the annual total compensation of the CEO (or any equivalent
position) of the registrant; and (C) the ratio of the median of the total compensation of all
employees of the registrant to the annual total compensation of the CEO of the registrant. Section
953(b)(2) specifies that, for purposes of Section 953(b), “total compensation” of an employee of a
registrant shall be determined in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K as in effect
on the day before the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. As discussed in detail below, we
are adopting amendments to Item 402 to implement Section 953(b). 8 We refer to this disclosure

5

Public Law No. 111-203, sec. 953(b), 124 Stat. 1376, 1904 (2010), as amended by Public Law No. 112-106,
sec. 102(a)(3), 126 Stat. 306, 309 (2012). Section 102(a)(3) of the JOBS Act amended Section 953(b) of the
Dodd-Frank Act to provide an exemption for registrants that are emerging growth companies as that term is
defined in Section 3(a) of the Exchange Act.

6

17 CFR 229.402. As discussed in greater detail below, consistent with Section 953(b), the final rule requires
a registrant to provide the pay ratio disclosure in any filing described in Item 10(a) of Regulation S-K that
calls for executive compensation disclosure under Item 402, including annual reports on Form 10-K,
registration statements under the Securities Act and Exchange Act, and proxy and information statements, to
the same extent that these forms require compliance with Item 402. Therefore, any company that provides
such a filing is subject to the final rule. Section 953(b) refers to any such company as an “issuer.” In this
release, to be consistent with other releases, we generally refer to such a company as a “registrant.” For the
purposes of this release, unless otherwise expressly specified, these terms are used interchangeably.

7

17 CFR 229.10(a).

8

On September 18, 2013, we proposed amendments to implement Section 953(b). See Pay Ratio Disclosure,
Release No. 33-9452 (Sept. 18, 2013) [78 FR 60560] (“Proposing Release”).

of the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the registrant, the annual total
compensation of the principal executive officer (“PEO”) of the registrant, 9 and the ratio of the two
amounts as “pay ratio” disclosure.
Congress did not expressly state the specific objectives or intended benefits of Section
953(b), and the legislative history of the Dodd-Frank Act also does not expressly state the
Congressional purpose underlying Section 953(b). 10 As discussed below, based on our analysis
of the statute and comments received, we believe Section 953(b) was intended to provide
shareholders with a company-specific metric that can assist in their evaluation of a registrant’s
executive compensation practices. Accordingly, we have sought to tailor the final rule to meet
that purpose while avoiding unnecessary costs.
In informing our understanding of the Congressional purpose of Section 953(b), we have
considered the surrounding provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act 11 as well as the comments that we
received during this rulemaking. Subtitle E of Title IX of the Dodd-Frank Act, headed —
“Accountability and Executive Compensation” is, as explained in the Conference Report for the

9

The term “CEO” in the executive compensation rules was replaced by the term “PEO” as part of the 2006
amendments to Item 402 in order to maintain consistency with the nomenclature used in Item 5.02 of Form
8-K. See Executive Compensation and Related Person Disclosure, Release No. 33-8732A, n. 326 (Aug. 29,
2006) [71 FR 53158] (“2006 Adopting Release”). Consistent with the language of current Item 402, both
the proposed rule and the final rule use the term “PEO” in lieu of “CEO.”

10

See letters from National Association of Manufacturers (Jul. 6, 2015) (“NAM II”) (stating that it concurs
with our conclusion in the Proposing Release that neither the statute nor the related legislative history
directly states the objectives or intended benefits of the provision) and WorldatWork (Jul. 6, 2015)
(“WorldatWork II”).

11

See, e.g., Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 496 (1996) (“Congress’ intent, of course, primarily is
discerned from the language of the … statute and the ‘statutory framework’ surrounding it. Also relevant,
however, is the ‘structure and purpose of the statute as a whole,’ as revealed not only in the text, but through
… reasoned understanding of the way in which congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory
scheme to affect business, consumers, and law.”) and Maine Public Utilities Comm’n v. FERC, 545 F.3d
278, 282 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“This court applies the traditional tools of statutory interpretation in determining
congressional intent, looking to the text, structure, purpose, and legislative history of a statute.”).

legislation, “designed to address shareholder rights and executive compensation practices.” 12 Its
provisions, including Section 953(b), address various aspects of executive compensation with a
focus on encouraging shareholder engagement in executive compensation matters by, among
other things, increasing the transparency of compensation. In Section 951, for example, Congress
required companies to provide for periodic shareholder votes on executive compensation. In
implementing Congress’s directive, we noted that a key function of the disclosures required
incident to the new voting requirement was to “provide shareholders and investors with timely
information” that was potentially useful to them “as they consider voting and investment
decisions.” 13 Section 952 requires, in turn, that both compensation committee members of
registrants and their advisors be independent. We noted that the rules implementing Section 952
could serve an informational purpose that benefits “investors to the extent they enable
compensation committees to make better informed decisions regarding the amount or form of
executive compensation.” 14 Further, as we noted in the release proposing implementation of
Section 953(a), that section is intended to provide shareholders with metrics that will help them
assess executive compensation relative to the registrant’s performance. 15 The Section 953(a)
information is intended, among other things, to assist shareholders when exercising their say-onpay voting rights under Section 951.
We believe that Section 953(b) should be interpreted consonant with Subtitle E’s general
purpose of further facilitating shareholder engagement with executive compensation. Thus, we

believe that Congress intended Section 953(b) to supplement the executive compensation
information available to shareholders. Particularly, Section 953(b) provides new data points that
shareholders may find relevant and useful when exercising their voting rights under Section
951. 16 Several commenters stated affirmatively that they would find the new data points,
including pay ratio disclosure, relevant and useful when making voting decisions. 17 Some
commenters in the pre-proposing period 18 suggested specifically that shareholders of public
companies could use the pay ratio information, together with pay-versus-performance disclosure,
to help inform their say-on-pay votes, which could also be a tool for shareholders to hold
companies accountable for their CEO compensation. 19 A significant consideration for us in
fashioning a final rule implementing Section 953(b), then, is the extent to which elements of the
16

We note that the say-on-pay votes extend to certain other senior officers at the registrant beyond the PEO
while the pay ratio disclosure is solely focused on a comparison of the PEO’s compensation to the median
employee’s compensation. However, we do not think that this diminishes the overall utility of the pay ratio
disclosures to say-on-pay votes. The PEO will typically be the highest compensated officer at a registrant
and, to the extent shareholders rely on the pay ratio disclosure to determine whether the PEO’s
compensation is appropriate or not, it also may inform shareholders’ relative assessment of the
compensation of the other senior officers whose compensation is subject to say-on-pay votes.

final rule further Congress’s apparent goal of giving shareholders additional executive
compensation information to enhance the shareholder engagement envisioned by Section 951. 20
Consistent with this understanding of the Congressional purpose of Section 953(b), we
believe the final pay ratio rule should be designed to allow shareholders to better understand and
assess a particular registrant’s compensation practices and pay ratio disclosures rather than to
facilitate a comparison of this information from one registrant to another. 21 As we noted in the
Proposing Release, we do not believe that precise conformity or comparability of the pay ratio
across companies is necessarily achievable given the variety of factors that could cause the ratio
to differ. Consequently, we believe the primary benefit of the pay ratio disclosure is to provide
shareholders with a company-specific metric that they can use to evaluate the PEO’s
compensation within the context of their company.
On the other hand, some commenters asserted that the pay ratio disclosure would not
provide meaningful or material information to shareholders in making voting or investment
decisions. 22 In support of this contention, some of these commenters cited studies demonstrating

20

We note that some commenters contended that the pay ratio disclosure is intended to publicly “shame”
registrants concerning the size of the disparity between their CEO’s compensation and their typical worker’s
compensation. See, e.g., letters from The Honorable Carolos Cardozo Campbell, Former Assistant Secretary
of Commerce for Economic Development (Nov. 27, 2013) (“Former Assistant Secretary Campbell”); Center
on Executive Compensation (Jul. 6, 2015) (“COEC III”); Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc. (Dec. 2,
2013) (“Hyster-Yale”); NACCO Industries, Inc. (Dec. 2, 2013) (“NACCO”); and U.S. Chamber of
Commerce (Dec. 2, 2013) (“Chamber I”). As discussed above, we have reached a different conclusion
based on principles of statutory construction and have taken no such objective into account in framing the
rule. In crafting the final rule, we have sought to carefully tailor the pay ratio disclosure requirement so that
it provides shareholders with a company-specific metric that is relevant and useful to their say-on-pay
voting.

that shareholders are not interested in this information, 23 some commenters cited shareholder
votes indicating a high level of support for executive pay and little support for shareholder
proposals advocating for pay ratio disclosure, 24 and some commenters contended that pay ratio
disclosure would confuse shareholders because they would rely on it without fully considering a
company’s detailed narrative disclosures. 25 Notwithstanding the disagreement among
commenters on the value of the pay ratio disclosure, in adopting the final rule we have sought to
implement Congress’s apparent determination that the pay ratio disclosure would be useful to
shareholders.
We also recognize that many commenters raised significant concerns about the costs of
providing the required pay ratio disclosure. In implementing the statutory requirements, we have
exercised our exemptive authority and provided flexibility in a manner that we expect will reduce
costs and burdens for registrants, while preserving what we perceive to be the purpose and

(Dec. 2, 2013) (“Mercer I”); NACCO; and Pearl Meyer and Partners (Dec. 2, 2013) (“PM&P”).

See, e.g., letters from Chamber I (citing the Center for Audit Quality’s 7th annual Main Street Investor
Survey, which ranked CEO compensation last on the list of factors used by shareholders to make investment
decisions, with only 16% saying it was essential to their decision); COEC I (acknowledging that, while some
literature focuses on pay disparities among employees with comparable jobs, the study frequently cited for
the impact of disparities on collaboration, “Pay Disparities Within Top Management Groups: Evidence of
Harmful Effects on Performance of High-Technology Firms” by Phyllis Siegel and Donald C. Hambrick,
concerns executive pay and pay disparities among top executives, it does not discuss pay disparities between
the CEO and median employee), and International Bancshares Corporation (Nov. 25, 2013) (“IBC”) (citing
a Wall Street Journal article that says only 10% of individuals polled believed pay ratio would have value to
shareholders) .

24

See, e.g., letters from Chamber I (indicating that the average support for management compensation in
public companies was 90.1%, and 97.6% of companies received majority shareholder support for executive
compensation) and COEC I (noting that, since 2010, there have been 14 shareholder proposals advocating
that companies provide pay ratio disclosure, and those proposals averaged 93% opposition from
shareholders, with none receiving at least 10% support from shareholders).

25

See, e.g., letters from Bill Barrett Corp., COEC I, National Investor Relations Institute (Oct. 17, 2013)
(“NIRI”), and Semtech Corporation (Nov. 27, 2013) (“Semtech”). Two of these commenters suggested
specifically that we should undertake an education effort to help shareholders understand the limits of pay
ratio disclosure and remind them that they can find other information, such as an executive summary of the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of a company’s proxy statement, which can provide a more
complete understanding of corporate pay practices. See letters from NIRI and Semtech.

intended benefits of the disclosure required by Section 953(b). 26 The significant cost estimates of
the pay ratio disclosure submitted by some commenters support our view that some
accommodations are appropriate. 27 The final rule, therefore, both maintains the flexibility and
accommodations from the proposal (such as permitting the use of statistical sampling and a
consistent compensation measure to identify the median employee and reasonable estimates to
calculate total compensation) and provides additional flexibility as follows: the final rule takes a
flexible approach to the methodology a registrant can use to identify its median employee and
calculate the median employee’s annual total compensation; provides a de minimis exemption for
non-U.S. employees and an exemption for registrants where, despite reasonable efforts to obtain
or process the information necessary for compliance with the final rule, they are unable to do so
without violating a foreign jurisdiction’s laws or regulations governing data privacy; permits costof-living adjustments for the compensation of employees in jurisdictions other than the
jurisdiction in which the PEO resides so that the compensation is adjusted to the cost of living in
the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides; gives registrants the ability to make the median
employee determination only once every three years and to choose as a determination date any
date within the last three months of a registrant’s fiscal year; and provides transition periods for
new registrants, registrants engaging in business combinations or acquisitions, and registrants that
cease to be smaller reporting companies or emerging growth companies.
Overall, we think the final rule will provide investors with information Congress intended
them to have to assess the compensation and accountability of a company’s PEO while seeking to
26

We are mindful of the principle that “no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs,” Rodriguez v. United
States, 480 U.S. 522, 525-26 (1987), and we believe that the accommodations that we have included within
the final rule reflect an appropriate balance.

27

The potential costs arising from the requirements of Section 953(b), as well as the potential costs relating to
the final rule, are discussed in detail below in Section III of this release under the heading “Economic
Analysis.”

14

limit the costs and practical difficulties of providing the disclosure.
Finally, we recognize the possibility that, based on the specific facts and circumstances of
a registrant’s work force and corporate operations, the pay ratio disclosure may warrant additional
disclosures from a registrant to ensure that, in the registrant’s view, the pay ratio disclosure is a
meaningful data point for investors when making their say-on-pay votes. While Congress appears
to have believed that the pay ratio disclosure would be a useful data point, we recognize that its
relative usefulness—taken alone without accompanying disclosures to provide potentially
important context—may vary considerably. Rather than prescribe a one-size-fits-all catalogue of
additional disclosures that registrants should provide to put the pay ratio disclosure in context, we
believe it is the better course to provide registrants the flexibility to provide additional disclosures
that they believe will assist investors’ understanding of the meaning of pay ratio disclosure when
making say-on-pay votes. In this way, we believe we can best fulfill Congress’s directive in
Section 953(b) while avoiding unnecessary costs and complexities that might result from
mandating additional disclosures.
B. Summary of the Proposed Rule
In September 2013, we proposed a new rule to implement Section 953(b) of the DoddFrank Act. 28 The proposal’s goal was to implement the statutory directive, while minimizing
costs. In response to public comments we received prior to the proposal about the significant
potential costs of complying with this requirement, the proposed rule would allow registrants
flexibility in developing the disclosure required by the statute. We recognized that a one-size-fitsall approach would not be appropriate, given the wide range of affected registrants and the
disparate burdens that would be imposed on them based on such factors as their business types
28

See Proposing Release.

15

and the complexity of their payroll systems. We therefore proposed to implement Section 953(b)
in a manner that we believed would lower the cost of compliance while remaining consistent with
the requirements of Section 953(b).
The proposed rule would require companies to disclose the median of the annual total
compensation of all its employees except the PEO, the annual total compensation of its PEO, and
the ratio of the two amounts. The proposed rule would not have specified a single calculation
methodology for identifying the median employee. Instead, it would permit registrants to select a
methodology for identifying the median employee that was appropriate to the size and structure of
their business and the way they compensate employees. Under the proposal, registrants could
have chosen to identify the median employee by analyzing their full employee population or by
using statistical sampling or another reasonable method. Also, to identify the median, registrants
could have used “total compensation,” as defined in our existing rules, namely Item 402(c)(2)(x),
or any consistently applied compensation measure, such as information derived from tax and/or
payroll records. The proposed rule would not prescribe a particular methodology or specific
computation parameters.
Once the median employee was identified, the proposed rule would require the registrant
to calculate the annual total compensation for that median employee in accordance with the
definition of “total compensation” set forth in Item 402(c)(2)(x), which requires companies to
provide extensive compensation information for the PEO and other named executive officers.
“Total compensation” under Item 402(c)(2)(x) is not ordinarily calculated for all employees. The
proposed rule, therefore, would permit registrants to use reasonable estimates in calculating any
element of total compensation and in calculating the annual total compensation of the median
employee. Also, the proposed rule would define “annual total compensation” to mean total

16

compensation for the last completed fiscal year, which would be consistent with our existing
executive compensation disclosure requirements.
Under the proposal, if a registrant used a compensation measure other than annual total
compensation to identify the median employee, it would be required to disclose the compensation
measure it used. Also, the registrant would be required to briefly describe and consistently apply
any methodology it used to identify the median and any material assumptions, adjustments, or
estimates used to identify the median employee or determine total compensation or any elements
of total compensation for that employee or the PEO, and the registrant would need to clearly
identify any amounts it estimated. Finally, registrants would be permitted, but not required, to
supplement their disclosure with a narrative discussion or additional ratios if they chose to do so.
Section 953(b) does not define the term “employee.” The proposed rule would define that
term, for purposes of pay ratio disclosure, to include any individual employed by the registrant or
any of its subsidiaries as of the last day of the registrant’s last completed fiscal year. The
proposed definition would encompass any full-time, part-time, seasonal, or temporary employees
of the registrant or any of its subsidiaries, including any non-U.S. employee. Also, a registrant
would be permitted, but not required, to annualize the total compensation for a permanent
employee who was employed at year-end but did not work for the entire year. In contrast, fulltime equivalent adjustments for part-time employees, annualizing adjustments for temporary and
seasonal employees, and cost-of-living adjustments for non-U.S. employees would not be
permitted.
Also, under the proposal, registrants would be required to provide the proposed pay ratio
disclosure in registration statements, proxy and information statements, and annual reports
required to include executive compensation information as set forth under Item 402. Registrants,

17

however, would not be required to provide their pay ratio information in reports that did not
include Item 402 executive compensation information, such as current and quarterly reports.
Additionally, registrants would not be required to update their annual pay ratio disclosure until
they filed their annual report on Form 10-K for their last completed fiscal year or, if later, their
definitive proxy or information statement for their next annual meeting of shareholders (or written
consents in lieu of such a meeting). Registrants, however, would still be required to file their pay
ratio information no later than 120 days after the end of the last fiscal year as provided in General
Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K. 29
The proposal would provide a transition period for newly public companies. For these
companies, initial compliance would be required with respect to compensation for the first fiscal
year commencing on or after the date the company became subject to the reporting requirements.
Also, as provided by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”), 30 the proposed rule
would not apply to emerging growth companies. Finally, the proposed rule would not apply to
smaller reporting companies or foreign private issuers.
C. Summary of the General Comments on the Proposed Rule
In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on many aspects of the proposed rule,
including whether the proposed rule would address sufficiently the practical difficulties of data
collection, whether other alternative approaches consistent with Section 953(b) could provide the
potential benefits of pay ratio information at a lower cost, and whether the proposed flexible
approach would appropriately implement Section 953(b). We received a large volume of
comment letters from a variety of stakeholders. We received more than 287,400 comment letters,

29

17 CFR 249.310.

30

15 U.S.C. 78c(a).

18

including over 1,540 individual letters that reflected a wide range of views concerning the
proposed rule and the potential costs and benefits associated with its requirements. We received
comments that addressed the proposed rule as a whole (including commenters that supported or
opposed the rule in its entirety) as well as comments directed toward particular requirements of
the rule, such as its application to foreign, part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees. In this
section, we summarize the general comments on the proposal as a whole. Comments on
particular provisions of the proposed rule are addressed as part of the discussion of each specific
provision of the rule in Section II below.
Of the over 287,400 total comment letters we received, over 285,900 were form letters
regarding the proposed rule. There were 12 types of form letters, 31 and these letters either
supported our proposed rule or supported the idea of adopting a rule based on Section 953(b)
without specifically referencing the proposal.
For example, one form letter asserted that the pay ratio disclosure is material to investors
because high pay disparities can impair employee morale and productivity and have negative
consequences on a company’s overall performance and because investors will have a “valuable
additional” measure for evaluating executive compensation, including when making say-on-pay
voting decisions. 32 Also, the letter supported the proposed rule’s inclusion of all employees,
including non-U.S. and part-time employees, and its flexibility in identifying the median

We have received 285,936 form letters. Form Letter A (19,965 letters) supporting a strong rule generally;
Form Letter B (12,942 letters) supporting a strong rule generally; Form Letter C (20 letters) supporting the
Proposed Rule; Form Letter D (5,428 letters) supporting the Proposed Rule; Form Letter E (1,688 letters)
supporting the Proposed Rule; Form Letter F (1,167 letters) supporting the Proposed Rule; Form Letter G
(15,304 letters) supporting the Proposed Rule; Form Letter H (70,338 letters) supporting a rule generally;
Form Letter I (36,299 letters) supporting the adoption of a rule; Form Letter J (75,333 letters) supporting a
strong rule; Form Letter K (15,247 letters) supporting a strong rule generally; and Form Letter L (32,275
letters) supporting a rule.

employee. Other form letters also indicated that the pay ratio disclosure is material to investors, 33
including some that noted that the disclosure would aid them in making voting decisions. 34
Additionally, the vast majority of the over 1,500 unique comment letters were from
individual commenters who, like those submitting the form letters, supported the proposed rule or
supported the idea of adopting a rule based on Section 953(b) without specifically referencing the
proposal. Most of these individuals supported the proposed rule or the pay ratio disclosure
because they believed it would:
•

inform shareholders about executive compensation matters, especially with regard to
say-on-pay voting; 35

•

demonstrate a company’s focus on its long-term health as opposed to short-term gains
that benefit its executives at the expense of its shareholders; 36

voting on executive compensation matters. The ratio of the CEO-to-worker pay is a valuable metric for
investors, because it places CEO pay levels into a broader perspective.”), Form Letter E (“Pay ratio
disclosure will help investors evaluate CEO pay levels when voting on executive compensation matters.
The ratio of the CEO-to-worker pay is a valuable tool for investors in evaluating and voting on CEO pay;
scrutinizing the performance of Boards of Directors; and, identifying possible investment risks.”), Form
Letter F (“A pay ratio disclosure will help investors better evaluate CEO pay levels when voting on
executive compensation matters. Compensation experts have found that there is a correlation between high
CEO pay and poor performance. By mandating disclosure of the ratio of CEO to worker pay, inequities will
be become more transparent.”).

costs and burdens of the proposed rule without reducing the rule’s benefits, 41 be consistent with
the directives of Section 953(b), 42 and have minimal effect on the pay ratio disclosure. 43 Other
commenters, however, opposed the proposed rule because they believed it provided too much
flexibility, which they asserted would allow registrants to manipulate the ratio in their favor, 44
decrease the ratio’s utility (especially for comparing the ratios of different companies), 45 and still
lead to high costs. 46 One commenter suggested that the final rule consist of little more than “a
simple restatement” of Section 953(b), doing “little more than rearranging a few commas and
adding a word or two to the statutory language.” 47
A number of commenters were critical of the proposed rule or particular aspects of it, as
discussed in greater detail below. Some commenters stated specifically that they opposed the
proposed rule or Section 953(b)’s requirement that we adopt any pay ratio rule. Some of these

commenters asserted that the rule would not provide shareholders with material information. 48
Other commenters noted that the pay ratio disclosure would not allow for meaningful
comparisons among registrants. 49 One commenter asserted that Section 953(b) and the proposed
rule violate the First Amendment. 50
A few commenters stated that we should not adopt a final rule until we demonstrate that
the rule is consistent with our mission and fully explain the benefits and costs of the rule. 51 In this
regard, one of these commenters criticized us for not making a statement about our precise goals
or objectives for the rule, especially when Congress failed to hold hearings on Section 953(b). 52
The commenter also stated that, without this statement and further explanations as to why we
rejected less costly options, commenters cannot be fully informed and provide constructive
comments. Several commenters argued that the proposed rule would be very costly to implement

to enable them to see the ratio of principal executive to employee compensation for a specific registrant from

50

See letter from COEC I. We do not believe that the pay ratio disclosure that Congress has mandated is
inconsistent with the First Amendment. We believe that, in passing Section 953(b), Congress determined
that the disclosure advances an important government interest, and we have carefully tailored the disclosure
through this rulemaking to further that interest. Moreover, consistent with Congress’s apparent purpose,
commenters have stated that the pay ratio disclosure would be useful to shareholders in making say-on-pay
votes. Accordingly, we believe the disclosure fits comfortably within the class of securities law disclosures
that have been deemed to be consistent with the First Amendment. See Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v.
Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 758, n.5 (1985) (citing Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S.

though many of these did not provide specific cost estimates. 53 A majority of these commenters
indicated that navigating their payroll systems and creating a single database of all their
employees’ compensation would be the most costly aspect of the proposed rule – especially with
respect to non-U.S. employees. 54 Commenters also mentioned other activities that would
contribute to the costs, including data privacy compliance, foreign exchange calculations, data
testing, establishing corporate guidelines, obtaining legal services, auditing results, public
relations tasks, and litigation risk. 55 As discussed below, some commenters provided specific cost
and burden estimates about the proposed rule to demonstrate generally that it would impose high
costs and burdens on registrants. 56 In addition, some commenters argued that the pay ratio
disclosure would impose a burden on competition or would cause competitive disadvantages for
particular types of companies. 57 Our analysis of the costs of the final rule, as well as an
assessment of its impact on competition, is contained in the Economic Analysis section below.
A number of commenters recommended that we take additional preliminary steps before
adopting a final rule. Some commenters requested that we extend the proposed rule’s comment

period. 58 Another commenter suggested that we re-solicit comments after publishing the
concerns it expressed. 59 A few commenters advocated that we involve stakeholders in the
rulemaking process by holding a roundtable, engaging in negotiated rulemaking, and/or
conducting pilot programs. 60 One of these commenters also recommended submitting the
proposed rule to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for an enhanced regulatory
review. 61 A few commenters suggested that we defer adopting a final rule under Section 953(b)
until we adopt other rules required under the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly the pay-versusperformance rule mandated by Section 953(a). 62
As discussed above, members of the public interested in making their views known were
invited to submit comment letters in advance of the official comment period for the proposed rule.
In addition, we have continued to review and consider all comment letters submitted during and
after the end of the comment period. Also, as discussed further in the Economic Analysis section
below, we have considered and analyzed the numerous comments received regarding the costs
and complexities of the mandated disclosure and have taken them into account in the final
rule. Finally, we added to this rulemaking’s public comment file additional analyses by the
Commission’s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis staff on the potential effects of excluding
different percentages of employees from the pay ratio calculation, and commenters were
expressly invited to comment on the analyses.
This robust and public debate has informed us in developing our final rule. Overall, we

believe interested parties have had sufficient opportunity to review the proposed rule, as well as
the comment letters submitted, and to provide views on the proposal and on the other comment
letters and data to inform our consideration of the final rule. Accordingly, we do not believe it is
necessary to solicit additional public input before adopting the final rule.
D. Summary of Changes in the Final Rule
The final rule we are adopting generally is consistent with the proposed rule. After
considering all of the comments received on the proposal, however, and in particular, after
considering specific suggestions from commenters on alternatives that could help to mitigate
compliance costs and practical difficulties associated with the proposed rule, we are adopting a
number of revisions in the final rule. We believe these revisions generally will preserve
Congress’s intent to require the disclosure of information that reflects the ratio of the PEO’s
compensation to the median employee’s compensation while helping to minimize the expected
costs and unintended consequences of the required disclosure. We summarize some of these
changes here and discuss them in greater detail in Section II, below.
1. Non-U.S. Employee Exemptions and Additional Permitted Disclosure
We proposed that an “employee” would include any U.S. and non-U.S. employee of a
registrant. We acknowledged in the Proposing Release that the inclusion of non-U.S. employees
would raise compliance costs for multinational companies, would introduce cross-border
compliance issues, could raise additional comparability concerns, and could have an adverse
impact on competition. We indicated, however, that the inclusion of non-U.S. employees in the
calculation of the median is consistent with the “all employees” language of the statute.
The final rule defines the term “employee” to include U.S. employees and employees
located in a jurisdiction outside the United States (“non-U.S. employees”) of a registrant, as

26

proposed. We continue to believe that this is most consistent with the statutory language of
Section 953(b) and with the purpose of providing a company-specific metric that shareholders can
use to evaluate a registrant’s executive compensation. Including both U.S. and non-U.S.
employees will result in pay ratio disclosure that reflects the actual composition of the registrant’s
workforce. Even assuming the statutory language could be viewed as ambiguous on this issue,
we also believe that this approach is most consistent with the general nature of our disclosure
regime, which does not limit registrants’ disclosure obligations only to factors, events, or
circumstances that exist in or take place within the United States. For example, a registrant must
disclose the PEO’s compensation whether or not the PEO actually works within the United States.
To help address concerns about compliance costs, and consistent with the commenters’
suggestions, the final rule provides two tailored exemptions from the definition of “employee,”
which otherwise includes all of a registrant’s U.S. and non-U.S. employees in the median
employee determination. First, the final rule provides an exemption for circumstances in which
foreign data privacy laws or regulations make registrants unable to comply with the final rule.
Second, the final rule permits registrants to exempt non-U.S. employees where these employees
account for 5% or less of the registrant’s total U.S. and non-U.S. employees, with certain
limitations.
The Proposing Release acknowledged that data privacy laws or regulations in various
foreign jurisdictions could affect a registrant’s ability to gather the necessary data to identify its
median employee. We did not propose any accommodation to address this concern, however,
because we believed the flexibility of the proposed rule would permit registrants to manage any
potential costs arising from these laws. In response to significant concerns expressed by a
number of commenters over cross-border compliance issues that may arise from the pay ratio

27

disclosure requirement, and consistent with commenters’ suggestions, the final rule permits
registrants to exclude from their determination of the median employee an employee who is
employed in a foreign jurisdiction in which the laws or regulations governing data privacy are
such that, despite its reasonable efforts to obtain or process the information necessary for
compliance with the final rule, the registrant is unable to do so without violating such data privacy
laws or regulations.
The registrant’s reasonable efforts must include using or seeking an exemption or other
relief under any governing data privacy laws or regulations. If a registrant excludes any non-U.S.
employees in a particular jurisdiction under this exemption, it must exclude all non-U.S.
employees in that jurisdiction, list the excluded jurisdictions, identify the specific data privacy
law or regulation, explain how complying with the final rule violates such data privacy law or
regulation (including the efforts made by the registrant to use or seek an exemption or other relief
under such law or regulation), and provide the approximate number of employees exempted from
each jurisdiction based on this exemption. In addition, the registrant must obtain a legal opinion
from counsel that opines on the inability of the registrant to obtain or process the information
necessary for compliance with the final rule without violating that jurisdiction’s data privacy laws
or regulations, including the registrant’s inability to obtain an exemption or other relief under any
governing laws or provisions.
In addition to the data privacy exemption for non-U.S. employees, the final rule includes a
de minimis exemption for non-U.S. employees. Under the final rule, if a registrant’s non-U.S.
employees account for 5% or less of its total employees, it may exclude all of those employees
when making its pay ratio calculations. In this circumstance, however, if the registrant chooses to
exclude any non-U.S. employees, it must exclude all of them. If a registrant’s non-U.S.

28

employees exceed 5% of the registrant’s total U.S. and non-U.S. employees, it may exclude up to
5% of its total employees who are non-U.S. employees. If a registrant excludes any non-U.S.
employees in a particular jurisdiction, it must exclude all non-U.S. employees in that jurisdiction.
The registrant must also disclose the jurisdictions from which its non-U.S. employees are being
excluded, the approximate number of employees excluded from each jurisdiction under the de
minimis exemption, the total number of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees irrespective of any
exemption (de minimis or data privacy), and the total number of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees
used for its de minimis calculation.
In calculating the number of non-U.S. employees that may be excluded under the de
minimis exemption, a registrant must count any non-U.S. employee exempted under the data
privacy exemption against the availability. A registrant may exclude any non-U.S. employee that
meets the data privacy exemption, even if the number of excluded employees exceeds 5% of the
registrant’s total employees. If, however, the number of employees excluded under the data
privacy exemption equals or exceeds 5% of the registrant’s total employees, the de minimis
exemption will not be available. Additionally, if the number of employees excluded under the
data privacy exemption is less than 5% of the registrant’s total employees, the registrant may use
the de minimis exemption to exclude no more than the number of non-U.S. employees that,
combined with the data privacy exemption, equals 5% of the registrant’s total employees.
Finally, the final rule permits registrants to make cost-of-living adjustments for the
compensation of employees in jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides to
identify the median and calculate annual total compensation. In identifying the median employee,
whether using annual total compensation or any other compensation measure that is consistently
applied to all employees included in the calculation, the registrant may, but is not required to,

29

make cost-of-living adjustments for the compensation of employees in jurisdictions other than the
jurisdiction in which the PEO resides so that the compensation is adjusted to the cost of living in
the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides. If the registrant uses a cost-of-living adjustment to
identify the median employee, and the median employee identified is an employee who does not
reside in the same jurisdiction as the PEO, the registrant must use the same cost-of-living
adjustment in calculating the median employee’s annual total compensation and disclose the
country in which the median employee is located. The registrant is also required to briefly
describe the cost-of-living adjustments it used to identify the median employee and briefly
describe the cost-of-living adjustments it used to calculate the median employee’s annual total
compensation, including the measure used as the basis for the cost-of-living adjustment. 63 To
provide context for the Item 402(u)(1)(iii) disclosure, a registrant electing to present the pay ratio
in this manner must also disclose the median employee’s annual total compensation and pay ratio
without the cost-of-living adjustments. To calculate this pay ratio, the registrant will need to
identify the median employee without using any cost-of-living adjustments.
In the Proposing Release, we noted that some comments received prior to the proposal
requested that the rule allow registrants to present separate pay ratios covering U.S. and non-U.S.
employees to mitigate concerns that the comparison of the PEO to non-U.S. employees could
substantially affect the pay ratio disclosure. The proposal did not prohibit such disclosure but did
not expressly state it was permitted. For clarification, therefore, the final rule states that
registrants are permitted, but not required, to provide additional pay ratios as long as any
63

For example, registrants may use cost-of-living adjustments based on purchasing power parity (“PPP”)
conversion factors. A PPP conversion factor is the ratio of PPP exchange rate to the nominal exchange rate.
For example, conversion factors for the US dollar are available
at http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PPPC.RF. This ratio provides the number of units of a
country’s currency required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market as a U.S.
dollar would buy in the United States.

30

additional pay ratios are not misleading and are not presented with greater prominence than the
required ratio.
2. Employees of Consolidated Subsidiaries
We proposed requiring a registrant’s pay ratio disclosure to include the employees of any
of its subsidiaries (including officers other than the PEO), in addition to its direct employees, in
its pay ratio disclosure. Unlike the proposed rule, however, the final rule defines “employee” to
include only the employees of the registrant’s consolidated subsidiaries. As discussed in greater
detail below, defining a “subsidiary” based on whether a registrant consolidates a company in its
financial statements will likely decrease the costs and burdens on a registrant without significantly
affecting the pay ratio because most registrants consolidate based on their ownership of over 50%
of the outstanding voting shares of their subsidiaries and guidance is readily available on when
consolidation is appropriate.
3. Employed on Any Date Within Three Months of the Last Completed Fiscal Year
The proposed rule would define “employee” as an individual employed as of the last day
of the registrant’s last completed fiscal year because this calculation date would be consistent
with the one used for the determination of the three most highly compensated executive officers
under existing Item 402(a)(3)(iii). In the Proposing Release, we also noted our preliminary view
that a bright line calculation date for determining who is an employee would ease compliance for
registrants by eliminating the need to monitor changes in workforce composition during the year.
Further, we assumed the potential benefits of the pay ratio disclosure would not be significantly
diminished by covering only individuals employed at year-end, although we acknowledged that
this approach could be costlier to registrants with seasonal or temporary employees who are
employed at year end as opposed to other times during the year.

31

Taking into consideration concerns raised by commenters about the desire for flexibility
in choosing the calculation date, the final rule permits registrants to use any date within three
months prior to the last day of their last completed fiscal year to identify the median employee. If
in subsequent years the registrant changes the date it uses to identify the median employee, it
must disclose this change and provide a brief explanation about the reason or reasons for the
change. This provision provides consistency for individual registrants from year to year while
also providing registrants with flexibility to choose the determination date. To provide additional
transparency about how the pay ratio disclosure has been calculated, the final rule requires
registrants to disclose the date used to identify the median employee.
4. Identifying the Median Employee Once Every Three Years
The proposed rule would require registrants to identify the median employee every year.
To help minimize compliance costs, we are revising the rule, as suggested by commenters, to
allow registrants to identify the median employee every three years unless there has been a
change in its employee population or employee compensation arrangements that the registrant
reasonably believes would result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure. However, the
registrant must still calculate the identified median employee’s annual total compensation and use
that figure in calculating its pay ratio every year. If there have been no changes that the registrant
reasonably believes would significantly affect its pay ratio disclosure, the registrant must disclose
that it is using the same median employee in its pay ratio calculation and describe briefly the basis
for its reasonable belief. For example, the registrant could disclose that there has been no change
in its employee population or employee compensation arrangements that it believes would
significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. If there has been such a change, the registrant must
re-identify the median employee for that fiscal year.

32

Under the final rule’s approach, the registrant will identify its median employee for year
one and then be permitted to use that employee or one who is similarly compensated (if, for
example, the median employee is no longer in the same position or is no longer employed by the
registrant) in the following two years for calculating the median employee’s annual total
compensation and the registrant’s pay ratio. The registrant must calculate the median employee’s
annual total compensation in year one and then re-calculate the annual total compensation for that
employee in year two and again in year three. If the median employee identified in year one is no
longer in the same position or no longer employed by the registrant on the median employee
determination date in year two or three, the final rule permits the registrant to replace its median
employee with an employee in a similarly compensated position.
5. Initial Compliance Date
We proposed that a registrant’s first reporting period would begin in its first fiscal year
commencing on or after the effective date of the final rule. Therefore, under the proposed rule,
the registrant’s initial pay ratio disclosure would be included in its first annual report on Form 10K or proxy or information statement for its annual meeting of shareholders following the end of
such year. Unlike the proposal, the compliance date set forth in this adopting release provides
that the registrant’s first reporting period for the pay ratio disclosure is its first full fiscal year
beginning on or after January 1, 2017 (instead of on or after the effective date of the final rule).
6. Transition Period for New Registrants
The proposed rule would not have required pay ratio disclosure by new registrants subject
to the rule in a registration statement on Form S-1 or Form S-11 for an initial public offering or
registration statement on Form 10. Consistent with the revised transition period for existing
registrants, the final rule provides that the first pay ratio reporting period begins for new

33

registrants with their first fiscal year commencing on or after January 1, 2017 that is after the date
they first become subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In
this way, new registrants will not become subject to the final rule sooner than existing registrants.
Such registrants are also permitted to omit their initial pay ratio disclosure from their registration
statements (or any other filing) made before their first annual report or proxy or information
statement following the end of that reporting period, but not later than 120 days after the end of
the fiscal year.
7. Additional Transition Periods
We did not propose a transition period for registrants that cease to be smaller reporting
companies or emerging growth companies, nor did we provide any special rules for registrants
that engage in business combinations and/or acquisitions. We did, however, request comment on
whether there should be transition periods in these situations and, if so, the appropriate length of
time for any such transition period. One commenter requested that we include such a transition
period. 64
The final rule provides that registrants that cease to be smaller reporting companies or
emerging growth companies are not required to provide pay ratio disclosure until they file a report
for the first fiscal year commencing on or after they cease to be a smaller reporting company or
emerging growth company. The final rule also permits registrants that engage in business
combinations and/or acquisitions to omit the employees of a newly-acquired entity from their pay
ratio calculation for the fiscal year in which the business combination or acquisition occurs. In
these cases, a registrant does not have to include these individual employees in its median
64

See letter from ABA (recommending a transition period for issuers that cease to be smaller reporting
companies in which such registrants would not be required to provide their pay ratio disclosure until the first
full fiscal year commencing on or after the first anniversary of the end of the fiscal year in which the issuer
is no longer a smaller reporting company).

employee calculation until the first full fiscal year following the acquisition. Registrants that
exclude employees as a result of a business combination must disclose the relevant acquired
business and the approximate number of employees that are excluded from the pay ratio
calculation.
II. DISCUSSION
A. Scope of Final Rule
1. Pay Ratio Disclosure Requirements Under New Paragraph (u) to Item 402 of
Regulation S-K
a. Proposed Rule
We proposed new paragraph (u) of Item 402 to require disclosure of: (A) the median of
the annual total compensation of all employees of the registrant, (except the registrant’s PEO);
(B) the annual total compensation of the registrant’s PEO; and (C) the ratio of the amount in (A)
to the amount in (B), presented as a ratio in which the amount in (A) equaled one, or,
alternatively, expressed narratively in terms of the multiple that the amount in (B) bears to the
amount in (A).
Although Section 953(b) calls for a ratio showing the median of the annual total
compensation of all employees to the PEO’s annual total compensation, it does not specify how
the ratio should be expressed. To promote consistent presentation and address the potential for
confusion, therefore, the proposed rule specified that registrants must express the ratio as one in
which the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is equal to one.
b. Comments on the Proposed Rule
No commenters objected to use of the term PEO or including the pay ratio disclosure
requirements in new paragraph (u) to Item 402, and commenters discussing other aspects of the
proposal did so on the assumption that we would include the pay ratio disclosure requirements in
35

Item 402(u). Several commenters agreed that the pay ratio should show the PEO’s compensation
divided by the median employee’s compensation because it would be easier to understand. 65
c. Final Rule
After considering the comments, we are adopting the final rule as proposed. The final rule
adds new paragraph (u) to Item 402 and requires disclosure of: (A) the median of the annual total
compensation of all employees of the registrant (except the registrant’s PEO); (B) the annual total
compensation of the registrant’s PEO; and (C) the ratio of the amount in (B) to the amount in (A),
presented as a ratio in which the amount in (A) equals one, or, alternatively, expressed narratively
in terms of the multiple that the amount in (B) bears to the amount in (A). 66
Consistent with the proposal, the final rule also requires registrants to disclose the ratio
such that the PEO’s annual total compensation is always compared to the median employee’s
annual total compensation. Registrants may not present the median employee’s annual total
compensation as a percentage of the PEO’s compensation. We believe expressing the ratio as “a
factor rather than a fraction” makes the ratio easier to understand because allowing the inverse
may be confusing. 67 In other words, the ratio must always show how much larger or smaller the
PEO’s annual total compensation is as compared to the median employee’s annual total
compensation. We believe that requiring registrants to present the ratio in this manner will make
it easier for shareholders to comprehend and allow them to use it in making voting decisions on

65

See, e.g., letters from FEI and Dr. Sue Ravenscroft, Professor of Accounting, Iowa State University (Sep.
20, 2013) (“Prof. Ravenscroft I”).

66

We did not propose to require that the pay ratio disclosure be provided in interactive data format, and are not
adopting such a requirement for this disclosure. To the extent that we consider more generally the tagging
of disclosures in XBRL format in our rules, we may consider revisiting the format in which the pay ratio
disclosure is provided.

67

See letter from FEI. See also letter from Prof. Ravenscroft I (stating that “the ratio of CEO compensation to
median worker would be easier for most people to grasp than the ratio of median worker compensation to
CEO compensation, a switch that I would see as not changing the intent of the law”).

36

executive compensation. 68
The final rule permits registrants to choose one of two options to express the ratio.
Registrants may disclose the pay ratio with the median of the annual total compensation of all
employees equal to one and the PEO’s compensation as the number compared to one. 69 For
example, if a registrant’s median annual total compensation for employees is $50,000 and the
annual total compensation of the PEO is $2,500,000, the PEO’s compensation is 50 times larger
than the median employee’s compensation. The registrant may describe the pay ratio as 50 to 1
or 50:1. Alternatively, registrants may disclose the pay ratio narratively by stating how many
times higher (or lower) the PEO’s annual total compensation is than that of the median employee.
For example, the registrant may state that “the PEO’s annual total compensation is 50 times that
of the median of the annual total compensation of all employees.”
2. Pay Ratio Disclosure in Filings that Require Item 402 of Regulation S-K Information
a. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule required registrants to include their pay ratio disclosure in any filing
described in Item 10(a) that requires executive compensation disclosure under Item 402, including

68

In the rare cases in which the PEO’s yearly compensation is nominal (or is otherwise less than the median
employee’s compensation), the resulting ratio will be a number smaller than one. Despite this anomalous
result, we believe that in the vast majority of cases setting the median compensation equal to one will result
in a ratio that is easier to understand than the inverse. See generally Illinois Commerce Comm'n v. I.C.C.,
776 F.2d 355, 359 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (“General rules need not work perfectly in all their applications”). We
also note that registrants are permitted to provide additional narrative discussion in cases where they feel the
disclosed pay ratio may be confusing or incomplete without further explanation.

69

We note that some commenters recommended that the final rule include a safe harbor or simplified reporting
method such that a registrant may stipulate that its pay ratio exceeds 300-to-1. See letters from Hyster-Yale
and NACCO. Under this suggestion, registrants would be permitted to forgo calculating and disclosing their
company-specific pay ratio and would instead be permitted to simply disclose that the ratio exceeds the
stipulated 300-to-1 statistic. We have not adopted the suggestion to allow a registrant to disclose that its pay
ratio exceeds a stipulated statistic, such as 300-to-1, because we do not believe that it would be consistent
with Congress’s apparent intent to provide a useful, relevant, company-specific pay ratio disclosure for
investors to utilize when undertaking their say-on-pay votes.

37

annual reports on Form 10-K, 70 Securities Act and Exchange Act registration statements, and
proxy and information statements, to the same extent that these forms require compliance with
Item 402. Section 953(b) does not direct us to amend any of our forms to add the pay ratio
disclosure requirements to filings that do not already require disclosure of Item 402 information,
and we did not propose to do so. Additionally, we proposed not to require registrants to update
their pay ratio disclosure for the most recently completed fiscal year until they file their annual
reports on Form 10-K, or, if later, their proxy or information statements for their next annual
meeting of shareholders (or written consents in lieu of such a meeting) but, in any event, not later
than 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.
b. Comments on the Proposed Rule
All of the commenters discussing the issue agreed that we should limit pay ratio disclosure
to the filings described in Item 10(a) that require executive compensation disclosure under Item
402, as proposed. 71 One commenter suggested, however, that the final rule should allow
registrants to include their pay ratio disclosure in other filings if they choose to do so. 72
c. Final Rule
We are adopting the final rule as proposed. It requires registrants to include their pay ratio
disclosure in any filing described in Item 10(a) that calls for executive compensation disclosure
under Item 402, including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements under the
Securities Act and Exchange Act, and proxy and information statements to the same extent that

70

17 CFR 249.310.

71

See, e.g., letters from ABA, AFL-CIO I, California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Dec. 2, 2013)
(“CalPERS”), Calvert, Capital Strategies, CII, Connecticut State Treasurer (Dec. 2, 2013) (“CT State
Treasurer”), Davis Polk, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, McGuireWoods, NIRI, NRF, Pax World Funds, PM&P,
Prof. Ray, and WorldatWork I.

72

See letter from Capital Strategies.

38

these forms require compliance with Item 402, consistent with the statutory directive. Registrants
must follow the instructions in each form to determine whether Item 402 information is required,
including any instructions that allow for the omission of Item 402 information. 73 The final rule
does not require registrants to include the pay ratio disclosure in any filings that are not required
to include Item 402 information, but registrants can voluntarily include non-mandated
information in any of their filings if they choose to do so and the information is not misleading in
the context of that filing. Further, registrants do not need to update their pay ratio disclosure for
their most recently completed fiscal year until they file their annual report on Form 10-K, or, if
later, their proxy or information statement for their next annual meeting of shareholders (or
written consents in lieu of such a meeting) but, in any event, not later than 120 days after the end
of such fiscal year.
We do not read Section 953(b) to require pay ratio disclosure in filings that do not contain
other executive compensation information. In our view, the most meaningful way to present pay
ratio disclosure is in context with other executive compensation disclosure, such as the Summary
Compensation Table required by Item 402(c) and the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
required by Item 402(b), rather than provided on a stand-alone basis. In this manner, the pay ratio
information will be presented in the same context as other information that shareholders can use
in making their voting decisions on executive compensation. Finally, although we understand the
primary purpose of the pay ratio disclosure to be to inform shareholder’s say-on-pay votes under
Section 951, we acknowledge that some commenters indicated the disclosure could be useful to
investors in making investment decisions. For that reason, and in light of the statutory language

73

See, e.g., General Instructions I(2)(c) and J(1)(m) to Form 10-K containing special provisions for the
omission of Item 402 information by wholly-owned subsidiaries and asset-backed registrants.

39

of Section 953(b), the final rule retains the requirement to include this disclosure in registration
statements under the Securities Act. 74
3. Excluded Registrants – Smaller Reporting Companies, Foreign Private Issuers,
MJDS Filers, and Emerging Growth Companies
a. Proposed Rule
In the Proposing Release, we noted that the reference to “each issuer” in Section 953(b)
could be read to apply to all registrants, including smaller reporting companies, 75 foreign private
issuers, 76 U.S.-Canadian Multijurisdictional Disclosure System filers, 77 and emerging growth
companies. Because Section 953(b) refers specifically to the definition of total compensation in
Item 402(c)(2)(x), and is silent on whether pay ratio disclosure should be required for registrants
not previously subject to Item 402(c) requirements, however, we proposed to limit the pay ratio
disclosure requirement to registrants required to provide Item 402(c) disclosure. As a result, the
proposed rule stated that smaller reporting companies, foreign private issuers, and MJDS filers
did not have to provide pay ratio disclosure in any of their filings.
Also, the JOBS Act, 78 which was passed by Congress subsequent to the Dodd-Frank Act

74

Although the final rule requires registrants to include the pay ratio disclosure in registration statements under
the Securities Act, as discussed below, the final rule permits new registrants to delay compliance so that the
pay ratio requirement is not required in a registration statement on Form S-1 or Form S-11 for an initial
public offering or registration statement on Form 10.

75

A “smaller reporting company” is an issuer that had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last
business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or had annual revenues of less than $50
million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.
17 CFR 229.10(f)(1).

76

A “foreign private issuer” is any foreign issuer other than a foreign government, except for a registrant that,
as of the last business day of its most recent fiscal year, has more than 50% of its outstanding voting
securities held of record by United States residents and any of the following: a majority of its officers and
directors are citizens or residents of the United States, more than 50% of its assets are located in the United
States, or its business is principally administered in the United States. 17 CFR 240.3b-4(c).

77

A U.S.-Canadian Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (“MJDS”) filer is a registrant that files reports and
registration statements with us in accordance with the requirements of the MJDS.

78

See Section 102(a)(3) of the JOBS Act.

40

but prior to publication of the Proposing Release, specifically excluded registrants that qualify as
emerging growth companies, as that term is defined in Section 3(a) of the Exchange Act, 79 from
the requirements of Section 953(b). To give effect to the statutory exemption, we proposed an
instruction to Item 402(u) providing that a registrant that is an emerging growth company is not
required to comply with Item 402(u).
b. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Most commenters concurred with the proposed rule’s exclusion of emerging growth
companies, consistent with the JOBS Act. 80 One commenter noted specifically that, while it
“believes all registrants accessing U.S. capital markets should be subject to comparable financial
regulation,” including smaller reporting companies, foreign private issuers, and MJDS filers, the
pay ratio information “is best viewed in the context of other compensation disclosures and the pay
ratio disclosure should be limited to those registrants required to provide a summary
compensation disclosure.” 81
Additionally, most of the commenters who addressed the issue agreed that we should
exclude smaller reporting companies from the pay ratio requirements. 82 One commenter reasoned
that, by excluding emerging growth companies, Congress demonstrated its intent to relieve this
category of registrants from the costs and burdens of compliance, and because both emerging
79

An “emerging growth company” is an issuer that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion
during its most recently completed fiscal year, has not reached the fifth anniversary of the date of the first
sale of its common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,
had not issued $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous 3-year period, or is deemed to be a
“large accelerated filer.” 15 U.S.C. 78c(a).

80

See, e.g., letters from CalPERS; Davis Polk; Hay Group, Inc. (Dec. 2, 2013) (“Hay Group”); NY State
Comptroller; PM&P; and US SIF. Some commenters, however, disagreed or were uncomfortable with this
exclusion. See letters from CII and Andrew Kushner (Nov. 12, 2013) (“Kushner”).

growth companies and smaller reporting companies are subject to scaled executive compensation
disclosure, it would be consistent with Congressional intent to exclude smaller reporting
companies. 83 Another commenter recommended that the final rule exempt any business with
revenues of less than $500 million or a market capitalization of less than $1 billion.84
By contrast, a few commenters asserted that the final rule should include smaller reporting
companies. 85 One of these commenters asserted that Congress did not expressly exclude smaller
reporting companies because the phrase “each issuer” in Section 953(b)(1) signals its intent that
there should be no exemption for any particular registrant and that excluding certain registrants
from the disclosure would defeat the purpose and policy of Section 953(b). 86
Finally, some commenters agreed that the proposed rule should exclude foreign private
issuers and MJDS filers, 87 while a few other commenters disagreed with excluding them. 88 One
commenter noted that, in “view of the Commission’s long-standing rules allowing foreign private
issuers and MJDS filers to provide information about their executive compensation programs
based on the applicable disclosure requirements of their home jurisdiction, we would find it
anomalous to single out this specific Item 402-based disclosure requirement for mandatory
application to these registrants without regard to important policy considerations that have led the
Commission for decades to permit disclosure in this area based on home-country law.” 89

After considering the comments, we are adopting the final rule as proposed. The final
rule, therefore, does not require pay ratio disclosure by smaller reporting companies, foreign
private issuers, MJDS filers, and emerging growth companies. 90
As stated above, Congress explicitly excluded emerging growth companies from the pay
ratio disclosure requirement. Regarding smaller reporting companies, Section 953(b)(2) requires
total compensation to be calculated in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x). Smaller reporting
companies, however, are permitted to follow the scaled disclosure requirements set forth in Items
402(m)-(r), 91 and therefore are not required to calculate compensation in accordance with Item
402(c)(2)(x). Also, the requirement set forth in Item 402(n) for disclosure of Summary
Compensation Table information, which includes disclosure of “total compensation,” does not
require smaller reporting companies to include the same types of compensation required to be
included in total compensation for other registrants under Item 402(c)(2). 92 Congress’s express
reference to Item 402(c)(2)(x) to calculate total compensation (without mentioning Item
402(n)(2)(x)) is consistent with the exclusion of smaller reporting companies from the pay ratio
disclosure requirement.
Requiring smaller reporting companies to provide the pay ratio disclosure would compel
them to collect data and calculate compensation for the PEO in ways that they otherwise are not
required to do. Nothing in the statute indicates that was Congress’s intent, and no commenters

90

Registered investment companies will also not be required to provide Item 402(u) disclosure. Business
development companies are a category of closed-end investment company that are not registered under the
Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48) and 80a-53-64]. Business development companies will
be treated in the same manner as issuers other than registered investment companies and therefore will be
subject to the pay ratio disclosure requirement.

91

See Item 402(l).

92

See Item 402(n)(2)(viii) (indicating that smaller reporting companies are not required to include the
aggregate change in the actuarial present value of pension benefits that is required for companies subject to
Item 402(c)(2)(viii)).

indicated that they believed there was such an intent. To clarify further that smaller reporting
companies are excluded from the final rule, we are making a technical amendment to paragraph
(l) of Item 402 to add Item 402(u), as proposed, to the list of items that are not required for
smaller reporting companies. 93
The final rule similarly does not apply to foreign private issuers and MJDS filers, which
we believe is consistent with excluding registrants that are not currently required to provide
Summary Compensation Table disclosure pursuant to Item 402(c). Foreign private issuers file
annual reports and registration statements on Form 20-F 94 and MJDS filers file annual reports and
registration statements on Form 40-F. 95 Neither of these forms requires Item 402 disclosure. As
with smaller reporting companies, requiring foreign private issuers and MJDS filers to provide
the pay ratio disclosure would require these registrants to collect data and calculate compensation
for the PEO in ways they otherwise would not be required to do. The final rule, therefore, does
not apply to foreign private issuers or MJDS filers.
Finally, for the same reasons, the final rule, consistent with the proposal, does not change
existing Item 402(a)(1) with respect to foreign private issuers. Item 402(a)(1) states that a
“foreign private issuer will be deemed to comply with Item 402 if it provides the information
required by Items 6.B and 6.E.2 of Form 20-F, with more detailed information provided if
otherwise made publicly available or required to be disclosed by the registrant’s home jurisdiction

93

Smaller reporting companies are permitted to choose whether they want to comply with either the scaled
disclosure requirements or the larger company disclosure requirements on an “a la carte” basis. As we
discussed in the scaled disclosure adopting release, the staff evaluates compliance by smaller reporting
companies with only the Regulation S-K requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, even if the
company chooses to comply with the larger company requirements. See Smaller Reporting Company
Regulatory Relief and Simplification, Release No. 33-8876 (Dec. 19, 2007) [73 FR 934], at 941.

or a market in which its securities are listed or traded.” Foreign private issuers that file annual
reports on Form 10-K, therefore, are still able to satisfy Item 402 requirements by following Items
6.B and 6.E.2 of Form 20-F and are not required to provide the pay ratio disclosure mandated by
Section 953(b).
B. Requirements of Final Rule
1. “All Employees” Covered Under the Rule
The final rule defines “employee” to include a registrant’s U.S. and non-U.S. employees,
as well as its part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees, as proposed. We believe that the “all
employees of the issuer” language in Section 953(b) is best implemented by including rather than
excluding broad categories of employees. Further, even assuming there was any ambiguity in the
statutory language, we believe that a more inclusive approach better serves Section 953(b)’s
purpose of providing shareholders with additional information about a registrant’s compensation
practices that can be used in making voting decisions on executive compensation because it
results in a pay ratio that is more reflective of the actual composition of the registrant’s
workforce. 96 As discussed in greater detail below, however, in response to particular issues and
concerns raised by comments, we have provided two tailored exemptions from the general
96

As discussed below, commenters have made competing arguments that the pay ratio disclosure would be
“distorted” in one way or another if the final rule included (or excluded) various categories of employees.
See, e.g., letter from Prof. Ray (asserting that the pay ratio will be distorted depending on whether the final
rule includes non-U.S. employees). We appreciate that a particular registrant’s pay ratio information may
vary – perhaps, in some cases, significantly – depending on whether the final rule includes or excludes these
employee categories (e.g., non-U.S. employees; part-time, temporary and seasonal employees; and leased
workers). We do not, however, view the choices made on these issues as involving a “distortion” of the pay
ratio disclosure that Congress directed should be provided to investors. As noted elsewhere in this release,
we have been guided by our general view that Section 953(b) reflects Congress’s intention that the pay ratio
disclosure should be broadly inclusive of all types of a registrant’s employees; thus, absent a reason that
takes into account the statutory objective, we have declined to make choices in the final rule that would
exclude broad categories of employees from the process of identifying the median employee. At the same
time, however, in an effort to mitigate the potential costs and burdens of the final rule, we have built in some
flexibility and provided several other accommodations to elements of the final rule, where we have
concluded that these measures would not result in any undue impact on the required pay ratio disclosure.

45

requirement to include all employees. In particular, for the reasons discussed below, we have
provided an exemption for employees in foreign jurisdictions in which it is not possible for a
registrant to obtain or process information necessary to comply with the rule without violating the
data privacy laws or regulations of that jurisdiction and a de minimis exemption for non-U.S.
employees.
a. Types of Employees
i. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule included in the definition of “employee” all of a registrant’s full-time,
part-time, seasonal, and temporary workers, including officers other than the PEO. In the
Proposing Release, we reasoned that these individuals should be included in the rule because
Section 953(b)(1)(A) expressly requires disclosure of the median of the annual total compensation
of “all employees,” which would encompass full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary
workers. Also, we proposed to include all of a registrant’s officers other than the PEO in the
definition of “employee.”
Workers not employed by a registrant (or its subsidiaries), however, such as independent
contractors, “leased” workers, or other workers who are employed by a third party, were not
covered by our proposed definition of “employee.” As an example, we noted that, if a registrant
pays a fee to another company (such as a management company or an employee leasing agency)
that supplies workers to the registrant, and those workers receive compensation from that other
company, these workers should not be considered employees of the registrant for purposes of the
disclosures required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
A number of commenters supported the proposed rule’s requirement that registrants

46

include their part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees in addition to their full-time
employees in their median employee determination. 97 Some commenters asserted that the
reference in Section 953(b) to “all employees” demonstrates Congress’s intent was not to limit the
pay ratio to only full-time employees. 98 Some commenters contended that including temporary
employees would cost registrants very little because they routinely develop that information for
their own internal use. 99 Commenters supporting the proposed rule also contended that, if parttime, temporary, and seasonal employees were excluded from the pay ratio, the disclosure would
be incomplete, inaccurate, and/or misleading. 100 One commenter suggested that the exclusion of
part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees would not reduce the regulatory burdens on
registrants because registrants with such employees would have substantial flexibility in
identifying the median employee. 101
Other commenters contended that the final rule should include only full-time
employees. 102 Many of these commenters claimed that applying the rule to part-time, temporary,
and seasonal employees would make the pay ratio disclosure less meaningful because the
compensation of these different types of employees are not comparable to each other or to the

PEO’s compensation. 103 Some commenters also asserted that including employees other than
full-time employees would be burdensome and increase costs. 104 One commenter noted that,
according to a survey it conducted of companies with more than 10,000 employees, “86 percent
of the average employer’s employees are full-time, with the median employer having 95 percent
of its workforce as full-time employees.” This commenter asserted that the incremental
information that would be obtained from including part-time or seasonal employees does not
justify the effort to collect it and could provide a distorted picture of the employee’s annual
income. 105
Another commenter asserted that the final rule should exclude part-time, seasonal, and
temporary employees unless a majority of a registrant’s employees work on a part-time,
temporary, and/or seasonal basis. 106 A few commenters recommended that the rule should allow
registrants to exclude any employee who was not employed for at least four months during the
calendar year. 107 Other commenters indicated that, if the rule is not limited to full-time
employees, registrants should be able to annualize or make full-time equivalent adjustments to the
compensation of part-time, seasonal, and/or temporary employees. 108 One commenter suggested,
in the alternative, that if the rule includes part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees, it should

only include such employees who have been employed during the 90-day period ending on the
last day of the registrant’s fiscal year. 109 Finally, another commenter suggested, in the alternative,
that the rule should require a “primary disclosure” that compares only full-time employees to the
PEO’s compensation. 110
Some commenters noted that neither Section 953(b) nor its legislative history states
explicitly that Congress intended for the “all employees” term to include part-time, seasonal, and
temporary employees. These commenters contended we could thus interpret the “all employees”
language to exclude such employees from the final rule. 111 Some commenters believed that the
minimal effect these employees would have on the pay ratio would not justify the high costs
required to include those employees in determining the pay ratio. 112 Conversely, commenters in
support of including part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees in the pay ratio contended that
failing to do so would distort registrants’ pay ratios because many of their employees would not
be included in the median calculation. 113
Several commenters agreed that a registrant’s pay ratio should exclude “leased”
workers. 114 One of these commenters noted that including “leased” workers would add

“global, full-time, part-time and seasonal employees” is not offset by other benefits) and General Mills (“We
would expect moderate cost savings from limiting the analysis to full-time employees, versus covering our
entire workforce, but the savings could be significant for registrants in other industries… Conversely, there
has been little or no evidence to suggest that the benefits of the Proposed Rule would be diminished as a
result of limiting its scope to full-time employees.”).

significant costs and distort the pay ratio. 115 Also, according to this commenter, such workers are
not “statutory” employees and the third parties employing these workers may be unwilling to
provide the information. A few commenters recommended that the final rule require a registrant
to include such workers in its pay ratio. 116 One commenter asserted that a registrant should be
required to clearly describe its reliance on “leased” workers if they comprise more than 40% of its
workforce. 117
iii. Final Rule
After considering the public comments, we have concluded that the final rule’s definition
of “employee” should include the full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees
employed by the registrant or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Because this definition refers
to workers “employed by the registrant,” workers who provide services to the registrant or its
consolidated subsidiaries as independent contractors or “leased” workers are excluded from the
definition as long as they are employed, and their compensation is determined, by an unaffiliated
third party. The final rule includes in the definition of “employee” all of a registrant’s officers
other than the PEO, as proposed. Section 953(b)(1)(A) expressly directs disclosure of the median
of the annual total compensation of “all employees of the issuer, except the chief executive officer
(or any other equivalent position) of the issuer.”
We believe this statutory language indicates that Congress intended the final rule to
include all types of a registrant’s employees, including part-time, seasonal, and temporary

significant portion of the registrant’s workforce).

workers, and we do not think it is appropriate to provide a wholesale exemption for those broad
categories of employees that are not employed full-time. 118 Any such exemption would risk
producing pay ratio disclosure that is significantly different than the pay ratio disclosure that
Congress expressly directed us to require when it said “all employees.” Further, as noted above,
we have generally limited our use of discretionary or exemptive authority to those items that
would not have an appreciable effect on the information that Congress intended that shareholders
have when they make their say-on-pay votes. To the extent there is any statutory ambiguity, we
would still elect this inclusive approach because we believe that it is more reflective of the actual
composition of the registrant’s workforce and thus furthers the purpose of providing shareholders
with useful information about a registrant’s overall compensation practices. While we are
sensitive to concerns raised by some commenters that inclusion of these broad categories of
employees means that compliance with the final rule will be more costly than if we adopted a
broad exemption, we note that the final rule provides other types of flexibility and
accommodations designed to reduce compliance costs while remaining faithful to our
understanding of the statutory directive and purpose of Section 953(b).
A registrant can supplement its pay ratio disclosure or provide additional pay ratios for its
shareholders to consider if it wants to explain the effect of including part-time, seasonal and
temporary employees on its pay ratio disclosure. While we do not believe a purpose of the rule is
to facilitate comparisons among registrants, the opportunity to supplement the pay ratio disclosure
and to provide additional pay ratios should help mitigate some concerns that shareholders may

See, e.g., County of Oakland v. Federal Housing Finance Agency, 716 F.3d 935, 940 (6th Cir. 2013)

Congress said ‘all taxation,’ it meant all taxation”) (emphasis in original); Marie O. v. Edgar, 131 F.3d 610,

(describing “the word ‘all’” as “one of the least ambiguous words in the English language”).

51

draw unwarranted conclusions from comparing one registrant’s disclosed ratio to the ratio of
others. In addition, our change to the proposed rule to allow a registrant some flexibility in
selecting the date for identifying the median employee may enable registrants that employ
temporary or seasonal employees only during a very limited period at the end of their fiscal year
to choose a date that allows them to exclude these employees.
One commenter pointed out that Item 402 does not contain a reference to hourly or
overtime compensation and contended, therefore, that the rule should not apply to non-salaried
employees who receive “wages plus overtime,” rather than salary. 119 We believe that the “all
employees” language is not limited to salaried employees. Moreover, we are concerned that a
contrary reading would be arbitrary and would eliminate an entire category of employees from the
pay ratio disclosure, potentially depriving shareholders of a more complete understanding of the
median employee’s compensation when making their say-on-pay votes. Thus, we believe that it
is appropriate to include these employees as part of a registrant’s pay ratio disclosure to reflect the
manner in which the registrant establishes its workforce.
The final rule excludes from the definition of “employee” those workers who are
employed, and whose compensation is determined, by an unaffiliated third party but who provide
services to the registrant or its consolidated subsidiaries as independent contractors or “leased”
workers. Although it is unclear whether Congress intended to include these workers as
“employees of the issuer,” or even considered the issue, we believe, as a matter of policy, these
workers should not be included as “employees of the issuer.”
While one commenter stated that “leased employees and other workers employed by a

119

See letter from Chamber I.

52

third party are not “statutory” employees of a registrant,” 120 some definitions of “employee” may
include workers who are not employed directly by the registrant or its consolidated subsidiaries,
such as independent contractors or “leased” or “borrowed” workers, if they are employed by a
third party. 121 We note that the statute specifies employees “of the issuer,” and in light of this, to
the extent there is any ambiguity on this point, we believe that the better reading of the statute is
to exclude from the final rule’s definition of “employee” workers who are not employed by the
registrant or its consolidated subsidiaries, such as independent contractors or “leased” workers, if
they are employed, and their compensation is determined, by an unaffiliated third party.
We believe excluding such workers is appropriate because registrants generally do not
control the level of compensation that these workers are paid. Instead, the registrant provides a
payment for their services to an unaffiliated third party, which determines the compensation for
the employees. As one commenter noted, there can be no assurance, therefore, that the registrant
even has access to the workers’ compensation information, which could make it difficult or
impossible to obtain the information. 122
We do not believe it is appropriate for registrants to voluntarily include workers employed
by third parties in their required pay ratio disclosure “if such persons make up a significant
portion of the workforce,” as one commenter suggested, even if doing so may add to the
“flexibility” of the final rule. 123 For the reasons described above, we have not included these

120

See, e.g., letter from ABA.

121

See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 602 (9th ed.2009) (defining “employee” as a “person who works in the
service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the
employer has the right to control the details of work performance,” and defines a “borrowed employee” as
an “employee whose services are, with the employee's consent, lent to another employer who temporarily
assumes control over the employee's work”).

53

workers within the definition of employee, and we are concerned that allowing registrants the
option to elect to include them in their required disclosures would introduce the potential for
registrants to manipulate the pay ratio disclosure. Registrants, however, may discuss their
reliance on “leased” workers, as suggested by another commenter, in their narrative disclosure. 124
Also, they may provide additional ratios that factor in those workers, as long as any additional
ratios are not misleading and are not more prominently displayed than the required ratio.
b. Employed on Any Date Within Three Months of the Last Completed Fiscal Year
i. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule would define “employee” as an individual employed as of the last day
of the registrant’s last completed fiscal year. We proposed this calculation date for determining
who is an employee because it is consistent with the one used for the determination of PEO and
principal financial officer and the other three most highly compensated executive officers under
Item 402(a)(3)(iii). In the Proposing Release, we noted that the composition of a company’s
workforce typically changes throughout the fiscal year, and in some industries and businesses, it
can change constantly. Although Section 953(b) requires the median calculation to cover “all
employees,” it does not prescribe a particular calculation date for the determination of who should
be treated as an employee for that purpose.
We reasoned in the Proposing Release that a single date for determining who is an
employee would ease compliance for registrants by eliminating the need to monitor changing
workforce composition during the year, while providing a recent snapshot of the registrant’s
entire workforce. Also, we indicated that a requirement to track which employees have been
continuously employed for the entire annual period could increase costs for registrants, and
124

See letter from LAPFF.

54

suggested that the most appropriate calculation date would be one that is consistent with the
calculation date for determining the named executive officers under current Item 402
requirements.
In proposing this approach, we assumed that the potential benefits of the disclosure
mandated by Section 953(b) would not be significantly diminished by covering only individuals
employed on a specific date at calendar year-end, rather than covering every individual who was
employed at any time during the year. Although this approach could help limit compliance costs
for registrants, we acknowledged that it could have other costs. For example, this approach
would not capture seasonal or temporary employees who are not employed at year end, with the
result that a registrant with a significant number of such workers might identify a median
employee from a pool that does not fully reflect the workforce that it requires to run its business.
This approach might also cause the disclosure to be costlier for, and thereby have an anticompetitive impact on, registrants whose temporary or seasonal workers are employed at calendar
year-end as opposed to other times during the year because registrants with temporary or seasonal
employees at calendar year-end would have to include them in their median calculations but other
registrants with temporary or seasonal employees at other times of the year would not have to do
so. Finally, we noted that it would be possible, but unlikely, that registrants could try to structure
their employment arrangements to reduce the number of lower paid employees employed on the
determination date.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Most commenters that discussed the issue agreed that registrants should be permitted to
identify the median employee based on the composition of their workforce on a particular day of

55

the year as opposed to the workforce employed throughout the year. 125 Only a few commenters,
however, supported using the last day of the fiscal year calculation date. 126 It seems that these
commenters supported this provision more to limit the calculation to a particular day of the year,
thereby limiting the need to monitor a changing workforce during the year, than because they
believed the appropriate date should be the last day of the registrant’s last fiscal year. 127 A
number of commenters contended that the final rule should allow registrants the flexibility to
choose a calculation date within the registrant’s last fiscal year. 128 As some of these commenters
noted, requiring registrants to use the last day of the fiscal year could adversely affect retailers, 129
may not allow enough time for registrants to collect and report on their pay ratio information, 130
and could make it difficult for registrants that are not calendar year-end companies to use
information derived from its tax and/or payroll records to calculate the ratio. 131 Some
commenters suggested that, if the final rule permits registrants to choose a determination date
other than a registrant’s fiscal year end, it should also require registrants to be consistent from
year to year and/or briefly explain the reasons for not using the fiscal year-end date. 132
One commenter suggested that the rule could allow registrants to choose a calculation date
within a designated time window, “such as a date occurring during the 90-day period preceding

the fiscal year end.” 133 Regarding the concern that allowing registrants to select the calculation
date would create the potential for manipulation of the pay ratio, this commenter stated that the
concern “is unwarranted, particularly if the choice is restricted to a limited time period (such as
the last fiscal quarter), since in general the employee population of a registrant would not vary
significantly over such a period.” 134
Another commenter proposed that registrants should be required to calculate the median
annual compensation of all employees employed at any time over the preceding 365 days to
ensure accurate disclosure for registrants that employ a high number of seasonal employees. 135
One commenter recommended that the final rule permit registrants to use different
determination dates for different segments of their workforce based on tax, payroll, and/or other
established recordkeeping systems, accompanied by a brief statement of the basis for the different
disclosure dates because a number of companies maintain their human resource/payroll systems
for U.S. employees on a calendar-year basis, but do so for their foreign employees on a fiscal-year
basis. 136 The commenter also noted that using the end of the second or third fiscal quarter as a
determination date would not be feasible because most payroll systems are set up to collect
information on fiscal year-end or calendar year-end bases.
Some commenters responded to the Proposing Release’s request for comment on whether
the rule’s definition of “employee” would cause a registrant to change its corporate structure.
Most of the commenters that responded said that the definition would not cause registrants to alter

57

their corporate structure or employment arrangements, 137 although one commenter disagreed. 138
iii. Final Rule
After considering commenters’ desire for flexibility in choosing the median employee
determination date, we are revising the final rule from the proposal. Unlike the proposed rule,
which would define “employee” as an individual employed as of the last day of the registrant’s
last completed fiscal year, the final rule defines “employee” as an individual employed on any
date of the registrant’s choosing within the last three months of the registrant’s last completed
fiscal year. The final rule also requires registrants to disclose the date used to identify the median
employee.
Some commenters recommended that the final rule require registrants to explain the
reason they selected a determination date other than the last of day of the fiscal year. 139 We do
not believe such an explanation would lead to useful disclosure, as registrants would likely state
that they chose any date other than the end of the fiscal year to provide more time to take the steps
necessary to identify the median employee. If, however, a registrant changes the determination
date from the prior year, we believe it should disclose the reason for the change. Under the final
rule, therefore, if a registrant changes the date it uses to identify the median employee, the
registrant must disclose the change and provide a brief explanation about the reason or reasons for
the change.
We note that allowing registrants to choose a determination date within a defined window,
rather than be required to use the last day of the fiscal year, is a change from the proposal and

58

differs from the approach in determining the three most highly compensated executive officers
under existing Item 402(a)(3)(iii). 140 We believe permitting registrants to choose a date within
the last three months of their last completed fiscal year, as suggested by a commenter, is
appropriate because it will provide registrants with some flexibility and could permit them
additional time to identify their median employee in advance of their fiscal year end. 141 At the
same time, establishing a particular date certain will provide some consistency from year to year.
We also note that this change may help to avoid some of the unintended consequences identified
by commenters, such as anti-competitive effects on retailers with a significant number of
employees at year end or inefficient changes in corporate structure made simply to avoid
employing workers on the last day of the fiscal year. Finally, as discussed in the Proposing
Release, we continue to believe that requiring the determination of the employee to be made as of
a specific date, rather than over the course of the year, will ease compliance for registrants by
eliminating the need to monitor changes in their workforce composition throughout the year.
c. Employees Located Outside the United States
i. Proposed Rule
We proposed a definition of “employee” that would include any U.S. and non-U.S.
employee of a registrant. In the Proposing Release, we acknowledged that the inclusion of nonU.S. employees raises compliance costs for multinational companies, introduces cross-border
compliance issues, and could raise concerns about the impact of non-U.S. pay structures on the
comparability of the data to companies without off-shore operations. We also recognized that

140

17 CFR 230.402(a)(3)(iii).

141

See letter from Davis Polk (noting that a “90-day period preceding the fiscal year end” would permit “a
registrant [to] begin the task of identifying its median employee in advance of its fiscal year end, which is
the most costly and time-consuming part of the pay ratio calculation”).

59

differences in relative compliance costs could have an adverse impact on competition. We
weighed these considerations and proposed that the disclosure requirements would nonetheless
cover all employees without exemptions for specific categories of employees, including non-U.S.
employees.
Additionally, we were cognizant that data privacy laws in various jurisdictions could have
an impact on gathering and verifying the data needed to identify the median of the annual total
compensation of all employees. Commenters in the pre-proposal period expressed concern that,
in some cases, data privacy laws of foreign countries could prohibit a registrant’s collection and
transfer of personally identifiable compensation data that would be needed to identify the median
employee. We also noted that some data privacy laws may make the collection or transfer of the
underlying data more burdensome, but do not actually prohibit transfer of compensation data.
For example, we indicated that multinational companies based in the United States might
need to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations when taking certain actions to comply
with the proposal, such as transmitting personally identifiable human resources data (“personal
data”) of European Union (“E.U.”) employees onto global human resource information system
networks in the United States; sending personal data in hard copy from the E.U. to the United
States; or making personal data “onward transfers” to third-party payroll, pension, and benefits
processors outside of the E.U. 142 In some E.U. countries, employee consent is required, while in
other countries consent may not be sufficient. We noted that other jurisdictions, such as Peru,
Argentina, Canada, and Japan also have data privacy laws that could be implicated by the
gathering of data for purposes of the proposed pay ratio disclosure.
142

The E.U. Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. L 281 (European Union Directive on the Protection of Individuals
with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data) sets forth the
regulatory framework governing the transfer of personal data from an E.U. Member State to a non-E.U.
country.

60

Although we did not propose any specific accommodation to address this concern, we
stated our belief that the flexibility afforded to all registrants under the proposed rule could permit
registrants to manage any potential costs arising from applicable data privacy laws. For example,
the proposed rule would permit registrants in this situation to estimate the compensation of
affected employees. We requested comment on whether the proposed flexibility afforded to
registrants in selecting a method to identify the median, such as the use of statistical sampling or
other reasonable estimation techniques and the use of consistently applied compensation measures
to identify the median employee, could enable registrants to better manage any potential costs and
burdens arising from local data privacy regulations or if there are other alternatives that would be
consistent with Section 953(b).
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Many commenters agreed that non-U.S. employees should be included in a registrant’s
pay ratio disclosure. 143 Some commenters contended that failing to include non-U.S. employees
would cause the pay ratio disclosure to be incomplete, less informative, and misleading. 144 Some
commenters stressed that Congress intended to include non-U.S. employees because Section
953(b) refers specifically to “all employees.” 145 One commenter suggested that the exclusion of
non-U.S. employees would not reduce the regulatory burdens on registrants because registrants

with such employees would have substantial flexibility in identifying the median employee. 146
Many commenters, however, disagreed with the proposed rule and contended that the final
rule should include only the registrant’s U.S. employees because including non-U.S. employees
would be very costly and/or distort the pay ratio. 147 A number of commenters asserted that the
costs to registrants of including non-U.S. employees would outweigh any benefits of the
disclosure to shareholders, 148 and offered a variety of different estimates of how greatly the
inclusion of non-U.S. employees would affect costs. 149
Additionally, commenters noted that companies with international operations almost
always have multiple payroll systems and databases for their employees’ compensation that are
difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile, 150 with some of the commenters providing the following
examples:
•

one commenter indicated that it has 15 payroll systems that are not integrated, and
those systems would have to be manually reconciled with “substantial costs” and

recommended that, if the final rule did not exclude all non-U.S. employees, it should permit
registrants to exclude from their methodology for identifying the median employee the data for
any employees in a jurisdiction where such collection, analysis, and transmission would violate a
registrant’s existing data privacy obligations. 157 A few commenters stated that the proposed
rule’s flexibility afforded to all registrants could permit registrants to manage any potential costs

arising from applicable data privacy laws. 158
One commenter contended that any data privacy concerns can be addressed easily by
anonymizing payroll data sets or conducting statistical sampling. 159 If, however, these privacy
safeguards proved insufficient, the commenter recommended that registrants be permitted to
exclude employees in such countries only if they disclose the number of employees in the
excluded countries and obtain and file as an exhibit to the periodic report in which the pay ratio
disclosure appears a legal opinion by qualified outside counsel demonstrating that the privacy
safeguards are inadequate under local law.
Additionally, a number of commenters contended that including non-U.S. employees in
the final rule would distort the pay ratio because of (1) differences in local pay practices, 160 with
some of these comment letters stating that, unlike many U.S. companies, companies in other
countries include as “compensation” transportation, food, housing, wedding, birth, education, and
phone expenses, as well as profit-sharing arrangements and government provided benefits; 161 (2)
the exchange rates of foreign currencies; 162 and (3) cost-of-living differences among countries. 163
A few commenters argued that excluding non-U.S. employees was supported by statutory

registrants, others may be able to gather the required information under existing waivers granted to them by
the EU, and some registrants can estimate total compensation of their employees in countries with data

total compensation using those bands).

construction. They contended that, despite Section 953(b)’s reference to “all employees,” this
statutory reference does not require the final rule to include non-U.S. employees. 164 Some of
these commenters asserted that excluding non-U.S. employees would be consistent with Section
953(b) because the statute is silent as to whether “all employees” means non-U.S. employees. 165
Others insisted that interpreting “all employees” to exclude non-U.S. employees would be
appropriate because of a presumption against the extraterritoriality of U.S. laws. 166
Some commenters advocated for a de minimis exemption for non-U.S. employees 167
because, as one of these commenters stated, excluding a small number of employees is unlikely to
affect “in a material way” the pay ratio and the nominal differences in ratios would be outweighed
by the cost savings to registrants. 168 Commenters provided a number of suggestions for a de
minimis exemption. One commenter suggested that, if non-U.S. employees make up less than
20% of all a registrant’s employees, the registrant should be permitted to exclude all non-U.S.
employees. 169 Another commenter stated that registrants should be permitted to exclude non-U.S.
employees in any foreign country that comprises less than 5% of the registrant’s aggregate global
workforce. 170
A different commenter recommended that a registrant be permitted to exclude non-U.S.

employees if they account for less than 5% of the registrant’s total workforce because they would
represent a de minimis number of employees. 171 Also, according to that commenter, if the
registrant’s foreign employees account for more than 5% of all employees, this commenter
recommended that the registrant should be permitted to exclude employees in any single foreign
jurisdiction if they comprise less than 2% of total employees, with an aggregate cap of 5%, and
that the registrant be allowed to choose which country’s employees to exclude. 172 Another
commenter noted that a registrant should be permitted to exclude non-U.S. employees in a foreign
country if the number of employees in that country is less than 1% of the registrant’s total
workforce. 173
One commenter recommended that a registrant be able to exclude non-U.S. employees if
its CEO is based in the United States and more than 50% of the registrant’s employees also are
based in the United States. 174 Conversely, a different commenter contended that we should use
our discretion to limit the scope of the term “all employees” to only U.S. employees if “most of
the registrant’s employees” and its principal executive officer “work primarily outside the United
States.” 175 Alternatively, the commenter suggested that, if the final rule includes non-U.S.
employees, the rule should not include as “compensation” the value of pension accruals, employer
matching contributions for 401(k)s, and non-cash benefits. The commenter also advocated that, if
non-U.S. employees are included, the final rule should exclude from the median identification
employees who work in any E.U. jurisdiction that has strict data privacy rules and employs fewer

than 50 people.
Another commenter contended that the final rule should include a principles-based
exclusion that would permit companies the flexibility to exclude substantial percentages of
employees if their compensation data is difficult to obtain and the impact would not be
significant. 176 The commenter cited the two memoranda analyzing the potential effects of
excluding different percentages of employees on the pay ratio calculation that the staff from the
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (“DERA”). 177 According to the commenter, these
memoranda concluded that excluding a “large share” of employees from the pay ratio calculation
would “not have a significant impact” on the ratio. As an example, the commenter noted that the
June 30 Memorandum states that excluding 40% of a registrant’s employee population could
reduce the pay ratio by 10.77% or increase it by 12.08%. The commenter asserted these amounts
would be “negligible,” and therefore registrants should be permitted to exclude these employees
from their pay ratio calculations under the principles-based exclusionary approach advocated by
the commenter. Additionally, the commenter noted that the average respondent to a survey it
conducted indicated that 40% of its employees are located overseas and excluding these
employees would decrease the compliance costs of the rule by 47%.

67

After considering the comments, we have determined to include in the final rule’s
definition of “employee” a registrant’s U.S. and non-U.S. employees, as proposed. We believe
that the inclusion of non-U.S. employees is the policy choice that most closely captures what
Congress directed us to do in stating that the ratio should reflect “all employees.” As noted
above, we believe that the use of the word “all” provides a general direction in favor of inclusion
rather than exclusion of broad categories of employees. Although we recognize that our reading
may impose more costs on registrants than if we excluded non-U.S. employees, given that
Congress is undoubtedly aware that many U.S. registrants operate globally, we think Congress’s
use of “all employees” without any territorial limitation is a strong indication that Congress did
not want us to categorically exclude non-U.S. employees. Further supporting our conclusion is
the fact that, historically, the disclosures that are required of registrants under the securities laws
apply to events, assets, conduct, or persons irrespective of whether those are located in the United
States or abroad, and there is no indication that Congress intended to depart from this historical
approach. However, as discussed below, we are adopting several tailored exemptions to address
specific concerns raised by commenters.
With respect to the assertion by some commenters that the rule should exclude non-U.S.
employees because there is a presumption against the extraterritoriality of U.S. laws, 178 we do not
believe that including foreign employees within the “employee” definition constitutes an
extraterritorial application of the statute. Generally, whether a particular application of a statute is
“extraterritorial” turns on an analysis of whether the conduct that is the Congressional focus of the
statute occurs here or abroad. 179 The Congressional focus of Section 953(b) is disclosure by

178

68

registrants that avail themselves of the U.S. public markets and thereby submit to U.S. law. 180 As
discussed above, Section 953(b)(1) directs us to amend Item 402, “to require each issuer to
disclose” the pay ratio information “in any filing” described in Item 10(a). Companies are only
required to provide a “filing” with us if they offer and/or sell securities in the United States and
become subject to the our registration and filing requirements. Therefore, the final rule affects
only registrants that come under the umbrella of United States laws.
Our exemptive authority under Section 36 of the Exchange Act and Section 28 of the
Securities Act would allow us to exempt registrants from including non-U.S. employees in the
median employee determination required by Section 953(b). 181 However, after careful
consideration, we decline to exercise our discretion to grant a wholesale exemption for non-U.S.
employees. As we understand Section 953(b), Congress thought that it was important for
shareholders to have pay ratio disclosure that reflects “all employees” of a registrant when making
their say-on-pay votes. We do not believe it would be appropriate to second-guess Congress by
granting a wholesale exemption for non-U.S. employees in a manner that we believe could
fundamentally change the pay ratio information that Congress directed be provided to

180

In this regard, we note that it is important that shareholders have access to information about both the
domestic and foreign operations of a registrant given that a shareholder’s investment in a U.S. registrant is
typically exposed to the risks of, and the returns generated by, the global operations of the registrant.

181

Section 36(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 28 of the Securities Act afford us general exemptive
authority to conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or
classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision or provisions of this title (i.e., the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, respectively) or of any rule or regulation thereunder, to the extent that
such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of
investors. Although Section 953(b) was not expressly incorporated into either Act, our view is that, to the
extent that the statutory criteria for invoking exemptive authority under these sections are met, the
exemptive authorities afforded by Section 36(a) and Section 28 are available here. We construe Section
953(b) as a Congressional directive to us to rely on our Exchange Act and Securities Act rulemaking
authorities to amend section 229.402 of Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations to require the pay ratio
disclosure. The pay ratio amendments that we are adopting, therefore, are rules or regulations under the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act and, thus, fall within the express terms of Section 36(a) and Section 28.

shareholders. 182
While the final rule does not exclude non-U.S. employees, in response to concerns that the
inclusion of non-U.S. employees could raise compliance costs for multinational companies,
introduce cross-border compliance issues, and have an adverse impact on competition, we are
exercising our exemptive authority to provide two tailored exemptions that we believe will
alleviate some of these concerns: (1) an exemption that applies when a foreign jurisdiction’s data
privacy laws or regulations are such that, despite its reasonable efforts to obtain or process
information necessary to comply with the rule, a registrant is unable to do so without violating
those laws or regulations, and (2) a de minimis exemption. These exemptions are discussed in
detail below.
(b) Foreign Data Privacy Law Exemption
The first instance in which we believe it is appropriate to provide an exemption to the
general requirement that non-U.S. employees be included in the pay ratio disclosure is when a
jurisdiction’s data privacy laws or regulations are such that, despite a registrant’s reasonable
efforts to obtain or process information necessary to comply with the rule, it is unable to do so
without violating those laws or regulations. A number of commenters noted that many countries
have data privacy and other laws that prevent registrants from transferring payroll data outside
that country’s borders (even if the transfer would be within the same company), which would
make compiling the information necessary for the pay ratio disclosure illegal. 183 For example,

182

Our use of exemptive authority where foreign data privacy laws are involved (as discussed below) may
result in different pay ratio disclosure in certain instances, but we believe the use of exemptive authority is
appropriate because it reflects a carefully tailored accommodation necessary to address a situation (i.e.,
foreign data privacy laws) that Congress may not have contemplated.

183

commenters noted that the E.U. prohibits the transfer of personal data to a third country that does
not ensure an adequate level of privacy protections (the United States is considered not to ensure
adequate privacy protections) and that China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Peru, Australia, Russia,
Switzerland, Argentina, and Singapore have adopted or are considering similar rules. 184
One of these commenters acknowledged, however, that “it would be reasonable to expect
that registrants which employ workers abroad already have an understanding of their obligations
under the data privacy laws of each jurisdiction in which they operate, and have undertaken to
comply with those laws,” but the commenter was concerned that existing actions taken by
registrants to comply with those laws may not be sufficiently flexible to facilitate compliance
with the rule. 185 In this regard, the commenter noted that, under the E.U. Directive, data may be
exempt from the dictates of the Directive if it is truly anonymous such that the data cannot be
attributed to any identifiable person. It would seem, therefore, that a registrant employing
hundreds or thousands of employees in an E.U. jurisdiction could collect compensation data for
purposes of complying with Section 953(b) in a way that would preserve employee anonymity
while a registrant that employs only a handful of employees in an E.U. jurisdiction may not be
able to collect the data in such a manner. 186 The commenter therefore recommended that, if the
final rule did not exclude all non-U.S. employees, it should permit registrants to exclude from
the definition of “employee” any employee in a jurisdiction where such collection, analysis, and
transmission would violate a registrant’s existing data privacy obligations. 187

184

See, e.g., letters from ABA, American Benefits Council, Business Roundtable I, COEC I, Cummins Inc.,
NAM I, NAM II, RILA, and WorldatWork I.

185

See letter from ABA.

186

In such situations, we recognize that the de minimis exemption may be available.

187

See letter from ABA (recommending that we consider permitting registrants to exclude from the
identification of the median employee those employees who work in an E.U. jurisdiction that maintains strict

71

After considering the comments received, we are persuaded that a tailored exemption from
the definition of “employee” is appropriate where a foreign country’s data privacy laws or
regulations are such that a registrant is not able to comply with the rule without violating those
laws or regulations in spite of its reasonable efforts to obtain or process the necessary
information. 188
Although, as noted above, we believe the inclusion of non-U.S. employees is consistent
with the Congressional directive and is important for providing pay ratio information that reflects
a registrant’s overall employment practices, we do not have any indication that Congress intended
that a registrant should have to choose between complying with our disclosure rules and violating
the laws of a foreign jurisdiction. We believe that, on balance, providing an accommodation in
such situations would not substantially affect the utility of the Section 953(b) disclosures for
shareholder say-on-pay votes.
To prevent any potential manipulation, the rule requires the registrant to exercise
reasonable efforts to obtain or process the information necessary for compliance with the final
rule. As part of its reasonable efforts, the registrant must seek an exemption or other relief under
the applicable jurisdiction’s governing data privacy laws or regulations and use the exemption if
granted.
If a registrant excludes any non-U.S. employees in a particular jurisdiction under the data
privacy exemption, it must exclude all non-U.S. employees in that jurisdiction. Additionally, the

data privacy laws and in which the registrant employs fewer than 50 employees).
188

As required by Section 28 of the Securities Act and Section 36 of the Exchange Act, we find that the
exemption here is consistent with investor protection and is necessary or appropriate in the public interest.
We make these findings based on the fact that, without the exemption, registrants operating in countries with
applicable privacy laws could be forced into the difficult situation of violating either that country’s laws or
U.S. law, and we believe that because of the limited and tailored nature of the exemption, it will not
materially impact the pay ratio disclosure.

72

registrant must list the excluded jurisdictions, identify the specific data privacy law or regulation,
explain how complying with the final rule violates the law or regulation (including the efforts
made by the registrant to use or seek an exemption or other relief under such law or regulation),
and provide the approximate number of employees exempted from each jurisdiction based on this
exemption.
Also, the registrant must obtain a legal opinion that opines on the inability of the registrant
to obtain or process the information necessary for compliance with the final rule without violating
that jurisdiction’s laws or regulations governing data privacy, including the registrant’s inability
to obtain an exemption or other relief under any governing laws or regulations. The legal opinion
must be filed as an exhibit with the filing in which the pay ratio disclosure is included. For filings
other than proxy or information statements, the legal opinion must be filed as an exhibit under
Exhibit 99. 189
(c) De Minimis Exemption
The second instance in which we believe it is appropriate to provide an exemption from
the general requirement to include non-U.S. employees in identifying the median employee is
when a de minimis number of a registrant’s employees work outside the United States. The de
minimis exemption is a change from the proposed rule. Under this exemption, registrants whose
non-U.S. employees make up 5% or less of their total U.S. and non-U.S. employees may exclude
all of them when identifying their median employee. If such a registrant chooses to exclude any
non-U.S. employees under this exemption, it must exclude all of them. A registrant with more
than 5% non-U.S. employees may also exclude non-U.S. employees up to the 5% threshold;

189

See Item 601(b)(99) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(99)]. The exhibit must be filed with proxy or
information statements pursuant to Item 25 of Schedule 14A.

73

provided that, if such a registrant excludes any non-U.S. employees in a particular foreign
jurisdiction, it must exclude all the employees in that jurisdiction. The registrant may not pick
and choose which employees to exclude in any one jurisdiction.
We believe a de minimis exemption provides flexibility in a manner that will not
meaningfully alter the pay ratio disclosure. We are persuaded that a de minimis exemption is
appropriate after considering the potential cost savings to registrants and the small effect it would
have on the pay ratio, as discussed below. The final rule establishes the de minimis threshold at
5%. The commenters that suggested specific de minimis thresholds did not provide reasons why
the particular thresholds they suggested were suitable, but several of these commenters suggested
a threshold of 5%. 190 We believe the 5% threshold will both limit the exemption to an amount
that is, in fact, de minimis and help address the payroll or other data challenges that may arise for
registrants with a small percentage of non-U.S. employees.
Although commenters did not provide data about the effect on the pay ratio of potential de
minimis thresholds, staff in DERA performed an analysis of the potential effect on pay ratio
disclosure of excluding different percentages of employees at a range of thresholds and posted to
the comment file two memoranda containing the analysis. 191 As discussed in further detail both
in the memoranda and in the Economic Analysis section below, under such analysis and based on
the assumptions set forth in the analysis, the exclusion of 5% of employees may cause the pay
ratio calculation to decrease by up to 3.4% or to increase by up to 3.5%. We believe such
analysis confirms that the effect of the 5% threshold on the pay ratio disclosure will be de
190

See letters from PNC Financial Services (suggesting 5% as the de minimis threshold) and FSR
(recommending a registrant be permitted to exclude non-U.S. employees if they account for less than 5% of
the registrant’s employees, but, if the registrant’s foreign employees account for more than 5% of all
employees, the registrant may exclude employees in any single foreign jurisdiction if they comprise less
than 2% of total employees, with an aggregate cap of 5%).

191

See the June 4 Memorandum and the June 30 Memorandum. See also, Section III.D.2.c.vi below.

74

minimis. We note that one commenter observed that under one of the scenarios analyzed in the
June 30 Memorandum, excluding 40% of a registrant’s employees may cause the pay ratio
calculation to decrease by up to 10.77% or to increase by up to 12.08%. 192 The commenter called
this impact “not significant” and “negligible” and, based on this impact, contended that the final
rule should permit registrants to exclude up to 40% of their non-U.S. employees. We are not
adopting this suggestion. We believe that the exclusion of 40% of employees would be a
fundamentally different type of exclusion than the one we adopting here—that is, a de minimis
exclusion designed to allow companies to exclude employees in jurisdictions where there are only
a limited number of employees and where the costs of including such employees may be
disproportionately greater than the incremental information they would add to the disclosure. The
exclusion of 40% of employees is not a de minimis amount of employees, and, in contrast to the
assertions of the commenter, we believe that a decrease in the pay ratio calculation of up to
10.77% or increase by up to 12.08% is significant and more than negligible, and we do not
believe that it is de minimis. Additionally, as the commenter acknowledges, under other scenarios
in the memorandum, exclusion of up to 40% of a registrant’s employees could have an even
greater effect on the pay ratio (e.g., by causing it to decrease by up to 25.06% or to increase by up
to 33.43%). In contrast, the 5% de minimis threshold both results in the exclusion of a de
minimis number of employees and has a de minimis effect on the pay ratio, regardless of which
scenario is considered. Accordingly, the final rule’s de minimis threshold for non-U.S. employees
does not exceed 5%.
As one commenter warned, there is a possibility for intentional manipulation in
identifying the median employee when a de minimis exemption is provided and a registrant is
192

See letter from COEC III.

75

permitted to choose which jurisdictions to exclude. 193 To provide safeguards against any
potential manipulation, the final rule requires that, if a registrant with 5% or fewer non-U.S.
employees chooses to exclude those employees from the calculation of its median employee, it
may not pick and choose which of the 5% to exclude and must exclude all of its non-U.S.
employees. Similarly, if a registrant with more than 5% non-U.S. employees excludes any
employees in any jurisdiction, it must exclude all the employees in that jurisdiction. In this
regard, we recognize that this requirement could prevent some registrants with more than 5% nonU.S. employees from excluding any of its foreign employees. A purpose of the de minimis
exemption is to provide relief from the need to determine how to integrate payroll systems and
compensation arrangements in jurisdictions where the number of employees may not justify the
effort, and we believe that setting the threshold at 5% establishes an appropriate measure of relief.
The final rule also requires a registrant using the de minimis exemption to provide certain
disclosures. If the registrant excludes any non-U.S. employees under the de minimis exemption, it
must disclose the jurisdiction or jurisdictions from which employees are being excluded, the
approximate number of employees excluded from each jurisdiction under the de minimis
exemption, the total number of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees irrespective of any exemption
(data privacy or de minimis) and the total number of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees used for its
de minimis calculation.
In calculating the number of non-U.S. employees that may be excluded under the de
minimis exemption, a registrant must count any non-U.S. employee exempted under the data
privacy exemption against the availability. A registrant may exclude any non-U.S. employee that
meets the data privacy exemption, even if the number of excluded employees exceeds 5% of the
193

See letter from FSR.

76

registrant’s total employees. If, however, the number of employees excluded under the data
privacy exemption equals or exceeds 5% of the registrant’s total employees, the registrant may
not use the de minimis exemption to exclude additional non-U.S. employees.
For example, a registrant has non-U.S. employees located in two foreign jurisdictions.
One of the jurisdictions has 10% of the registrant’s total employees who are non-U.S. employees
and has data privacy laws that, despite its reasonable efforts to obtain or process the information
necessary for compliance with the final rule, the registrant is unable to do so without violating
those data privacy laws or regulations. The other jurisdiction has an additional 5% of the
registrant’s total employees who are non-U.S. employees and has no such data privacy laws or
regulations. The registrant may exclude all the non-U.S. employees in the first jurisdiction, which
has 10% of the registrant’s total employees. In that situation, however, the registrant may not
exclude the non-U.S. employees in the second jurisdiction, which has the additional 5% of the
total employees, even though the 5% would otherwise constitute a de minimis amount of non-U.S.
employees, because the registrant is already excluding over 5% of its employees under the data
privacy exemption. 194
Moreover, if the number of non-U.S. employees excluded under the data privacy
exemption is less than 5% of the registrant’s total employees, the registrant may use the de
minimis exemption to exclude no more than the number of non-U.S. employees that, combined
with the data privacy exemption, equals 5% of the registrant’s total employees.
For example, a registrant has non-U.S. employees located in two foreign jurisdictions.
194

We do not envision a scenario in which a registrant can forgo the data privacy exemption in favor of the de
minimis exemption in the above or similar situations. The data privacy exemption is permitted only for
circumstances in which a foreign jurisdiction’s laws or regulations governing data privacy are such that a
registrant is unable to comply with the final rule without violating the that jurisdiction’s laws or regulations.
If a registrant is in a position to forgo the data privacy exemption, it would not be considered eligible for the
exemption.

77

One of the jurisdictions has 2.5% of the registrant’s total employees who are non-U.S. employees
and has data privacy laws that, despite its reasonable efforts to obtain or process the information
necessary for compliance with the final rule, the registrant is unable to do so without violating
those data privacy laws or regulations. The other jurisdiction has an additional 2.5% of the
registrant’s total employees who are non-U.S. employees and has no such data privacy laws or
regulations. The registrant may exclude the 2.5% of total employees who are non-U.S.
employees in the first jurisdiction under the data privacy exemption. The registrant may also
exclude the additional 2.5% of the registrant’s total employees who are non-U.S. employees from
the second jurisdiction because the total number of exempted non-U.S. employees under both the
data privacy and the de minimis exemptions equal only 5% of the registrant’s total employees.
Alternatively, in the above example, if the number of non-U.S. employees in the second
jurisdiction was 3% of the registrant’s total employees, the registrant could not exclude the nonU.S. employees in that jurisdiction because the registrant’s number of excluded non-U.S.
employees in both jurisdictions would be over 5% of its total employees.
(d) Cost-of-Living Adjustment
In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on whether we should permit cost-ofliving adjustments for employees in different countries. A number of commenters who addressed
this issue contended that unadjusted cost of living differences between countries would cause the
inclusion of non-U.S. employees to render the pay ratio disclosure misleading. 195 Accordingly,
some of these commenters suggested that the pay ratio disclosure could be more meaningful for
some registrants if the final rule permitted cost-of-living adjustments. 196 However, other

ExxonMobil, NAM I, NAM II, and SH&P.

196

See letter from ExxonMobil (“Example 2: Differences in cost of living. Two employees hold similar jobs

78

commenters objected to permitting cost-of living-adjustments, 197 asserting that the compensation
of a non-U.S. employee “is more directly comparable to the total compensation of a registrant’s
[PEO] without a cost-of-living adjustment,” 198 and that permitting cost-of-living adjustments
could add a level of subjectivity to the pay ratio disclosure. 199
We acknowledge that differences in the underlying economic conditions of the countries
in which registrants operate likely have an effect on the compensation paid to employees in those
jurisdictions. As a result, requiring registrants to determine their median employee and calculate
the pay ratio without permitting them to adjust for these different underlying economic conditions
could result in what some would consider a statistic that does not appropriately reflect the value
of the compensation paid to individuals in those countries. The final rule, therefore, allows
registrants the option to make cost-of-living adjustments to the compensation of their employees
in jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides when identifying the median
employee (whether using annual total compensation or any other consistently applied
compensation measure), provided that the adjustment is applied to all such employees included in
the calculation. 200 If the registrant chooses this option, the compensation of such employees will

in two different countries, C and D. The employee in Country C receives total annual compensation of
$100,000 and the employee in Country D receives total annual compensation of $75,000. The cost of living
in Country D is approximately 50% of the cost of living in Country C. In real economic terms, the
employee in Country D enjoys significantly higher pay than the employee in Country C. However, under
the rules as proposed the appearance is reversed.”) (Emphasis in original.). See also, letters from NAM I,
NAM II, and SH&P.

198

See letter from ABA (“We believe that the Commission should not allow registrants to make cost-of-living
adjustments for non-U.S.-based employees (should the agency determine to include them), other than the
annualization and full-time equivalent adjustments discussed above in our responses to Questions 23 and 24.
We believe the total compensation of such full-time employees is more directly comparable to the total
compensation of a registrant’s principal executive officer without a cost-of-living adjustment than with it.”).

199

See letter from Prof. Ray.

200

We are utilizing our authority under Section 28 of the Securities Act and Section 36 of the Exchange Act to
permit registrants to elect to identify the median employee by first adjusting the compensation of employees

79

have to be adjusted to the cost of living in the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides. Further, if
the registrant uses a cost-of-living adjustment to identify the median employee, and the median
employee identified is an employee in a jurisdiction other than the one in which the PEO resides,
the registrant must use the same cost-of-living adjustment in calculating the median employee’s
annual total compensation and disclose the median employee’s jurisdiction. If a registrant does
not make cost-of-living-adjustments to its employees when identifying the median employee, the
registrant is not permitted to make cost-of-living adjustments to the median employee’s annual
total compensation if the median employee is an employee in a jurisdiction other than the
jurisdiction in which the PEO resides.
In the Proposing Release, we said that we preliminarily believed that certain adjustments,
including cost-of-living adjustments, “could distort an understanding of the registrant’s
compensation practices.” Based on our fuller understanding of the Congressional purpose
underlying the pay ratio disclosure and the comments received on the proposal, however, we are
persuaded that allowing registrants the option of a cost-of-living adjustment for employees in
jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides could be useful to investors as
they make their say-on-pay votes. Put simply, a cost-of-living adjustment could provide a more
meaningful comparison of the PEO’s compensation to the actual value of the median employee’s
compensation by effectively filtering out that part of the difference in compensation that results
from differences in the cost of living between the PEO’s place of residence (typically, the United
States) and the median employee’s jurisdiction. For some shareholders making their say-on-pay
votes, we believe that what may matter is the value of compensation received by the median

in jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides to the cost of living in the CEO's
jurisdiction of residence. Moreover, for the reasons described above, we believe that this conditional
exemption is consistent with the public interest and investor protection.

80

employee, rather than the dollar amount of the compensation paid. Although we are not
mandating that registrants adjust for these cost-of-living considerations, we believe that it is
appropriate to give them the option to make such adjustments where they determine that doing so
would provide more useful information to their shareholders as they vote on executive
compensation. 201
We recognize that providing registrants the flexibility to make cost-of-living adjustments
could add a level of subjectivity to the pay ratio disclosure, make compliance with the rule more
burdensome, or permit registrants to alter the reported ratio to achieve a particular objective with
the ratio disclosure. 202 Registrants with a significant number of employees in countries with
higher cost-of-living than the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides may be unlikely to adjust
those compensation figures downward, while registrants with a sizable work force in countries
with a lower cost-of-living may be likely to adjust the compensation figures upward.
We believe, however, that the final rule mitigates these concerns by requiring registrants
to briefly describe any cost-of-living adjustments they used to identify the median employee or to
calculate annual total compensation, including the measure used as the basis for the cost-of-living
adjustment, and disclose the country in which the median employee is located. Additionally, the
final rule requires that any registrant electing to present the pay ratio using a cost-of-living
201

Although the final rule gives registrants the option to make cost-of-living adjustments for employees in
jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides, we are not giving registrants the option of
adjusting part-time or seasonal employees’ compensation as though they were full time employees. For U.S.
part-time or seasonal employees, the unadjusted compensation reflects the actual relative value of the
compensation received by that employee, unlike non-U.S. employees who may be working in countries with
a significantly lower cost of living. Moreover, adjusting the compensation of part-time or seasonal
employees to what they would have received if they had been full time employees would cause the median
to not be reasonably representative of the registrant’s actual employment arrangements for its workforce
during the period.

202

See letters from Prof. Ray (stating that permitting cost-of-living adjustments “will only make the pay ratio
more subjective,” because they “add subjectivity” to the disclosure) and WorldatWork I (“Cost-of-living
adjustments and full-time compensation adjustments would make compliance more burdensome by
requiring more context in the explanation of how the ratio was calculated.”).

81

adjustment must also disclose the median employee’s annual total compensation and pay ratio
without the cost-of-living adjustments. To calculate this pay ratio, the registrant will need to
identify the median employee without using any cost-of-living adjustments. In this way,
shareholders would have pay ratio information both in terms of the value of compensation
received by the employee and in terms of the compensation paid by the registrant. 203
For registrants who choose to present the pay ratio using a cost-of-living adjustment, the
pay ratio required by Item 402(u)(1)(iii) will be the cost-of-living adjusted pay ratio. Disclosure
of the unadjusted pay ratio will be available to provide context for the registrant’s required pay
ratio. Because the cost-of-living adjustment will be optional for registrants, we assume they will
choose to avail themselves of this option only to the extent they believe the benefits of doing so
will justify any additional costs to make the adjustment.
d. Employees of Consolidated Subsidiaries
i. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule would cover employees of both a registrant and its subsidiaries, which
is similar to the approach taken for other Item 402 information. 204 In the context of Item 402, a
subsidiary of a registrant is an affiliate controlled by the registrant directly or indirectly through
one or more intermediaries, as set forth in the definition of “subsidiary” under both Securities Act
Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. Therefore, the proposal would cover an employee if he
or she was employed by the registrant or a subsidiary of the registrant as defined in Rule 405 and
Rule 12b-2.
203

We believe that requiring this disclosure of the unadjusted pay ratio for those registrants who choose to
include a cost-of-living adjustment will help to mitigate the concerns noted in the Proposing Release about
the impact that a cost-of-living adjustment could have on an understanding of a registrant’s compensation
practices.

204

See Item 402(a)(2) and Instruction 2 to Item 402(a)(3).

82

ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
The majority of commenters that discussed this issue recommended that the rule only
require parent registrants to incorporate into their pay ratio disclosure the employees of their
consolidated subsidiaries. 205 One of the commenters claimed that there would be a 91% increase
in compliance costs if the final rule included minority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures
because registrants would otherwise be required to “engage in an extensive information gathering
process” without “access to the payroll and human resources information needed for the pay ratio
from subsidiaries or other entities with a more tenuous connection, such as joint ventures.” 206
Another commenter claimed that registrants do not exercise much influence on the compensation
policies and practices of entities in which they have only a minority or nominal interest. 207 Only
one commenter asserted that the final rule should exclude compensation information from all
subsidiaries and be limited to only the compensation of employees directly employed by the
registrant. 208
Some commenters suggested that the final rule require registrants to incorporate only
employees of their wholly-owned subsidiaries and not employees of their joint ventures. 209 Other
commenters stated that the final rule should allow a subsidiary to exclude its pay ratio disclosure
in its filings if the subsidiary’s employees are incorporated into its parent registrant’s pay ratio

disclosure. 210 One commenter asserted that the final rule should require a registrant to include the
compensation information of its subsidiary only if the issuer has “control” over the subsidiary (as
“control” is defined in our rules). 211 Another commenter maintained that the final rule should
require a registrant to include its subsidiary only if the registrant has “actual control” over the
compensation decisions made at the subsidiary level. 212 Finally, a few commenters contended
that the final rule should require registrants to include the employees of their subsidiaries in their
pay ratio generally without specifying the types of subsidiaries. 213
iii. Final Rule
After considering these comments, we are revising the final rule from the proposal.
Unlike the proposed rule, the final rule defines “employee” to include only the employees of the
registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries rather than employees of subsidiaries that were
affiliates it controlled directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, as set forth in the
definition of “subsidiary” under both Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2.
This change should reduce costs and burdens for registrants, while maintaining the benefits of the
pay ratio rule, as discussed below.
Rule 12b-2 and Rule 405 define a “subsidiary” as “an affiliate controlled by [an entity]
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,” while an “affiliate” is defined as “a
person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by,
or is under common control with, the person specified.” 214 The term “control” (including the

terms “controlling,” “controlled by” and “under common control with”) means the possession,
direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. 215 One
commenter described this definition of “subsidiary” as “very expansive” because it includes not
just affiliates controlled directly by the registrant, but also those controlled indirectly by the
registrant through one or more intermediaries or that are under common control with the
registrant. 216 In the Section 16 context, we have noted that many practitioners believe that
individuals or entities holding as little as 10% or more of the voting equity securities of a
registrant may likely be considered an affiliate or control person. 217 Further, whether an affiliate
is controlled by an entity is based on the facts and circumstances of each situation, so whether a
company should be considered a “subsidiary” of a registrant is not always clear. 218 Therefore,
depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the situation, if the rule used the term
“subsidiary” as defined under Rules 12b-2 and 405, a registrant could potentially be required to
include the employees of a company in which it holds as little as a 10% ownership stake. As
commenters noted, obtaining compensation and payroll data from unconsolidated entities could
be costly, burdensome, or potentially impossible. 219 Additionally, one commenter suggested that,
because compensation disclosure is designed to facilitate the comparison of the PEO’s pay to the

most persons who are not officers, directors, or 10% holders are not in a ‘control’ position.”).

performance of the company based on its consolidated financial statements, the pay ratio should
relate to the same consolidated financial performance of the company and not to non-consolidated
entities and other factors if the purpose of the rule is to enhance compensation disclosure. 220
In contrast, defining a “subsidiary” based on whether a registrant consolidates a company
in its financial statements likely will decrease the costs and burdens on a registrant compared with
the proposal because most registrants consolidate based on their ownership of over 50% of the
outstanding voting shares of their subsidiaries and more guidance is readily available on when
consolidating subsidiaries is appropriate than when an entity should be considered a “subsidiary”
based on the concept of control. For example, the United States generally accepted accounting
principles (“U.S. GAAP”) traditionally has required a company holding the “controlling financial
interest” of another company to consolidate that company. 221 The usual condition for
consolidation is a controlling financial interest through majority ownership of over 50% of the
outstanding voting shares. 222 Determining whether a company is a “subsidiary” under the
consolidated financial statement method, as opposed to the using the definition of “subsidiary”
under Rules 405 and 12b-2, generally will provide a higher quantitative threshold and thus a
smaller pool of employees to include in the median employee determination, which should help to
reduce costs associated with making such a determination. Overall, the standard for consolidation
and the definition of “control” under Rules 405 and 12b-2 are both driven by very similar
concepts of control. Use of a consolidated subsidiary standard will typically exclude employees

See ASC 810-10-15-8 (“The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority
voting interest, and, therefore, as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly, of
more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward
consolidation. The power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership, for example, by
contract, lease, agreement with other stockholders, or by court decree.”).

of entities where a company holds between a 10% to 50% voting interest in such entity.
Although this change from the proposal generally will result in a smaller pool of
employees being used for the median employee determination, we do not believe it will
undermine the usefulness of the required disclosures or conflict with the purposes of Section
953(b). As one commenter indicated, “registrants do not exercise much, if any, influence on the
compensation policies and practices of entities in which they have only a minority or nominal
interest (unless the employees of such entities provide services directly to the registrant).” 223
According to the commenter, limiting the final rule to employees of a registrant’s consolidated
subsidiaries, therefore, “would not deprive investors of useful information or important insights
into a registrant’s compensation structure.” We believe that requiring registrants to consider only
their employees and the employees of their consolidated subsidiaries in identifying their median
employee should not limit the usefulness of the pay ratio disclosure as a data point for
shareholders to use in making their voting decisions on executive compensation under Section
951 of the Dodd-Frank Act in any significant way.
e. Any PEO Compensation in the Last Full Fiscal Year
i. Proposed Rule
The Proposing Release did not discuss the compensation information that would be
required if one or more of a registrant’s PEOs served only part of a fiscal year.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Some commenters suggested that a registrant should be required to disclose the
compensation information only for the PEO holding the position at the end of the last completed

223

87

fiscal year. 224 One commenter suggested an exception where the PEO has served for most of a
fiscal year but departs before the last day, in which case the commenter recommended that we
require compensation information disclosure for the person who served as PEO for the majority
of the fiscal year. 225 Another commenter suggested the use of the PEO as of the last day of the
most recently completed fiscal year and noted that the issue of that person’s annual total
compensation representing less than a full year’s compensation “could be addressed by requiring
registrants to annualize the annual total compensation for the chief executive officer serving at
fiscal year end.” 226
iii. Final Rule
The final rule allows a registrant a choice of two options in calculating the annual total
compensation for its PEO in situations in which the registrant replaces its PEO with another PEO
during its fiscal year. In these situations, the registrant must disclose which option it chose and
how it calculated its PEO’s annual total compensation. First, a registrant may take the total
compensation calculated pursuant to Item 402(c)(2)(x), and reflected in the Summary
Compensation Table, provided to each person who served as PEO during the year and combine
those figures. This figure would constitute the registrant’s annual total PEO compensation.
Alternatively, a registrant may look to the PEO serving in that position on the date it
selects to identify the median employee and annualize that PEO’s compensation. For example, if
the registrant chooses October 15 as the date to determine its median employee, the registrant
would calculate the compensation of the person serving as PEO on that date and annualize that
PEO’s compensation. If the person was PEO for six months and received $100,000 of total

88

compensation, the registrant would use $200,000 as the annual total compensation of its PEO.
This approach is consistent with annualizing the total compensation of permanent employees,
discussed below, which is permitted under the final rule. It is also similar to the approach
suggested by one commenter. 227
We are not adopting the approach advocated by some commenters of disclosing
compensation information for the PEO holding that position at the end of the fiscal year. Section
953(b) requires the disclosure of the “annual total compensation of the chief executive officer (or
any equivalent position) of the issuer,” and we think the better interpretation of that language is
that it is intended to capture the annual compensation paid for that position (regardless of the
individual who holds the position). Also, we believe that allowing the disclosure of only partial
year compensation would fundamentally alter the pay ratio disclosure and would not capture the
ratio of PEO compensation to median employee compensation.
f. Additional Information is Permissible
i. Proposed Rule
In the Proposing Release, we noted that we received some comments prior to the proposal
suggesting that the rule should allow registrants to present separate pay ratios covering U.S. and
non-U.S. employees to mitigate concerns that the comparison of the PEO to non-U.S. employees
could distort the disclosure. 228
The Proposing Release stated that we did not believe that it was necessary to include
instructions in the new rule expressly permitting registrants to add disclosure to accompany the

pay ratio. We indicated, that, as with other mandated disclosure under our rules, registrants
would be permitted to supplement their required disclosure with a narrative discussion or
additional ratios if they chose to do so. We indicated also that, as with other disclosure under our
rules, 229 any additional ratios should not be presented with greater prominence than the required
pay ratio. We requested comment on whether the final rule should permit or require registrants to
include two separate pay ratios covering U.S. employees and non-U.S. employees.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Some commenters opposed any requirement for two separate ratios. 230 Other commenters
also opposed a requirement for two separate ratios, but indicated that the final rule should permit
registrants to provide separate ratios if they chose to do so. 231 One commenter acknowledged that
the Proposing Release permitted additional ratios but suggested that we should indicate that any
additional ratios should not be misleading and not presented with greater prominence than the
required ratio. 232
iii. Final Rule
After considering the comments, we have added an instruction to the final rule stating
expressly that registrants may present additional ratios or other information to supplement the
required ratio, but are not required to do so. The instruction states also that, if a registrant
includes any additional ratios, the ratios must be clearly identified, not misleading, and not

presented with greater prominence than the required ratio. Additional pay ratios are not limited to
any particular information, such as pay ratios covering U.S. and non-U.S. employees.
g. Annualizing Permanent Employees is Permissible, but Other Compensation
Adjustments are Prohibited
i. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule included an instruction permitting, but not requiring, registrants to
annualize the total compensation for permanent “employees” who did not work for the entire
year, such as new hires, employees on leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 233
employees called for active military duty, or employees who took an unpaid leave of absence
during the period for another reason. We did not propose to require registrants to perform this
type of adjustment, however, because we did not believe that the costs of requiring companies to
make this extra calculation would be justified. The proposed rule applied to individuals who were
employed on the last day of the fiscal year because it referred specifically to an “employee.”
In addition, the proposed instruction would prohibit a registrant from annualizing some
eligible employees and not others, and the instruction prohibited adjustments that would cause the
ratio to not reflect the actual composition of the workforce, such as annualizing the compensation
of seasonal or temporary employees. A registrant could annualize the compensation for a
permanent part-time employee who had only worked a portion of the year (such as an employee
who is permanently employed for three days a week and who took an unpaid leave of absence
under the Family and Medical Leave Act for a portion of the year). In such a case, we explained
that the adjustment should reflect compensation for the employee’s part-time schedule over the
entire year, but should not adjust the part-time schedule to a full-time equivalent schedule.

233

29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.

91

Although we proposed to permit the annualizing adjustments described above, the
proposed rule would not have permitted certain other adjustments or assumptions, such as fulltime equivalent adjustments for part-time employees or annualizing adjustments for temporary or
seasonal employees. We believed such adjustments would cause the median to not be reasonably
representative of the registrant’s actual employment and compensation arrangements for its
workforce during the period and could diminish the potential usefulness of the disclosure.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Some commenters concurred that registrants should be permitted to annualize the total
compensation for all permanent employees (which would exclude temporary and seasonal
positions) that were employed by the registrant for less than the full fiscal year. 234 Some
commenters also agreed that registrants should not be permitted to adjust the salaries of part-time,
temporary, and seasonal employees to the equivalent of full-time status contending that it would
be misleading to do so. 235
Many commenters, however, contended that the final rule should permit registrants to
provide full-time equivalent adjustments for the salaries of part-time, temporary, and seasonal
employees. 236 Some of these commenters asserted that not doing so would distort the pay
ratio. 237 One of these commenters asserted that permitting full-time equivalent adjustments
would not undermine disclosure or make it less accurate because any potential concern about

237

92

shareholders’ understanding of the pay ratio would be mitigated by requiring registrants to
disclose their full-time equivalency and the approximate number of part-time, seasonal, and
temporary employees for which it made the calculation. 238 Another commenter indicated that, if
the final rule requires disclosure of any adjustment calculations, the disclosure should be limited
to brief statements. 239
iii. Final Rule
After considering the comments, we are adopting the final rule as proposed.
Annualization and full-time equivalent adjustments are separate concepts. Annualization involves
taking the compensation of an employee who worked for only part of the registrant’s fiscal year
and projecting that compensation as if the employee worked the full fiscal year at the schedule
that the employee worked for the portion of the year the employee worked. Annualization is
allowed under the rule for full-time and part-time employees who did not work for the registrant’s
full fiscal year for some reason, such as they were employees who were newly hired, on leave
under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, called for active military duty, or took an
unpaid leave of absence during the period. Annualization is only allowed for permanent
employees; it is not allowed under the final rule for seasonal or temporary employees. A full-time
equivalent adjustment involves taking the compensation of a part-time employee and projecting
what the employee would have made if the employee were employed on a full-time basis. Fulltime equivalent adjustments are prohibited under the final rule under all circumstances.
We are taking this approach in the final rule because we believe it most accurately
captures the workforce and compensation practices that the registrant has chosen to employ. The

238

93

limited ability to annualize a permanent full-time or part-time employee reflects the fact that these
employees are a permanent part of the registrant’s workforce despite having only worked for part
of that particular year. In contrast, a temporary or seasonal employee is not a permanent part of
the registrant’s workforce. Full-time equivalent adjustments of these employees’ compensation
would reflect a different workforce composition and compensation structure than used by the
registrant. To the extent a registrant believes that not making full-time equivalent adjustments for
temporary or seasonal employees might not provide shareholders a complete understanding of the
registrant’s compensation practices as they exercise their say-on-pay votes, the registrant is
permitted under the final rule to provide additional disclosure.
2. Identifying the Median Employee and Calculating Annual Total Compensation
a. Identifying the Median Employee
i. Once Every Three Years
(a) Proposed Rule
The proposed rule required registrants to disclose the “median of the annual total
compensation of all employees of the registrant.” 240 The proposed rule defined “annual total
compensation” to mean “total compensation for the registrant’s last completed fiscal year,” 241 and
“employee” to mean “an individual employed by the registrant or any of its subsidiaries as of the
last day of the registrant’s last completed fiscal year.” 242 Therefore, the proposed rule suggested
that registrants would need to undertake the full process of identifying anew the median employee
for each completed fiscal year.
(b) Comments on the Proposed Rule
240

See proposed Item 402(u)(1)(i) of Regulation S-K.

241

See proposed Item 402(u)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

242

See proposed Item 402(u)(3) of Regulation S-K.

94

A few commenters suggested that the final rule should allow registrants to undertake the
full process of identifying the median employee periodically (such as once every three years) and
use the compensation of that same or a similarly situated employee during the intervening two
years as long as no material or substantial changes to the workforce had occurred. 243 These
commenters indicated that, to remain consistent with Section 953(b), a registrant should be
required to undertake the process to re-identify the median employee for any year in which it has
experienced a change in its employee population which the registrant reasonably believes would
result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure. One of these commenters suggested that
the registrant should exercise “requisite diligence” annually to determine whether such a material
change had occurred. 244
(c) Final Rule
The final rule allows a registrant to identify the median employee whose compensation
will be used for the annual total compensation calculation once every three years unless there has
been a change in its employee population or employee compensation arrangements that it
reasonably believes would result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure. If there have
been no changes that the registrant reasonably believes would significantly affect its pay ratio
disclosure, the registrant must disclose that it is using the same median employee in its pay ratio
calculation and describe briefly the basis for its reasonable belief. For example, the registrant
could disclose that there has been no change in its employee population or employee
compensation arrangements that it believes would significantly affect the pay ratio disclosure. If
the registrant is using the same median employee, it must calculate that median employee’s

243

See, e.g., letters from ABA, COEC I, and COEC II.

244

See letter from ABA.

95

annual total compensation each year and use that figure to update its pay ratio disclosure each
year.
For example, the registrant is required to identify the median employee and calculate that
median employee’s annual total compensation in year one. In years two and three, however, the
registrant may use that same median employee (or an employee whose compensation is
substantially similar to the original median employee based on the compensation measure used to
select that median employee, as discussed below) to re-calculate the annual total compensation for
that employee without re-identifying the median employee as would otherwise be required under
the final rule if it satisfies the above conditions.
We believe this approach is appropriate because, as commenters noted, it is consistent
with the requirements of Section 953(b) to provide annual pay ratio disclosure, while at the same
time reducing registrants’ costs and burdens of re-calculating the median employee more than
once every three years unless there has been a change in the registrant’s employee population or
employee compensation arrangements that it reasonably believes would result in a significant
change in the pay ratio disclosure. 245 Also, we note that the final rule permits reasonable
estimates in identifying the median employee. Permitting registrants to identify the median
employee once every three years, absent a change in the registrant’s employee population or
employee compensation arrangements that it reasonably believes would result in a significant
change in its pay ratio disclosure, is another way of allowing an estimate of the median employee
in a situation where it is unlikely to result in a significant change to the pay ratio disclosure.
Therefore, this provision will help to minimize burdens and costs while not significantly affecting
registrants’ pay ratios. We do not believe that allowing this flexibility will limit the usefulness of
245

See, e.g., letters from ABA and COEC I.

96

the pay ratio for shareholders as a data point in making their voting decisions on executive
compensation under Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Further, we note that allowing a registrant in appropriate circumstances to go up to three
years without engaging in the full process to re-identify the median employee is consistent with
the outer limit established by Section 951 for a registrant’s say-on-pay vote. In our view, just as
registrants must have a new say-on-pay vote three years after the previous vote, we think it is
reasonable and appropriate that they engage in the process of re-identifying the median employee
no less frequently than every three years.
Also, there may be situations in which there has been no change in a registrant’s employee
population or employee compensation arrangements but it is no longer appropriate for the
registrant to use the median employee identified in year one as the median employee in years two
or three because of a change in that employee’s circumstances. In such a situation, the registrant
may use another employee whose compensation is substantially similar to the original median
employee based on the compensation measure used to select the median employee in year one.
For example, if the median employee identified in year one is no longer employed by the
registrant in years two or three or that employee’s compensation significantly changed in years
two and three (for example, a promotion that significantly increased his or her compensation), the
registrant is permitted to identify its median employee in each of the following two years from
among employees that had similar compensation to the median employee in year one. If no other
employee has similar compensation, however, the registrant must re-identify the median
employee as required under the final rule.
ii. Using Annual Total Compensation, Another Consistently Applied Compensation
Measure, Statistical Sampling, Reasonable Estimates, or Other Reasonable Methods
(a) Proposed Rule
97

In the Proposing Release, we noted that Congress specifically chose the “median” as the
point of comparison for Section 953(b), rather than the average or some other measure.
Therefore, the proposed rule required the median. Section 953(b) does not prescribe a
methodology that must be used to identify the median. To allow the greatest degree of flexibility
while remaining consistent with the statutory provision, the proposed rule did not specify any
required calculation methodologies for identifying the median. Instead, we provided instructions
and guidance designed to allow registrants to choose from several alternative methods to identify
the median, so that they would be able to use the method that worked best for their own facts and
circumstances.
For instance, registrants would be able to provide the proposed disclosure using total
compensation for each employee under Item 402(c)(2)(x), statistical sampling, reasonable
estimates, or the use of any consistently applied compensation measures to identify the median.
Once the registrant identified the median employee based on the selected compensation measure
applied to each employee in the sample, the registrant would calculate that employee’s annual
total compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) and disclose that amount as part of the
pay ratio disclosure. The proposal did not prescribe what a reasonable estimate would entail
because that would necessarily depend on the registrant’s particular facts and circumstances. In
addition, the proposed rule did not prescribe specific estimation techniques or confidence levels
for identifying the median employee because we believed that companies would be in the best
position to determine what is reasonable in light of their own employee population and access to
compensation data. We proposed to require registrants to briefly describe and consistently use the
methodology and any material assumptions, adjustments, or estimates applied to identify the
median employee, and for any estimated amounts to be clearly identified as such.

98

We proposed this flexible approach because we believed that the most appropriate and
cost effective methodology would necessarily depend on a registrant’s particular facts and
circumstances, including, among others, such variables as: the size and nature of the registrant’s
workforce; the complexity of its organization; the stratification of pay levels across the
workforce; the types of compensation paid to employees; the extent that different currencies are
involved; the number of tax and accounting regimes involved; and the number of payroll systems
the registrant has and the degree of difficulty involved in integrating payroll systems to readily
compile total compensation information for all employees. We believed that these likely are the
same factors that would cause substantial variation in the costs of compliance.
In the Proposing Release, we stated our belief that the proposed rule’s flexibility would
enable registrants to manage compliance costs more effectively. We also stated that, by allowing
registrants to better manage costs, a flexible approach could mitigate, to some extent, any
potential negative effects on competition arising from the mandated requirements. We
recognized, however, that a flexible approach could increase uncertainty for registrants that would
prefer more specificity on how to comply with the proposed rule, particularly for those registrants
that do not use statistical analysis in the ordinary course of managing their businesses.
In the Proposing Release, we offered guidance on two permissible methodologies under
the proposal: (1) statistical sampling and (2) use of a consistently applied compensation measure.
The variance of underlying compensation distributions (that is, how widely employee
compensation is spread out or distributed around the mean) could appreciably affect the sample
size needed for reasonable statistical sampling. We conducted an analysis about sample size that
we described in the Proposing Release. Our analysis used mean and median wage estimates from
the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) at the 4-digit North

99

American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”) industry level (290 industries) and assumed
a lognormal wage distribution, a 95% confidence interval with 0.5% margin of error. The
analysis focused on the registrants that have a single business or geographical unit. The analysis
also assumed that the sampling method would be a true random sampling because it would not be
biased by region, occupation, rank, or other factor. In our analysis, the appropriate sample size
for the registrants with a single business or geographical unit varied between 81 and 1,065 across
industries, with the average estimated sample size close to 560.
We acknowledged, however, that variation in the types of employees at a registrant across
business units and geographical regions would add complexity to the sampling procedure. While
we generally agreed that a relatively small sample size would be appropriate in some situations, a
reasonable determination of sample size would ultimately depend on the underlying distribution
of compensation data. We noted that reasonable estimates of the median for registrants with
multiple business lines or geographical units could be arrived at through more than one statistical
sampling approach. All approaches, however, would require drawing observations from each
business or geographical unit with a reasonable assumption on each unit’s compensation
distribution and inferring the registrant’s overall median based on the observations drawn.
Certain cases may not easily generate confidence intervals around the estimates or prescribe the
appropriate minimum sample size. As a result, compliance costs would vary across registrants
according to the characteristics of their compensation distributions. Nevertheless, we concluded
that permitting registrants to use statistical sampling could lead to a reduction in compliance costs
as compared with other methods of identifying the median.
Additionally, we noted that the identification of a median employee would not necessarily
require a determination of exact compensation amounts for every employee included in the

100

sample. A registrant could, rather than calculating exact compensation, identify the employees in
the sample that have extremely low or extremely high pay that would fall completely on either
end of the pay spectrum. Since identifying the median involves finding the employee in the
middle, it might not be necessary to determine the exact compensation amounts for every
employee paid more or less than the employee in the middle.
In addition to statistical sampling, the Proposing Release also highlighted the use of a
consistently applied compensation measure. We recognized concerns about expected compliance
costs arising from the complexity of the “total compensation” calculation under Item 402(c)(2)(x)
and, in particular, the determination of total compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x)
for employees when identifying the median. To address these concerns, the proposed rule would
allow companies to use total direct compensation (such as annual salary, hourly wages, and any
other performance-based pay) or cash compensation to first identify a median employee and then
calculate that median employee’s annual total compensation in accordance with Item
402(c)(2)(x). We noted that this approach would provide a workable identification of the median
for many registrants, and we expected that the costs of compliance would be reduced if registrants
were permitted to identify the median using a less complex, more readily available figure, such as
salary and wages, rather than total compensation as determined in accordance with Item
402(c)(2)(x).
This approach could also reduce costs for registrants that are unable to use statistical
sampling techniques, as registrants would be permitted to use a consistently-applied
compensation measure to identify the median employee regardless of whether they use statistical
sampling. Further, because of concerns that using cash compensation could be just as
burdensome to calculate for registrants with multiple payroll systems in various countries, we did

101

not propose to require companies to use a specific compensation measure like cash compensation
or total direct compensation when they were identifying the median employee. Instead, we
believed that registrants would be in the best position to select a compensation measure that was
appropriate to their own facts and circumstances and that a consistently applied compensation
measure would result in a reasonable estimate of a median employee at a substantially reduced
cost. Therefore, the proposed rule permitted a registrant to identify a median employee based on
any consistently applied compensation measure, such as information derived from its tax and/or
payroll records, as long as the registrant briefly disclosed the measure that it used.
We also recognized that the annual period used for payroll and/or tax recordkeeping could
sometimes differ from the registrant’s fiscal year. For purposes of calculating the annual total
compensation amounts when using a consistently applied compensation measure, the proposed
rule permitted registrants to use the same annual period that was used in the payroll and/or tax
records from which the compensation amounts were derived. We did not propose to define or
limit what would qualify as payroll and/or tax records. We noted, however, that the proposed
accommodation was intended to be construed broadly enough to allow registrants to use
information that they already tracked and compiled for payroll and/or tax purposes. We thought
that permitting registrants to use compensation information in the form that it was maintained in
their own books and records would reduce compliance costs without appreciably affecting the
quality of the disclosure.
Additionally, although our proposed flexible approach could reduce comparability of the
pay ratio disclosure across registrants, we stated our belief that precise conformity or
comparability of the ratio across companies was not necessary and indicated that a possible
benefit of the pay ratio disclosure would be providing a company-specific metric that

102

shareholders could use to evaluate the PEO’s compensation within the context of his or her own
company. Accordingly, we did not believe that improving the comparability of the disclosure
across companies by mandating a specific method for identifying the median would be justified in
light of the costs that would be imposed on registrants by a more prescriptive rule.
Also, even assuming the benefits of comparability across registrants as a desirable goal,
we did not believe that mandating a particular methodology would necessarily improve
comparability because of the numerous other factors that could also cause the ratios to be less
meaningful for company-to-company comparison, such as differences in industry and business
type; variations in the way companies organize their workforces to accomplish similar tasks;
differences in the geographical distribution of employees (domestic or international, as well as in
high- or low-cost areas); degree of vertical integration; reliance on contract and outsourced
workers; and ownership structure. We also note that some commenters asserted that disclosing
the pay ratio could potentially increase the likelihood that a registrant’s competitors could infer
proprietary or sensitive information about the registrant’s business, which could cause a
competitive disadvantage for registrants. 246
Finally, we recognized that allowing registrants to select a methodology for identifying the
median, including identifying the median employee based on any consistently applied
compensation measure and allowing the use of reasonable estimates, rather than prescribing a
methodology or set of methodologies, could potentially permit a registrant to alter the reported
ratio to achieve a particular objective with the pay ratio disclosure, thereby potentially reducing
the usefulness of the information. But, as we explained, we believed that requiring the use of a
consistently applied compensation measure should lessen this concern.

(b) Comments on the Proposed Rule
(i) Flexibility
A large number of commenters indicated that they supported the flexibility permitted in
the proposed rule generally, or more specifically supported the flexibility of the proposed rule in
permitting registrants to choose a methodology for calculating the median. 247 Some commenters
contended that the flexibility would lessen the costs and burdens of the proposed rule without
reducing the rule’s benefits. 248 A few commenters suggested that the proposed rule’s flexibility
would not undermine the rule and would be consistent with the directives of Section 953(b). 249
Other commenters indicated that, although the proposed rule’s flexibility might alter pay ratio
disclosures, any distortion would be minimal. 250 One commenter claimed that the proposed rule
was not flexible enough because Instruction 2(iii) to Item 402(u) would permit a registrant to
identify the median employee only using “compensation” measures, whereas the commenter
advocated for use of a “job-level” measure. 251 Despite the permitted flexibility, another

See letter from Towers Watson. According to the commenter, in a job-level approach, a global company
assigns all jobs in its organization to one of X number of job levels (determined by how the particular job
role contributes to the organization based on tasks, skills, expertise, leadership, functional strategy and
business strategy). The company would readily be able to determine the job or job family that would fall at
the median of skill levels within the company based on a ratio that compares the total number of employees
at each job level to the total employee population. The job or job family in the median of skill levels would
be where the median-level employee resides and, once it is determined that the median employee resides at a
particular level, the company would then be able to apply a statistical sampling approach to that job level,

104

commenter remained concerned about the complexity of finding the median employee. 252
One commenter contended that a registrant should be permitted to develop its own
methodology for identifying their median employee to mitigate costs 253 if the rule required the
registrant to accurately describe its methodology, perform consistent calculations each year,
disclose when and how it chose to deviate from the prior year’s methodology, select the
methodology in good faith, and make reasonable assumptions, adjustments, and estimates. Some
commenters recommended that, once a registrant chooses its methodology for identifying the
median employee, the registrant should be required to use that methodology going forward. 254
Other commenters supported the proposed rule’s flexibility in allowing registrants to choose a
methodology for identifying the median employee, provided that registrants are required to
disclose the methodologies they used. 255 One commenter suggested that the final rule provide
some type of check generally on a registrant’s methodology. 256
Some commenters were opposed to the proposed rule’s flexibility. Most of these
commenters were individuals who claimed that the proposed rule’s flexibility would allow
registrants to reduce the ratio in inappropriate ways. 257 Other commenters contended that the
permitted flexibility would decrease the ratio’s utility, especially for comparing the ratios of

taking into account compensation earned in different locations or countries, to further reduce the number of
payroll files that will need to be examined. The commenter indicated that more details of this approach can

different companies. 258 A few commenters maintained that the proposed rule would still lead to
high costs, even taking into account its flexibility. 259
Some commenters recommended that the final rule include a safe harbor for identifying
the median employee to minimize burdens, provide greater comparability, and limit liability. 260
One commenter encouraged us to retain the proposed rule’s flexibility in allowing a registrant to
remove some percentage of the distribution from both the high and low ends of an employee
sample because this would not distort the median employee determination while reducing
costs. 261
Only a few commenters commented specifically on using reasonable estimates for
identifying the median employee. One commenter declared that the final rule should not permit
any estimates at all. 262 Other commenters contended that the final rule should permit reasonable
estimates. 263 One of these commenters noted that permitting reasonable estimates would mitigate
the rule’s costs while not “materially” impacting its usefulness. 264 Also, some commenters
recommended that the final rule not specify any requirements, guidance, or safe harbors regarding
the estimates. 265 Several commenters asserted that the final rule should not provide guidance

regarding assumptions about error rates or confidence levels. 266 One of these commenters
expressed concern that, if the final rule provided such guidance, the assumptions would become
de facto requirements. 267
A number of commenters provided suggestions on the methodologies a registrant should
be permitted to use in identifying the median employee. A few commenters stated that the final
rule should provide more explicit guidance on what “other reasonable methods” for identifying
the median employee are available. 268 One of these commenters suggested allowing the
following methods: (1) specific safe harbor assumptions about the statistical distribution of
compensation within the company and its business units; (2) formulaic, numerical, and other
computational approaches to estimate the median compensation; and (3) disclosure of a
reasonable range of outcomes rather than requiring the “right” outcome. 269
Additionally, other commenters provided specific suggestions for methods that we should
consider “reasonable” in the final rule. One commenter requested that the final rule allow
registrants to identify the median employee based on rates of pay or compensation schedules
applicable to classes of employees instead of pay actually earned over the course of the year. 270
Another commenter suggested that, where a registrant has an even number of employees and,
therefore, is unable to select one median employee, the registrant should be permitted to select

See letter from RILA (“In order to reduce the cost of using payroll or other data and annualizing information
for employees such as new hires who are employed for less than an entire fiscal or other year, we would
propose that registrants be permitted as an alternative to determine the median employee based upon
employee rate of pay on the measurement date. For some issuers, identifying the median employee based
upon rates of pay, rather than pay earned over the course of a year, will reduce the burden and minimize the
skewing effects on the ratio of a large number of part-time, temporary and seasonal employees. Provided
that the method is disclosed, the final rule should give issuers flexibility in this regard.”).

and disclose an average of the compensation of the two employees nearest the median. 271 Finally,
one commenter indicated that a registrant’s methodology should be based on a “good faith
compliance” standard that is akin to that type of standard in our proposed crowdfunding rules. 272
(ii) Statistical Sampling
We received many comments on using statistical sampling for identifying the median
employee, with a majority of these commenters supporting the use of statistical sampling, as
permitted in the proposed rule. Many of these commenters suggested that allowing the use of
statistical sampling would reduce the costs for registrants, without specifically quantifying a
reduction. 273 Some commenters that supported statistical sampling recommended that the final
rule not specify requirements for statistical sampling (such as appropriate sample size, confidence
levels, or other requirements). 274 One of these commenters contended that specifying
requirements for statistical sampling would unduly constrain registrants from developing the most
appropriate methodology and would be inconsistent with flexibility. 275
Another commenter asserted that the statute permits statistical sampling because Section
953(b) does not prescribe a particular way to identify the median employee. 276 Some commenters
stated that registrants would likely use statistical sampling in identifying their median

employee, 277 and that statistical sampling is feasible. 278 A few commenters agreed with the
proposal that registrants should be allowed to identify the median employee by using statistical
sampling based on a definition of compensation other than “annual total compensation” under
Item 402. 279 Some commenters indicated that the final rule should include a safe harbor for
statistical sampling. 280
Although the majority of commenters that discussed statistical sampling supported its use
in identifying the median employee, one commenter stated specifically that the final rule should
discourage the use of statistical sampling in favor of information derived from tax and/or payroll
records to determine actual employee pay rather than an estimated amount. 281 Other commenters,
while not necessarily opposed to statistical sampling, contended that it would not mitigate costs of
collecting and assembling employee compensation data, which, in their view, is the most
expensive part of the rule. 282

as information derived from tax and/or payroll records, to identify the median employee agreed

with the proposed rule’s approach. 283 Generally, these commenters contended that permitting the
use of such measures would reduce costs while not impairing the pay ratio’s usefulness. For
example, one commenter noted that, while using a consistently applied compensation measure
may exclude benefits, perquisites, and other allowances, it would still capture salary, incentive
cash earned, and stock awards. 284 Therefore, the measure would include “the substantial majority
of compensation and [would] not lead to distortion of the median.” Another commenter asserted
that the final rule should be flexible enough to encompass different approaches across
jurisdictions. 285
One commenter disagreed with permitting the use of consistently applied compensation
measures on the basis that it would alter the pay ratio because not all compensation would be
included. 286 Some commenters noted that using consistently applied compensation measures
would not reduce the costs for registrants with non-U.S. employees. 287 Therefore, several of these
commenters recommended that the final rule should allow registrants to use one or more
comparable consistently applied compensation measures and not be limited to a single
consistently applied compensation measure for employees in different international jurisdictions
to reduce registrants’ costs and burdens. 288

(iv) The “Median” Employee
A number of commenters recommended that the rule use compensation of an employee, or
employees, other than the median employee as is required in Section 953(b). A few of these
commenters suggested that, instead of using their median employee in their pay ratio, registrants
should be permitted to use their “average” employee. 289 The commenters contended that using
“average” instead of “median” would reduce costs, would be better understood by the public, and
could be calculated easily using tax records. 290 One of these commenters acknowledged that the
statutory language of Section 953(b) uses the word “median” rather than “average,” but pointed
out that the Proposing Release quotes from two letters submitted by members of Congress,
including two co-sponsors of Section 953(b), in which the members refer to the “average” and
“typical” employee instead of the “median” employee when discussing the statute. 291 Also, the
commenter noted that we stated in the Proposing Release that “Section 953(b) does not expressly
set forth a methodology that must be used to identify the median, nor does it mandate that [we]

Commission consider including in the final rules that for employees based in non-US jurisdictions,
registrants be permitted to use (i) the same compensation measure used in the US or (ii) another reasonably
comparable compensation measure for any non-US jurisdiction where the same compensation measure is not
used, unless a different application is required or compensation cannot be estimated in a particular
jurisdiction for a particular reason (i.e., data privacy laws).”) and Davis Polk (“For example, a registrant
using cash compensation as its consistently applied compensation measure for purposes of determining its
median employee may intend to include only base salary and bonus amounts for its U.S. employees, but may
find it appropriate to also include other benefits commonly considered to be part of base compensation for
its non-U.S. employees, such as meal stipends or automobile allowances. We believe that it would be
appropriate for registrants to use these reasonably comparable measures, even if not the exact same measure,
across different employee populations in order to provide for more meaningful comparisons across the
varying compensation structures in international jurisdictions and to reduce unnecessary burdens on
registrants.”).

must do so in [our] rules.” 292
Other commenters recommended that the final rule allow registrants to use existing BLS
data to calculate their pay ratios, which is based on average employee compensation figures. 293
One of these commenters contended that allowing registrants to use existing data sources,
including BLS data, would be faithful to the intent of Section 953(b) and not be “materially”
different than using the median, even though it would be less precise. 294
A few commenters contended that registrants should be permitted to use the compensation
of a range of employees as the median compensation instead of the compensation of the median
employee. 295 One of these commenters noted that it would be unlikely for a registrant, using a
convenient and cost-effective measure, to determine a single employee that is the median. 296
According to this commenter, it would be more likely that the registrant’s calculations would
yield a group of employees, any of whom who could serve as the median employee. Therefore,
once the range of employees is determined, registrants should be permitted to use any reasonable
method to determine which employee to use as the median employee.
Similarly, one commenter recommended that the final rule permit registrants, after
identifying the median employee using whatever methodology they select, to use another
employee as the median employee if that employee is within a 1% variance of the median and the
original employee has anomalous compensation characteristics that would create the risk of a

distorted pay ratio. 297 The commenter recognized that Section 953(b) refers to the ratio of the
“median” employee’s annual compensation to the compensation of the PEO but contended that
some deviation from that precise statutory language should be acceptable if it furthers the
statute’s intent to show the ratio of the compensation of the typical or representative employee to
that of the PEO.
Another commenter advocated using one of two alternative approaches based on whether
the registrant has international employees that would segregate employees with similar positions
into different groups. Registrants could identify in which group the median resides based on a
ratio that compares the total number of employees at each job level to the total employee
population and use sampling or another technique to identify the median of that group, which the
registrant would use as its median for pay ratio purposes. 298
(c) Final Rule
We are adopting the final rule as proposed. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule
does not specify any required methodology for registrants to use in identifying the median
employee. Instead, the final rule permits registrants the flexibility to choose a method to identify
the median employee based on their own facts and circumstances. To identify the median
employee, registrants may use a methodology that uses reasonable estimates. The median
employee may be identified using annual total compensation or any other compensation measure
that is consistently applied to all employees included in the calculation, such as information
derived from tax and/or payroll records. Also, in determining the employees from which the
median is identified, a registrant is permitted to use its employee population or statistical

298

See letter from Tower Watson. See also letter from Mercer I (advocating a somewhat similar approach
using multiple statistical samples).

113

sampling and/or other reasonable methods. In any event, the final rule requires a registrant to
briefly describe the methodology it used to identify the median employee and any material
assumptions, adjustments (including any cost-of-living adjustments), or estimates it used to
identify the median employee or to determine total compensation or any elements of total
compensation, which shall be consistently applied. The registrant also must clearly identify any
estimates used.
(i) Flexibility
As we noted in the Proposing Release, we believe that allowing registrants the flexibility to
choose a method that works best for their particular facts and circumstances will help them comply
with the rule in a relatively cost-efficient manner while still fulfilling the purpose of Section
953(b). We recognize that a flexible approach could increase uncertainty for registrants that prefer
more specificity on how to comply with the final rule, particularly for those registrants that do not
use statistical analysis in the ordinary course of managing their businesses. We believe that any
negative effects caused by any uncertainty would be offset by the positive effects of permitting
flexibility. Also, the final rule establishes certain methodologies and permissible uses of estimates,
such that registrants may use reasonable estimates both in the methodology used to identify the
median employee and in calculating annual total compensation or any elements of total
compensation for employees other than the PEO; use their employee population, statistical
sampling, or another reasonable methods in determining the employees from which the median
employee is identified, and identify the median employee using annual total compensation or any
other compensation measure that is consistently applied to all employees included in the
calculation.
We believe also that any uncertainty provided by the final rule’s flexibility is offset by

114

other benefits. Particularly, as we noted in the Proposing Release, the final rule’s flexibility allows
registrants to provide the required disclosure in a relatively cost-efficient manner based on the
registrant’s own facts and circumstances using total compensation for each employee under Item
402(c)(2)(x), statistical sampling, reasonable estimates, or the use of any consistently applied
compensation measures to identify the median. A large number of commenters supported this
flexibility because it would reduce the rule’s costs without significantly diminishing its benefits. 299
In this regard, we do not believe permitting this flexibility will limit the usefulness of the pay ratio
for shareholders as a data point in making their voting decisions on executive compensation under
Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
In determining their methodology, registrants may consider, among other factors, such
variables as: the size and nature of the workforce; the complexity of the organization; the
stratification of pay levels across the workforce; the types of compensation the employees
receive; the extent that different currencies are involved; the number of tax and accounting
regimes involved; and the number of payroll systems the registrant has and the degree of
difficulty involved in integrating payroll systems to readily compile total compensation
information for all employees. These likely are the same factors that could cause substantial
variation in the costs of compliance, but the final rule’s flexibility should help registrants reduce
these costs.
As part of the flexibility permitted by the final rule, registrants may use a methodology
that uses reasonable estimates in identifying the median employee and calculating the annual total
compensation or any elements of compensation for employees other than the PEO, as proposed.

115

Most commenters on this issue agreed that the final rule should permit reasonable estimates to
mitigate the rule’s costs. 300 Some of these commenters suggested that the final rule should not
include further requirements or guidance for making reasonable estimates, including safe harbors,
assumptions for error rates, or confidence levels. 301 We are not persuaded that further guidance is
necessary.
Further, as proposed, in determining the employees from which the median is identified,
the final rule permits registrants to use “other reasonable methods” in addition to using its
employee population or statistical sampling. Some commenters provided suggestions on the
“other reasonable methods” a registrant should be permitted to use in identifying the median
employee. 302 We are not specifying the “other reasonable methods” that may be appropriate
because we seek to allow each registrant the flexibility to determine the method that best suits its
own facts and circumstances, which may include some of the suggestions made by these
commenters.
(ii) Statistical Sampling
Consistent with the proposal, the final rule permits registrants to use statistical sampling in

See, e.g., letters from E&Y (“In the adopting release, we believe the Commission should identify additional
methods that, if used, would satisfy the requirements for determining which employees should be included
in the analysis.”), FSR (indicating that an issuer’s methodology should be based on a “good faith
compliance” standard that is akin to our proposed crowdfunding rules), RILA (requesting that the final rule
allow issuers to identify the median employee based on rates of pay instead of pay earned over the course of
the year), TCA (suggesting that final rule allow the following methods: (1) specific safe harbor assumptions
about the statistical distribution of compensation within the company and its business units; (2) formulaic,
numerical, and other computational approaches to estimate the median compensation; and (3) disclosure of a
reasonable range of outcomes rather than requiring the “right” outcome), and Towers Watson
(recommending that the final rule permit registrants to “employ a methodology using salary grades or job
levels, as appropriate, to reasonable identify the median” (emphasis in original)).

116

determining the employees from which the median is identified. We believe permitting statistical
sampling is appropriate under Section 953(b). Statistical sampling is based on statistical theory to
make sampling more efficient. For example, with large populations, results accurate enough to be
useful can be obtained from samples that represent only a small fraction of the population. 303 We
note that one commenter recommended that we discourage statistical sampling in favor of using
the information derived from tax and/or payroll records to determine actual employee pay rather
than allowing registrants to use an estimation. 304 We believe, however, that statistical sampling
can be a reliable means of identifying the median employee.
Some commenters indicated that permitting statistical sampling in the final rule would not
mitigate costs because the final rule would still require registrants to collect and assemble
employee compensation data, which the commenters view as the most expensive part of the
rule. 305 We believe, however, that permitting registrants to use statistical sampling could lead to a
reduction in compliance costs as compared with other methods of identifying the median
employee without significantly affecting the pay ratio because registrants are not required to
calculate the total compensation for each of their employees. Therefore, although the final rule
still requires registrants to collect and assemble employee compensation data, the availability of

statistical sampling may allow them to assemble far less employee compensation data than if the
final rule prohibited such sampling. We note that a number of other commenters indicated that
permitting statistical sampling would reduce costs. 306 Also, because of the reliability of the result
achieved through appropriately conducted statistical sampling, we do not believe the use of
sampling will limit the usefulness of the pay ratio for shareholders as a data point in making their
voting decisions on executive compensation under Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
The final rule does not provide specific parameters for statistical sampling, including the
appropriate sample size. We agree with commenters that specifying requirements for statistical
sampling, including appropriate sample sizes, confidence levels, or other requirements would
unduly constrain registrants from developing the most appropriate methodology. 307 Instead, we
believe registrants must make their own determinations on what is appropriate based on their own
facts and circumstances.
We are, however, providing some guidance for registrants when using statistical sampling.
In this regard, based on the analysis we described in the Proposing Release, we believe that a
relatively small sample size may be appropriate in certain situations. 308 A reasonable
determination of sample size ultimately depends on the underlying distribution of compensation
data. Further, we believe that reasonable estimates of the median for registrants with multiple
business lines or geographical units may be determined using more than one statistical sampling

In that analysis, we determined that the appropriate sample size for the registrants with a single business or

sample size close to 506.

approach. Additionally, all statistical sampling approaches should draw observations from each
business or geographical unit with a reasonable assumption on each unit’s compensation
distribution and infer the registrant’s overall median based on the observations drawn.
Moreover, as we noted in the Proposing Release, the identification of a median employee
does not necessarily require a determination of exact compensation amounts for every employee
included in the sample. For example, rather than calculating exact compensation, a registrant
could identify the employees in its sample that have extremely low or extremely high pay that
would, therefore, fall on either end of the compensation spectrum. Since identifying the median
involves finding the employee in the middle, it may not be necessary to determine the exact
compensation amounts for every employee paid more or less than that employee in the
middle. Instead, just noting that the employees are above or below the median may be sufficient
for finding the employee in the middle of the compensation spectrum.
(iii) Consistently Applied Compensation Measures
As proposed, the final rule permits registrants to use a consistently applied compensation
measure, such as information derived from tax and/or payroll records, in determining the
employees from which the median is identified as long as the registrant discloses the
compensation measure used. Due to concerns about expected compliance costs arising from the
complexity of using the “total compensation” calculation under Item 402(c)(2)(x) when
identifying the median, we sought a reasonable alternative to identifying the median employee
that is easier to calculate.
As we noted in the Proposing Release, this approach provides a workable identification of
the median employee for many registrants, and we expect it will reduce the costs of compliance.
Most commenters discussing this issue agreed with this position and supported permitting

119

registrants to use consistently applied compensation measures, such as information derived from
tax and/or payroll records, to identify the median employee because it would reduce costs while
not significantly affecting a registrant’s pay ratio. 309 As one commenter noted, while a
consistently applied compensation measure may exclude benefits, perquisites, and other
allowances, it will still capture salary, incentive cash earned, and stock awards, which will
encompass “the substantial majority of compensation and [should] not lead to distortion of the
median.” 310 In light of these comments, we do not believe this provision will hinder shareholders
in using the pay ratio as a potentially useful data point in making their voting decisions on
executive compensation under Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
One commenter asserted that the final rule should be flexible enough to permit a registrant
to use an internally consistent measure that is not necessarily internally identical. 311 According to
the commenter, the consistently applied compensation measure could be a measure based on the
registrant’s individual organizational structure that is reasonably designed to identify the median
employee. As an example, the commenter stated that if a registrant selects to use “taxable wages”
as the consistently applied compensation measure, it is possible that the measure may be defined
differently across multiple jurisdictions and be calculated over differing time periods. In such a
situation, the commenter suggested that, although the registrant should attempt to use the nonUnited States equivalent to a Form W-2 for purposes of conducting its analysis, the final rule
should provide sufficient flexibility to permit the use of other reasonable data sources for

collecting the comparable information relating to non-U.S. employees as long as such measures
are consistently applied within each subject jurisdiction.
We agree. We note that a consistently applied compensation measure, such as “taxable
wages” or “cash compensation,” 312 may be defined differently across jurisdictions and may
include different annual periods. For purposes of calculating the annual total compensation
amounts when using a consistently applied compensation measure, the final rule permits
registrants to use a measure that is defined differently across jurisdictions and may include
different annual periods as long as within each jurisdiction, the measure is consistently applied. A
registrant, however, would not be permitted to use an entirely different type of measure across
jurisdictions that would not be consistently applied. The final rule does not require registrants to
use any specific compensation measure when identifying the median employee. We continue to
believe that registrants are in the best position to select a compensation measure that is
appropriate to their own facts and circumstances. Therefore, consistent with the proposal, the
final rule permits registrants to identify a median employee based on any consistently applied
compensation measure, such as information derived from tax and/or payroll records, as long as
the registrant briefly discloses the measure that it used. After the median employee is identified,
registrants must calculate that median employee’s annual total compensation in accordance with
Item 402(c)(2)(x).
(iv) The “Median” Employee
Some commenters recommended that the final rule permit registrants to calculate the ratio
using a figure other than the median, such as the employee earnings estimates available through

312

See, e.g., letters from Corporate Secretaries and Davis Polk.

121

the BLS, 313 which may reduce costs for registrants and promote comparability across companies.
As we stated in the Proposing Release, although such an approach would greatly reduce the
compliance burden for registrants, we do not believe it is consistent with Section 953(b).
Consistent with the proposal, the final rule requires that registrants provide their pay ratio
disclosure using the compensation of their median employee. Section 953(b)(1)(A) states
specifically that registrants must disclose “the median of the annual total compensation of all
employees of the issuer, except the chief executive officer.” We believe, therefore, that Congress
intended that the final rule should require registrants to use their median employee in their pay
ratio determination.
Although we considered commenters’ arguments that “median,” as used in Section 953(b),
can be interpreted to mean a measure other than “median,” such as “average” or “mean,” we
believe the better reading of the statutory language is that it means the statistical median of all
employee compensation. “Median” has a specific meaning in statistics and probability theory, 314
and there is no reason to believe that, when Congress chose to use this term in Section 953(b), it
intended that it not have its established meaning. In the context of the disclosure required by
Section 953(b), the alternative measures suggested by commenters could produce a significantly
different number than the “median,” and we do not believe that would be appropriate in light of
the statutory language and our understanding of its purpose. Further, we believe the median may
provide a more useful or relevant data point for shareholders making their say-on-pay votes than
313

See, e.g., letters from Brian Foley & Co., NACD, and NIRI. Some commenters recommended that the final
rule permit registrants to use the average salary of its employees instead of the median. See, e.g., letters
from Hyster-Yale, and NACCO, which they suggest also may reduce costs for registrants and promote
comparability across companies. As with using the BLS data, however, we do not believe this approach is
consistent with Section 953(b).

314

The dictionary defines “median” as “the middle number in a sequence, or the average of the two middle
numbers when the sequence has an even number of numbers.” RANDOM HOUSE WEBSTER’S DICTIONARY,
411 (2d ed. 1996).

122

would a mathematical average because the use of median can decrease the significance of
outliers.
Similarly, we note that some commenters suggested that a registrant should be permitted
to use the compensation of a range of employees as the median compensation instead of the
compensation of the exact median employee. 315 We disagree. No matter what method a
registrant chooses to identify its median employee, it must identify an actual employee and
determine that employee’s annual total compensation to use in the pay ratio disclosure. We note,
however, that the final rule does not require a registrant to disclose any personally identifiable
information about that employee other than his or her compensation. A registrant may choose to
generally identify the employee’s position to put the employee’s compensation in context, but the
registrant is not required to provide this information and should not do so if providing the
information could identify any specific individual.
Another commenter recommended that a registrant, after identifying the median
employee, should be able to select another employee as the median if that employee is within a
1% variance of the median and the original employee has anomalous compensation characteristics
that would result in a pay ratio that did not accurately reflect the relationship between the
compensation practices for a typical employee and the compensation of the CEO. 316 Given the
significant flexibility that the rule provides registrants in identifying the median employee, we
believe it would be appropriate to substitute another substantially similarly situated employee in

See, e.g., letters from Capital Strategies, Hyster-Yale, Mercer I, NACCO, and NYC Bar.

316

See letter from PNC Financial Services (noting that if the median employee is chosen by a metric other than
total Item 402(c) compensation, when that median employee’s compensation is then calculated using Item
402(c), it is possible that such employee may have pay elements or be missing pay elements that would
make his or her compensation anomalous when compared with others at the same overall compensation
level, and providing some examples such as if the employee does not participate in certain benefit programs
that are reflected in Item 402(c) compensation but not in W-2 compensation).

123

these circumstances. Thus, when calculating the total compensation for that median employee in
accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x), if the registrant reasonably determines that there are
anomalous compensation characteristics of that employee’s compensation that would have a
significant higher or lower impact on the pay ratio, we will not object if the registrant substitutes
another employee with substantially similar compensation to the original median employee based
on the compensation measure used to select the median employee. The registrant must, however,
disclose this fact as part of its brief description of the methodology it used to identify the median
employee.
b. Calculating Annual Total Compensation
i. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule would define “total compensation” by reference to Item 402(c)(2)(x).
In the Proposing Release, we stated that, because of the complexity of the requirements of Item
402(c)(2)(x), registrants typically compile information required by Item 402(c) manually for the
named executive officers, which takes significant time and resources. Given the specificity of the
definition used in Section 953(b), the proposed rule incorporated the Item 402(c)(2)(x) definition
of “total compensation” for purposes of disclosing the median of the annual total compensation of
employees and the pay ratio. Because the total compensation calculation using Item 402(c)(2)(x)
would only be required for one additional employee (the median employee), we did not propose
to simplify the total compensation definition that is required to be used to disclose the median
employee compensation and the ratio.
Additionally, the proposed rule permitted the use of reasonable estimates in determining
any elements of total compensation of employees other than the PEO under Item 402(c)(2)(x).
For registrants using estimates, an instruction to the proposed rule would require them to disclose

124

and consistently apply any material estimate used to identify the median employee or to
determine that employee’s total compensation or any elements of total compensation, and to
clearly identify any estimates used. In using an estimate for annual total compensation (or for a
particular element of total compensation), a registrant would be required to have a reasonable
basis to conclude that the estimate approximates the actual amount of compensation under Item
402(c)(2)(x) (or for a particular element of compensation under Item 402(c)(2)(iv)-(ix)) awarded
to, earned by, or paid to the employee. We did not specify what a reasonable basis would entail
because we believed that would necessarily depend on the registrant’s particular facts and
circumstances.
Because the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) were promulgated to address executive
officer compensation, rather than compensation for all employees, we considered some
interpretive questions that registrants could face in applying the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x)
to employees who are not executive officers and proposed ways to address those questions.
Those included questions concerning: applying the definition of “total compensation” to an
employee who is not an executive officer and valuation issues for certain elements of total
compensation, including for non-U.S. employees.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
One commenter agreed with the Proposed Rule’s requirement that “total compensation”
be calculated using the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x). 317 Also, this commenter and a few
others stated specifically that they supported the proposed rule’s flexibility in permitting the use
of reasonable estimates to calculate the annual total compensation or any elements of total

317

See letter from COEC II.

125

compensation for employees other than the PEO. 318 One commenter indicated that it expected its
clients to use reasonable estimates for calculating total compensation. 319 Some commenters
requested additional guidance as to what estimates would be considered reasonable, 320 but other
commenters said that no additional guidance is required. 321
One commenter stated that it was “deeply troubled” that the proposed rule would require
registrants to calculate the median employee’s total compensation using Item 402(c)(2)(x)
because no registrant uses this measure to calculate a non-executive officer’s compensation. 322
According to the commenter, a significant difficulty with using Item 402(c)(2)(x) is the inclusion
of pension benefits because the actuarial value of pensions vacillate dramatically from year to
year, which would significantly impact total compensation. The commenter recommended
excluding pension value from the total compensation calculation. If the final rule does not
exclude pensions, the commenter suggested that government-related pensions for non-U.S.
employees should be excluded as they are for named executive officers under Item 402(c)(2)(x).
Other commenters also contended that the final rule should not require calculating total
compensation using Item 402(c)(2)(x) because certain compensation measures are excluded from
that item requirement, such as benefits, non-discriminatory plans, perquisites, and personal
benefits that aggregate less than $10,000, which would cause the median employee’s total
compensation to be understated. 323 Another commenter, while not necessarily advocating against
using Item 402(c)(2)(x) to calculate total compensation, noted that it would be difficult for

registrants to use that item requirement because it would require them to include as compensation
bonuses, stock compensation, pensions, and other benefits for the median employee that are
usually not factored into annual salary amounts in company records. 324
Some commenters suggested that the final rule prescribe a methodology for calculating
total compensation. 325 One commenter requested specifically that we include guidance about
excluding government-mandated pension plans. 326 Another commenter suggested that registrants
should be permitted (but not required) to include benefits, non-discriminatory plans, perquisites,
and personal benefits that aggregate less than $10,000 in total compensation because Item
402(c)(2)(x) merely permits and does not require exclusion of such items for executive officers. 327
Other commenters contended that the calculation of total compensation in the final rule should
include all compensation of a registrant’s PEO and median employee, such as benefits, perks,
bonuses, stock options, and other forms of compensation; 328 be limited to cash and stock-based
compensation; 329 or include only compensation on the W-2 Form of the PEO and median
employee. 330
One commenter recommended that total compensation either include the average change
in defined benefit pension values or exclude defined benefit pension values entirely. 331 Another
commenter indicated that total compensation should include welfare and retirement benefits

included to union members. 332 One commenter indicated that total compensation should be
calculated based upon the same method used when identifying the three most highly compensated
executive officers in accordance with Instruction 1 of Item 402(a)(3), which excludes the value of
the aggregate change in actuarial present value of defined pension benefits under Item
402(c)(2)(viii). 333
Finally, one commenter suggested that, if the final rule allows registrants to identify the
median employee only every three years, registrants should similarly be allowed to calculate total
compensation either every year or only when a new median is determined unless there has been a
material change in annual total compensation. 334
iii. Final Rule
The definition of “total compensation” in the final rule is unchanged from the proposal.
The final rule requires that “total compensation” for both the median employee and PEO be
calculated using the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x). As with the proposed rule, the final rule
provides registrants with flexibility in identifying the median employee, and does not require
registrants to identify the median employee by calculating the total compensation for each
employee. Because the total compensation calculation using Item 402(c)(2)(x) is only required
for one additional employee (the median employee), we do not believe it necessary in the final
rule to simplify the total compensation definition that is required to be used in that calculation.
The final rule permits registrants to use reasonable estimates in calculating the annual total
compensation of their median employee, including any elements of the total compensation, under

332

See letter from Vectren Corp.

333

See letter from SH&P.

334

See letter from ABA.

128

Item 402(c)(2)(x). A few commenters supported such flexibility. 335 We believe, as we noted in
the Proposing Release, that the use of reasonable estimates does not diminish the potential
usefulness of the pay ratio disclosure, is consistent with Section 953(b), and will result in lower
compliance costs on registrants.
Under the final rule, registrants must clearly identify any estimates used. Additionally,
registrants must have a reasonable basis to conclude that their estimates approximate the actual
amounts of Item 402(c)(2)(x) compensation, or a particular element of compensation under Item
402(c)(2)(iv)-(ix), that are awarded to, earned by, or paid to the median employee. Some
commenters requested that we provide additional guidance as to what estimates would be
considered reasonable. 336 Consistent with the Proposing Release, we are not prescribing what a
reasonable basis would entail in the final rule because we believe that will necessarily depend on
the registrant’s particular facts and circumstances.
As we discussed in the Proposing Release, our rules for compensation disclosure focus on
the compensation of executive officers and directors rather than compensation for all employees.
Some commenters urged us not to require registrants to calculate total compensation using Item
402(c)(2)(x). 337 We believe, however, that it is appropriate to require “total compensation” to be
calculated using Item 402(c)(2)(x) for both the median employee and PEO. Using different
measures of total compensation for the median employee and the PEO would be inconsistent with
the statutory language and alter the pay ratio. Due to the concerns about calculating median
employee compensation using requirements meant only for executive offices, however, we are

129

reiterating the discussion that we included in the Proposing Release to help registrants understand
our views on how the final rule should be applied.
In calculating the annual total compensation of employees in accordance with Item
402(c)(2)(x), applicable references to “named executive officer” in Item 402 and the related
instructions are deemed in the final rule to refer instead to “employee,” as proposed. Also, the
final rule clarifies that, for non-salaried employees, references to “base salary” and “salary” in
Item 402 are deemed to refer instead, as applicable, to “wages plus overtime.” We are adopting
this provision to help registrants calculate the total compensation for a median employee that
happens to be non-salaried.
Additionally, registrants may use reasonable estimates, as described above, in determining
an amount that reasonably approximates the aggregate change in actuarial present value of an
employee’s defined pension benefit for purposes of Item 402(c)(2)(viii), as we stated in the
Proposing Release. For example, in the case of pension benefits provided to union members in
connection with a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan, the participating employers
typically do not have access to information (or may not have access in the timeframe needed to
compile pay ratio disclosure) from the plan administrator that would be needed to calculate the
aggregate change in actuarial present value of the accumulated benefit of a particular individual
under the plan. 338 In such circumstances, we believe it would be appropriate for a registrant to
use reasonable estimates in determining an amount that reasonably approximates the aggregate

338

Section 101(k) and related regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended [21 U.S.C. 1021(k)], govern the requirements for plan administrators to provide actuarial reports
relating to the plan. Under the rules, a plan administrator has thirty days to respond to a request for an
actuarial report, and it is not required to provide access to any reports that have not been its possession for
more than thirty days. In addition, the rules prohibit the disclosure of reports that include information that
the plan administrator reasonably determines to be personally identifiable information regarding a plan
participant, beneficiary or contributing employer. See 29 CFR 2520.101-6.

130

change in actuarial present value of an employee’s defined pension benefit for purposes of Item
402(c)(2)(viii).
The instructions to Item 402(c)(2)(ix) permit the exclusion of personal benefits as long as
the total value for the employee is less than $10,000, based on the basis of the aggregate
incremental cost to the registrant. 339 In calculating any such amounts for purposes of calculating
the annual total compensation of employees other than the PEO, a registrant may use reasonable
estimates in the manner described above, as proposed. In light of concerns about the difficulty
and complexity in the valuation of government-mandated pension plans, we acknowledged in the
proposing release that some registrants might need clarity as to how to treat governmentmandated pension plans for purposes of calculating an employee’s total compensation and,
specifically, for purposes of determining the aggregate change in actuarial present value of
defined pension benefits under Item 402(c)(2)(viii). Item 402(c)(2)(viii) applies to a defined
benefit plan, which, as explained in the 2006 Adopting Release, is a retirement plan in which the
company pays the executive specified amounts at retirement that are not tied to the investment
performance of the contributions that fund the plan. 340 In contrast, under many governmentmandated pension plans, the employee ultimately receives the pension benefit payment from the
government, not the employer, and the purpose of the mandated pension benefit is not to provide
compensation to the employee for services performed for the employer. 341 Notwithstanding any

339

See Instruction 4 to Item 402(c)(2)(ix). This instruction would apply to perquisites and personal benefits.
Accordingly, perquisites provided to executive officers who are included in the identification of the median
would be treated as set forth in Instruction 4. For this purpose, however, benefits that were provided to all
employees or all salaried employees would not have been considered “perquisites.”

340

See 2006 Adopting Release at 53175. This definition serves to distinguish defined benefit pension plans
from defined contribution plans, in which the amount payable at retirement is tied to the performance of the
contributions that fund the plan.

341

Although Item 402(a)(2) includes compensation transactions between a registrant and a third party where the
purpose of the transaction is to furnish compensation to the employee, we generally would not consider a

131

amounts that an employer may be obligated to pay (typically as a tax) to the government in
respect of an employee or amounts the employee may be obligated to have withheld from wages
and paid to the government, where a pension benefit is being provided to the employee from the
government and not by the registrant, a government-mandated defined benefit pension plan
should not be considered a “defined benefit plan” for purposes of Item 402(c)(2)(viii) and any
accrued pension benefit under such a plan should not be considered compensation for purposes of
Item 402(c)(2)(x).
Some commenters expressed concern over including pension benefits in calculating total
compensation. 342 One commenter indicated that it would be difficult to use Item 402(c)(2)(x) in
calculating “total compensation” due to the inclusion of pension benefits because the actuarial
value of pensions vacillate dramatically from year to year, which could significantly impact total
compensation. 343 Another commenter requested specifically that we include guidance about
excluding government-mandated pension plans. 344 In response to these comments, we are
clarifying that, in calculating “total compensation,” registrants may exclude government-related
pension benefits for non-U.S. employees, just as Social Security benefits are excluded under
“total compensation” for U.S. employees. Ultimately, as to both concerns, we believe that the
ability to use reasonable estimates should help with calculating total compensation for the median
employee who has pension benefits.
We acknowledge that the application of the definition of total compensation under Item
402(c)(2)(x) to employees who are not executive officers could understate the overall
government-mandated pension plan to be such a transaction.

compensation paid to such employees. Item 402 captures all of the various compensation
components received by a named executive officer, excluding certain limited items like benefits
under non-discriminatory plans and perquisites and personal benefits that aggregate less than
$10,000. By excluding certain benefit plans and perquisites that do not exceed the $10,000
threshold, however, the rules may understate the median employee’s actual total compensation.
To address this, the final rule permits registrants, at their discretion, to include personal benefits
that aggregate less than $10,000 and compensation under non-discriminatory benefit plans in
calculating the annual total compensation of the median employee. To be consistent, however,
the PEO’s total compensation used in the related pay ratio disclosure must also reflect the same
approach to these items used for the median employee. The registrant must also explain any
difference between the PEO total compensation used in the pay ratio disclosure and the total
compensation amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table, if material.
One commenter suggested that, if the final rule allows registrants to identify the median
employee only every three years, registrants should similarly be required to calculate total
compensation only when a new median is determined or when there is a material change to the
annual total compensation figure. 345 The final rule allows registrants to identify the median
employee every three years, but requires total compensation for that employee to be calculated
each year. The primary reason for our decision to permit registrants to calculate the median
employee every three years is to reduce the costs and burdens to registrants. Based on the
comments we received, we understand that much of the cost associated with the proposed rule
arises from the task of identifying the median employee. 346 Several commenters stated that
345

See letter from ABA.

346

One commenter stated explicitly that the primary cost associated with the proposed rule would be in
identifying the median employee. See letter from McGuireWoods.

133

navigating a registrant’s payroll systems and creating a single database of all of its employees’
compensation, especially non-U.S. employees’ compensation, would be the most costly aspect of
the proposed rule. 347 Other activities mentioned by commenters that would contribute to the costs
of the proposed rule included data privacy compliance, foreign exchange calculations, data
testing, establishing corporate guidelines, obtaining legal services, auditing results, public
relations tasks, and litigation risk. 348 Many of these activities also must be undertaken in
identifying the median employee. Once the median employee has been identified, however, it
does not appear that calculating the annual total compensation of that one additional employee is
a source of significant additional cost. Additionally, since the PEO’s compensation will be
updated annually, we believe that it is appropriate to have a consistent reflection of that year’s
compensation both for the PEO and the median employee. Therefore, the final rule requires
registrants to calculate the median employee’s annual total compensation every year.
Finally, Section 953(b)(2) states that “total compensation” shall be determined in
accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) “as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this
Act.” One commenter suggested that this statement does not preclude any amendment of
Regulation S-K subsequent to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act that would alter the definition
of “total compensation” in Item 402 in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the
Act. 349 In the Proposing Release, we noted that Section 953(b) refers to Item 402(c)(2)(x) in
effect on the day before enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, or July 20, 2010. We also indicated
that, because no substantive amendments have been made to Item 402(c) since that date, the

proposed rule would refer to Item 402(c)(2)(x) without reference to the rules in effect on July 20,
2010. We further stated that we expect to address the impact on the proposed rule of any future
amendments to Item 402(c)(2)(x) if and when such future amendments are considered. No
substantive amendments have been made to Item 402(c) since July 20, 2010. We continue,
therefore, to take the approach articulated in the Proposing Release on this issue.
3. Disclosure of Methodology, Assumptions, and Estimates
a. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule required registrants to briefly describe and consistently apply any
methodology used to identify the median and any material assumptions, adjustments, or estimates
used to identify the median or to determine total compensation or any elements of total
compensation. The proposed rule also provided that, if a registrant changes methodology,
material assumptions, adjustments, or estimates from those used in its pay ratio disclosure for the
prior fiscal year, and if the effects of any such change are material, the registrant must briefly
describe the change and the reasons for the change, and provide an estimate of the impact of the
change on the median and the ratio. The proposed rule would not require registrants to provide
technical analyses or formulas (such as statistical formulas, confidence levels or the steps used in
data analysis).
b. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Many commenters indicated that the rule should require registrants to provide narrative
information about the methodology and material assumptions, adjustments, or estimates they used

commenters asserted that the rule should not require registrants to provide narrative
information. 351 One of these commenters recommended also that we clarify the nature of the
information that we expect registrants to disclose without imposing restrictions on methodologies;
state expressly that disclosure is only required if a registrant used material assumptions,
adjustments, or estimates; and state that no negative statement is required if a registrant did not
use material assumptions, adjustments, or estimates. 352
One commenter expressed concern that the disclosure would not be brief because of the
registrant’s need to use many estimates and assumptions for the median, especially for non-U.S.
employees. 353 Another commenter cited survey data in which 66% of respondents anticipated
that they would feel compelled to provide more than a brief narrative to explain how they
determined the pay ratio. 354 Some commenters did not support requiring any additional narrative
disclosure beyond what was already in the proposed rule. 355 Some of these commenters, as well
as a large number of other commenters, asserted that the final rule should permit registrants to
provide additional narrative disclosures if they chose to do so. 356

changes to their assumptions, adjustments, or estimates from previous years, as proposed. 357 One
commenter suggested that the final rule allow a good-faith compliance period of two years in
which a registrant can change its initial methodology without having to specifically explain and
quantify the change. 358
Finally, a few commenters requested that the final rule require some additional metrics,
such as upper and lower quartiles, mean, and standard deviation, 359 and one commenter suggested
that companies voluntarily disclose both the ratio between average employee pay and average
executive pay and the ratio of pay between the top and bottom 10% of earners within the
company. 360 Other commenters, however, stated specifically that the final rule should not require
the disclosure of any additional metrics. 361
c. Final Rule
The final rule, consistent with the proposal, requires registrants to briefly describe and
consistently apply any methodology used to identify the median and any material assumptions,
adjustments (including any cost-of-living adjustments), or estimates used to identify the median
or to determine total compensation or any elements of total compensation. The final rule also
requires a registrant to clearly identify any estimates used. For example, when statistical
sampling is used, registrants must describe the size of both the sample and the estimated whole
population, any material assumptions used in determining the sample size and the sampling
method (or methods) is used. Additionally, although the required descriptions must provide

sufficient information for readers to evaluate the appropriateness of the methodologies used,
registrants are not required to include any technical analyses, formulas, confidence levels, or the
steps used in data analysis. 362 Although one commenter suggested that the final rule allow a
good-faith compliance period of two years in which an issuer may change its initial methodology
without having to specifically explain and quantify the change, 363 the final rule requires
registrants to disclose any change in methodology, significant assumption, adjustment, or estimate
from the prior year if the effects of any such change are significant. Registrants must also
disclose if they changed from using the cost-of-living adjustment to not using that adjustment and
if they changed from not using the cost-of-living adjustment to using it. We believe that it is
important for shareholders to understand changes to a registrant’s methodology so that they may
make informed voting decisions on executive compensation under Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank
Act.
We believe that requiring registrants to include the brief overview will make it easier for
shareholders to understand the pay ratio disclosure for that company and better evaluate its utility
in assessing the compensation and accountability of a registrant’s executives, including in making
their voting decisions on executive compensation under Section 951. We do not believe that
requiring registrants to provide additional metrics, such as a more detailed or technical analysis
will help shareholders in this manner. We note that other of our rules require similar disclosures,
particularly where registrants are given the flexibility to choose a methodology, such as the
valuation method for determining the present value of accrued pension benefits in Item 402(h)(2)

362

A registrant, however, must include the measure used as the basis for any cost-of-living adjustments when
briefly describing the cost-of-living adjustments it used to identify the median employee and calculate the
median employee’s annual total compensation.

or the description of models, assumptions, and parameters in Item 305 of Regulation S-K
(quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk). Several commenters agreed that the
rule should require registrants to provide this narrative description, as proposed, and no additional
information. 364 Further, a number of these commenters indicated that the final rule should clarify
that the narrative should be brief. 365 Consistent with these comments, the final rule specifically
states that registrants must “briefly” describe this information.
We note that some commenters contended that the final rule should require additional
metrics, 366 whereas other commenters stated specifically that the final rule should not require the
disclosure of any additional metrics. 367 As we discussed in the Proposing Release, we are
sensitive to the costs of the mandated disclosure, and we believe that narrative disclosure in
addition to what is already required about the ratio would not, for many registrants, provide useful
information for shareholders. For example, disclosures about employment policies, use of parttime employees, use of seasonal employee workers, and outsourcing and off-shoring strategies are
not required under the final rule. The final rule does, however, allow registrants the flexibility to
provide those additional disclosures that they believe will assist shareholders’ understanding of
the meaning of the pay ratio disclosure for their particular circumstances. We believe this
approach is preferable to imposing a requirement on all registrants to provide additional metrics
that may not be useful in many cases.

4. Meaning of “Annual”
a. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule would define “annual total compensation” to mean total compensation
for the last completed fiscal year, consistent with the time period used for the other Item 402
disclosure requirements. This provision was intended to address concerns about the need to
update the pay ratio disclosure throughout the year and to make clear that the disclosure does not
need to be updated more than once a year. Although we considered other “annual” periods that
may have reduced compliance costs for registrants by giving them the ability to use information
in the form that it is currently compiled for other purposes, we believed it was appropriate for the
time period for the pay ratio disclosure to be the same as the time period used for the PEO’s
compensation. Registrants, therefore, would be required to calculate the total compensation for
the median employee for their last completed fiscal year.
For purposes of identifying the median employee, however, we proposed allowing
registrants to use compensation amounts derived from the information derived from tax and/or
payroll records for the annual period used in those records. We believed that permitting
companies to identify the median employee using compensation information in the form that it is
maintained in their own books and records would reduce compliance costs. Registrants using the
information derived from tax and/or payroll records to identify the median employee would still
be required to calculate the Item 402(c)(2)(x) total compensation for that median employee for the
last completed fiscal year, rather than the annual period used in the payroll and/or tax records.
b. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Some commenters agreed that the final rule should require the pay ratio to be calculated

140

for the last completed fiscal year, as proposed, rather than some other annual period. 368 Other
commenters, however, contended that the final rule should provide another annual period. Some
of these commenters recommended that the final rule permit registrants to use the year prior to the
registrant’s last completed fiscal year for identifying the median employee, annual total
compensation, or both to give the registrants more time to identify the median employee and
calculate his or her total compensation. 369 Using the employee population from the year before,
one commenter stated, would not have a material impact on the ratio and the added value of more
contemporaneous information would likely be negligible. 370 Another commenter suggested using
this time period for registrants with non-U.S. employees. 371
Some commenters urged us to adopt a final rule that permitted use of the time periods
used for payroll and/or tax records when calculating compensation to identify the median
employee and the pay ratio for that employee. 372 These commenters indicated that the periods
could be different across jurisdictions. In this regard, another commenter noted that there is no
need to have exact overlap of the time periods because the pay ratio “won’t change all that
much.” 373
Other commenters asserted that registrants should be given flexibility to choose any
annual period in identifying the median employee and/or that employee’s total compensation. 374
One of these commenters stated, however, that the annual period must substantially relate to the

fiscal year for which the pay ratio disclosure is being provided, regardless of whether the last day
of such annual period falls before or after the end of the registrant’s fiscal year for the purposes of
identifying the median employee. 375 As an example, this commenter stated that, if the registrant
has a fiscal year ending on November 30, the registrant should be permitted to identify the median
employee based on a compensation measure calculated from January 1 through December 31 of
that year, as long as such records substantially relate to the fiscal year for which pay ratio
disclosure is being provided.
c. Final Rule
The final rule defines “annual total compensation” to mean “total compensation” for the
registrant’s last completed fiscal year, as proposed. Although there were other “annual” periods
suggested by commenters, such as the year prior to the registrant’s last completed fiscal year 376 or
the time periods used for the information derived from tax and/or payroll records, 377 we believe
the registrant’s last completed fiscal year is more appropriate. Using the registrant’s last
completed fiscal year is consistent with the time period used for the other Item 402 disclosure
requirements. Registrants are required, therefore, to disclose the “total compensation,” using Item
402(c)(2)(x), for their median employee and PEO based on the compensation they provided for
these individuals in the last completed fiscal year. We believe that making the time period for the
pay ratio disclosure consistent with other Item 402 disclosures will better enable shareholders to
use it in conjunction with the other Item 402 disclosures to assess the compensation and
accountability of a registrant’s executives. For this same reason, we are not permitting registrants
to select any annual period or the year prior to the last completed fiscal year to calculate total

142

compensation.
As discussed above, registrants may use compensation amounts derived from the
information derived from their tax and/or payroll records for the same annual period used in those
records to identify their median employee because we believe this reduces compliance costs.
Registrants using the information derived from tax and/or payroll records to identify the median
employee are still required to calculate the Item 402(c)(2)(x) total compensation for that median
employee for the registrant’s last completed fiscal year, rather than the annual period used in the
payroll and/or tax records because identifying the median is a separate process from calculating
total compensation.
5. “Filed” not “Furnished”
a. Proposed Rule
Under the proposal, the pay ratio disclosure would be considered “filed” for purposes of
the Securities Act and Exchange Act, which is the same as for other Item 402 information.
b. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Only one commenter stated explicitly that the pay ratio disclosure should be “filed,” as
proposed. 378 This commenter agreed that the information should be filed because Section 953(b)
refers to “filings.” Further, the commenter stressed that any concerns registrants may have about
the pay ratio information being “filed” are mitigated by the proposed rule’s flexibility.
Commenters that opposed the proposed rule generally indicated that the pay ratio
disclosure should be “furnished” rather than “filed.” 379 The commenters contending that the pay

ratio information should be “furnished” argued that, in making the calculations for identifying the
median employee and total compensation, registrants will have to review a large amount of data
and make a significant number of estimates, assumptions, and judgment calls, which will
necessarily lead to imprecision. 380 Some noted that this imprecision will subject a registrant to
potential liability and litigation, 381 make it difficult to validate the information sufficiently for
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 382 certification purposes, 383 and/or not permit the information to be audited
(or greatly increase the costs of the audits). 384
Some commenters asserted that use of the word “filing” in Section 953(b) does not
demonstrate a Congressional desire that the disclosure be “filed” rather than “furnished.” Some
of these commenters pointed out that the statutory language refers to information to be included in
“filings” rather than requiring the information to be “filed.” 385 Also, the commenters noted that
there is some information in our “filings” that is “furnished,” such as Items 2.02 and 7.01 of Form
8-K, the glossy annual reports to shareholders, the audit committee reports (Item 407(d)), the
stock performance graphs (Item 2.01(e)), the compensation committee reports (Item 407(e)(5)),
and that executive compensation information in “filings” was “furnished” until 2006. 386
One commenter recommended that, in the event that the pay ratio disclosure must be
“filed,” we consider providing a “safe harbor” excluding the disclosure from the portion of a

registrant’s filings that must be certified pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 and
are also subject to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 387 Additionally, another
commenter recommended that, at least initially, we make the pay ratio disclosure an addendum to
documents required under Regulation S-K and have that addendum deemed “furnished.” 388 This
commenter indicated that this approach could minimize some of the rule’s costs and burdens.
c. Final Rule
The final rule treats the pay ratio disclosure, as with other Item 402 information, as “filed”
for purposes of the Securities Act and Exchange Act, and, therefore, subject to potential liabilities
under those statutes, including Exchange Act Section 18 liability. 389 Information required to be
disclosed by registrants pursuant to the federal securities laws generally is filed with us and
subject to the liabilities thereunder, unless a specific exception applies. Although we recognize
that identifying the median employee and calculating total compensation may require registrants
to review a large amount of data and make a significant number of estimates, assumptions, and
judgment calls, we do not believe this fact alone justifies exempting this information from being
“filed.” Many of the disclosures required by our rules require complex calculations and
estimates. Moreover, the fact that registrants will be required to provide disclosure about how
they have arrived at their pay ratio calculations, and in particular the required disclosure about the
assumptions and methodologies underlying the calculations, will permit registrants to clearly
explain to shareholders where potential imprecisions may be introduced into the reported statistic.
We also note that all other Item 402 information is considered “filed” rather than “furnished” and
that the disclosure called for by Item 402(u)—information pertaining to the registrant’s operations
387

15 U.S.C. 78r.

145

and workforce composition—differs from the types of information we typically permit to be
“furnished” rather than “filed.” 390 For similar reasons, we do not believe these disclosures should
be exempted from the certification requirements of Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 or
Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or be provided as an addendum to filings
referenced in Regulation S-K.
In addition, we note that Section 18 of the Exchange Act does not create strict liability for
“filed” information. Rather, it states that a person shall not be liable for misleading statements in
a filed document if it can establish that it acted in good faith and had no knowledge that the
statement was false or misleading. 391 A plaintiff asserting a claim under Section 18 would need
to meet the elements of the statute to establish a claim, including purchasing or selling a security
at a price that was affected by the false or misleading statement in reliance on the misstatement,
and damages caused by that reliance. Finally, regardless of whether the information is “filed” or
“furnished,” registrants that fail to comply with the final rule could also be violating Exchange
Act Sections 13(a) and 15(d), as applicable, and would also be subject to potential liability under

390

Some examples of information that are “furnished” include: the Results of Operations and Financial
Condition information (Item 2.02 of Form 8-K); Regulation FD disclosures (Item 7.01 of Form 8-K); the
Stock Performance Graph (Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K); the Audit Committee Report (Item 407(d) of
Regulation S-K); the Compensation Committee Report (Item 407(e)(5) of Regulation S-K); and the annual
reports to shareholders (Rules 14a-3(b) and 14c-3(a) under the Exchange Act and General Instruction G(2)
to Form 10-K).

391

Exchange Act Section 18(a) provides that any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in
any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this title or any rule or regulation thereunder or any
undertaking contained in a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 15 of this title,
which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement
was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement shall have purchased or sold a security at a
price which was affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued
shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A
person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In any such suit the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against either party litigant.

146

Exchange Act Section 10(b) 392 and Rule 10b-5, 393 promulgated thereunder, for any false or
misleading material statements in the information disclosed pursuant to the rule.
6. Timing of Disclosure
a. Updating Pay Ratio Disclosure for the Last Completed Fiscal Year
i. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule would not have required the pay ratio for the registrant’s last completed
fiscal year to be disclosed until the filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for that fiscal year or,
if later, the filing of a definitive proxy or information statement relating to its next annual meeting
of shareholders (or written consents in lieu of such a meeting) following the end of such fiscal
year. The proposed rule would require pay ratio information to be filed, in any event, not later
than 120 days after the end of such fiscal year as provided in General Instruction G(3) of Form
10-K. Also, in any filing a registrant made after the end of its last completed fiscal year and
before the filing of such Form 10-K or proxy or information statement, as applicable, a registrant
that was subject to the proposed rule for the fiscal year prior to the last completed fiscal year
would be permitted to include or incorporate by reference the pay ratio disclosure information for
that prior fiscal year. We proposed this provision because, as discussed above, the proposed rule
would require annual total compensation amounts used in the ratio to be calculated for the
registrant’s last completed fiscal year. In addition, pay ratio disclosure would be required in any
filing by the registrant that required Item 402 disclosure.
Although the annual update of the pay ratio was not required to be disclosed until the
filing of an annual report for the last completed fiscal year, or if later, the filing of a definitive

392

393

147

proxy statement or information statement relating to the registrant’s annual meeting of
shareholders, this provision would not have altered the requirements for Item 402 disclosure
under Item 8 of Schedule 14A in other proxy or information statement filings.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Some commenters generally agreed with the proposed rule’s requirement that the pay ratio
disclosure be updated no earlier than the filing of a registrant’s annual report on Form 10-K or, if
later, the filing of a proxy or information statement for the registrant’s annual meeting of
shareholders (or written consents in lieu of such a meeting), and in any event no later than 120
days after the end of its fiscal year. 394 One of these commenters agreed with the proposal that all
registrants, should be allowed to file their pay ratio disclosure no later than 120 days after fiscal
year end by either an amended Form 10-K or Form 8-K because permitting the later filing would
allow registrants not subject to the proxy rules to have the same amount of time to file their pay
ratio disclosure as filers that are subject to the proxy rules. 395 One commenter indicated that,
although timing of the disclosure is “not important,” the information should be required in the
registrant’s annual report on Form 10-K and permitted in other filings. 396 Another commenter
contended that the information should at least be available in a registrant’s proxy statement for the
annual meeting so that shareholders may use the information for voting. 397
One commenter stated that it would not object to the proposed delay because it would not
diminish the usefulness of the disclosure to investors. 398 The commenter, however, noted that the

148

proposed delay still might not provide registrants enough time after the end of the fiscal year for
all registrants to calculate and disclose the pay ratio in their annual proxy statement. Therefore,
the commenter stated that it “generally would not object to the rules providing for some additional
accommodation to the extent that it does not significantly diminish the usefulness of the
disclosure to investors.” 399
Other commenters disagreed with the proposed rule’s requirement that registrants disclose
their pay ratio information on Form 10-K, the proxy or information statement, or 120 days after
the end of its fiscal year. Mainly, these commenters believed the requirement would not provide
sufficient time for registrants to identify the median employee, calculate total compensation and
the pay ratio, and file their information. 400 Most of these commenters recommended that the final
rule permit disclosure on Form 8-K at some other time of the year, including when the
information is able to be calculated, 401 “within some extended period (such as 180 days after
fiscal year end, as is the case for Form 11-Ks and other reports),” 402 any time during the first five
months after fiscal year-end, 403 before the end of the registrant’s second quarter, 404 and 14 days
before the annual meeting of shareholders. 405
iii. Final Rule
The final rule does not require registrants to provide the pay ratio disclosure information
for the registrant’s last completed fiscal year until it files its annual report on Form 10-K for that

year or, if later, it files the definitive proxy or information statement relating to its next annual
meeting of shareholders (or written consents in lieu of such a meeting). In any event, the final
rule requires registrants to file their pay ratio information not later than 120 days after the end of
such fiscal year in a manner similar to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K. 406 This
requirement is consistent with the proposal. Also, consistent with the proposed rule, a registration
statement that incorporates by reference a Form 10-K (or amended Form 10-K) containing all Part
III information other than updated pay ratio information could be declared effective before the
registrant’s definitive proxy or information statement containing updated pay ratio information is
filed in accordance with General Instruction G(3).
Additionally, although the annual update is not required to be disclosed until the filing of
an annual report for the last completed fiscal year, or if later, the filing of a definitive proxy
statement or information statement relating to the registrant’s annual meeting of shareholders, as
discussed in the Proposing Release, this provision does not alter the requirements for Item 402
disclosure under Item 8 of Schedule 14A in other proxy or information statement filings. For
example, if a registrant filed a proxy statement (other than the definitive proxy statement for its
annual meeting) that required Item 402 information pursuant to Item 8 of Schedule 14A, the
registrant would be required to include or incorporate by reference pay ratio disclosure for the
most recent period that had been filed in its Form 10-K or definitive proxy statement for its
annual meeting.

406

General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K permits registrants to incorporate by reference Part III of its Form
10-K, which includes the Item 402 information, from their definitive proxy or information statements filed
in connection with the registrant’s annual meeting if such definitive proxy or information statements are
filed within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by the Form 10-K. If a definitive proxy or
information statement is not filed within this 120-day period, Items comprising the Part III information must
be filed as part of the Form 10-K, or as an amendment to the Form l0-K, not later than the end of the 120day period.

150

We continue to believe this provision is appropriate for the reasons discussed in the
Proposing Release. Without it, a registrant would be required to include its pay ratio disclosure in
a filing (such as a registration statement) filed after the end of the prior fiscal year, but before it
was able to compile its executive compensation information for that fiscal year, which is usually
included in a registrant’s proxy statement relating to its annual meeting of shareholders following
the end of the fiscal year, which could raise additional incremental costs for registrants that elect
to provide executive compensation disclosure in their annual proxy statement rather than their
annual report and for registrants that are conducting registered offerings at the beginning of their
fiscal year.
We note that a number of commenters agreed with our approach. In response to other
comments stating that our approach will not provide registrants sufficient time to identify the
median employee, calculate total compensation and the pay ratio, and file their information, we
note that the final rule retains the significant flexibility afforded to registrants in the proposal and
includes several additional accommodations intended to reduce the burdens of producing the
required disclosure. We believe these provisions will make it feasible for registrants to file their
pay ratio disclosure within the timeframes set forth in the final rule. We do not believe it would
be appropriate to extend the deadline by which the pay ratio disclosure should be updated in light
of its relevance to shareholders in making their voting decisions under Section 951 of the DoddFrank Act. If registrants were not required to provide the pay ratio disclosure when they file their
annual report on Form 10-K or, if later, the definitive proxy or information statement for their
next annual meeting of shareholders (or written consent in lieu of such a meeting), this could
result in the disclosure not being presented together with other relevant executive compensation
information to which it relates and not being available to inform shareholders as they exercise

151

their say-on-pay voting rights, which we understand to be the disclosure’s primary purpose. For
all of these reasons, we believe the timing requirements in the final rule are reasonable and
appropriate.
b. Omitting Salary or Bonus Information for the PEO in Reliance on Instruction 1 to
Item 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv), and Technical Amendment to Item 5.02(f) of Form 8-K
i. Proposed Rule
In cases where a registrant is relying on Instruction 1 to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of
Regulation S-K to omit salary or bonus of the PEO that is not calculable until a later date, the
proposed rule would permit registrants to omit pay ratio disclosure until those elements of the
PEO’s total compensation are determined. The proposed rule would also have required
registrants relying on that instruction to provide their pay ratio disclosure in the same Form 8-K
filing in which the PEO’s salary or bonus is disclosed. We proposed a conforming amendment to
Item 5.02(f) of Form 8-K to reflect the addition of this pay ratio disclosure requirement.
Although a filing is triggered under Item 5.02(f) when the omitted salary or bonus becomes
calculable in whole or in part, under the proposed amendment to Form 8-K, the pay ratio
information would be required only when the salary or bonus became calculable in whole, which
would avoid the need for multiple updates to the pay ratio disclosure until the final total
compensation amount for the PEO is known.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
Only a few commenters discussed this proposed instruction and they generally agreed
with the proposed rule. 407 One commenter contended that, if the registrant is relying on
Instruction 1 to Item 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv), the final rule should require neither an estimate of

407

See, e.g., letters from ABA, Capital Strategies, and CII.

152

compensation nor additional supplemental disclosure prior to the Item 5.02 8-K because it would
further dilute the utility of the pay ratio information for shareholders. 408 One commenter
suggested that delaying the pay ratio information under Instruction 1 to Item 402(c)(2)(iii) and
(iv) would diminish the information’s usefulness, but did not object to the proposed instruction
because it would only affect a small number of registrants. 409
iii. Final Rule
As proposed, the final rule permits registrants to omit pay ratio disclosure until the salary
or bonus of their PEO’s total compensation is determined in cases in which the registrant is
relying on Instruction 1 to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of Regulation S-K 410 to omit the salary or
bonus of the PEO that is not calculable until a later date. Commenters on this provision generally
agreed with our approach. The final rule also includes a conforming amendment to Item 5.02(f)
of Form 8-K to reflect the addition of this pay ratio disclosure requirement. However, although a
filing is triggered under Item 5.02(f) when the PEO’s omitted salary or bonus becomes calculable
in whole or in part, under the conforming amendment to Form 8-K, the pay ratio information is
required only when the salary or bonus become calculable in whole, which avoids the need for
multiple updates to the pay ratio disclosure until the final total compensation amount for the PEO
is known.
The final rule includes an instruction that provides that a registrant relying on Instruction 1
408

See letter from ABA.

409

See letter from CII.

410

Instruction 1 to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of Regulation S-K, under our existing executive compensation
disclosure rules, permits registrants to omit disclosure in the Summary Compensation Table of the salary or
bonus of a named executive officer if it is not calculable as of the latest practicable date. In that
circumstance, the registrant must include a footnote disclosing that fact and providing the date that the
amount is expected to be determined, and the amount must be disclosed at that time by filing a Form 8-K.
Item 5.02(f) of Form 8-K sets forth the requirements for the filing of information that was omitted from Item
402 disclosure in accordance with Instruction 1 to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv), including the requirement to
include a new total compensation figure for the named executive officer.

153

to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) with respect to the salary or bonus of the PEO would be required
to disclose that the pay ratio disclosure is not calculable until the PEO salary or bonus, as
applicable, is determined and disclose the date that the PEO’s actual total compensation is
expected to be determined. The instruction also requires the registrant to include its pay ratio
disclosure in the filing on Form 8-K that includes the omitted salary or bonus information as
contemplated by Instruction 1 to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv).
We believe, as stated in the Proposing Release, that the potential benefits of the complete
and up-to-date pay ratio disclosure could be diminished if the pay ratio were to be calculated
using less than the entire amount of the PEO’s total compensation for the period and that these
potential benefits could justify the potential costs to shareholders of a delay in the timing of the
disclosure. For example, in some cases, the amount of compensation that is omitted under
Instruction 1 to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) could be significant, and, therefore, the pay ratio
would be lower if presented using that incomplete compensation amount. Similarly, we believe
that the potential benefits of the complete and up-to-date pay ratio disclosure could be diminished
if the registrant used the prior year’s pay ratio information to calculate an approximate pay ratio
for the current year, especially if there is a significant change to the PEO’s compensation from the
prior year. Also, based on the number of registrants that have historically relied on Instruction 1
to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv), 411 we do not expect that the instruction will impact a significant
number of registrants each year.
c. Initial Compliance Date
i. Proposed Rule
411

For example, based on a review of EDGAR filings for calendar years 2012 and 2013, we estimate that
approximately 11 Forms 8-K are filed pursuant to Item 5.02(f) annually and approximately 90% of these
relate to disclosure of PEO compensation.

154

We proposed to require a registrant to comply with proposed Item 402(u) with respect to
compensation for the registrant’s first fiscal year commencing on or after the effective date of the
rule. We also proposed to permit a registrant to omit this initial pay ratio disclosure until the
filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for that fiscal year or, if later, the filing of a proxy or
information statement for its next annual meeting of shareholders (or written consents in lieu of a
meeting) following the end of such year. In any event, the information would be required to be
filed not later than 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. We recognized in the Proposing
Release that a transition period would likely be needed by large, multinational registrants and any
registrants that did not have a centralized, consolidated payroll, benefits, and pension system that
captures the information necessary to identify the median. We expected that it would take
registrants one full reporting cycle to implement and test any necessary systems.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
One commenter disagreed with the initial transition period in the proposed rule on the
grounds that further delays in having access to the pay ratio disclosure are not in the best interests
of shareholders. 412 Other commenters contended that the transition period in the Proposing
Release would disadvantage registrants with fiscal years that end on or close to the effective date
of the final rule and suggested that the transition period be extended until:
•

a registrant’s first fiscal year commencing on or after six months following the effective
date of the final rule; 413

•

a registrant’s first fiscal year commencing one year after the effective date of the final

412

155

rule; 414
•

a registrant’s first fiscal year commencing after the second anniversary of the effective
date of the final rule (or, alternatively, a registrant’s first fiscal year commencing on or
after December 15 of the year in which the rule becomes effective); 415

•

a registrant’s first fiscal year commencing on or after the first January 1 after the
effective date of the final rule; 416

•

a registrant’s 2016 fiscal year, if the final rule is adopted in 2014; 417

•

a registrant’s 2017 fiscal year; 418

•

one year after the Proposing Release’s compliance date (i.e., one year after a registrant’s
first fiscal year commencing on or after the effective date of the final rule); 419

•

two full years after the effective date of the final rule; 420 and

•

three years after the effective date of the final rule. 421
One commenter recommended delaying compliance with “the most onerous parts of this

rule,” 422 and a further commenter requested that we phase in various requirements of the rule. 423
Neither of these commenters, however, was more specific as to which parts of the rule to delay or
phase-in. One commenter suggested that we include a three-year sunset provision in the final

rule. 424 Other commenters suggested various transition periods for companies with non-U.S.
employees. Some commenters requested that, if the final rule includes non-U.S. employees, we
permit registrants to exclude non-U.S. employees from the pay ratio for an additional two
years. 425 A few commenters recommended that we extend the transition period for multinational
registrants to permit them to begin to comply with the final rules with respect to compensation for
their first full fiscal year commencing on or after the second anniversary of the effective date of
the final rules (assuming foreign employees are not excluded from the “median employee”
determination). 426 One commenter urging a transition period for non-U.S. employees stated that
“a staged implementation would allow companies to design methodologies for pay ratio
compliance during the first year and test them on an employee population where data collection is
more manageable.” 427
iii. Final Rule
The final rule provides that registrants’ first reporting period is their first full fiscal year
beginning on or after January 1, 2017, instead of on or after the effective date of the rule, as
proposed. For example, the reporting period for a company with a fiscal year that ends on
December 31 will begin on January 1, 2017. 428 We believe a transition period is appropriate
424

See letter from COEC I.

425

See, e.g., letters from FSR (suggesting that the final rule permit registrants with non-U.S. employees at least
two full fiscal years to comply, and providing two suggestions for doing so: (1) providing a “transition
period during which the registrant may report its pay ratio disclosure solely on the basis of the data available
in respect of its employees based in the United States;” or (2) providing a transition period for any registrant
with more than a de minimis non-U.S. workforce), FuelCell Energy (requesting that we “provide an
additional two years before companies must include overseas workers in their pay ratio calculations”),
Garmin (same), NIRI (same), and Semtech (same).

426

See letter from ABA and American Benefits Council.

427

See letter from COEC I.

428

Approximately 70% of registrants have fiscal years that begin on January 1. We determined this figure
based on the number of current reporting companies. There are 8,529 total registrants, and 5,799 of these
registrants have a fiscal year end of December 31, which is approximately 68% (5,799 / 8,529 = .67991).

157

because, as we noted in the Proposing Release, certain registrants may need additional time to
implement systems to compile the disclosure and verify its accuracy.
We are changing our approach from the proposal because a number of commenters
contended that the proposed transition period would be burdensome to registrants, and would
particularly disadvantage registrants with fiscal years that end on or close to the effective date of
the final rule. 429 Additionally, a number of these commenters indicated at least another additional
year would be required for registrants to establish systems to comply with the final rule. 430 One
commenter claimed, in particular, that registrants would need “an initial year to establish and test
the systems that may be necessary to collect and analyze the data required to identify their median
employee and develop the necessary disclosure controls and procedures, and then a second year
involving a full reporting cycle to actually put their selected system into operation.” 431

We are not providing an additional transition period or staggered compliance for
registrants with non-U.S. employees, as requested by some commenters. We believe that the final
rule provides sufficient time for all registrants, including multinationals and those with non-U.S.
employees, to identify the median employee and calculate annual total compensation for that
employee and the PEO. Additionally, we note that the de minimis and foreign privacy law
exemptions to the definition of “employee” in the final rule may help reduce the burden on such
registrants in preparing the necessary disclosure.

158

i. Proposed Rule
The proposed rule would permit new registrants to delay compliance so that the pay ratio
disclosure would not be required in a registration statement on Form S-1 432 or Form S-11 433 for an
initial public offering or registration statement on Form 10. 434 Such registrants would be required
to comply with proposed Item 402(u) with respect to compensation for the first fiscal year
commencing on or after the date the registrant became subject to the requirements of Section
13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the registrant could omit this initial pay ratio
disclosure from its filings until the filing of its Form 10-K for such fiscal year or, if later, the
filing of a proxy or information statement for its next annual meeting of shareholders (or written
consents in lieu of a meeting) following the end of such fiscal year. Similar to the proposed
instructions for updating pay ratio disclosure, these proposed instructions also would require that
this initial pay ratio disclosure be filed, in any event, as provided in connection with General
Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K not later than 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
All the commenters that discussed the topic agreed that new registrants should not be
required to provide pay ratio disclosure in their initial registration statements on Form S-1, Form
S-11, or Form 10. 435 A few commenters also agreed that a new public company should not have
to provide any pay ratio disclosure until it completes its first full fiscal year as a public
company. 436

159

iii. Final Rule
Similar to the transition period for existing registrants, the final rule provides that a new
registrant’s first pay ratio disclosure must follow its first full fiscal year beginning after the
registrant has (i) been subject to the requirements of Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
for a period of at least twelve calendar months beginning on or after January 1, 2017 and (ii) filed
at least one annual report pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act that does not
contain the pay ratio disclosure. 437
This change aligns the transition for new registrants with the change we made to the initial
transition period for existing registrants. As discussed above, the final rule provides that a
registrant’s first reporting period is its first full fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2017,
instead of on or after the effective date of the rule, as proposed. Also, this change is consistent
with some commenters’ recommendation that new registrants not be required to provide any pay
ratio disclosure until they complete their first full fiscal year as a public company. 438
Additionally, as proposed, the final rule does not require the pay ratio to be disclosed in a
registration statement on Form S-1 or Form S-11 for an initial public offering or an initial
registration statement on Form 10. Also, new registrants are permitted to omit their pay ratio
disclosure from their filings until after the later of (i) their first full fiscal year beginning on the
date they first become subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
437

For example, company with a fiscal year ending on December 31 that completes its initial public offering on
March 1, 2017 will not be required to include any pay ratio information in its registration statement on Form
S-1. The registrant will be first required to include pay ratio disclosure in its Form 10-K for its 2018 fiscal
year or its definitive proxy or information statement for its 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, but no later
than 120 days following the end of its 2018 fiscal year. The registrant’s pay ratio disclosure will be required
for its 2018 fiscal year because it filed its registration statement after January 1, 2017 (March 1, 2017), it
will have been subject to the requirements of Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for a period of at
least twelve calendar months (March 1, 2017 to March 1, 2018), and it will have filed at least one annual
report pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (for fiscal year 2017).

438

See, e.g., letters from ABA and Hyster-Yale.

160

and (ii) January 1, 2017. All commenters that discussed the topic agreed that new registrants
should not be required to provide pay ratio disclosure in their initial registration statements on
Form S-1, Form S-11, or Form 10. 439
We noted in the Proposing Release that shareholders might benefit from pay ratio
disclosure in connection with an initial public offering or Exchange Act registration. Even so, we
continue to believe that it is appropriate to give companies time to develop any needed systems to
compile the disclosure and verify its accuracy. This is particularly so since we believe the
primary purpose of the pay ratio disclosure is to provide a useful data point for shareholders in
making their voting decisions on executive compensation, including their say-on-pay votes, which
is unlikely to occur for those registrants until at least a year after the initial public offering has
occurred. The transition period for new registrants is similar to the time frame provided for other
registrants to comply with pay ratio disclosure requirements following the effective date of the
final rule.
As we stated in the Proposing Release, we are sensitive to the impact that a rule could
have on capital formation. Section 953(b), as amended by the JOBS Act, distinguished between
certain newly public companies and all other registrants by providing an exemption for emerging
growth companies. We note further that, without a transition period, the incremental time needed
to compile pay ratio disclosure could cause companies that are not emerging growth companies to
delay an initial public offering, which could have a negative impact on capital formation. In this
regard, we assume that companies that are no longer eligible for emerging growth company status
are likely to be businesses with more extensive operations or a greater number of employees,
which could increase the initial efforts needed to comply with the proposed requirements. We
439

See, e.g., letters from ABA, CalPERS, CII, Corporate Secretaries, Hyster-Yale, NACCO and PM&P.

161

continue to believe that providing a transition period for these newly public companies could
mitigate this potential impact on capital formation and will not significantly affect shareholders’
ability to assess the compensation and accountability of a registrant’s executives.
e. Additional Transition Periods
i. Proposed Rule
We did not propose a transition period for registrants that cease to be smaller reporting
companies or emerging growth companies or engage in business combinations and/or
acquisitions. We did, however, request comment on whether there should be such transition
periods and the appropriate length of time for any such transition period.
ii. Comments on the Proposed Rule
One commenter recommended a transition period for registrants that cease to be smaller
reporting companies. 440 The commenter recommended that those registrants not be required to
provide their pay ratio disclosure until the first full fiscal year commencing on or after the first
anniversary of the end of the fiscal year in which the registrant is no longer a smaller reporting
company.
Several commenters supported generally a transition period for registrants that engage in a
business combination and/or an acquisition to delay including any new employees acquired in the
transaction in the acquirer’s pay ratio. 441 Other commenters suggested specific transition periods
for such registrants, including: six months after the end of the fiscal year in which the transaction
closes; 442 six or more months after the transaction; 443 one full fiscal year following the

440

442

443

See id. (providing an alternative to initial recommendation of six months after the end of the fiscal year in

162

transaction; 444 the fiscal year beginning 18 months after closing of the transaction; 445 and three
years after the transaction. 446
iii. Final Rule
In response to comments, the final rule provides that a registrant that ceases to be a
smaller reporting company or an emerging growth company will not be required to provide pay
ratio disclosure until after the first full fiscal year after exiting such status and not for any fiscal
year commencing before January 1, 2017. For example, if a calendar year-end smaller reporting
company registrant’s public float exceeds $75 million as of the end of its second fiscal quarter in
2017, the registrant will cease to be a smaller reporting company as of the beginning of its fiscal
year starting on January 1, 2018. 447 The registrant, therefore, must include its pay ratio disclosure
in its Form 10-K for 2018 or a proxy or information statement for its 2019 annual meeting of
shareholders (or written consents in lieu of a meeting) following the end of the 2018 fiscal year,
but not later than 120 days after the end of the 2018 fiscal year. We believe that this approach is
appropriate because, as commenters noted, smaller reporting companies “will encounter the same
challenges in preparing to comply with the pay ratio disclosure requirement as registrants
generally and, therefore, will need time to determine how they will collect the data necessary to
identify their median employee and prepare the necessary disclosure,” but, “as relatively small
entities, these registrants are not likely to need as much time as ‘regular’ (larger) registrants to

which the transaction closes).

447

See 17 CFR 229.10(f)(1).

163

transition to compliance with the pay ratio disclosure requirement.” 448 This new transition period
is consistent with the one comment we received on this issue, and we believe it will provide
sufficient time for these registrants to prepare their disclosure.
Similarly, in 2017, if a calendar year-end emerging growth company had total annual
gross revenues of $1 billion or more, exceeded the $1 billion threshold in non-convertible debt for
the previous 3-year period, has reached the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of its
common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,
had not issued $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous 3-year period, or is deemed
to be a “large accelerated filer,” the registrant will cease to be an emerging growth company at the
beginning of its fiscal year starting on January 1, 2018. 449 The registrant, therefore, will be
required to include pay ratio disclosure in its Form 10-K for 2018 or a proxy or information
statement for its 2019 annual meeting of shareholders (or written consents in lieu of a meeting)
following the end of the 2018 fiscal year, but not later than 120 days after the end of the 2018
fiscal year.
We have decided to adopt this provision because it is consistent with a commenter’s
similar recommendation for a transition period when a registrant ceases to be a smaller reporting
company. The reasoning for the approach for both types of registrants is similar in that emerging
growth companies will need time to determine how they will collect the data necessary to identify
their median employee and prepare the necessary disclosure.
The final rule also permits a registrant that engages in a business combination and/or an
acquisition to omit the employees of a newly-acquired entity from their pay ratio calculation for

448

See letter from ABA.

449

17 CFR 229.10(a).

164

the fiscal year in which the business combination or acquisition becomes effective. For example,
for a calendar year-end registrant that engages in a business combination and/or acquisition in
2017, the registrant’s first period for which it will have to include the newly-acquired employees
in the pay ratio disclosure would be fiscal year 2018, with the disclosure included in its Form 10K for 2018 or a proxy or information statement for their next annual meeting of shareholders (or
written consents in lieu of a meeting) following the end of the 2018 fiscal year, but not later than
120 days after the end of such fiscal year.
A number of commenters recommended a transition period for such registrants.
Suggestions for the length of the transition period ranged from six months 450 to three years. 451
The transition period being adopted is generally consistent with commenters’ suggestions that the
disclosure not be required until one full fiscal year after the transaction. We also believe that the
final rule’s approach will allow a registrant sufficient time to incorporate the payroll,
compensation, and/or recordkeeping structures of the newly-acquired entity into the registrant’s
pay ratio disclosure framework.
Finally, under the provision in the final rule for triennial calculations of median employee
compensation discussed above, in the year of the acquisition or business combination, the
registrant need not evaluate whether the acquisition or business combination would result in a
substantial change to its pay ratio disclosure that would necessitate the re-identification of the
median employee. Rather, consistent with the one year transition for incorporating the new
employees in the pay ratio disclosure, the first time the registrant must evaluate whether the

450

See letter from Brian Foley & Co. (suggesting that the final rule allow registrants conducting a
merger/acquisition transaction to delay reporting “until at least 6 months after the end of the fiscal year in
which the M&A transaction closes, or 6 or more months after the closing date”).

451

See letter from Cummins Inc.

165

business combination or acquisition would result in a substantial change to its pay ratio disclosure
that would necessitate a re-identification of the median employee is in the fiscal year following
the acquisition or business combination. We believe this will provide registrants sufficient time
to integrate the new business or acquisition. Nevertheless, those registrants must identify the
acquired business excluded and the approximate number of employees for the fiscal year in which
the business combination or an acquisition becomes effective to provide transparency about what
the pay ratio disclosure does and does not include.
III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Background
We have performed an economic analysis of the main economic effects that may result
from the final rule, relative to the baseline discussed below. Section 2(b) of the Securities Act
and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act require us, when engaging in rulemaking that requires us to
consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, also to
consider whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 452
Further, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires us, when adopting rules under the
Exchange Act, to consider the impact that any new rule will have on competition and to not adopt
any rule that would impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 453
As discussed above, Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act directs us to amend Item 402
of Regulation S-K to add a pay ratio disclosure requirement. Section 953(b) imposes a new
requirement on registrants to disclose the median of the annual total compensation of all

452

See 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).

166

employees and the ratio of that median to the annual total compensation of the CEO. In doing so,
Section 953(b) requires registrants to determine total compensation in accordance with Item
402(c)(2)(x). Our rules for compensation disclosure generally focus on compensation matters that
relate to executive officers and directors. While registrants subject to Item 402 are required to
provide extensive information about the compensation of the PEO and other named executive
officers identified pursuant to Item 402(a), current disclosure rules do not require registrants to
disclose compensation information for other employees in their filings with us.
As directed by Congress, we proposed amendments to Item 402 to require the disclosure
of the annual total compensation of a registrant’s PEO, the median annual total compensation of
all employees of that registrant (excluding the PEO), and the ratio of the median annual total
compensation of all employees to the annual total compensation of the PEO. We considered the
statutory language and exercised our discretion to develop a proposal designed to lower
compliance costs while remaining consistent with the mandate of Section 953(b). In particular,
among other things, we proposed a rule that would permit registrants to use reasonable estimates
to identify the median employee, including by using statistical sampling, and a consistently
applied compensation measure (such as payroll or tax records). The proposed rule would also
allow the use of reasonable estimates in calculating the annual total compensation or any elements
of total compensation for employees. The proposed flexible approach was aimed at decreasing
compliance costs while taking into consideration a registrant’s particular facts and circumstances.
We received thousands of comment letters in response to the proposal.
To satisfy the statutory mandate of Section 953(b), we are adopting amendments to Item
402 substantially as proposed, with modifications intended to address some of the concerns raised
by commenters and provide further flexibility in the determination of the pay ratio. We believe

167

the primary benefit that Congress intended with pay ratio disclosure is to provide shareholders
with a company-specific metric that they can use to inform their voting decisions regarding
executive compensation under Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Several commenters stated
affirmatively that they would find the new data points, including pay ratio disclosure, relevant and
useful when making voting decisions. 454 As discussed above, while neither the statute nor the
related legislative history directly states the objectives or intended benefits of the provision, we
believe, based on our analysis of the statute and comments received, that Section 953(b) was
intended to provide shareholders with a company-specific metric that can assist in their evaluation
of a registrant’s executive compensation practices.
We are sensitive to the costs and benefits that stem from the final rule. Some of the costs
and benefits stem directly from the statutory mandate in Section 953(b), while others are affected
by the discretion we exercise in implementing that mandate. Our economic analysis of the final
rule addresses both the costs and benefits that stem directly from the mandate of Section 953(b)
and those arising from the policy choices made using our discretion, recognizing that it may be
difficult to separate the discretionary aspects of the rule from those elements required by statute.
In the economic analysis that follows, we first examine the current regulatory and
economic landscape to form a baseline for our analysis. We then analyze the likely economic
effects – including benefits and costs and impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation
– arising from the new mandatory disclosure requirement prescribed by the Dodd-Frank Act and
from the choices we have made in exercising our discretion, relative to the baseline discussed
below.

B. Baseline
To assess the economic impact of the final rule, we are using as our baseline the current
state of the market without a requirement for registrants to disclose pay ratio information. At
present, registrants that are required to comply with Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K provide
disclosure of their PEO’s compensation as Section 953(b) requires. Other registrants, such as
emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies, foreign private issuers, and MJDS
filers, are not required to comply with Item 402(c). 455 We do not expect that many registrants, if
any, currently maintain payroll and information systems that track total compensation as
determined pursuant to Item 402 for all their employees, or make that information publicly
available. Some registrants have reported ratios of CEO compensation to employee pay. 456 We
note, however, that the voluntarily reported information is different from the elements covered by
Item 402(c)(2)(x), and therefore is not identical to what would be required under the final rule.
Currently, shareholders cannot calculate registrant-specific median employee
compensation or the ratio of the PEO compensation to median employee compensation because
there are no existing publicly available sources for this data. In the absence of such data,
455

These registrants are required to provide disclosure of executive compensation, but the disclosure
requirements for these registrants do not fall under Item 402(c)(2)(x).

456

For example, Noble Energy Inc. voluntarily disclosed that “our Chairman and CEO’s total annual direct
compensation was approximately 85 times that of the median annual total direct compensation of all of our
other employees” in their 2014 proxy filing and disclosed a pay ratio in their 2015 proxy filing. MBIA Inc.
provided voluntary disclosure about average and median salary and bonus for all employees other than the
NEOs, and compared them to the CEO’s salary and bonus in its 2011 and 2012 proxy filings. NorthWestern
Corp. disclosed in its 2011 proxy filing that its CEO compensation (salary, annual incentive and long-term
incentive) was “18 times the median pay of all our employees” and disclosed a pay ratio of 19-24 in its
2012-2015 proxy filings. Whole Foods Market Inc. disclosed in its filings a “salary cap” on executive cash
compensation based on a multiple of the employee “average annual wage”. Other examples of registrants
that disclosed a pay ratio or median employee pay in its proxy filings include Advanced Environmental
Recycling Technologies Inc., First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey, Inter Parfums Inc., Itex
Corporation, and Penn Virginia Corp. See also Simpson Thacher survey of pay ratio disclosures, available at
http://www.compensationstandards.com/member/memos/firms/Simpson/03_15_ratio.pdf. We note that the
pay ratio in these voluntary disclosures may differ from the pay ratio required to be disclosed in the final
rule. In addition, registrants that currently disclose pay ratio are not necessarily the same registrants subject
to the final rule.

169

researchers have approximated the ratio using other available data, such as average employee
pay. 457 Statistics on the median earnings of U.S. workers in various “industries” are publicly
available from the BLS, 458 enabling shareholders to approximate the ratio using the industry
median employee compensation and the information about PEO compensation for those
registrants subject to Item 402(c). 459 The distribution of the ratios of CEO to industry median
employee compensation for a sample of large reporting companies is reported by NAICS industry
sectors in the figure below for fiscal year 2013. 460 Using this data, it is possible, for example, to
determine that, for the median manufacturing firm with available data, CEO pay was
approximately 105 times industry median employee pay. The 25th–75th percentile range for
manufacturing firms was approximately 51–195.
Figure 1. Distribution of the ratio of CEO compensation to median industry wage

457

In a working paper entitled “The CEO-Employee Pay Ratio,” Dr. Steven Crawford finds that during the
1995-2012 period the ratio of CEO compensation to the average employee pay at U.S. commercial banks
was on average 16.6 (with a median of 8.4). See “The CEO-Employee Pay Ratio” available at
http://ssrn.com/abstract=2529112.

458

See BLS Occupational Employment Statistics available at http://www.bls.gov/oes/.

459

See letter from Prof. Angel (“CEO compensation is already disclosed for public, but not private companies.
The only new information is the pay of the median employee. However, there is already pretty good
information about median compensation in various industries. For example, a few seconds of Googling leads
to http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oessrci.htm.”).

460

The ratios in the figure are calculated for each registrant with executive compensation data from the
Standard and Poor’s Compustat Executive Compensation database which tracks compensation for the
companies currently or previously in the S&P 1500 index and industry median employee wage information
at each 3-digit NAICS level from the BLS as of May 2014. The data in the Compustat Executive
Compensation database is for fiscal year 2013, which is the most recent fiscal year with complete coverage
at the time of this analysis. The distribution of the registrant-level ratios within each NAICS industry sector
(2-digit) is represented using horizontal box plots that show the minimum and maximum, and 25th, 50th
(median), and 75th percentiles.

170

We caution that any pay ratio estimate that can be made with currently available
information would be different from the ratio required under the final rule. The above example
uses the BLS median wage information of U.S. workers within the same 3-digit NAICS
industries, while the final rule mandates registrants to use registrant-specific information about
median employee compensation for “all employees,” including employees in workplaces outside
the U.S., subject to certain exemptions. Also, the example is based on only wages and does not
consider other forms of compensation for employees other than PEOs because the BLS does not
report those components for detailed industry definitions. In contrast, the final rule requires
registrants to present the ratio using “total compensation,” which includes all forms of
compensation in Item 402(c)(2)(x). Thus, while existing public data may permit shareholders to
estimate median pay ratios across industry sectors, it does not allow for the particularized,
registrant-specific assessment that, in our view, Section 953(b) was intended to facilitate.
171

To assess the economic effects of the final rule, we consider its impact on shareholders,
registrants subject to the pay ratio disclosure, and all registrants’ employees, including executive
officers. We estimate that the final rule applies to approximately 3,571 registrants. 461
Important potential determinants of the economic effects of the pay ratio disclosure
requirements on the affected registrants are the differences in size, nature, and location of the
workforce; complexity of the organization; and the degree of integration of payroll systems that
are likely to exist among these registrants. In particular, the number of business and/or
geographic segments within a particular registrant can significantly affect the compliance costs
associated with the final rule. The registrants that operate in different geographic and business
segments will likely have a less homogeneous workforce and are also less likely to maintain a
single centralized payroll system. 462 The average number of geographic and business segments
and employees per each segment disclosed by some of the potentially affected registrants in the

461

Based on a review of EDGAR filings in calendar year 2014, we estimate that there were approximately
7,619 annual reports on Form 10-K filed in that year with available Xtensible Business Reporting Language
(XBRL) data tags (available at http://www.sec.gov/dera/data/financial-statement-data-sets.html). From this
number we subtracted the annual reports filed by approximately 678 emerging growth companies (EGCs),
2,958 smaller reporting companies (SRCs), and 412 ABS issuers. These ABS issuers typically omit
executive compensation disclosures in accordance with General Instruction J to Form 10-K. To the extent
that the number of EGCs is growing each year, we might be underestimating the number of registered EGCs
because we look only at registrants that file an annual report on Form 10-K. Registrants can fall into
multiple categories among emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies, and foreign private
issuers. For example, 371 smaller reporting companies self-identified also as emerging growth companies.
Therefore, we did not include these 371 registrants in the 2,958 smaller reporting companies that we
subtracted from the 7,619 registrants that file annual reports on Form 10-K because they were already
included as emerging growth companies. Foreign private issuers and MJDS filers that file annual reports on
Form 20-F and Form 40-F, respectively, are not required to provide Item 402 information. They are
therefore not included in the 3,571 affected registrants estimated above.

462

See letter from Chamber II (reporting that 39 companies that conduct operations in more than 50 countries
with an average of 90 different “employee data systems” worldwide would have average estimated labor
costs of $311,800 for first year compliance. In contrast, 37 companies that operate in fewer than 10 countries
with an average of 4.2 employee data systems would have average estimated labor costs of $67,200 for first
year compliance (according to the 25 firms that provided this data)).

Table 1 shows that, in 2014, potentially affected registrants had an average of three
geographic segments and two business segments. Also, the average number of employees was
approximately 8,700 per geographic segment and 7,800 per business segment. We do not have
complete information on how the registrants maintain their payroll systems across multiple
geographic and business segments, but we believe that, because it is probable that registrants with
multiple geographic and business segments will have multiple payroll systems and therefore lack
easily accessible employee-level data on compensation, the number of such segments serves as an
indication of the complexity and costs of trying to comply with the final rule (whether by
sampling at each segment and aggregating the samples across the segments or by aggregating the
payroll observations and sampling from the aggregated pool). The estimated costs associated
with compliance for registrants with multiple geographic and business segments employing

The corporate segments data used in the table come from the Standard and Poor’s Compustat Segments
database for companies with a business or geographic segment listed under “segment type”. Segment
information is self-reported by companies. As such, it is not based on standardized definitions of lines-ofbusiness and geographic areas. The database provides some geographic segment information for
approximately 63% of the potentially affected registrants and some business segment information for
approximately 68% of the potentially affected registrants.

multiple payroll systems are discussed below.
One commenter asserted that the pay ratio disclosure may affect PEO compensation. 464 If
the pay ratio disclosure were to significantly affect PEO compensation, the rule may have adverse
effects on registrants’ ability to attract and retain PEOs focused on such compensation. We note
that there may be other factors affecting the ability of a registrant to attract and retain executive
talent, such as the general structure and conditions of the labor market for executives. However,
we do not have enough information to assess the effect of the new rule on PEO compensation or
on the level of competition in the labor market for PEOs.
Relative to the baseline discussed above, the economic analysis that follows focuses
initially on the likely economic effects – including benefits and costs and impact on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation – arising from the new mandatory disclosure requirement
prescribed by the Dodd-Frank Act, and it then focuses on those that arise from the choices we
have made in exercising our discretion. 465
C. Economic Effects from Mandated Disclosure Requirements
1. Benefits
The following discussion is mainly intended to address benefits of the mandated
disclosure to shareholders and shareholders of the registrants that are subject to the disclosure
requirements mandated by Section 953(b).
464

See letter from Lou (“In spite of the fact that the pay ratio does not necessarily lead to CEO pay cuts, some
companies may decrease executive pay if the number is too embarrassing. But this productivity-unrelated
deduction can artificially depress the U.S. CEO market and IPOs.”).

465

Although we have divided our discussion of the economic effects of the rule between mandatory and
discretionary features, we do not mean to imply that Congress unambiguously compelled us to adopt all of
the items discussed under the mandatory requirements discussion. Specifically, we recognize that we retain
exemptive authority and interpretive authority over many aspects of the rule, including many of those that
we discuss within the mandatory requirements section. Generally speaking, we have chosen to classify
items as mandatory because, in our view, these particular items appear to us to be consistent with the
Congressional intent underlying Section 953(b).

174

Although Congress neither expressly identified in Section 953(b) a specific market failure
intended to be addressed by the new disclosure requirement nor expressly stated the specific
objectives and intended benefits of Section 953(b), we nonetheless believe that the context in
which the provision appears provides useful evidence of Congress’ purpose in enacting the
provision. As discussed above, we believe that Congress intended Section 953(b) to enhance the
executive compensation information available to shareholders. Particularly, Section 953(b)
provides new data points that shareholders may find relevant and useful when exercising their
voting rights under Section 951. We believe, therefore, that Section 953(b) should be interpreted
consonant with Subtitle E’s general purpose of further facilitating shareholder engagement in
executive compensation decisions. A significant consideration for us in fashioning a final rule
implementing Section 953(b), then, is the extent to which elements of the final rule further
Congress’ apparent goal of giving shareholders additional executive compensation information to
use as part of the shareholder engagement envisioned by Section 951.
Moreover, as discussed earlier, a number of commenters stated that they would find the
pay ratio disclosure relevant when making voting decisions. 466 We acknowledge the views of
these commenters and regard the informational benefit of facilitating shareholder engagement in
executive compensation decisions as potentially a significant new benefit to shareholders when
they exercise their say-on-pay voting rights. We note that registrants have not historically been
required to provide shareholders with access to information that would allow them to assess the
level of a PEO’s compensation as it compares to employees at the same registrant and, as a result,
shareholders generally have not been provided such information.

175

While we believe that the pay ratio disclosure may provide an informational benefit to
shareholders in their say-on-pay voting, we are unable to quantify this benefit. This is so for a
number of reasons. First, the primary benefit that results from the pay ratio disclosure is not
directly tied to an immediate economic transaction, such as the purchase or sale of a security,
which makes it difficult for us to quantify in monetary terms the likely benefit to shareholders of
this information. Second, the pay ratio disclosure is but one data point among many
considerations that shareholders might find relevant when exercising their say-on-pay votes,
which also makes it difficult for us to quantify the precise benefit that shareholders may
experience. Third, even in situations where the pay ratio may be a significant or dispositive
consideration for shareholders, because the say-on-pay vote is advisory and not binding, it is
difficult for us to link the disclosure with certainty to a potential change in PEO compensation
and even more speculative for us to link the disclosure to an economic outcome at a registrant.
Further, we note that no commenter provided us with data that would allow us to quantify the
potential benefits nor did any commenter suggest a source of data or a methodology that we could
look to in quantifying the rule's potential benefits.
We also think it is important to observe that, despite our inability to quantify the benefits,
Congress has directed us to promulgate this disclosure rule. Thus, we believe it reasonable to rely
on Congress’s determination that the rule will produce benefits for shareholders and that its costs
(which we discuss further below) are necessary and appropriate in furthering shareholders’ ability
to meaningfully exercise their say-on-pay voting rights. Because Congress expressly directed us
to undertake this rulemaking, we do not believe it would be appropriate to second-guess its
apparent conclusion that the benefits from this rule justify its adoption. In any event, as noted
above, we concur with Congress’s judgment that the pay ratio disclosure could be beneficial for

176

shareholders.
Commenters also suggested that pay ratio disclosure can be a valuable tool in evaluating
PEO compensation practices in general. 467 Among other uses of the pay ratio information, some
commenters suggested that comparing the total compensation of the median employee and PEO
would assist investors in their ability to evaluate the PEO’s compensation in the context of the
registrant’s overall business, 468 and could provide insight into the effectiveness of board oversight
and sound board governance. 469 Other commenters noted that they incorporate social and
governance issues, like pay equity, as part of their investment decisions. 470
As noted above, we recognize that there are significant limitations to using the pay ratio
information for comparative purposes in light of the various factors that could affect employee
compensation at a particular registrant and the flexibility we are providing. We believe that the
informational benefit to shareholders from the final rule is in providing information about a
particular registrant’s executive compensation.
In addition to its utility in assessing PEO compensation practices, commenters identified a

number of ancillary benefits that may arise from the required pay ratio disclosure. Some
commenters suggested that the new disclosure could offset an upward bias in executive
compensation resulting from the practice of benchmarking executive pay solely against the
compensation of other executives to the extent that current benchmarking practices are
inefficient. 471 Other commenters suggested that a comparison of PEO compensation to employee
compensation could be used by shareholders to approximate employee morale and/or
productivity472 or analyzed as a measure of a particular registrant’s approach to managing human
capital. 473 One commenter cited his own research showing that large pay disparities within a
corporation contribute to an unethical culture within the corporation. 474 Finally, some
commenters asserted that the registrant-specific information about the median employee
compensation may be used to address a broader public policy concern relating to income
inequality and income mobility, which they suggest is exacerbated by increasingly high levels of
PEO compensation relative to other workers. 475
With respect to employee morale and productivity, commenters did not specify what
effect a pay ratio disclosure would have on these conditions relative to other environment-specific
and registrant-specific factors. In particular, the pay ratio disclosure may be significantly

dependent on how a registrant structures its business. For example, one registrant might
outsource the labor-related (manufacturing) aspects of its business to a third party to focus on
product innovation, while another registrant competing in the same industry might choose to
retain the labor aspect of its business. To the extent that product innovation requires higher pay
than manufacturing, the outsourcing company will have a lower pay ratio for the same PEO pay.
Therefore, the potential value of this disclosure for assessing issues related to employee morale,
productivity, and investment in human capital may be diminished by the variation in business
structures.
Some commenters suggested that the pay ratio disclosure would promote capital
formation. 476 The main rationale given for this effect is that the new disclosure would help
shareholders understand the assets of the firms they invest in or that it will let shareholders choose
registrants that invest in their workforce. 477 On the other hand, some commenters asserted that
the rule would discourage capital formation because it would discourage firms from accessing the
U.S. capital markets. 478 We note that the final rule does not apply to emerging growth companies,
which conduct the bulk of initial public offerings. 479 While the pay ratio disclosure could be
costly, it is not clear whether it would significantly affect a registrant’s ongoing capital raising
activity.
Overall, while certain shareholders may use the pay ratio for their investment decisions, it
is unclear whether the final rule would impact the capital formation of U.S. capital markets in a

significant way. As discussed above, shareholders may be able to approximate the industry level
pay ratio using industry employee compensation data from BLS and the information about PEO
compensation for registrants subject to Item 402(c). In this regard, adding the pay ratio statistic to
the mix of reported financial and operational data may not change the investment decision of
investors who access this data. On the other hand, the pay ratio disclosure is company-specific,
which adds information not otherwise available to investors.
In contrast to commenters supporting the required disclosure, some commenters stated
that the disclosure mandated by Section 953(b) would not have any benefit, or would not have
benefits sufficient to justify the compliance costs, which many of those commenters anticipate
would be substantial. 480 Some of the commenters questioned the materiality of pay ratio
information to an investment decision 481 This view was also asserted by the minority in the
Senate report accompanying the legislation. 482
While we acknowledge these concerns about the usefulness or materiality of the mandated
disclosure, we note that other commenters asserted that certain shareholders incorporate social
and governance issues, like pay equity, as part of their decision making. 483 These shareholders
may realize non-economic benefits associated with their decision making based on this type of
information. These commenters, however, did not quantify the extent to which shareholders

to make a reasoned assessment of how executive compensation levels are set. Existing SEC disclosures
already do this.”).

would value pay ratio information or would incorporate the disclosure required by Section 953(b)
into their investment or voting decision, if at all. Academic research suggests that the stock
market does not fully incorporate employee satisfaction into stock prices. 484 As mentioned above,
because company-specific pay ratio information is not currently reported, it is not possible to
assess the usefulness to shareholders of this information as required by Section 953(b) relative to
the usefulness of publicly available statistics of median compensation, or the usefulness of any
other company-specific metric of employee compensation or satisfaction.
Some commenters were particularly concerned that the comparisons of pay ratios across
registrants may be inappropriate to the extent that registrants employ workers in different
countries that have unique compensation practices, 485 use different methodologies to calculate the
median employee, 486 employ workers with different skill levels, 487 and have different corporate
structures. 488 As noted above, we believe that the purpose of the pay ratio disclosure is to
provide shareholders of a registrant with new data points that they may find relevant and useful
when exercising their voting rights under Section 951. As we noted in the Proposing Release, we
believe that a variety of factors can potentially limit the comparability of the pay ratio across
registrants. We also acknowledge that the final rule we are adopting allows for significant
484

Existing research has studied whether there is a correlation between information about employee satisfaction
and long-term equity returns in an effort to understand how the market values a public company’s intangible
assets. This research uses different information than what is provided in the pay ratio disclosure. This
research was based on the equity prices of companies that were identified on Fortune Magazine’s list of the
“100 Best Companies to Work For in America.” See A. Edmans, Does the stock market fully value
intangibles? Employee satisfaction and equity prices, J. OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS 101, 621-640 (2011)
(finding evidence implying that the market fails to incorporate intangible assets, like employee satisfaction,
fully into stock valuations until the intangible subsequently manifests in tangibles, such as earnings, that are
valued by the market, and finding evidence suggesting that the non-incorporation of intangibles into stock
prices is not simply due to the lack of salient information about them).

flexibility in determining the pay ratio to address concerns raised by a number of commenters
about the potential costs of the pay ratio disclosure. One result of allowing for this flexibility,
however, is that the comparability of the pay ratio from registrant to registrant may be further
diminished. We recognize this consequence but believe it is justified in light of the cost savings
that such flexibility will provide and because we do not regard precise comparability as the
primary objective of the final rule.
2. Costs
a. General
The following discussion is mainly intended to address costs to registrants that are subject
to the pay ratio disclosure. The analysis of costs focuses on direct compliance costs on
registrants.
As discussed above, the final rule permits registrants to choose from several options to
identify the median employee. First, registrants can choose to use Item 402(c)(2)(x) to calculate
the annual total compensation for each employee and then identify the median employee.
Second, registrants can choose a statistical method that is appropriate to the size and structure of
their own businesses and the way in which they compensate employees to identify the median
employee, and then use Item 402(c)(2)(x) to calculate the median employee’s compensation.
Third, registrants can use a consistently applied compensation measure, whether with respect to
the entire employee population or in conjunction with statistical sampling, to identify the median
employee, and then calculate and disclose that median employee’s total compensation in
accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x).
In addition to providing flexibility in identifying the median employee’s compensation,
the final rule allows flexibility in several other respects. Registrants may:

182

•

use reasonable estimates when applying Item 402(c)(2)(x) to calculate the annual
total compensation for employees other than the PEO, including when disclosing
the annual total compensation of the median employee identified using a
consistently applied compensation measure;

•

identify the median employee every three years to the extent that there is no
significant change in the registrant’s employee population or employee
compensation arrangements;

•

consistently choose any date within the last three months of a registrant’s fiscal
year to identify the median employee.

Moreover, the final rule allows flexibility for registrants with non-U.S. employees by
providing (1) a foreign data privacy law exemption reducing the burden on registrants that operate
in certain foreign jurisdictions, and (2) a de minimis exemption that may reduce the number of
payroll systems that need to be used to identify the median employee and will allow registrants
some flexibility in addressing payroll matters that may result from having employees in multiple
jurisdictions. Finally, the final rule also provides that registrants, when determining the
compensation of the median employee for purposes of identifying the median employee and
making the pay ratio disclosure, may elect to adjust the compensation of their employees in
jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides to reflect the cost of living in the
PEO’s country of residence, but they must also provide disclosure of the registrant’s pay ratio
calculated without the cost-of-living adjustment. Overall, we believe that the flexible approach
allowed by the final rule is consistent with Section 953(b) and, in certain circumstances discussed
below, may reduce costs compared to other methods of implementing the statute.
b. Compliance Cost Estimates in Comment Letters

183

In the pre-proposing period, we received estimates of the costs of compliance for certain
registrants from some commenters. 489 These estimates varied significantly and were based on the
commenters’ initial reading and interpretation of the statute and not on the proposed rule, which
would allow for flexibility not accounted for in the pre-proposal letters. For example, prior to the
proposal, one commenter estimated the cost of compliance with Section 953(b) would be
$250,000 to $500,000 annually, and revised its cost estimate downward to $15,000 annually after
the proposed rule was released “primarily due to the ability afforded by the proposed rule for
registrants to use a consistently applied compensation measure, such as payroll records or W-2
reportable wages and the equivalents for non-U.S. employees, to identify the median
employee.” 490
In the Proposing Release, we did not estimate the costs of the calculation and disclosure of
a registrant’s pay ratio because we did not have enough data for such estimation. In response to
the Proposing Release, a number of commenters evaluated our estimates of the compliance costs
represented by the estimated Paperwork Reduction Act (“PRA”) burdens imposed by the
proposed rule. Most commenters generally indicated that those PRA burdens underestimated the
compliance costs associated with the disclosure requirement, and some provided more specific
cost estimates. For example, one commenter noted that our PRA estimate of an average of 340
hours of internal company time in year one to comply with the proposed rule significantly
understates the time that many companies would need to comply (especially those with non-U.S.

489

For example, one pre-proposal comment letter from an industry group reported that a member company
estimated that it would require approximately $7.6 million and 26 weeks to prepare the pay ratio disclosure
and that a separate member company estimated that it would cost approximately $2 million annually to
determine the actuarial value of employee pension benefits. See American Benefits Council et al., (Jan. 19,
2012) (“American Benefits Council et al. pre-proposal letter”).

employees). 491 Below, we discuss the specific comments that we consider to be the most useful
to estimate the compliance costs of the pay ratio disclosure. We note that, in providing specific
comments, commenters did not typically distinguish between costs derived from the statutory
mandate and costs derived from the exercise of our discretion. Furthermore, they typically did
not distinguish between internal costs in burden hours versus external professional costs in dollar
amounts for PRA purposes.
Two commenters provided survey studies with several relevant estimates of the
compliance costs associated with the proposed rule, as well as characteristics of the types of
registrants that would be affected. As discussed in greater detail below, the aggregate initial
external compliance cost estimates provided by these commenters range between $187 million 492
and approximately $711 million.493 These estimates are based on responses to the surveys
discussed below and may not be representative of all registrants affected by the final rule.
i. Center on Executive Compensation Survey
One commenter provided the results of a joint survey it conducted among its members. 494
The results are based on the responses from 128 public companies out of 1,270 surveyed. 495 Most
of the respondents are large registrants, with average revenue of approximately $28 billion; 59%
491

See letter from NIRI.

492

See letter from COEC I. We note that this estimate represents only the cost of outside professionals and
does not take into account internal company hours as an additional cost of compliance with the rule. This
commenter estimated that compliance would require at least 801,000 hours of in-house personnel time (at
least 255,000 additional company hours above the 546,000 company hours we estimated) in addition to a
cost of $187 million.

493

See letter from Chamber II. This commenter estimated an annual internal compliance burden of 3.6 million
hours in addition to an annual cost of $710.9 million.

494

This survey was jointly conducted by the COEC, Human Resource Policy Association, and Corporate
Secretaries. See letters from COEC I and Corporate Secretaries. See also letter from Business Roundtable I
(referencing the results from the COEC I survey).

495

See letter from COEC I. We note that the letter from Corporate Secretaries refers to results from the same
survey, but for the 127 respondents who are also members of Corporate Secretaries.

185

of the registrants had revenues greater than $10 billion. Nearly 80% of respondents had 10,000 or
more employees, most of them employed full- time. In addition, nine out of ten respondents had
foreign operations with employees located outside the United States. On average, respondents
operated in 34 countries, and about two-fifths of their employees worked in foreign countries.
The average number of separate employee data systems that respondents had worldwide was 46.
In its letter, the commenter questioned our estimate, for PRA purposes, of $400 per hour
for outside professional costs and the estimated PRA hour burden. More than half of the survey
respondents indicated that the average hourly fee for their company’s external securities
compliance counsel is above $700. The respondents also indicated that, on average, 72% of the
estimated initial compliance costs are expected to be incurred in subsequent years. Based on
these survey results, the commenter asserted that compliance with the rule would require at least
255,000 additional company hours and an additional $114.1 million in costs across all affected
registrants for outside professional services above the our PRA burden estimates in the Proposing
Release ($72.77 million). Using these updated estimates, the commenter arrived at a total initial
compliance cost estimate of at least $186.9 million. 496 We note that, although labeled “total
compliance costs” by the commenter, that estimate of compliance costs includes only the cost of
outside professionals, and thus is only part of the expected total compliance costs. The estimate
does not take into account internal company hours as an additional cost of compliance with the
rule. Additionally, the commenter assumed that all affected registrants will bear the same
compliance costs, which may bias its total cost estimate because compliance costs are likely to
vary between registrants with and without foreign operations, or between small and large
496

The commenter reports the additional cost of outside professional services of $114 million in excess of the
cost of outside professional services estimated by us in the Proposing Release. The total cost estimate
reported as $186.9 million can be obtained by adding $114 million and $72.77 million, with the difference
likely due to rounding. See letter from COEC I.

186

registrants.
The survey provided several estimates of how compliance costs might change if there
were certain changes in the rule. For instance, the commenter’s letter argued that the final rule
should apply only to a registrant’s consolidated subsidiaries, noting that its survey indicated that,
if the final rule were to include employees of all minority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, a
registrant’s compliance costs would increase by an average of 91%, with a mid-range of 20%.
The letter from the other commenter that jointly conducted the survey also presented information
about the inclusion of all minority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, but its letter presented
the survey data in a different format. It presented the average and median anticipated increases
categorized based on the company’s annual revenue. 497 According to this comment letter, for
registrants with annual revenue of over $30 billion, the median increase in cost would be
approximately 35% if employees in minority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures were
included. For registrants with annual revenue between $5 billion and $30 billion, that median
increase would be approximately 20%, while for registrants with annual revenue below $5 billion,
the median increase in compliance cost would be 10%. These numbers, however, appear to
reflect an increase in the compliance cost if the coverage of subsidiaries and joint ventures were to
be increased from the suggested coverage under the Proposing Release to complete (100%)
coverage of subsidiaries and joint ventures. Thus, they do not directly correspond to the changes
we made in this release, including the change that we made to include only employees of a
registrant’s consolidated subsidiaries, as suggested by the commenter.
If a registrant were permitted to calculate the pay ratio based on full-time, permanent
employees only, then according to the survey responses, the compliance cost would decrease by a
497

See letter from Corporate Secretaries.

187

mid-range of 10% or an average of approximately 11%. 498 Another commenter suggested that the
median decrease in compliance costs would be approximately 10% or an average of 12% if a
registrant were permitted to calculate the pay ratio based on full-time, permanent employees
only. 499 Requiring only U.S. employees to be used when estimating the pay ratio would decrease
costs on average by 40%, while the mid-range decrease would be approximately 50%. 500 In
contrast, if the rule did not contain the flexibility allowed under the proposal and instead total
compensation as calculated in the Summary Compensation Table was required to be used to
identify the median employee, 99% of the respondents said that their cost would increase and
49.1% said that the cost would increase by over 100%. Another commenter, relying on
information from the same survey, suggested that the average cost increase would be 4,689% and
the median cost increase would be approximately 175% if total compensation as calculated in the
Summary Compensation Table was required to be used to identify median employee pay. 501
ii. Chamber of Commerce Survey
A different commenter also provided estimates of compliance costs of the proposed rule
based on survey results. 502 This commenter’s survey is a version of the COEC survey that
included only 118 respondents, approximately “3.1% of all covered businesses.” The commenter
did not elaborate on how its version of the survey is different from the COEC survey, other than

498

See letter from COEC I. While the survey data attached to the comment letter showed that the average
anticipated cost reduction would be 11%, the text of the comment letter discussing the survey also stated that
for the subset of respondents that anticipated that limiting the rule to full-time employees would lower costs,
“the average savings would be approximately 20 percent.”

499

See letter from Corporate Secretaries.

500

See letter from COEC I (mentioning in the text of the comment letter that the expected decrease is “47% on
average for firms with non-U.S. employees”). See also letter from Corporate Secretaries.

including fewer respondents. 503 The commenter’s letter provides no information on the survey’s
respondent size characteristics to provide context with respect to the respondents’ potential
organizational complexity and associated challenges in complying with the proposed rule. Based
on the survey, the commenter concludes that the average labor cost per company of complying
with the proposed rule would be approximately $185,600 for the initial year. That commenter
also estimated, but did not monetize, an annual compliance time of 3.6 million hours. 504 The
survey results also show a wide divergence in cost estimates across survey respondents, with 42
respondents estimating the value of the time necessary to comply with the proposal to be at least
$100,000, while 13 respondents estimated this value to be less than $10,000. On average,
respondents estimated 952 hours needed to comply with the proposed rule. Respondents that
conduct operations in foreign countries will have higher compliance costs according to the survey
results. Thirty-nine respondents that conduct operations in more than 50 countries indicated an
average labor cost of $311,800 to comply with the proposed rule. These respondents also
reported an average of 90 different employee data systems worldwide. On the other hand, for 37
respondents that operate in fewer than 10 countries, the average compliance cost was estimated to
be $67,200. Based on the survey results, the commenter asserted that the total external
compliance costs for the private sector could be approximately $711 million and that total cost
could increase to $1.1 billion (in addition to the internal compliance time) if every affected
registrant has an average cost of $311,800.
iii. Other Specific Comments
In addition to the two surveys, several other commenters provided the following cost

the Chamber represents over “3 million businesses and organizations of every size, sector and region.”

189

estimates based on the proposed rule. In these estimates, the commenters did not distinguish
between the costs arising from the mandated disclosure and the costs arising from the exercise of
our discretion. The estimates for the proposal were as follows:
•

$500,000 to $1 million to automate a large global registrant’s processes; 505

•

between $1 million and $1.5 million for at least 10 to 15 internal staff members
and two or three external advisors, with 100 to 150 hours of internal work and 20
to 40 hours in external consulting time; 506

•

annual compliance cost of $15,000 for an issuer with global operations; 507

•

a “likely to be conservative” estimate of $100,000 per company, based on what
mid-sized retail corporations informed the commenter. 508

•

approximately $250,000 for 1,000 internal hours initially and $100,000 per year
for 500 hours annually thereafter (but, according to the commenter, the workload
would perhaps drop by 90% if the final rule includes only employees employed by
the U.S. parent organization and all U.S.-based subsidiaries in addition to other
changes recommended by the commenter); 509

•

“thousands of dollars to hire a dedicated resource and overhaul our payroll and
human resource information system in order to prepare our first pay ratio
disclosures under this rule;” 510

•

between $50,000 and $100,000 to test the commenter’s current payroll system for
a quote on identifying the median employee, with an “actual cost” that “is
indeterminable” but that the commenter believes could cost over $500,000; 511

•

$500,000 to $1 million for 50 internal employees and outside advisors; 512

•

3,000 work hours in the initial year and 850 work hours annually thereafter (but,
according to the commenter, these costs would be reduced by 90% if the final rule
excluded non-U.S. employees); 513

•

over $1.6 million not including modifications of payroll or accounting systems; 514

•

actual cost is indeterminable, but believed to exceed $500,000 due to substantial
non-U.S. employee base; 515

•

cost for many registrants would likely to be in the millions of dollars; 516 and

•

annual cost to collect required data would exceed $2 million. 517

The overall cost range provided by individual commenters for initial compliance by a
large registrant was between $15,000 per year to $2 million. 518 We note that all of these
comments concerned the proposed rule, rather than the final rule. As discussed below, the final
rule allows for further flexibility, which we believe will reduce the cost of compliance.
These estimates provide a significant number of data points on the anticipated compliance

costs that we use in our quantification of the estimated compliance costs of the final rule below.
However, we caution that these estimates do not necessarily represent an accurate indication of
the expected costs because they use different methodologies and assumptions in arriving at these
numbers, some of which might change with the different requirements under the final rule.
Moreover, only a few commenters discussed the complexity of their payroll systems; 519 the
degree to which the estimated costs reflect internal personnel costs 520 or the costs of outside
service providers 521 and outside professionals; 522 and the precise assumptions used in deriving the
estimates, all of which may be relevant for assessing the estimates provided. 523 Also, although
most of these estimates do not precisely distinguish between initial and ongoing costs, we expect
that, for many registrants, the overall compliance burden will diminish after systems are in place
to gather and verify the underlying data. 524 Some commenters noted that the costs are impossible

519

See letter from Hyster-Yale (commenting that “of the 4,967 people who received Form W-2s (or similar
documents) for 2012, 2,375 (48%) resided outside the U.S. and were paid on twenty different payroll
systems (none of which are integrated with our U.S. system or any other system)”). This commenter,
however, did not comment on the expected cost of integrating these payroll systems.

520

See letter from Avery Dennison (estimating that they will use 10-15 internal staff members with 100-150
hours of internal work), FEI (estimating 1,000 hours of internal time to develop the database and
methodology to derive the data and 500 hours to maintain this database in the following years), and
ExxonMobil (estimating 3,000 work hours by internal personnel in the first year and 850 work hours per
year thereafter).

521

See letter from ExxonMobil (stating “are not able to provide a specific estimate, but expect that a significant
work effort would also be required on the part of each of our 60 third-party vendors”).

522

See letters from Avery Dennison (estimating that they will use two or three external advisors (e.g., legal
counsel, human resources consultants) and 20-40 hours of external consulting time,) and Hyster-Yale
(stating that it will need to hire an outside consulting firm to assist with the process).

523

See letter from General Mills (providing a list of steps it will take). However, the commenter did not
provide detailed cost estimates for these steps.

524

A few commenters addressed this point, and the estimates they provided were very different. See, e.g.,
letters from ExxonMobil (expecting a 72% drop), FEI (estimating a 60% drop in compliance costs from the
first year to the next year), and General Mills (indicating that most of the costs for the first year would also
apply to subsequent years of compliance). But see letter from Business Roundtable I (asserting that 42% of
respondents to a survey it conducted indicated that they would have to update their methodology every
year).

192

to determine before they start the process. 525 The provided cost estimates were also given prior to
additional cost-reducing measures adopted in the final rule in response to comments, including
comments about costs. These measures include: the ability to calculate the median employee
once every three years, the exemption from the definition of “employee” of a de minimis
percentage of non-U.S. employees, the requirement to consider only registrant’s own employees
and those of their consolidated subsidiaries when identifying the median employee, and the
exemption for employees in foreign jurisdictions in which it is not possible for a registrant to
obtain or process information necessary to comply with the rule without violating the data privacy
laws or regulations of that jurisdiction. We expect that these changes will further reduce the costs
of compliance.
In contrast to these estimates, a significant number of the commenters, generally the same
commenters that perceived the benefits of the rule, asserted that the rule would not impose high
costs and burdens. The majority of these commenters indicated that the permitted flexibility in
complying with the proposed rule would reduce costs, 526 and that the registrants already have the
data necessary to make their pay ratio calculations. 527 While we agree that the permitted
flexibility should lower costs for many registrants, we recognize that registrants who operate in
various geographic and business segments may need to reconcile their systems to compile and
525

See, e.g., letter from NACCO (stating that consulting companies were unable to provide quotes about the
cost to assist with statistical sampling until they are able to test their various payroll systems). This
commenter also stated that the actual cost is indeterminable but could exceed $500,000, as it will depend on
(i) the availability and accuracy of employee data, (ii) the scope of the final rule and (iii) whether registrants
choose to disclose the minimum required disclosure or if they decide to provide various alternative
disclosures that would provide shareholders with more context.

c. Quantification of Compliance Costs
While our overarching consideration of the costs of the rule takes into account the
information provided by a broad range of commenters, the most useful frameworks for
considering costs were provided by commenters that provided data on company-wide potential
costs. Other commenters provided certain valuable insights into how our rule would be
implemented, but were either not as transparent in their analytical frameworks or not easily
generalizable in terms of aggregating the costs across multiple registrants.
Some commenters indicated that the most important driver for the compliance costs of the
required disclosure is the presence of foreign operations and the complexity of dealing with, or
the need to create compatible employee data and payroll systems that track the compensation of
employees of such foreign operations. 529 Underscoring the importance of foreign operations for
the costs of compliance with the rule, one commenter’s survey results indicate that the
compliance costs for registrants would decrease by a median of 50% or on average by 40% if only
U.S. employees were included in the calculation of the median compensation. 530 In addition,
most of the survey participants appear to have had at least some international operations. The
participants in the commenter’s survey on average operate in 34 countries (including the United
States) 531 and have about 38% of all employees and 44% of their full-time employees outside of

the United States. The survey reflected predominantly larger registrants and therefore may not
reflect the characteristics of a large number of registrants subject to Section 953(b) requirements.
Another commenter suggested that the cost of implementing the final rule would be 20-30 times
higher if foreign employees are included in the calculation of the median compensation. 532 Based
on these comments and survey results, we acknowledge that there may be significant differences
in the potential costs of the rule between registrants with foreign operations and registrants
without foreign operations.
Commenters have pointed out other potential cost drivers, such as including part-time,
seasonal, and temporary employees in the calculation of the median. However, the effect of these
other factors seems to be less significant. For example, one commenter’s survey results suggest
that the compliance costs for registrants would decrease by a median of 10% and on average by
11% if only full-time permanent employees are included in the determination of the median
compensation, compared to an expected median reduction of 50% or average reduction of 40% if
no foreign employees are included in the determination. 533
Some of the compliance costs outlined above may be ameliorated by the de minimis
exemption in the final rule that allows for some flexibility in identifying the median employee for
registrants that have employees in multiple countries. The final rule also provides a foreign data
privacy law exemption that should help to reduce the burden on registrants that operate in certain
foreign jurisdictions. For some registrants with small foreign operations, the de minimis
exemption and the foreign data privacy law exemption might greatly reduce the importance of
foreign operations as a driver of compliance costs.

195

Several commenters subject to the proposed rule provided compliance costs estimates
specific to their particular situation. Other commenters provided cost estimates for what appear to
be anonymous but real companies. 534 For all estimates received, we have used data available
from Standard and Poor’s Compustat, 535 to obtain or confirm information about the number of
employees at the registrant. Because, as noted above, certain registrants were not specifically
identified, we could not confirm or obtain their number of employees or use them to construct a
reliable cost-per-employee estimate, which is a key factor in our analysis below. Accordingly, we
decided to focus our analysis on those estimates where the registrant was identified, although we
have noted below what the impact on our estimates would be if we were to include the estimates
from the unidentified registrants whose employment data we cannot verify.
To estimate the potential compliance costs of the final rule, we analyze the detailed
information on compliance costs provided in comment letters from 10 registrants 536 and provide
an assessment, below, of how their estimates might relate more broadly to other affected
registrants. The reported expected costs vary in nature, but the common element among the
commenters is the cost associated with modifying current payroll or accounting systems to
compile the information necessary for the identification of the median employee and the
calculation of the employee’s compensation. In quantifying these and other reported potential

534

One commenter mentioned that “Company B,” a U.S. multinational manufacturer with approximately
130,000 employees in about 275 locations worldwide, including 30,000 employees in the United States and
100,000 overseas expects that the cost to build the global human resources information system needed to
comply with the proposed rule would exceed $18 million. See letters from NAM I and NAM II. Another
commenter mentioned that one survey respondent with over 50,000 employees across 69 countries described
the costs of data gathering as over $10 million. See letter from Corporate Secretaries. The commenter only
notes that the survey respondent has over a certain number of employees.

costs, when registrants presented a range of cost estimates, we use the mid-range value (i.e., if a
registrant indicated that its costs would range from $0.5 million to $1 million, we use $0.75
million in the analysis). 537 When registrants indicated that they expect to incur at least a certain
dollar amount of costs, we use that value in our estimation, and, as such, this represents a lower
bound because we have no way of estimating the top of their range (i.e., if a registrant indicated
that its costs would be at least $0.5 million, we use $0.5 million in the analysis).
One commenter provided costs in terms of the number of hours rather than in dollar value
terms. 538 In this case, we converted the hours into a dollar amount using the hourly rates reported
in one commenter’s survey, 539 according to which the median respondent expected to incur the
cost of $700 per hour to comply with the proposed rule. This rate is higher than our estimate of
$400 per hour for professional costs in the PRA section of the Proposing Release, and we believe
it may overestimate the costs of compliance with the final rule. We continue to believe that $400
per hour is the appropriate rate to use for PRA purposes as this reflects the average cost for
outside professional services for all registrants, including smaller and mid-sized registrants.
Nevertheless, we have used the $700 per hour rate here to be conservative in our estimates and
because the commenter in question is a large registrant with globally diversified operations. The
estimate of $700 per hour for outside compliance counsel may be justified for a certain type of
registrant with certain size and characteristics but may not be representative of all registrants. We
also note that we have monetized the commenter’s entire hourly estimate using the $700 per hour
rate. This likely overstates the actual dollar value of these costs, as we expect that some of the
537

Since commenters provided no information on how likely it is that the costs would be close to the lower or
upper bound of the range, we believe that using the midpoint of the range would provide a reasonable cost
estimate.

compliance burden of the final rule will be carried internally by the registrant (e.g., using the
registrant’s existing workforce) and at rates significantly lower than $700 per hour.
The 10 registrants that quantified expected registrant-wide compliance costs tend to be
large registrants (in terms of both assets and revenues) and have globally diverse operations, and
as such, may not be representative of the costs incurred by smaller registrants or registrants that
do not have foreign operations. Thus, we restrict the use of the information provided by them to
estimate the expected compliance costs for only registrants subject to the requirements that we
identify as having foreign operations. Since we believe that the compliance costs will be
generally proportionate to the size of the registrant’s work force, we calculate the cost per
employee using the number of employees reported for fiscal year 2013. 540
For the 10 registrants with compliance cost estimates, we estimate the ratio of
“Compliance cost estimates” to “Number of employees.” We then take the median ratio and use
it to estimate the expected initial compliance costs for registrants with U.S.-based operations and
registrants with foreign operations. We use the median instead of the average to diminish the
influence of outliers. The individual estimates and the average and median are presented in the
table below. We estimate that the average cost-per-employee for these registrants would be
$50.70 and the median cost-per-employee would be $38.04. The average cost per registrant is
approximately $971,500, while the median is $750,000. 541 We note that the 10 registrants in this

540

This assumption implies that all compliance costs are variable. It is possible that some compliance costs
have a fixed component (i.e., payroll system configuration costs and training), and thus compliance costs per
employee may be higher for small and mid-size firms with globally diversified operations than for globally
diversified large firms, which may result in adverse effects on competition to the extent that the former are
not SRCs and are not covered by the de minimis or foreign data privacy exemptions. Data on the number of
employees and revenues is taken from Standard and Poor’s Compustat.

541

Our estimate of the cost per registrant aggregates the cost of outside professional services and monetized
internal burden hours. One commenter referred to an average cost of $311,800 per registrant to comply with
the pay ratio provision. The commenter also estimated that the median registrant would require 1,825

198

analysis are larger than the average and median registrant subject to the final rule. To adjust for
differences in registrant size, we make the assumption that the compliance costs of the rule will be
proportionate to the size of the registrant’s work force, which enables us to use the cost-peremployee ratio to estimate the potential compliance costs of affected registrants.

We estimate the aggregate costs for the 3,571 registrants to whom the rule will apply,
including both registrants with U.S.-based operations and registrants with foreign operations,
using data from Standard and Poor’s Compustat. We classify registrants as having foreign

internal burden hours to comply with the rule. These estimates are based on companies with operations in
more than 50 countries that averaged 90 different employee data systems. See letter from Chamber II.
542

If we were to include the data for the anonymous registrants in the NAM I / NAM II letters and the
Corporate Secretaries letter, the median would be $51.07. We note that the data for the anonymous
registrant in the Corporate Secretaries letter did not specify a single number of employees, indicating instead
that registrant had over 50,000 employees, thus making it difficult to compute a cost per employee ratio
without additional assumptions. We assume that the number of employees of that anonymous registrant was
50,000 and its compliance cost was $10 million.

199

operations if they report having at least one geographical segment outside the United States. If
they report only U.S.-based segments, then we classify them as having U.S.-based operations
only. We note several challenges in calculating these estimates. First, 13 of both the registrants
with foreign operations and the registrants with U.S.-based operations only do not report the total
number of employees. For these registrants, we impute the total number of employees by using
the median number of employees for the registrants with foreign operations and the registrants
with U.S.-based operations, respectively. Second, about 37% of affected registrants do not report
geographic segment data, so we cannot classify them as registrants with U.S.-based operations or
registrants with foreign operations. 543 We compare the total assets and total revenues of these to
the group of registrants with U.S.-based operations or registrants with foreign operations. These
registrants tend to more closely resemble the registrants with U.S.-based operations, so we
classify them as such. We recognize that this may underestimate the compliance cost for
registrants with non-U.S. operations that choose not to report geographic segments.
We estimate the initial compliance costs for the registrants with foreign operations by first
aggregating the number of employees across all such registrants and then multiplying that number
by the median estimated cost per employee, calculated as $38.04 in Table 2 above.
To estimate the expected costs for registrants with U.S.-based operations only, we rely on
one commenter’s survey results that indicate that the median decrease in registrants’ compliance
costs would be 50% if only U.S. employees are included in the determination of the median
employee compensation. 544 Thus, we assume that the expected compliance costs for registrants
with U.S.-based operations only will be 50% lower than the expected compliance costs for

Compustat, like most other databases, has incomplete coverage of small companies, and reporting
companies that do not trade on national exchanges.

registrants with foreign operations. Accordingly, we estimate the compliance costs for registrants
with only U.S.-based operations by multiplying the total number of employees across such
registrants by the (median estimated costs per employee * (1 - 0.5)), which is $19.02 per
employee. 545
Lastly, to estimate the total compliance costs for registrants that do not report geographic
segment data, which we reclassify as registrants with U.S.-based operations only, we first
determine whether we have information on their number of employees. 546 For the 973 registrants
that we reclassify as registrants with U.S.-based operations and for which we have information as
to their number of employees, we aggregate the total number of employees for those registrants
and multiply it by $19.02. For the other 335 registrants that we reclassify as registrants with U.S.based operations, we do not have information on the number of employees. As mentioned above,
these registrants are similar to registrants with U.S.-based operations with respect to total assets
and total revenues. Thus, to estimate the compliance cost for those registrants, we estimate the
median cost per registrant with U.S.-based operations only and multiply it by the number of such
registrants (335). To estimate the median cost per registrant with U.S.-based operations only, we
first multiplied $19.02 per employee by the number of employees of each of the 793 registrants
with U.S.-based operations only. We then found the median of those 793 amounts, which was
$27,008.40. Multiplying this number by the total number of registrants with missing employee
data (335), we reached a total cost estimate of $9,047,814. Consistent with other estimates in our
analysis, we used median costs rather than average costs to reduce the significance of outliers.
We believe that our approach to the estimate is more appropriate because, by using median

$38.04*(1-0.5) = $19.02

546

For about a third of registrants with missing segment data, Compustat reports no employee data.

numbers, we reduce the significance of outliers, but we acknowledge that had we instead
estimated based on average numbers, a significantly higher cost estimate for this group would
result. Our cost estimates are presented in Table 3 below.

If we had included the cost estimates of the anonymous registrants provided by two commenters in
calculating the median cost per employee ratio, as referenced above, the median cost per employee would be
$51.07, and the total compliance cost for all 3,571 registrants would have been $1,765 million. See letters
from NAM I, NAM II (providing the same estimate as in the NAM I letter), and Corporate Secretaries.

+ $140,908,795

Based on our calculations, the average initial cost of compliance for a registrant with
foreign operations is expected to be approximately $714,099 and for a registrant with U.S.-based
operations only is expected to be approximately $156,444. The total initial cost of compliance for
all 3,571 registrants affected by the Section 953(b) requirements is expected to be approximately
$1,315 million, which includes both internal company costs as well as the costs of outside
professionals. 548 Thus, we estimate the initial cost of compliance for the average registrant to be
approximately $368,159. 549
It is important to note that this estimate does not reflect the de minimis and foreign data
privacy exemptions, or the change to include only employees of consolidated subsidiaries, which
would lead to some cost reductions for some registrants and which we are not able to fully
quantify. Our cost estimate is higher than the survey estimate of $187 million for the cost of
outside professionals provided by one commenter, although we note that the commenter also
estimated, but did not monetize, an internal company burden of 800,870 hours. 550 Similarly, our
estimated cost is higher than the other commenter’s survey estimate of over $710 million,
although that commenter also estimated, but did not monetize, an annual compliance time of 3.6
million hours. 551
Next, we estimate the ongoing compliance costs. Unlike in the case of the initial

548

549

If average cost per registrant with U.S.-based operations ($156,444) were used in lieu of median for the 335
registrants with missing employee data ($27,008.40), the total cost would instead be estimated as
$1,049,725,402 + $124,060,347 + $131,860,981 + (335*$156,444) = $1,358 million.
$1,314,694,544/3,571 = $368,159.

compliance costs, we received very few specific estimates of the ongoing compliance costs from
commenters. One commenter suggested that ongoing annual costs would be approximately 28%
of the initial compliance costs. 552 Another commenter reported expected ongoing compliance
costs of 40%. 553 One commenter’s survey results suggest that the ongoing costs are expected to
be about 80% (mid-range) or 72% (average) of the initial compliance costs. 554 We note that some
compliance costs of the final rule, such as burden hours and professional costs associated with
making the disclosure, may remain consistent from year to year. Other compliance costs,
however, will largely be upfront fixed costs, such as those associated with the modification of
payroll or accounting systems to allow a registrant to compile the information and costs
associated with developing the methodology needed to identify the median employee and
calculate his or her pay. 555 Given these upfront fixed costs, it is likely that that part of the initial
compliance costs would decline after the first year.
The specific estimates provided by commenters (28% to 72%) 556 yield a range of ongoing
compliance cost estimates of between $368 million and $947 million per year, with the median of
the estimates provided by these commenters (40%) yielding an ongoing compliance cost of

552

See letter from ExxonMobil. The commenter stated that it expects 3,000 work hours for initial compliance
costs and 850 work hours for ongoing compliance costs. This suggests the ongoing compliance cost is
approximately 28.3% (850/3000) of the initial compliance costs.

553

See letter from FEI. According to this commenter, the initial compliance costs would be approximately
$250,000, while the ongoing compliance costs would be approximately $100,000, suggesting that the latter
is 40% of the former ($100,000/$250,000).

554

See letter from COEC I.

555

But see letter from Business Roundtable I (asserting that 42% of respondents to a survey indicated that they
would have to update their methodology every year). We note that ongoing costs of compliance may
represent a higher percentage of the initial costs of compliance for these respondents.

556

Other commenters made more general assertions about ongoing compliance costs, but because they did not
provide specific cost estimates, we did not include them in this calculation. See, e.g., letters from General
Mills (asserting that “most of the costs would also apply to subsequent years of compliance”) and Business
Roundtable I.

204

approximately $526 million per year. 557 We note, however, that the Proposing Release did not
provide registrants with the flexibility to identify the median employee every three years. We
assume these three estimates are based on the commenters’ reading of the Proposing Release, and
hence include the requirement that the median employee be identified every year.
d. Indirect Costs
Registrants covered by the final rule also could be affected by indirect costs. 558 They
could be at a competitive disadvantage to registrants (including private companies, foreign private
issuers, smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies) that are outside the scope
of the final rule. Some commenters suggested that the proposed rule would cause competitive
disadvantages for public companies, 559 U.S. companies, especially those with overseas
employees, 560 issuers with subsidiaries, 561 and issuers with low-wage workers. 562 In addition, we
understand from commenters that some registrants covered by the final rule would likely incur
higher costs of compliance based on size, business type, and level of integration of payroll and
benefits systems — such as large, multinational registrants that do not maintain integrated
employee compensation information on a global basis. 563 Therefore, the competitive impact of
compliance with the disclosure requirements prescribed by Section 953(b) could
disproportionately fall on U.S. registrants with large workforces and global operations, although
557

$1,315 million * 0.28 = $368 million; $1,315 million * 0.72 = $947 million; $1,315 million * 0.4 = $526
million.

558

We cannot precisely quantify the indirect costs because they depend on the registrant’s business structure
and competitive environment.

Corporate Secretaries, NAM I, NAM II.

See supra note 528.

205

the de minimis exemption and the foreign data privacy law exemption in the final rule would
likely reduce some of these compliance costs and the competitive effects of the final rule. While
we expect that the incremental impact of the fixed components of compliance costs will have a
lower impact on larger registrants than on smaller registrants, as discussed in the previous section,
the overall compliance costs will likely lessen after systems are in place to gather and verify the
underlying data, reducing the competitive effects of the final rule over the years. 564
Registrants subject to the final rule could also face a competitive disadvantage if their
competitors are able to infer proprietary or sensitive information from the disclosure of the
median of the annual total compensation of all employees. 565 For example, it could be possible in
some instances for a competitor to infer sensitive information about a registrant’s cost structure
based on information about median levels of employee compensation, especially for small
registrants operating in a single industry. While the final rule does not apply to smaller reporting
companies and emerging growth companies, we still estimate that at least 131 affected registrants
operated in a single business segment and had book value of assets less than $100 million in
2014. 566 As we noted above, a registrant subject to Section 953(b) could potentially be at a
competitive disadvantage when hiring or retaining a PEO if there is pressure to limit PEO wages
based on the pay ratio disclosure while non-covered registrants are not subject to the same
pressure. However, there may be other factors affecting the ability of a registrant to attract and

But see letters from Business Roundtable I (noting that 42% of respondents to a survey “indicated that they
expect having to update their pay ratio methodology every year because of changes to their business
organization or structure”) and COEC I (arguing that the burden hours and professional costs may decrease
after the first year but not by the estimated 50% in the Proposing Release).

565

See letter from Prof. Ray. But see letter from Capital Strategies (stating, on the contrary, that competitors
will not be able to decipher any proprietary or sensitive information from the pay ratio disclosure).

One of the commenters indicated that 55% of the respondents in a survey of members it
conducted anticipated indirect costs (i.e., adverse impact on sales, brand damage, increased public
relations costs etc.) 567 Although we acknowledge the possibility of these indirect costs, we cannot
quantify them and lack sufficient data to analyze them.
3. Other Economic Effects
Several commenters indicated that the pay ratio rule would promote economic
efficiency. 568 In contrast, one commenter argued the rule would inhibit economic efficiency
without providing specific details. 569 As noted above, the pay ratio disclosure is not well suited to
compare pay practices across registrants, and thus, it is unclear whether the final rule would affect
economic efficiency. Some commenters suggested that registrants may decide to alter their pay
structure or workforce structure in ways that are different from their efficient labor market
decisions. 570 For example, one commenter suggested that registrants may decide to shift their
labor force to workers employed by a third party or reduce their foreign operations. 571 Also, the
567

See letter from Corporate Secretaries.

568

See, e.g., letters from Capital Strategies (asserting that “The proposed rules would promote market
efficiency as they would steer investors to the best value CEO, that is, the one producing the most returns for
the least pay, when compared to peers.”), Change to Win (asserting that CEO pay increases have been
driven by rent seeking behavior and “if in fact the disclosures provided by Section 953(b) do induce more
investors to insist on limiting executive pay, this will result in increased, rather than reduced, economic
efficiency”), and Form Letter D (“Disclosure of the pay ratios will help the capital markets better allocate
capital to those companies that invest in their workforces.”).

569

See letter from NIRI.

570

See, e.g., letters from CEG (stating that the rule can be “gamed by outsourcing lower wage jobs”), NIRI
(stating that the rule will adversely impact “U.S. states and cities with lower labor costs”), and Prof. Ray
(arguing that employers will change their corporate structure or employment arrangements as a response to
the pay ratio rule).

571

See letter from Lou (“[S]ome companies will be incentivized to outsource poorly paid jobs to increase the
median payment number. The flip side is the increase of administrative cost and losses of profits generated
by the to-be-outsourced department. Or companies will reduce workforce in their foreign subsidiaries where
the labor cost is relatively low. But obviously this reduction sacrifices the low labor cost advantage.
Therefore the proposal does not motivate CEOs to maximize companies’ interests.”).

207

same commenter asserted that registrants may change the relative wages of employees in a way
that increases the median employee pay while reducing the pay of employees below the median
employee in the pay distribution. 572 Another commenter asserted that pressure for a registrant to
maintain a low pay ratio could also curtail the expansion of business operations into lower cost
geographies. 573 We expect that such changes, if they were to occur, would move the registrant
away from efficient business practices and could result in inefficient outcomes. Other
commenters suggested, however, that workforce restructuring in response to the pay ratio
disclosure was not likely. 574 While we believe that registrants are unlikely to make critical labor
decisions solely to impact the pay ratio disclosure, we cannot assess the prevalence of such effects
at this time because these commenters did not quantify or otherwise provide data relevant to the
expected changes in business practices.
D. Economic Effects from Exercise of Discretion
1. General
In this section, we discuss the choices we have made in implementing the statutory
requirements and the associated economic effects, including the likely benefits and costs and the
likely impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. In addition to the statutory
benefits and costs described above, we believe that the use of our discretion in implementing the
statute could result in benefits and costs to registrants and users of the pay ratio disclosure.

572

Id.

573

See letter from Prof. Ray (providing the example of a firm that might prefer to hire in the U.S. rather than in
India because a strong exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee will make the Indian wages
appear low and can lead to high pay ratio if the firm hires employees in India).

574

See letters from ABA (asserting that registrants would not incur the related costs to alter their organizational
structure or workforce in order to improve their pay ratio disclosure), Capital Strategies (asserting that the
definition of “all employees” would not cause registrants to alter their corporate structure or employment
arrangements), and WorldatWork I (same).

208

In general, the final rule implementing Section 953(b) is designed to comply with the
statutory mandate. In light of the significant potential costs that commenters attribute to the
requirements of Section 953(b), 575 we believe that it is appropriate for the final rule to permit
registrants certain flexibility in calculating the pay ratio, which we believe should help lower the
costs of compliance generally while still providing the information directed by Section 953(b). In
addition, the final rule generally seeks to implement Section 953(b) without imposing additional
requirements that are not mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. In this respect, the final rule reflects
our consideration of the relative costs and benefits of a more flexible approach as opposed to a
more prescriptive approach.
In evaluating alternatives, we considered whether to adopt a rule that would be
prescriptive enough that the resulting pay ratio disclosure would be more directly comparable
across registrants. As noted above, we believe that comparability of the ratio across registrants
has significant limits, due to the variety of factors that could influence the ratio. We believe that
providing a flexible approach would not significantly diminish the potential benefits of the
mandated disclosure and would achieve the purposes that Congress intended at a significantly
reduced burden for registrants. In this respect, we note that some commenters indicated that the
expected benefits of pay ratio disclosure derive from its ability to facilitate a company-specific
assessment, by providing a metric by which a PEO’s compensation can be evaluated within the
context of that particular company. 576 We also acknowledge that some commenters that support
the pay ratio disclosure suggested that it could be used to compare compensation practices

between registrants and/or for the same registrant over time. 577 We note, however, that using the
ratios to compare compensation practices between registrants, and for a registrant over time (e.g.,
in the case of business acquisitions or significant structural or business model changes), without
taking into account inherent differences in business models between registrants and for a
registrant over time, which may not be readily available information, could potentially lead to
unwarranted conclusions.
2. Implementation Choices and Alternatives
a. Filings Subject to the Pay Ratio Disclosure Requirements
Commenters suggested that the final rule should apply only to those filings for which the
applicable form requires Item 402 disclosure. 578 Some commenters stated that requiring pay ratio
disclosure in every filing would be unnecessary and even confusing. 579 The final rule follows the
proposed approach to require pay ratio disclosure in filings described in Item 10(a) of Regulation
S-K that require executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K.
We believe that requiring pay ratio disclosure in filings that do not contain other executive
compensation information would not present this information in the most meaningful context.
Some commenters asserted that the pay ratio disclosure would provide another metric to evaluate

Walden, and WA State Investment Board.

579

See, e.g., letters from ABA (“In our view, it is neither reasonable nor sensible to mandate the inclusion of
pay ratio disclosure in filings where no other executive compensation disclosure required by Item 402 will
appear to provide meaningful context.”) and PM&P (“Providing such information in multiple filings (e.g.,
registration statements, annual reports or other filings) throughout the year is unnecessary and would dilute
the usefulness, if any, of the disclosure.”).

210

executive compensation disclosure, 580 and we believe that the intended purpose of the disclosure
is to provide new data points that shareholders can use when exercising their new voting rights
under Section 951. We believe that the pay ratio disclosure would be presented in a more
meaningful context if it were accompanied by other Item 402 information, such as the Summary
Compensation Table required by Item 402(c) and the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
required by Item 402(b). Therefore, we believe that this choice preserves the intended benefits of
Section 953(b) while reducing reporting costs relative to a requirement to include pay ratio
disclosure in every filing, including in filings that do not require other Item 402 information.
b. Registrants Subject to the Pay Ratio Disclosure Requirements
We recognize that the reference to “each issuer” in Section 953(b) could be interpreted to
apply to all registrants. However, as a result of the specific reference in Section 953(b) to the
definition of “total compensation” contained in Item 402(c)(2)(x) and the absence of
Congressional direction to apply this requirement to registrants not previously subject to Item
402(c) requirements, the final rule does not apply to registrants that are not subject to Item 402(c)
requirements. Thus, smaller reporting companies, foreign private issuers, and MJDS filers are
excluded. In addition, Congress exempted emerging growth companies from the requirement in
the JOBS Act.
We considered a number of alternative approaches. We considered whether a broader
reading of the statute was warranted in the context of SRCs as suggested by some commenters. 581

580

See supra note 34.

581

See, e.g., letters from CII (indicating that two of three CII members that commented on the proposed rule
“were ‘not comfortable’ with the proposed exemption from the pay ratio disclosure requirements for
emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies, foreign private issuers, and MJDS filers”), Ray
(“To support Congress’s demand for greater pay-related disclosures, I strongly suggest for the Commission
to expand the disclosure requirement to ensure that all smaller reporting companies disclose their pay
ratio.”), and US SIF (“While we understand the SEC’s reasons for several exemptions from the proposed

211

However, most commenters agreed with the approach to exclude SRCs from the requirements. 582
Commenters either argued that these registrants are not currently required to provide a Summary
Compensation Table under Item 402(c) and therefore should not be required to comply with the
pay ratio rule 583 or cited high costs of compliance. 584 Requiring SRCs to provide the pay ratio
disclosure consistent with the requirement for other registrants would require them to collect data
and calculate compensation for the PEO in a manner they otherwise would not do, and there
would be some incremental costs in doing so. However, these incremental costs may be limited
to the extent that smaller reporting companies are less likely to have defined benefit and actuarial
pension plans. 585 In contrast, the costs of complying with the other requirements prescribed by
Section 953(b)—namely, identifying the median employee and calculating annual total
compensation for that employee—are more extensive. We can estimate those costs using the
approach and estimates we made in the “Quantification of Compliance Costs” section above. We
identify 2,958 registrants as SRCs that are not EGCs as of the end of fiscal year 2014. Of these,
494 have data on segments and number of employees in Compustat. Following the approach in
the “Quantification of Compliance Costs” section above, we use information on international
geographic segments reported in Compustat to identify registrants with and without international
operations. Of the 2,958 SRCs, 212 have foreign operations and 282 have U.S.-based operations

rule for emerging growth companies, smaller companies and foreign private issuers, we are, nonetheless,
uncomfortable with these proposed exemptions.”).

only; the rest does not have segment data in Compustat. 586 We next obtain the total number of
employees for SRCs with foreign operations and SRCs with U.S.-based operations only from
Compustat. We apply the respective “compliance cost per employee” ratios for registrants with
foreign and U.S.-based operations only estimated in section “Quantification of Compliance
Costs” above to estimate the average and total compliance costs for SRCs with foreign operations
and SRCs with U.S.-based operations only. We reclassify the remaining 2,464 registrants as
SRCs with U.S.-based operations only because our analysis suggests that registrants that are not
covered by Compustat are usually smaller companies without foreign operations. Consistent with
our methodology for Table 3, to estimate the total compliance costs for SRCs that do not report
segment data, which we reclassify as SRCs with U.S.-based operations only, we estimate their
total number of employees and multiply it by $19.02. For those SRCs we reclassify as SRCs with
U.S.-based operations only that do not have employee data available, we estimate the median cost
per SRC with U.S.-based operations only and multiply it by the number of such registrants. The
table below presents our estimates of the compliance costs of SRCs with foreign operations and
SRCs with U.S.-based operations only, as well as total compliance costs for SRCs.

TOTAL

Our decision not to require SRCs to comply with the pay ratio disclosure requirements
prescribed by Section 953(b) would save the average SRC with foreign operations approximately
$10,816, and the average SRC with U.S.-based operations only approximately $6,045. We note
that these cost savings are the savings from not having to identify the median employee and
calculate the total compensation for that employee. Those cost savings from exercise of our
discretion with respect to SRCs total approximately $10 million. 587 We expect there also would
be cost savings from not having to calculate PEO compensation pursuant to Item 402, but we are
unable to quantify those savings.
587

If average cost per SRC with U.S.-based operations were used in lieu of median for registrants with missing
data, the total cost savings would instead be estimated as $2,293,051 + $1,704,668 + $4,674,203 +
1,314*$6,045 = $16.62 million.

214

To the extent that these costs have a fixed component that does not depend on the
registrant’s size of operations, the compliance burden for small registrants may be
disproportionately large. 588 Moreover, small companies are more likely to operate in a single
geographic or business segment, making the disclosure of the median employee pay more likely
to reveal sensitive or proprietary information that can put these registrants at a competitive
disadvantage.
We also considered expanding the coverage of the final rule to registrants, such as foreign
private issuers and MJDS filers, which are not currently required to provide Item 402 disclosure.
Most commenters agreed with the exclusion of foreign private issuers and MJDS filers, 589 but
other commenters expressed concerns about excluding them. 590 Although quantifying the costs to
these registrants of calculating PEO compensation under Item 402(c)(2)(x) or of complying with
the requirements prescribed by Section 953(b) is not currently feasible because of lack of data, we
assume that these costs (and in particular the costs of computing the median employee) could be
significant. In particular, these costs may be higher for foreign private issuers and MJDS than for
SRCs because these registrants are not currently required to provide any Item 402 disclosure.
Based on a review of EDGAR filings for calendar year 2014, we estimate that there are
approximately 677 foreign private issuers filing on Form 20-F and 143 MJDS filers filing on form
40-F that will benefit from the exclusion from the pay ratio disclosure requirements.

588

See letter from Vivient (“From a cost standpoint, requiring smaller reporting companies to disclose the pay
ratio would create a significant cost and administrative burden. Given the size of their employee population
and administrative budget, very few smaller reporting companies employ full-time senior level human
resource professionals who could be assigned the responsibility of complying with the proposed ruling.”).

Strategies, Davis Polk, Hay Group, and PM&P.

c. Employees Included in the Determination of the Median
Section 953(b) requires disclosure of the median of the annual total compensation of “all
employees of the issuer.” Consistent with that mandate, the final rule includes in the definition
of “employee” or “employee of the registrant” any U.S. and non-U.S. full-time, part-time,
seasonal, or temporary worker (including officers other than the PEO) employed by the registrant
or any of its subsidiaries as of the last day of the registrant’s last completed fiscal year.
Additionally, as set forth above, we are excluding from the determination of the median
employee any workers who are not employed by the registrant or its consolidated subsidiaries,
such as independent contractors and “leased” workers who are employed by, and whose
compensation is determined by, an unaffiliated third party.
i. Types of Employees
Commenters were generally split on whether the rule should include part-time, seasonal,
or temporary employees. A number of commenters agreed with the proposed requirements to
include part-time, temporary, and seasonal workers because of Section 953(b)’s reference to “all
employees” and believed that excluding these employees would distort the pay ratio by rendering
it incomplete or misleading. 591 Other commenters suggested that the final rule should exclude
part-time, seasonal, or temporary employees. These commenters asserted that compensation for
these employees is not comparable to full-time employees, so their inclusion would distort the pay
ratio. 592 Some commenters believed that the final rule should exclude part-time, seasonal, or
temporary employees because the potential benefits from including them would not justify the

216

high costs. 593 Another commenter recommended that the final rule should exclude part-time,
seasonal, and temporary employees unless a majority of a registrant’s employees work on a parttime, temporary, and/or seasonal basis. 594
The final rule requires registrants to include part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees
when identifying the median employee. We could have chosen an alternative approach, namely
to allow registrants to base their pay ratio disclosure on full-time employees only. This approach
would have led to a lower cost of compliance. According to one survey, such flexibility would
have generated median savings of approximately 10% in compliance costs. 595 Applying this
estimate to our compliance cost estimate of $1,315 million, had we chosen this alternative the
total compliance costs would have been approximately $1,183.5 million, or savings of
approximately $131.5 million. According to another commenter, excluding part-time employees
could reduce costs of compliance by 20%, which would raise the estimate of potential cost
savings to approximately $263 million.596 Another commenter noted that more than 30 percent of
respondents to its survey believe that limiting the median employee calculation to full-time

593

See letters from COEC I (“Nearly all firms, 122 of 128, have part-time and/or seasonal employees. With
this in mind, two-thirds of survey respondents to the survey indicated that limiting the application of the
proposed pay ratio rules to full-time employees only would reduce their costs. The average savings for these
respondents would be approximately 20 percent.”), General Mills (which estimated that approximately 13%
of their employees are part-time, seasonal or temporary), and WorldatWork II (recommending exclusion of
part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees from the pay ratio).
According to one of the commenters, the average percentage of full-time employees reported by survey
respondents was 86% (mid-range was 95%). See letter from COEC I. Another commenter estimates the
average (median) percentage of full-time employees to be 87% (95%). See letter from Corporate
Secretaries. Based on BLS data, approximately 81% of workers were employed full time as of 2014. See
BLS Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey, available at
http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat12.htm. We note that BLS data incorporates workers at a broader range of
firms, including privately held firms and small firms, which may not be representative of the composition of
the workforce at the registrants subject to the final rule.

employees would yield cost savings of more than 10 percent and an additional 18 percent of
respondents believe that limiting the median employee calculation to full-time employees will
yield cost savings of more than 20 percent. 597 Despite these potential cost savings, we are not
adopting this alternative. Several commenters argued that excluding part-time, temporary, and
seasonal workers from the definition of “employee” would make the disclosure incomplete and/or
not representative of the registrant’s actual workforce. 598 We agree and have concluded, as
discussed more fully in section B.1.a. above, that this approach could significantly undermine the
intent of the rule to allow a company-specific assessment of a registrant’s compensation practices
with respect to “all employees”.
ii. Workers Not Employed by the Registrant (i.e., Leased Workers)
The final rule, as proposed, excludes independent contractors and “leased” workers who
are employed by, and whose compensation is determined by, an unaffiliated third party.
Commenters generally supported this approach. 599 As discussed, we believe excluding such
workers is appropriate because registrants generally do not control the level of compensation that
these workers are paid.
We recognize that it is possible that a registrant could alter its corporate structure or its
employment arrangements to reduce the number of employees covered by the final rule and,
therefore, reduce its costs of compliance or alter its pay ratio disclosure to achieve a particular
objective. For example, a registrant could choose to use only independent contractors or “leased”
workers instead of hiring employees. A registrant could also choose to outsource some aspects of

its business to achieve similar objectives. Although one commenter asserted that registrants
would change their corporate structure or employment arrangements based on the definition of
“employee,” 600 other commenters questioned the likelihood of this behavior. 601 We cannot
quantify the expected prevalence of this behavior. However, given the inherent complexities
involved in altering a registrant’s corporate structures or employment arrangements, we do not
expect that many registrants would undertake such changes merely for the purposes of lowering
compliance costs or achieving a particular pay ratio.
iii. Employees of Consolidated Subsidiaries
As discussed above, of the commenters that discussed whether to include employees of a
subsidiary, the majority recommended that the final rule require registrants to include only
employees of certain types of subsidiaries, in particular consolidated or wholly-owned
subsidiaries. 602 One of those commenters claimed that there would be a median increase in
compliance costs of approximately 20% if the final rule included employees of all minorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures. 603 Another commenter argued that limiting the final rule
to consolidated subsidiaries would reduce costs and burdens and is consistent with Rule 405 of
the Securities Act and Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 604
The final rule defines “employee” to include only the employees of the registrant and its
consolidated subsidiaries rather than employees of subsidiaries that were affiliates it controlled

directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, as set forth in the definition of
“subsidiary” under both Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. This change will
affect registrants that have unconsolidated subsidiaries with a significant number of workers.
We believe that excluding employees of unconsolidated subsidiaries may provide a better
representation of the compensation practices of the registrant itself since the compensation
provided by unconsolidated subsidiaries may be beyond the control of the registrant covered by
Section 953(b).
Based on our analysis of Compustat firms for calendar year 2014, excluding firms
identified as emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies, foreign private issuers,
and MJDS filers, approximately 23% of firms reported positive equity investments in
unconsolidated subsidiaries, 605 with the median investment of approximately 1.7% of the book
value of total assets. The majority of the firms were in the financial, regulated utilities, and oil
and gas industries. We lack information on the number of employees at unconsolidated
subsidiaries to quantify the potential magnitude of their effect on the pay ratio disclosure.
We also reviewed Exhibit 21 to the annual reports on Form 10-K, which contains
subsidiary information, for a sample of 24 firms that submitted individual unique comment letters
pertaining to the proposal. The median number of subsidiaries in that set of firms was
approximately 31. Only three registrants explicitly identified the number of consolidated
subsidiaries, with the median being approximately 36. The registrants we studied may not be
random as firms with more subsidiaries may be more likely to submit a comment letter. The
information in the exhibits indicates that some firms have complex organizational structures but it

605

Our analysis excludes investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for by the cost method as those
are not identified separately by filers in the data available to us.

220

does not allow us to systematically differentiate between consolidated and unconsolidated
subsidiaries.
The final rule allows registrants to exclude employees from unconsolidated subsidiaries
when identifying the median employee. This change from the proposed rule could lead to
significant cost savings. 606 First, limiting the definition in this way will result in a smaller pool of
employees from which to identify the median employee, thereby helping to reduce compliance
costs associated with this step. Second, registrants are more likely to maintain integrated systems
with their consolidated subsidiaries because these subsidiaries have to consolidate their financial
statements with those of the registrant, which should make it easier to collect and analyze the
relevant data. 607 Finally, as the consolidated subsidiary standard is commonly applied in other
disclosures, there may be less cost for registrants to identify subsidiaries relevant for the
disclosure. In summary, the final rule could provide a potential competitive advantage to
registrants with a significant percentage of the workforce at unconsolidated subsidiaries over
registrants with consolidated subsidiaries due to lower compliance costs associated with having
fewer workers covered by the rule.
We have attempted to quantify the expected decrease in compliance costs from the revised
definition of subsidiaries of the registrant, but did not obtain estimates on what these costs would
be. One commenter’s survey results suggested that compliance costs would increase by
approximately 20% (median) compared to the proposal if the final rule required registrants to

606

See, e.g., letters from ABA, COEC I (claiming that there would be a 91% increase on average in costs if
registrants were required to include all minority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in the definition of
“employee”), and Corporate Secretaries (survey reporting a median increase in costs of 20% if the definition
of “employee” included all minority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures of the registrants).

607

See letter from COEC I. The letter indicates that in the majority of cases, a registrant’s access to the
information necessary to calculate the pay ratio will only extend to wholly-owned subsidiaries that
consolidate their financial statements with those of the registrant.

221

include employees of all minority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. 608 However, the effect
of allowing registrants to exclude employees of unconsolidated subsidiaries on compliance costs
relative to the proposed rule is not clear from this estimate. In light of this uncertainty and
because we do not have other data available on the effects on the compliance cost estimate of the
exclusion of employees of unconsolidated subsidiaries versus the exclusion of “minority-owned
subsidiaries and joint ventures,” we are not reducing our initial cost estimates to account for the
change to only include employees of consolidated subsidiaries. We acknowledge that our
estimates may therefore overstate the compliance cost for companies with unconsolidated
subsidiaries. Although we are unable to estimate the magnitude of this cost savings, as noted
above, and consistent with the views of commenters, we believe that it could be significant for
some companies.
iv. Employees Located outside the United States
As discussed above, a number of commenters asserted that non-U.S. employees should be
included in the final rule. 609 Some who supported this view argued that the failure to include
foreign workers would substantially affect the pay ratio disclosure. 610 On the other hand, many
commenters indicated that including those employees would lead to significantly higher costs and
suggested that the final rule allow registrants to use only their U.S. employees when identifying

the median employee. 611 One commenter indicated that costs would be 20 to 30 times higher, or
hundreds of thousands of dollars higher if non-U.S. employees are included. 612 Other
commenters asserted that costs would decrease by over 50% 613 or 90% 614 if non-U.S. employees
are excluded. Another commenter indicated that nearly half of respondents to its survey expected
a U.S.-employee -only ratio to reduce compliance costs by more than 20 percent, while 29 percent
of respondents expected it would reduce compliance costs by more than 40 percent. 615
Comment letters addressing costs associated with including non-U.S. employees often
noted that multinational registrants have multiple payroll systems and databases for their
employees’ compensation that are difficult if not impossible to reconcile. 616 One commenter
indicated that it has 15 payroll systems that are not integrated, and those payroll systems would
have to be manually reconciled with “substantial costs” and “extensive staff hours.” 617 Another
commenter stated that it used 30 payroll systems that are not connected. 618 Yet another
commenter cited a Human Resource Policy Association survey indicating that 84% of
respondents could not easily calculate worldwide enterprise cash compensation for all their
employees. 619

identifying the median employee, other than the limited exceptions described below. One
commenter 620 estimated that the average company in a survey it conducted had 40% of its
workforce located outside the United States and recommended a principles-based approach that
would permit registrants to exclude up to and exceeding 40% of their employee population. This
commenter estimated that permitting registrants to exclude non-U.S. employees would reduce
compliance costs by 47%. Another commenter estimated that the median decrease in the
compliance costs for registrants with foreign operations would be approximately 50% if the final
rule excluded non-U.S. employees. 621 Given our estimate of aggregate initial compliance costs
for registrants with foreign operations of approximately $1,050 million, had we instead excluded
non-U.S. employees, the survey results suggest such registrants’ initial compliance costs would
instead be $525 million.
v. Foreign Data Privacy Law Exemption
The final rule also provides a foreign data privacy exemption that gives registrants the
ability to exclude from their median employee computation non-U.S. employees in jurisdictions
in which data privacy laws or regulations prohibit the use or transfer of the necessary information
required to comply with the final rule. According to one commenter’s survey, 45.8% of
respondents anticipated “being prohibited or limited by non-U.S. data privacy laws” in their
efforts “to access information necessary to collect data to identify the median employee or make
the pay ratio calculation.” 622 The foreign data privacy exemption may lower the costs of
calculating the pay ratio for registrants with employees in such jurisdictions, although we do not
have data from which to estimate the magnitude of the cost savings. We recognize that it may

also affect the median employee compensation determination. For example, based on the latest
available Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data for 2012, U.S. multinational companies were
estimated to have approximately 11.5% of their employees at foreign affiliates in the EU, 3.2% in
Canada, 4.2% in China, 3.7% in Mexico, 1.4% in Japan, and 2.6% combined in Switzerland,
Australia, Argentina, Russia, and Singapore. Lower estimates are obtained when only majorityowned foreign affiliates are considered. Each of these jurisdictions was identified by commenters
as having laws that may prohibit or restrict the transfer of information necessary to make the pay
ratio calculation. 623 To the extent that data privacy restrictions may be present both in highincome and low-income jurisdictions, the direction of the effect of the exemption on the pay ratio
is ambiguous and may vary from registrant to registrant. To the extent that registrants with nonU.S. workers in jurisdictions with data privacy laws would have experienced a significantly
higher cost of calculating the pay ratio than registrants with the same percentage of non-U.S.
workers but in jurisdictions without such laws, this change from the proposed rule mitigates the

potential adverse competitive effects of the pay ratio disclosure requirement on registrants with
non-U.S. workers in jurisdictions with data privacy laws. Consistent with a commenter’s
suggestion, 624 the final rule requires registrants to obtain a legal opinion from counsel in that
jurisdiction on the inability of the registrant to obtain or process the information necessary for
compliance with the final rule without violating that jurisdictions’ laws or regulations governing
data privacy, including the registrant’s inability to obtain an exemption or other relief under any
governing laws or regulations. The legal opinion must be filed as an exhibit with the filing in
which the pay ratio disclosure is included.
The exemption could potentially provide a competitive advantage to registrants with a
significant overall percentage of the workforce located in jurisdictions with data privacy laws
over other registrants due to lower compliance costs associated with having fewer workers
covered by the rule. However, the limited and tailored nature of the exemption, as well as the
reduction or elimination of the de minimis exemption for registrants that exclude employees under
the foreign data privacy exemption, as discussed below, mitigates this possibility.
vi. De Minimis Exemption
While we define the term “employee” to include any U.S. and non-U.S. employee of a
registrant, the final rule provides for a de minimis exemption for employees in foreign countries,
up to 5% of a registrant’s workforce, under certain conditions. 625 This type of exemption was
suggested by several commenters, 626 and it should provide cost savings to eligible registrants.

226

The suggested de minimis amount varied significantly across commenters. 627
In the June 4 Memorandum and June 30 Memorandum, staff attempted to quantify the
effects of the exemption. However, because staff lacked more specific information about
potentially affected registrants, including comprehensive data on the intra-company distribution
of compensation of these categories of employees at companies that may be subject to the rule,
the analyses necessarily relied on certain assumptions. Commenters also did not provide this
data.
The projections in the two staff memoranda were based on evidence obtained from other
studies, aggregate statistics, and other assumptions that may result in over- or underestimating the
magnitude of the effect on the pay ratio calculation. The memoranda made the following
assumptions: companies have excluded the percent of employees equal to the specified percentage
threshold; the distribution of pay is described by a lognormal distribution 628 (with various

627

See, e.g., letters from American Benefits Council (suggesting that a registrant be permitted to exclude nonU.S. employees in any foreign jurisdiction that comprises less than 5% of the issuer’s aggregate global
workforce), ExxonMobil (indicating that a registrant be permitted to exclude non-U.S. employees in a
foreign jurisdiction if the number of employees in that jurisdiction is less than 1% of the issuer’s total
workforce), FSR (recommending that non-U.S. employees be excluded if they account for less than 5% of
the registrant’s total workforce or employees in any single foreign jurisdiction if they comprise less than 2%
of total employees with an aggregate cap of 5% (if the registrant’s non-U.S. employees account for more
than 5% of all employees)), and NACCO (suggesting that a registrant be permitted to exclude non-U.S.
employees if they make up less than 20% of the employee population).

628

A commenter noted that a lognormal distribution may be inadequate for actual firms. See letter from Public
Citizen II. As we noted in the Proposing Release, registrants that have multiple business or geographical
segments may not necessarily have a lognormal distribution of pay. However, a distributional assumption is
necessary for the analysis because staff could not observe the actual distribution of wages within the affected
firms in the data available to them. This assumption is motivated by the positive skewness in dollar wages
and the distribution of log of wages approximating normal distribution. See, e.g., Blundell, R., Reed, H.,
Stoker, T., 2003, Interpreting aggregate wage growth: The role of labor market participation, AMERICAN
ECONOMIC REVIEW, Vol. 93(4), pp. 1114-1131; Measuring the distribution of wages in the United States
from 1996 through 2010 using the Occupational Employment Survey, BLS Monthly Labor Review, May
2014, http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/article/measuring-the-distribution-of-wages-in-the-united-statesfrom-1996-through-2010-using-the-occupational-employment-survey-1.htm). The assumptions used in this
analysis are for illustration purposes only. As we note, while the lognormal assumption may be appropriate
for some registrants, it may not be appropriate for all registrants. While one commenter suggested that the
final rule permit a registrant to determine the median employee based on an assumption that compensation is
lognormally distributed within a company or segment, we believe that registrants can and thus should

estimates of the standard deviation of the log of pay 629 that broadly incorporate the ranges of
estimates from the studies cited in the June 4 Memorandum, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, and 0.55 630); and the
level of PEO pay is independent of the exclusion threshold. The estimates of the effect on the pay
ratio calculation of excluding different percentages of employees were sensitive to the above
assumptions. 631
The June 4 Memorandum, under the assumptions above evaluated the effects on the pay
ratio calculation of excluding different percentages (between 1% and 20%) of pay observations
from a lognormal distribution for each set of assumptions about intra-company standard deviation
of the log of pay (σ) and for each of the two scenarios below concerning excluded pay
observations: Scenario I (all excluded observations are below the median for the underlying
distribution of pay); and Scenario II (all excluded observations are above the median for the

determine for themselves whether the use of a lognormal assumption is appropriate given their own
compensation distributions. See letter from TCA. The final rule does not specify any required methodology
for registrants to use in identifying the median employee and permits registrants the flexibility to choose a
method to identify the median employee based on their own facts and circumstances so long as a registrant's
methodology uses reasonable estimates. Indeed, more generally, we believe that it is appropriate for
registrants to make their own determinations about whether a particular methodological assumption
constitutes a reasonable estimate for their particular firms.
629

As we noted in the Proposing Release, each registrant would have a company-specific compensation
variance, which is impossible to be generally assumed.

630

Two commenters noted that these assumptions may understate the variability of employee pay within actual
publicly-traded companies, particularly companies with part-time, seasonal or temporary employees. See
letters from AFL-CIO II and Public Citizen II. As discussed in the June 4 memorandum, the above standard
deviation assumptions could understate intra-firm wage variation in employee pay, which would in turn
potentially understate the effects of the exclusion on the pay ratio. However, the staff lacked data on the
actual intra-firm distribution of wages for registrants affected by the final rule to perform additional analysis.

631

The letter from COEC III cites additional research on wage dispersion within and between firms not cited in
the June 4 Memorandum. See Jae Song, David J. Price, Fatih Guvenen, Nicholas Bloom, and Till von
Wachter, Firming Up Inequality, NBER Working Paper 21199, May 2015, available at
http://www.nber.org/papers/w21199 (“Song et al. (2015)”). The estimates of within-firm wage variation in
this paper are in a format from which the staff cannot directly infer the standard deviation estimates required
for its analysis, and the staff lacks access to the source data to compute these standard deviation estimates.
The paper concludes that within-firm wage inequality changed little over time, which is broadly similar to
the conclusion in Barth et al. (2014) based on a different dataset, cited in the June 4 Memorandum. The staff
analysis utilizes a range of standard deviation assumptions to illustrate the effects of various potential levels
of within-firm wage variability.

228

underlying distribution of pay). Under these scenarios, for a given standard deviation level, the
effect on the pay ratio is larger in magnitude when a larger percentage of employees are excluded.
For example, the exclusion of 5% of employees may cause the pay ratio to decrease by up to
3.4% in Scenario I or to increase by up to 3.5% in Scenario II (an aggregate range of 6.9%).
Under a 20% threshold, the pay ratio may decrease by up to 13% or increase by up to 15% (an
aggregate range of 28%), depending on the scenario considered.
The June 30 Memorandum extended the analysis contained in the June 4 Memorandum by
showing, under the same assumptions, the potential effects of excluding percentages greater than
20% and up to 95%. As expected, under the same assumptions, excluding a broader range of
exclusion thresholds (between 20% and 95%) yielded a larger magnitude of the effect on the pay
ratio for Scenarios I and II. In addition, the June 30 Memorandum included different intermediate
scenarios between Scenarios I and II, with some observations excluded from above the median
and some from below the median of the underlying distribution. 632 As expected, under the same
assumptions, including these intermediate scenarios yielded effects within the range delineated by
Scenarios I and II. 633

632

Specifically, the June 30 Memorandum included the following three scenarios: Scenario I(a) (75% of the
excluded observations are below the median, with the remaining 25% of the excluded observations above
the median); Scenario I(b) (50% of the excluded observations are below the median, with the remaining 50%
of the excluded observations above the median); and Scenario I(c) (75% of the excluded observations are
above the median, with the remaining 25% of the excluded observations below the median). See June 30
Memorandum. One commenter noted that non-random exclusion of low-paid employees would cause the
pay ratio estimate to decline more than random exclusion. See letter from Public Citizen II. Consistent with
the commenter, as the staff analysis demonstrates, exclusion scenarios in which over half of the excluded
workers are paid below the true median cause the pay ratio estimate to decline. As noted in the June 4
Memorandum, non-U.S. employees of U.S. multinational firms outside the United States on average receive
lower compensation than employees located inside the United States. See June 4 Memorandum. However,
for some firms with employees outside the United States in highly skilled occupations or firms with
employees in jurisdictions with high labor costs, some employees outside the United States may receive
higher compensation than U.S. employees.

633

We note that, if observations are equally excluded from either side of the median, the estimated effect is zero
regardless of the percentage of employees excluded from the distribution.

229

As the memoranda indicate, under the assumptions considered, excluding 5% of
employees yields an effect on the pay ratio in the range between -3.4% and 3.5%. 634
We further recognize that the estimates of the effects of the de minimis exemption on the
pay ratio are sensitive to the assumptions made and may understate or overstate the actual
magnitude of the effect if any of the above assumptions, for instance, the assumptions about
lognormal distribution or magnitude of intra-firm variation in wages, do not hold. If the affected
registrant’s true intra-firm distribution of the log of employee pay is not normal, depending on the
shape of the true distribution, the actual effects on the median may significantly differ from the
estimated effects reported in the memoranda. Importantly, if the true intra-firm distribution of
pay at an affected registrant deviates from the lognormal assumption, estimates of the effects
under these scenarios may correspondingly decrease in accuracy as the percentage of the excluded
observations increases.
We note that the de minimis exemption may not affect some registrants because not all
registrants will be eligible to use it or choose to use it to exclude up to 5% of the total workforce.
We also note that, in some instances, this exemption may result in the exclusion of employees
from jurisdictions with low pay, which may increase the difficulty of interpreting the pay ratio.
The requirements to disclose the jurisdiction(s) and the approximate number of employees from
each jurisdiction being excluded should mitigate this concern.
We have considered several reasonable alternatives to the final rule’s 5% de minimis
exemption. One alternative would be to apply a different de minimis threshold. A lower de
minimis percentage may increase registrants’ costs of calculating the ratio for workers in non-U.S.
634

As mentioned above, we lack information about the actual intra-firm distribution of pay for affected
registrants but, even if the true distribution is lognormal, we do not have information to know where the
effect may fall within the range.

230

jurisdictions. Lowering the de minimis threshold below 5% would not meaningfully reduce the
impact on the pay ratio under the assumptions in our analysis. A higher de minimis threshold
could yield potentially larger savings in the costs of calculating the ratio for registrants with
workers in non-U.S. jurisdictions. However, as seen in Table 1 in the June 4 Memorandum, such
a threshold would have a potentially larger effect on the pay ratio than the 5% threshold.
Specifically, as discussed above, under the assumptions made and depending on the scenario
considered, the exclusion of 10% of employees may decrease the pay ratio by up to 6.7% or
increase it by up to 7.2%; the exclusion of 15% of employees may decrease the pay ratio by up to
9.9% or increase it by up to 11%; the exclusion of 20% of employees may decrease the pay ratio
by up to 13% or increase it by up to 15%. Each of these alternatives thus could result in an
impact on pay ratio that is greater than the impact under the de minimis threshold. 635
Under alternative de minimis exemptions suggested by commenters, registrants would be
permitted to exclude non-U.S. employees in every foreign country that comprises less than 1% 636
or less than 5% 637 of the registrant’s aggregate global workforce. These alternative definitions of
the de minimis exemption can reduce calculation costs for U.S. multinational registrants with a
high level of international diversification in their workforce. However, they may potentially
result in the exclusion of a large percentage of employees at registrants with a large percentage of
non-U.S. employees diversified across countries, which may affect the pay ratio considerably, as
we indicate in the discussion above. These alternatives may also offer a larger relative
competitive advantage to internationally diversified U.S. registrants compared to U.S. registrants
with the same total percentage of non-U.S. employees concentrated in fewer countries and thus

ineligible for the exemption under these alternatives.
A different alternative exemption proposed by a commenter would permit registrants to
exclude all employees in any single foreign jurisdiction if they comprise less than 2% of total
employees, with an aggregate cap of 5% (if the registrant’s foreign employees account for more
than 5% of all employees). 638 The exemption in our final rule is defined more broadly than this
alternative definition and enables savings in calculation costs for a potentially larger fraction of
registrants with non-U.S. workers.
Registrants that are eligible for the de minimis exemption and choose to use it may have
lower compliance costs than registrants that do not use the exemption. 639 By excluding foreign
workers, the exemption makes eligible registrants with foreign operations more similar to
registrants with U.S.-based operations only and reduces the number of employees considered in
the identification of the median employee, with the effect of reducing compliance costs for the
eligible registrants. Relying on some reasonable assumptions, we are able to quantify some of the
cost savings from the de minimis exemption. First, we assume that all registrants with foreign
operations will use the exemption and eliminate 5% of their workforce. We also assume that the
savings in compliance costs are directly proportionate to the number of employees excluded and
that the compliance cost per excluded foreign employee is equal to the estimate for firms with
some foreign employees, $38.04. Using these assumptions and our estimates of the number of
registrants with foreign operations and the total number of employees for these registrants from
Table 3, the total savings from the use of the de minimis exemption would be approximately
638

See letter from FSR.

639

Some commenters noted that the staff analysis did not incorporate a cost-benefit analysis. See letters from
COEC III and WorldatWork II. Potential cost savings from the de minimis exemption are discussed in this
section. See Section III.D.2.c.iv, above, for a discussion of potential cost savings from the exclusion of all
non-U.S. employees. Commenters did not provide more detailed estimates of the cost savings from
excluding some but not all non-U.S. employees.

232

$52.5 million.640
We note that actual cost savings incrementally attributed to the de minimis exemption are
likely to be lower. Some registrants may have less than 5% of the total workforce outside the
United States. Other registrants may have more than 5% of the total workforce outside the United
States but less than 5% of the total workforce in aggregate across foreign jurisdictions in which it
can exclude employees under the de minimis exemption (with no more than 5% of the total
workforce in each such jurisdiction). The incremental cost savings from the de minimis
exemption are further reduced or potentially eliminated for registrants that exclude some
employees under the foreign data privacy exemption as such registrants may be ineligible for the
de minimis exemption or eligible for the exemption but unable to exclude employees at the
maximum level under the de minimis exemption due to the concurrent use of the foreign data
privacy exemption, concentrated nature of their non-U.S. workforce, or a combination of the two
factors. 641 Other registrants with non-U.S. workers may elect not to use the exemption. We also
note that the actual cost savings could vary significantly depending on whether cost savings
increase uniformly with the percent of employees excluded and whether registrants can exclude
any employees outside the United States under the foreign data privacy law exemption.
To the extent that registrants with non-U.S. workers experience a higher cost of
calculating the pay ratio than registrants with U.S. workers only and that the de minimis
640

The savings are calculated as 5% * (27,595,305 * $38.04) for firms with some foreign employees. Under
similar assumptions, if companies with foreign operations were permitted to exclude 10%, 20%, 30%, and
40% of their employees, respectively, potential cost savings could amount to that percentage multiplied by
(27,595,305 * $38.04) or $105 million, $210 million, $315 million, and $420 million, respectively. Actual
cost savings may differ if there are fixed costs associated with the inclusion of non-U.S. employees in the
pay ratio calculation. Another commenter estimated from a survey that the mid-range percentage of nonU.S. employees was 40% and that the mid-range cost savings from excluding all non-U.S. employees would
be 50%. See letter from COEC.

641

The final rule does not limit a registrant’s ability to rely on the foreign data privacy exemption, provided the
conditions of the exemption are met.

233

exemption reduces such costs, it reduces the potential adverse competitive effects of the pay ratio
disclosure requirement on registrants with non-U.S. workers eligible for the exemption.
Registrants with non-U.S. workers concentrated in fewer foreign jurisdictions are more likely to
exceed the 5% threshold for any single foreign jurisdiction and thus be ineligible for the
exemption than registrants with the same total percentage of non-U.S. workers diversified across
more foreign jurisdictions. If the inability to use the de minimis exemption increases the costs of
calculating the pay ratio significantly (for instance, when the overall percentage of non-U.S.
workers is higher than but relatively close to 5%), registrants with geographically concentrated
non-U.S. workers may be at a relative competitive disadvantage.
vii. Calculation Date
The final rule permits registrants to choose any date within three months of the end of
registrant’s fiscal year to identify the median employee for that year and requires registrants to
disclose the date used. Compared with prescribing a given date, such as the last day of the
completed fiscal year, as proposed, this approach may reduce compliance costs by providing
flexibility to registrants that may not have enough time to collect and report on their pay ratio
information at year-end. Commenters suggested that allowing registrants to select the date would
allow them to pick a date that does not coincide with other required reporting or that better
utilizes the internal resources of the registrants. 642 This approach also might reduce compliance
costs for registrants that use many employees at the end of the calendar year by permitting those
registrants to choose a date on which those seasonal or temporary employees are not employed. 643
Registrants in industries with more fluctuations in employment within the year due to seasonality

643

See, e.g., letters from American Benefits Council, NACCO, and PM&P.

234

may realize larger benefits from this approach. 644 Hence, it is possible that registrants could
choose a date and structure their employment arrangements around that date to reduce the number
of workers employed on the calculation date or to alter the reported ratio to achieve a particular
objective with the pay ratio disclosure. One commenter specifically addressed this issue and
noted its belief that this concern “is unwarranted, particularly if the choice is restricted to a
limited time period (such as the last fiscal quarter), since in general the employee population of a
registrant would not vary significantly over such a period.” 645 Another commenter suggested that
not allowing such an adjustment will produce “artificially low” median employee pay for
registrants that have many temporary and seasonal workers at year-end. 646 Yet another
commenter recommended allowing flexibility with respect to the measurement date but requiring
that the calculation include annual compensation of all employees employed at any time over the
preceding 365 days. 647 However, we note that such an alternative would increase the cost for
registrants with significant fluctuations in the number of employees within the year relative to the
final rule. Based on the comments we received, we believe that the rule as adopted will reduce
compliance costs compared to the proposed rule. However, we did not receive data that would
allow us to quantify the cost reduction.
644

For example, analysis by staff in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis of BLS employment statistics
by industry for 2014 revealed that the following sectors appear to have the largest employment fluctuations
due to seasonality, as proxied by the average magnitude of the percentage difference between seasonally
adjusted and not seasonally adjusted employment: arts, entertainment and recreation, educational services,
and construction, as well as administrative and support services, accommodation and food services (when
data for all months is used) and retail trade and warehousing and storage (when data for the final three
months is used, to account for the fiscal year end being December for the majority of registrants). See
http://www.bls.gov/data/#employment. Agricultural employment is excluded from the above calculations.
It is also likely to be subject to significant fluctuations within the year due to seasonality. We note that BLS
data may not be representative of the employment fluctuations within the year for the registrants subject to
the final rule and that the value of the flexibility to select the calculation date will vary across registrants.

235

d. Adjustments to the Compensation of Employees
The final rule includes an instruction that permits a registrant to annualize the
compensation for all permanent employees (full-time or part-time) employed on the calculation
date who did not work for the registrant for the full fiscal year. The final rule does not permit
annualization for employees in temporary or seasonal positions. The final rule also does not
permit the use of full-time-equivalent adjustments for any of a registrant’s employees in the
required pay ratio disclosure, although such adjustments are permitted to derive an additional
ratio if the registrant chooses. We believe that our approach provides appropriate
accommodations to registrants to represent the annual composition of their workforce without
significantly diminishing the potential usefulness of the disclosure mandated by Section 953(b).
We believe that by permitting annualization adjustments for permanent employees but not
seasonal or temporary ones, our approach more closely captures the composition of a registrant’s
workforce and compensation practices. For these annualizing adjustments to have any significant
impact on the reported pay ratio, both the fraction of permanent new hires to all employees of the
registrant and their annualized compensation would have to be relatively large. We also note that
some commenters were supportive of allowing annualizing adjustments. 648 One commenter
suggested that this adjustment will make the ratio more representative of the registrant’s labor
arrangements. 649 This procedure is purely optional and registrants do not need to annualize
compensation, such as if they believe that the additional cost of the adjustment does not warrant

648

See, e.g., letters from ABA, Corporate Secretaries, Intel, NACCO, PM&P, SH&P, and WorldatWork I.

649

See letter from Corporate Secretaries (“We believe that allowing annualizing adjustments effectuates the
Dodd-Frank Act requirement that each registrant disclose the median of the annual total compensation of its
employees. Such adjustments would result in a calculation that is closer to a fair and reasonable
representation of the registrant’s actual compensation practices and labor costs. The adjustment also would
help eliminate the potential distorting effects of mid-year hires, including those that result from a merger or
acquisition”).

236

the perceived benefit.
By permitting registrants to annualize compensation for these employees, the
comparability of disclosure across registrants could be reduced compared to an alternative of
either requiring or prohibiting such annualization. As noted above, however, we believe that
precise comparability of disclosure from registrant to registrant could be difficult to achieve due
to the variety of factors that could cause the ratio to differ. Accordingly, we do not believe that
the costs associated with promoting precise comparability would be justified.
Another alternative would have been to permit a registrant to annualize the compensation
for all temporary and seasonal employees who were employed for less than the full fiscal year and
to use that annualized compensation in the mandated pay ratio disclosure. Some commenters
supported this alternative and indicated that not allowing an annualizing adjustment for these
employees would distort the pay ratio. 650 Some commenters urged us to permit the use of fulltime equivalent adjustments for part-time employees, temporary, and seasonal employees. 651 The
final rule does not permit the mandated pay ratio disclosure to include either the use of annualized
adjustments for seasonal or temporary employees or the use of full-time-equivalent adjustments
for part-time employees. We believe that such adjustments would reflect a different workforce
composition and compensation structure than that utilized by the registrant. To the extent that a
registrant relies primarily on part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers, computing a ratio based
on their annualized compensation of temporary and seasonal workers or the full-time-equivalent
of a part-time worker, unlike annualizing adjustments for permanent employees, could have a
significant impact on the ratio.

Group, KBR, NIRI, and NYC Bar.

237

Although we are not permitting full-time-equivalent adjustments or annualization
adjustments for seasonal and temporary employees to be made for purposes of calculating the
annual total compensation in the mandated pay ratio disclosure, the final rule does permit
registrants to provide additional disclosure. For example, registrants can report additional ratios,
including ratios that reflect one or more of those adjustments, if they choose, provided that any
additional ratio is clearly identified, not misleading, and not presented with greater prominence
than the required ratio.
The final rule permits but does not require registrants to adjust compensation to the cost of
living in the PEO’s jurisdiction of residence. While some commenters stated that international
differences in the cost of living can distort the reported pay ratio, 652 one commenter suggested
that compensation is more directly comparable to the total compensation of a registrant’s PEO
without a cost-of-living adjustment. 653 Moreover, as some commenters suggested, 654 the cost-ofliving adjustment may alleviate concerns about pay comparability between U.S. employees and
those non-U.S. employees that are located in foreign countries where the purchasing power of the
average foreign pay in dollar terms deviates significantly from the purchasing power of the
average domestic pay in dollar terms.
Providing the option to use a cost-of-living adjustment is not expected to increase the
compliance cost for registrants. Country-level cost-of-living data is widely available. The
incremental cost of identifying the median employee based on pay without the cost-of-living
adjustment and calculating the pay ratio without the cost-of-living adjustment is expected to be
small once pay data for all employees or for samples of employees from individual countries have

been obtained. Thus, registrants that believe the cost-of-living adjusted ratio to be more
meaningful given the structure of their workforce may benefit from the option to present the pay
ratio with the cost-of-living adjustment as the ratio required by Item 402(u)(1)(iii).
The cost-of-living adjustment of the compensation of a registrant’s employees may have
an effect on the determination of the median employee and on the calculation of the pay ratio for
registrants with employees in countries whose cost of living differs from the cost of living in the
PEO’s country of residence. We are limited in our ability to quantify the impact of this
adjustment on the pay ratio calculation by our lack of data on the intra-firm distribution of pay of
employees outside the PEO’s country of residence for the affected registrants and by limited data
available to us on the distribution of employees by country at the individual registrant level. As
noted elsewhere, because we lack data regarding intra-firm distributions, we cannot predict the
effects of a cost-of-living adjustment on those distributions, as the adjustment may, in some cases,
have an effect on the combined employee pay distribution at the individual registrant level by
potentially changing the median employee within the same country or by locating the median
employee in a different country. We therefore analyze qualitatively the main factors that may
contribute to more significant effects of the cost-of-living adjustment on the determination of the
median employee and on the calculation of the pay ratio.
The cost-of-living adjustment option could affect the pay ratio calculation for registrants
with some employees located outside the PEO’s country of residence that elect to use this option.
The effect of the cost-of-living adjustment could be potentially larger for registrants with a larger
percentage of employees outside the PEO’s country of residence and for registrants with
employees in countries with a cost of living that differs significantly from the PEO’s country of
residence.

According to the results of one commenter’s survey, the average (median) respondent had
62% (60%) of its employees located in the United States. 655 According to another commenter’s
survey, approximately 55% of respondents reported having the majority of their employees
located in the United States. 656 As set forth in Table 3 above, out of the registrants potentially
subject to the final rule for which we have data on the presence of geographic segments, 657
approximately a third are estimated to have U.S.-based operations only and two-thirds are
estimated to have some non-U.S. operations. Based on aggregate BEA data on U.S. multinational
companies for 2012, 658 employees at foreign affiliates and at majority-owned foreign affiliates of
U.S. multinational companies comprised approximately 38% and 33-34%, respectively, of the
total employment of U.S. multinational companies. We note that the respondents in the surveys
cited above, companies that report geographic segments, and companies in the BEA sample may
not be representative of the full set of registrants subject to the final rule, and the PEO’s country
of residence may be different than the United States.
Based on aggregate BEA data on the distribution of employees of U.S. multinational
companies by country for 2012, 659 the majority of employees at foreign affiliates of U.S.
multinational companies were estimated to be located in the following regions: Europe (34%,
including 30% in the EU); Asia and Pacific (34%); and Latin America (20%). Looking at
individual jurisdictions, the most employees of foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational companies

(10.3%); Mexico (9.8%); Canada (8.4%); India (6.9%); Germany (4.9%); Brazil (4.6%); Japan
(3.7%); France (3.5%); and Australia (2.5%), which in aggregate accounted for 65.8% of foreign
employees of U.S. multinational firms. 660
However, these aggregate statistics on the location of employees by country do not
capture the distribution of employees by countries at individual registrants. While these
aggregate statistics may offer an average perspective across all firms with a non-U.S. workforce
in the BEA sample, they do not enable us to draw strong conclusions about the ultimate effects on
the pay ratio for those registrants that are subject to final rule and decide to opt for the cost-ofliving adjustment. We believe that registrants anticipating an increase in the pay ratio after the
adjustment may be less likely to opt for the cost-of-living adjustment. Based on 2014 data from
the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”), 661 we note that the E.U. on aggregate had a cost of
living similar to the U.S. level. Based on 2014 data on PPP conversion factors from the World
Bank, 662 of the above locations, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Japan, France, and
Australia had a cost of living similar to or above the U.S. level. Based on the same measure, of
the above locations, India, China, Mexico, and Brazil had a cost of living below the U.S. level. 663

depend on the countries where employees are located, the actual distribution of employee pay,
and the specific cost-of-living measure used.
Below we illustrate the potential effect of the cost-of-living adjustment on the pay ratio for
a hypothetical registrant. 664 In this example, we make the following assumptions: we assume that
the registrant has 70% of employees in the country of residence of the PEO and 30% of
employees in another country; the pay of the registrant’s employees in the PEO’s country,
expressed in the currency of the PEO’s country, is lognormally distributed (with mean log of pay
of 10.5 and standard deviation of log of pay of 0.5); the pay of the registrant’s employees in the
other country, expressed in the currency of the PEO’s country, is lognormally distributed (with
mean log of pay of 9 and standard deviation of log of pay of 0.5); and the cost of living is two
times higher in the country of residence of the PEO than in the other country. In this hypothetical
example, a cost-of-living adjustment would cause the pay ratio to decrease by approximately
6.4%. If the cost of living were three times higher in the country of residence of the PEO than in
the other country, holding other assumptions unchanged, a cost-of-living adjustment would cause
the pay ratio to decrease by approximately 14.9%.
Some commenters 665 suggested that a cost-of-living adjustment could introduce an
element of subjectivity into the pay ratio calculation or permit registrants to alter the reported
ratio to achieve a particular objective with the ratio disclosure. In the final rule, the requirements
to apply a consistent methodology, to disclose the use of the adjustment, and to provide
disclosure of the registrant’s pay ratio calculated without the cost-of-living adjustment should

This is intended only as a hypothetical example for illustration purposes and not as an indication of the
effects at an actual or representative registrant. The effects are highly sensitive to the assumptions
described. The estimates are obtained numerically.

address these concerns.
e. Frequency of Identifying the Median Employee
Unlike the proposed rule, which required registrants to identify the median employee
every year, the final rule allows registrants to identify the median employee once every three
years unless there has been a change in the registrant’s employee population or employee
compensation arrangements that it reasonably believes would result in a significant change in the
pay ratio disclosure. Registrants must still provide annual disclosure of their pay ratio by
recalculating the previously identified median employee’s annual total compensation each year.
Under this approach, a registrant may identify its median employee for year one and then
use that employee or one who has substantially similar compensation as its median employee in
the following two years for calculating the employee’s annual total compensation and the
registrant’s pay ratio. A couple of commenters suggested this approach, noting that it would still
result in a registrant providing a pay ratio disclosure on an annual basis while reducing the burden
and costs required to identify the median employee annually when there have not been any
interim changes in the registrant’s workforce or compensation structure. 666
Choosing this approach is likely to result in lower ongoing compliance costs for affected
registrants. We expect that some registrants will identify the median employee every three years,
while others may identify it every year or every two years. Thus, depending on how frequently
registrants would have to identify the median employee, and on whether the identification of the
median employee is the main ongoing cost of compliance, with the change in the final release, the
ongoing compliance costs could range approximately from $123 million to $947 million per

666

See, e.g., letters from ABA, COEC I, and COEC II.

243

year. 667
f. Method of Identifying the Median Employee
In order to allow the greatest degree of flexibility while maintaining consistency with the
statutory provision, the final rule does not specify a particular methodology for identifying the
median. Instead, it allows registrants a choice of multiple methods, including several with
significant flexibility.
We are adopting this flexible approach because we believe that the appropriate and most
cost-effective methodology for identifying the median employee necessarily depends on a
registrant’s particular facts and circumstances, including, among others, such variables as size and
nature of the workforce, complexity of the organization, the stratification of pay levels across the
workforce, the types of compensation the employees receive, the extent that different currencies
are involved, the number of tax and accounting regimes involved, the number of payroll systems
the registrant has, and the degree of difficulty involved in integrating payroll systems to readily
compile total compensation information for all employees. We believe that these are likely the
same factors that would cause substantial variation in the costs of compliance. By not prescribing
specific methodologies that must be used, the final rule allows registrants to choose a method to
identify the median employee that is appropriate to the size, structure, and compensation practices
of their own businesses, including permitting a registrant to identify the median employee using
any consistently applied compensation measure.
667

Ongoing costs without this adjustment are estimated to be between $368 million and $947 million. See
Section III.C.2.c. Ongoing costs with the adjustment are estimated as follows. The $123 million is
estimated as $368 million divided by three, based on the lowest of the estimates of ongoing compliance
costs and the assumptions that all registrants identify the median employee every three years and the
identification of the median employee accounts for the entirety of the ongoing cost. This estimate represents
the aggregate annual cost in this scenario averaged over three years. The $947 million is based on the
highest of the estimates of ongoing compliance costs and the assumption that all registrants incur the full
ongoing cost every year.

244

In addition, the final rule’s flexibility could enable registrants to manage compliance costs
more effectively than a more prescriptive approach would allow. 668 We also believe that, by
allowing registrants to minimize direct compliance costs, a flexible approach could mitigate, to
some extent, any potential negative effects of the mandated requirements on competition. We
recognize, however, that a flexible approach could increase uncertainty for registrants that prefer
more specificity on how to comply with the final rule, particularly for registrants that do not use
statistical analyses in the ordinary course of managing their businesses. In light of this potential
uncertainty, the final rule establishes certain parameters on the use of this flexibility, such as by
specifying that the use of statistical sampling or other reasonable estimates in identifying the
median is permitted, as is identifying the median employee based on any consistently applied
compensation measure.
We believe that a flexible approach would not significantly diminish the potential benefits
of the disclosure mandated by Section 953(b). As discussed above, we believe that the intended
purpose of the pay ratio disclosure is to provide shareholders with a company-specific metric to
evaluate the PEO’s compensation, rather than a benchmark for compensation arrangements across
registrants. Also as discussed above, we are not persuaded that mandating a particular
methodology will necessarily improve the comparability of pay ratio disclosure across registrants
because of the numerous other factors that could also cause the ratios to be less meaningful for
registrant-to-registrant comparison. Even if such comparability could be marginally enhanced by
mandating a specific method for identifying the median, we do not believe this marginal
improvement in comparability would be justified in light of the costs that would be imposed on
668

For example, one commenter estimated that using all elements of compensation rather than the sum of salary
earned, incentive cash earned, and stock awards granted to identify the median employee in a worldwide
workforce would increase the initial expense and ongoing workload by a factor of more than five times. See
letter from Microsoft.

245

registrants by a more prescriptive rule. We also note that some commenters expressed the view
that greater comparability across registrants could increase the likelihood that a registrant’s
competitors could infer proprietary or sensitive information about the registrant’s business. This
in turn could increase the indirect costs to registrants of the adopted requirements, such as
competitive harms in labor markets discussed in the previous section or general costs arising from
the mandated disclosure requirement.
Finally, we recognize that allowing registrants to select a methodology to identify the
median, rather than prescribing a methodology or set of methodologies, could reduce the benefits
for shareholders if that flexibility results in a pay ratio statistic that is less useful than a more
precisely and consistently calculated ratio. In particular, some commenters claimed that
permitting flexibility in the rule would allow registrants to manipulate the ratio in their favor. 669
While we acknowledge that the flexibility we are providing creates some risk that registrants will
attempt to use this flexibility to produce a more favorable pay ratio, we think that this risk is
mitigated by the disclosures we are requiring with respect to the methodologies and assumptions
used to identify the median employee, as discussed below. The final rule specifically discusses
two particular permitted methods of identifying the median employee—using a consistently
applied compensation measure and using statistical sampling. For all of these reasons, we believe
the benefits of the final rule’s flexibility outweigh those of a more prescriptive approach.
i. Consistently Applied Compensation Measure
We proposed to allow registrants to use any consistently applied compensation measure,
such as amounts derived from the registrant’s payroll or tax records, to identify the median

669

See, e.g., letters from Bupp, Corayer, Fedewa, Fox, Friend, Grotzke, Hlodnicki, Kizzort, Maly, Petricoin,
and Van Pelt.

246

employee and then calculate that median employee’s annual total compensation in accordance
with Item 402(c)(2)(x). We are adopting this approach as proposed.
Allowing registrants this flexibility is likely to reduce registrants’ compliance costs
significantly, compared to the alternative of requiring registrants to calculate total compensation
in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) for all employees, or for a statistically valid sample, and
then identify the median. This view was shared by commenters. 670 Registrants that choose this
approach will be able to identify a median employee from employee compensation data that they
may already track or record or that may be less expensive for them to acquire than obtaining and
computing all of the Item 402(c)(2)(x) compensation information for each employee. Using one
commenter’s survey results, 671 we can estimate the potential savings resulting from our exercise
of discretion. According to the survey, which provided both average and median cost increase
estimates, costs would increase on average by 4,689% if registrants were required to calculate
total compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) for all employees. The median increase
in compliance costs would be 175%. 672 Applying this median percentage to our initial
compliance cost estimate of $1,315 million, this alternative would increase the total compliance
670

See, e.g., letters from CalPERS (“By offering companies a number of alternatives, companies will be able to
determine which methodology works best for their company and/or tailor it for their special circumstances.
Moreover, this flexibility will allow companies to select a methodology that is most cost effective for them.
Finally, since companies will already have the dataset necessary for this calculation (in order to prepare their
financial statements and tax returns), we do not envisage costs will be a barrier to compliance.”) and COEC
I (“The value of this flexibility appears to be significant in terms of cost. Indeed, survey respondents were
asked how their compliance costs would be affected in the event they were required to calculate median
employee compensation using the same method employed in the ‘Summary Compensation Table.’ This
method is currently used to calculate total primary executive officer compensation and is equivalent to the
first approach offered by the SEC. 99 percent of respondents answered that their costs would increase if
they were forced to calculate median employee compensation using the Summary Compensation Table
approach. Including all responses, the median increase is reported as 100 percent. The data strongly indicate
that adhering to the Summary Compensation Table approach would lead to additional significant increases
in compliance costs relative to the Proposed Rule”).

Another commenter, based on survey results, argued that the average increase in costs would be 4,592%, but
did not provide a median estimate. See letter from COEC I.

247

costs to approximately $3,616 million. Thus, we estimate that allowing registrants flexibility in
identifying the median employee could result in a total savings of approximately $2,301 million.
We acknowledge, however, that some registrants will still incur costs if they have to
combine or sample from separately maintained payroll systems across segments and/or
geographic locations.
ii. Statistical Sampling
The final rule, as proposed, also allows registrants to use statistical sampling in their
determination of the median employee. The size of the reduction in compliance costs that can be
achieved by using statistical sampling or other reasonable estimates in identifying the median
employee ultimately depends on a registrant’s particular facts and circumstances. Below we
provide an illustration of how various registrants’ characteristics might affect the sampling size.
We note that these numbers are intended to provide examples and should not be treated as
recommendations about the appropriate sampling size. For example, in the following figure and
tables, we show that the variance of underlying wage distributions can materially affect the
appropriate sample size for statistical sampling. 673 Industries characterized by the BLS as having

673

The analysis uses average and median wage estimates from the BLS at the 4-digit NAICS industry level
(290 industries) and assumes a lognormal wage distribution. We use a 95% confidence interval with relative
0.5% margin of error in the estimate of the average of the logarithm of wage. We estimate the median wage
by taking the exponential of the sample average of the logarithm of wage, which is the sample geometric
average. This median estimator is the maximum likelihood estimator (“MLE”) of the population median for
lognormal distribution, and it is an unbiased estimator when the sample size is large. The 95% confidence
interval for the population wage median can be obtained by taking the exponential of the endpoints of the
95% confidence interval for the sample average of logarithm of wage (E.L. Crow and K. Simizu, Lognormal
Distributions: Theory and Applications 29, (Marcel-Dekker: New York, 1988), R. Serfling, Efficient and

low wage variances, such as electric power generation, coal mining, and metal ore mining, have
estimated minimum appropriate sample sizes for an accurate median estimate of less than 135
employees. In contrast, industries characterized by high wage variances, such as offices of
physicians, health and personal care stores, and spectator sports, have estimated minimum
appropriate sample sizes of more than 1,263 employees. Figure 2 shows the distribution of
estimated minimum appropriate sample sizes for registrants operating in each of the 290 4-digit

and X. Sala-i-Martin, Parametric Estimations of the World Distribution of Income, NBER WORKING PAPER
15433, (2009). It is common in practice to control the relative margin of error (instead of absolute margin of
error) to determine the sample size. Accordingly, the sample size depends on the coefficient of variation
(CV) of the underlying distribution. The square of the CV, also known as “relative variance,” is often more
stable and easier to guess in advance than variance (W. G. Cochran, Sampling Techniques 77, (New York:
Wiley, 3rd ed. 1977); S. L. Lohr, Sampling: Design and Analysis 46-47, (Cengage Learning, 2nd ed. 2009).
This analysis also assumes that when the sampling is implemented, the sampling method would be a true
random sampling (i.e., it would not be biased by region, occupation, rank, or other factor).
674

Our analysis excludes the Motor Vehicle Manufacturing and Postal Service industries from our sample
because, for these industries, mean wage was lower than median wage in dollar terms, appearing to
contradict our lognormal distributional assumption.

Figure 2. The distribution of registrant sample sizes for different industries.

Because these estimated minimum appropriate sample sizes are based on wage
distributions measured by the BLS in standardized industries, they may not correspond to the
250

appropriate minimum sample size at registrants with an employee base that does not correspond
precisely to one of these industries. Even for registrants whose operations are wholly within one
of these standardized industries, their appropriate sample size may also be different to the extent
that their distribution of employee wages is different than that of the industry. In these instances,
a registrant’s appropriate sample size could be higher or lower than that estimated for its industry.
In 2014, of the nearly 3,571 registrants that we believe will be subject to the final rule, we
estimate that approximately 68% and 63% report business and geographic segments, respectively.
Approximately 50% and 65% of the potentially affected registrants that self-report business and
geographic segments, respectively, report a single segment of that type. 675 Of the registrants that
self-report a single business segment for which we have industry classifications that match the
BLS data, Table 7 shows estimated minimum appropriate sample sizes assuming that each
registrant’s wage distribution is similar to the BLS-measured industry distribution.

The example in Table 7 is simplified by the assumptions that registrants have employees

parameters based on aggregate statistics for that industry. We recognize that statistical sampling
may be more complicated for registrants with different types of pay distributions or multiple
business and geographic segments, each of which may have different parameters of the
distribution. While one commenter suggested simple random sampling could be used for these
registrants, 676 other approaches, such as stratified cluster sampling, 677 may yield more efficient
estimates in some instances. We also recognize that the implementation of statistical sampling for
registrants with multiple payroll systems may require additional steps. While we believe that
statistical sampling can produce reasonable estimates of the median for these types of registrants,
we lack information on intra-firm employee pay distributions and registrants’ costs of sampling to
estimate the proportion of registrants for which specific sampling approaches may most
efficiently produce reasonable estimates of median pay.
While some commenters argued that statistical sampling will not lead to significant
reductions in compliance costs, 678 the majority of commenters supported using statistical
sampling for calculating the median employee, implying that this approach can reduce costs for
some registrants. 679 In light of the comments received, we continue to believe that permitting
registrants to use statistical sampling will lead to an overall reduction in compliance costs as
compared to not permitting this method of identifying the median.

methodology used to identify the median employee and disclose any material assumptions,
adjustments, or estimates used to identify the median or to determine total compensation or any
elements of total compensation. Registrants also must clearly identify any estimates used.
Registrants’ disclosure of the methodology and material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates
used must be designed to provide information for a reader to be able to evaluate the
appropriateness of the methodologies used.
This disclosure is intended to aid shareholders and investors in their use of the pay ratio
disclosure and alert them to any material changes in the methodology that might change the
reported pay ratio. Many commenters indicated that the rule should require registrants to provide
this narrative information, 680 but a number of these commenters indicated that the rule should
clarify that the narrative be brief. 681
Alternatively, we could have required registrants to provide a detailed description of every
operational step and methodological assumption used in identifying the median employee.
Because we are concerned that disclosure about methodology, assumptions, adjustments, and
estimates could become dense and overly technical, 682 which we believe would limit its
usefulness, the final rule asks for a brief overview and makes clear that it is not necessary to
provide technical analyses or formulas. We do not believe that a detailed, technical discussion
(such as statistical formulas, confidence levels, or the steps used in data analysis) would
appreciably enhance shareholders’ understanding of how the pay ratio was calculated. We

See, e.g., letter from Business Roundtable I (commenting that the disclosure could not be brief because of
the issuer’s need to use many estimates and assumptions).

253

recognize, as commenters noted, that registrants will incur some costs in developing and
reviewing the appropriate language to describe the approach taken. However, we expect that the
costs of this disclosure will be marginal, as these additional disclosures are intended to simply
describe what has already been done or assumed in the calculations, and therefore will not require
additional analysis by registrants.
h. Determination of Total Compensation
As mandated by Section 953(b), the final rule defines “total compensation” by reference
to Item 402(c)(2)(x). We received comments supporting the use of estimates in calculating the
annual total compensation or any elements of total compensation for employees other than the
PEO. 683 As proposed, the final rule permits registrants to use reasonable estimates to determine
elements of “total compensation.”
We acknowledge that, to the extent that the use of estimates causes the disclosure to
present a less precise measure of the “total compensation” of the registrant’s median employee
than if we prohibited the use of estimates, it could diminish the potential usefulness of the
disclosure. However, commenters did not suggest that allowing for the use of reasonable
estimates in determining the “total compensation” would diminish the potential usefulness of the
disclosure and we likewise believe it is not likely to have such an effect. 684
i. Defining “Annual”
As proposed, the final rule defines “annual total compensation” to mean total
compensation for the last completed fiscal year, consistent with the time period used for the other
Item 402 disclosure requirements.

683

See, e.g., letters from ABA, COEC I, COEC II, Davis Polk, Prof. Angel, and Vectren Corp.

684

But see letter from Dennis T (“No estimates. [N]o sampling. We demand the actual data.”).

254

Some commenters agreed that the pay ratio disclosure should be calculated based on data
from the last completed fiscal year. 685 Other commenters, however, recommended that the rule
permit registrants to use another period, such as the fiscal year preceding the registrant’s last
completed fiscal year. 686 Commenters also asked that registrants be permitted to choose the
period. 687 We understand that these suggestions are intended to reduce compliance costs for
registrants by giving registrants extra time to comply with the rule or the ability to use
information in the form that would best suit their particular facts and circumstances. We believe,
however, that it is appropriate for the time period used for the pay ratio disclosure to be the same
as the time period used for the registrant’s other executive compensation disclosures, although the
flexibility in identifying the median employee could help to address the concerns raised by these
commenters. In particular, using the same time period as for other executive compensation
disclosure will avoid any possible confusion for shareholders using this disclosure.
j. Updating the Pay Ratio Disclosure for the Last Completed Fiscal Year
The final rule includes instructions to clarify the timing for updating pay ratio disclosure
after the end of a registrant’s fiscal year. Without this provision, a registrant could be required to
include pay ratio disclosure in a filing after the end of the fiscal year, but before it has compiled
the executive compensation information for that fiscal year for inclusion in its proxy statement
relating to its annual meeting of shareholders. This could impose additional costs on registrants
that elect to provide executive compensation disclosure in their annual proxy statement rather
than in their annual report and for registrants that are conducting registered offerings at the
beginning of their fiscal year.
685

See, e.g., letters from ABA, CalPERs, and UAW Trust.

686

See, e.g., letters from Aon Hewitt, Business Roundtable I, Corporate Secretaries, and Eaton.

687

See, e.g., letters from Davis Polk and WorldatWork I.

255

To address this concern, we considered the recommendation of commenters that pay ratio
disclosure not be required to be updated for the most recently completed fiscal year until the
registrant files its proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders. The final rule generally
follows this recommended approach and also provides a similar accommodation for registrants
that do not file annual proxy statements. 688 It also aligns the final rule to the filing deadlines for
providing Item 402 disclosure in annual reports and proxy and information statements. We
believe that such an approach will reduce costs to registrants without diminishing the potential
usefulness of the disclosure.
We also believe that this approach could reduce costs for registrants in connection with
filings made or required to be made before the filing of the proxy or information statement for the
annual meeting of shareholders (or written consents in lieu of such a meeting) that would
typically contain the registrant’s other Item 402 disclosure covering the most recently completed
fiscal year. In addition, under the final rule, updating the pay ratio disclosure is not an additional
impediment for a registrant that requests effectiveness of a registration statement after the end of
its fiscal year and before the filing of the proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders.
In this regard, this approach could alleviate some of the final rule’s potential impact on capital
formation.
k. Status of Disclosure as “Filed”
Under the final rule, the pay ratio disclosure will be considered “filed” for purposes of the
Securities Act and Exchange Act, like other Item 402 information. A number of commenters

688

Based on a review of EDGAR filings in calendar year 2013, approximately 250 registrants that would be
subject to the final rule do not file proxy or information statements in connection with annual meetings of
shareholders, including 15D filers (other than SRCs and ABS issuers) and registrants that are not corporate
entities required to hold annual meetings of shareholders.

256

recommended that the pay ratio disclosure be “furnished” rather than “filed” 689 because
registrants will have to review a large amount of data and make a significant number of estimates,
assumptions, and judgment calls, which will necessarily lead to imprecision. 690 This, in turn,
could subject registrants to potential liability and litigation, 691 make it difficult to validate the
information sufficiently for Sarbanes-Oxley Act certification purposes, 692 and/or not permit the
information to be audited (or greatly increase the costs of the audits). 693 We recognize that some
registrants could have more difficulty in gathering and verifying the information than others. We
believe, however, that the flexibility afforded to registrants in connection with identifying the
median employee could reduce some of the difficulties of compiling the required information
because registrants will be able to tailor the methodology to reflect their own facts and
circumstances. In addition, we believe that the final rule’s transition periods, which are discussed
below, could mitigate some concerns about compiling and verifying the information because they
are designed to give registrants sufficient time to develop and implement compliance procedures.
Requiring registrants to “file” their pay ratio information may make the final rule more
costly for registrants than the alternative of allowing them to “furnish” such information.
Treating the pay ratio disclosure as “filed” will mean that registrants could potentially be subject
to litigation under Section 18 of the Exchange Act, although, as mentioned earlier, Section 18

does not create strict liability for misstatements in “filed” information and requires that a plaintiff
establish that it relied on the misleading information in purchasing or selling a security and
suffered damages caused by that reliance. On the other hand, under the final rule, this potential
liability for misleading pay ratio disclosure could make registrants more accountable for the
disclosure than if we instead permitted the disclosure to be ‘furnished’ and result overall in fewer
inaccuracies in the required pay ratio disclosure. To the extent that registrants perceive there to
be a greater likelihood of private litigation under the final rule than if they were permitted to
“furnish” the information, registrants may decide to apply a more costly process to identify the
median employee, or retain additional counsel, thus increasing compliance costs.
l. Compliance Date
Section 953(b) does not specify a date when registrants must begin to comply with the
final rule. In a change from the Proposing Release, the final rule requires that a registrant must
begin to comply with Item 402(u) with respect to compensation for the registrant’s first full fiscal
year commencing on or after January 1, 2017.
As discussed above, the change from the proposal provides calendar year-end filers and
registrants with fiscal years beginning January 1, 2015 until the day before the final rule’s
effectiveness one additional year to provide their pay ratio disclosure relative to the proposal. The
final rule also changes the compliance schedule for registrants with fiscal years starting on or after
effectiveness through December 30, 2015. These registrants will receive two additional years to
provide their pay ratio disclosure relative to the proposal. Assuming a hypothetical effective date
of November 1, 2015, we estimate that this change will lead to a one-time cost deferral of
approximately $147 million for two years and to savings of approximately between $27.3 million
and $212 million for 223 registrants subject to the final rule that have fiscal years that end from

258

October 31, 2015, through December 30, 2015 694 and a one-time cost deferral of approximately
$1,169 million for one year and to savings of approximately between $109 million and $842
million for the remaining 3,348 registrants subject to the final rule. 695 For this estimation, we
identified the fiscal year ends for all affected registrants. We found that 223 registrants have
fiscal years that end between October 31 and December 30, of which 130 are multinational
registrants and 93 are registrants with U.S.-only segments. We found that of the remaining 3,348
registrants estimated to be subject to the final rule, 1,340 are multinational registrants and 2,008
are registrants with U.S.-only segments. 696
m. Transition Periods
The final rule also includes a transition period for new registrants because we are sensitive
to the impact that the rule could have on capital formation. We note that the requirements of
Section 953(b), as amended by the JOBS Act, distinguish between certain newly public
companies and all other registrants by providing an exemption for emerging growth companies.
694

For these registrants, the initial compliance cost is assumed to be deferred for two years. There are 130
multinational registrants and 93 registrants with U.S.-only segments. The annual cost for the 130
multinational registrants is equal to the product of their cumulative number of employees (3,354,869) and
the cost per employee ($38.04), or a total of approximately $128 million. The annual cost for the 93
registrants with U.S.-only segments is equal to the product of their cumulative number of employees
(1,018,780) and the cost per employee ($19.02), or a total of approximately $19 million. Thus, the total
initial compliance cost for the 223 registrants that is deferred for two years is approximately $147 million.
These registrants also will not have to incur two years of ongoing compliance costs. Assuming the ongoing
cost as a percentage of the initial cost is between one-third of 28% (9.3%) and 72% of the initial cost, the
cost savings are estimated to be between ($147 million*9.3%)*2 = $27.3 million and ($147 million*72%)*2
= $212 million. See Sections III.C.2.c and III.D.2.e.

695

For these registrants, the initial compliance cost is assumed to be deferred for one year. Of the 3,348
registrants, 1,340 are multinational registrants with 24,240,445 employees in total and a total annual cost of
$922 million; 1,691 are registrants with U.S.-only segments with 12,530,180 employees in total and a total
annual cost of $238 million; and 317 are registrants with U.S.-only segments with missing employee data
and a total annual cost of $9 million. Thus, the total cost for the 3,348 registrants is approximately $1,169
million over one year. These registrants also will not have to incur one year of ongoing compliance costs.
Assuming the ongoing cost as a percentage of the initial cost is between one-third of 28% (9.3%) and 72%
of the initial cost, the cost savings are estimated to be between ($1,169 million*9.3%) = $109 million and
($1,169 million*72%) = $842 million. See Sections III.C.2.c and III.D.2.e.

696

For registrants without segment or employee data, we followed the same approach as in Table 3.

259

We also note that the incremental time needed to compile pay ratio disclosure could cause
registrants that are not emerging growth companies to delay an initial public offering, which
could have a negative impact on capital formation. 697 In this regard, we expect that registrants
that are not emerging growth companies are likely to be businesses with more extensive
operations and a greater number of employees than many emerging growth companies, which
could increase the initial efforts needed to comply with the final rule. We believe that providing a
transition period for these newly public companies could mitigate this potential impact on capital
formation.
To address these concerns, the final rule also includes instructions that would permit new
registrants to delay compliance, so that pay ratio disclosure would not be required in a registration
statement on Form S-1 or S-11 for an initial public offering or a registration statement on Form
10. Instead, such a registrant would be required to first comply with Item 402(u) with respect to
compensation for the first fiscal year commencing on or after the year in which the registrant first
becomes subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, but
no earlier than the year commencing January 1, 2017. Additionally, in response to comments, the
final rule provides that a registrant that ceases to be a smaller reporting company or an emerging
growth company will not be required to provide pay ratio disclosure until the first fiscal year after
exiting such status, but no earlier than the year commencing January 1, 2017. This change from
697

See, e.g., letters from ABA (“Although we doubt that a company considering an initial public offering of its
securities would decide to forego such a transaction simply because of the pay ratio disclosure obligation, in
some situations, the time and costs associated with Item 402(u) compliance could certainly weigh in the
timing of the offering.”), Lou (“The competitive disadvantages raise the costs of raising capital through
public trading markets and thereafter discourage companies to go public. The additional monetary cost
obviously makes an initial public offering (‘IPO’) [a] less attractive mean[s] to raise capital though the
negative impact might not constitute a fatal factor that would kill the IPO. However a CEO would feel
reluctant to list the company because of the threatening embarrassment of pay ratio disclosure. Therefore the
pay ratio exerts a negative effect on IPOs.”), and PM&P (“We agree with the proposed transition period that
new registrants should not be required to include pay ratio disclosure in their initial registration statements,
and that to do so could significantly delay the IPO.”).

260

the proposed rule allows registrants exiting smaller reporting company or an emerging growth
company status to delay their initial compliance by a year, and will give them additional time to
decide how they will identify their median employee and prepare the necessary disclosure.
Further, the final rule permits registrants that engage in business combinations and/or acquisitions
to not include in the median employee determination employees of a newly-acquired entity for the
fiscal year in which the business combination or acquisition occurs. We believe that the exercise
of discretion used in allowing these additional transitional periods will result in cost savings for
the affected registrants and will further mitigate any effects of the rule on capital formation.
IV. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
A. Background
Certain provisions of the final amendments contain “collection of information”
requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the “PRA”). 698 We
published a notice requesting comment on the collection of information requirements in the
Proposing Release for the rule amendments, and we submitted these collections of information
requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with
the PRA. 699 The titles for the collections of information are:
•

“Regulation S-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0071);

•

“Form 10-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0063);

•

“Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A” (OMB Control No. 3235-0059);

•

“Regulation 14C and Schedule 14C” (OMB Control No. 3235-0057);

•

“Form 8-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0060);

698

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

699

44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11.

261

•

“Form S-1” (OMB Control No. 3235-0065);

•

“Form S-4” (OMB Control No. 3235-0324);

•

“Form S-11” (OMB Control No. 3235-0067);

•

“Form 10” (OMB Control No. 3235-0064); and

•

“Form N-2” (OMB Control No. 3235-0026).

These regulations, schedules and forms were adopted under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, and in the case of Form N-2, 700 the Investment Company Act of 1940. 701 The regulations,
forms and schedules set forth the disclosure requirements for periodic reports, registration
statements, and proxy and information statements filed by companies to help investors make
informed investment and voting decisions. The hours and costs associated with preparing, filing
and sending the form or schedule constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by each
collection of information. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
Our amendments to the forms and regulations are intended to satisfy the requirements of
Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which directs the Commission to amend Item 402 of
Regulation S-K to add the pay ratio disclosure requirements specified by that provision.
Compliance with the final rule will be mandatory for affected registrants. Responses to the
information collections will not be kept confidential, and there will be no mandatory retention
period for the information disclosed.
B. Summary of Information Collections
In order to satisfy the legislative mandate in Section 953(b), we are adopting new
700

17 CFR 239.14 and 274.11a-1.

701

15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.

262

paragraph (u) to Item 402 of Regulation S-K. This new paragraph (u) will require registrants to
disclose:
•

the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the registrant
(excluding the PEO);

•

the annual total compensation of the registrant’s PEO; and

•

the ratio between these two amounts.

For this purpose, Section 953(b) specifies that total compensation is to be determined in
accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x). Item 402 already requires registrants to disclose the annual
total compensation of the PEO in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x). 702 The median of the annual
total compensation of all employees and the ratio are new, incremental disclosure burdens and
will require affected registrants to collect compensation information for employees that is not
currently required to be disclosed.
The additional disclosure under new paragraph (u) of Item 402 will be required in any
annual report, proxy or information statement, or registration statement that requires executive
compensation disclosure pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K. 703 In addition, the requirements
will allow certain registrants to omit the disclosure otherwise required by Item 402(u) from filings
made during a specified transition period.
Finally, in order to conform the amendments to current rules for the disclosure of PEO

702

As of the date of this release, the requirements for the calculation of total compensation under Item
402(c)(2)(x) are the same as those in effect on July 20, 2010. Therefore, for purposes of this PRA analysis,
we have assumed that registrants would not need to recalculate the annual total compensation for the PEO in
connection with the pay ratio disclosure.

703

Consistent with the scope of Section 953(b), the new requirements will not apply to the annual reports and
proxy and information statements of emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies or foreign
private issuers. In addition, consistent with the instructions J and I of Form 10-K, the new requirements will
not apply to the annual reports of issuers of asset-backed securities or to wholly-owned subsidiary
registrants.

263

compensation when certain elements of compensation are not yet known, we are adopting a
conforming amendment to Item 5.02 of Form 8-K. New paragraph (1) of Item 5.02(f) will also
require registrants that are disclosing PEO total compensation in accordance with Item 5.02 of
Form 8-K to provide in that filing the updated pay ratio disclosure required by Item 402(u).
Because Item 5.02 of Form 8-K provides a delayed method of filing information that would
otherwise be required in the registrant’s proxy or information statement or annual report, the PRA
analysis assumes that the burden and cost of compliance with new Item 402(u) would be
associated primarily with those forms and schedules rather than Form 8-K.
C. Summary of Comment Letters and Revisions to Proposals
In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on the PRA analysis. We received
letters from two commenters that directly addressed the PRA estimates, 704 as well as a number of
other comment letters and submissions that discussed the costs and burdens to issuers that would
have an effect on the PRA analysis. 705 A detailed discussion of these comments is included in the
Section III above. 706
One of the two commenters analyzed data from a survey of 118 companies to conclude
that it would take registrants an average of 952 hours per year to comply with the pay ratio
disclosure requirement at an average labor cost of $185,600, which we assume refers to external
costs only. 707 The other commenter disagreed with the our assumption in the Proposing Release
704

See letters from COEC I, COEC II, and Chamber II.

705

See letters from Avery Dennison, ExxonMobil, FEI and KBR.

706

See Section III.C.2.b.

707

See letter from Chamber II. This commenter estimated that the annual cost of compliance would be $710.9
million and an annual compliance time of 3.6 million hours. The commenter also stated that we may have
underestimated costs by more than 870% and underestimated compliance time by 560%. From this
information, we infer that the average labor cost of $185,600 refers to external costs, as multiplying the
number of registrants estimated to be subject to the proposed rule (3,830) by the average labor cost
estimated by this commenter ($185,600) equals $710,848,000.

264

that ongoing compliance costs in the second and third year would significantly decrease from the
initial compliance costs in the first year. 708 Based on the proposed rule, which did not include
several accommodations adopted in the final rule, that commenter estimated that ongoing
compliance costs would be 80% (mid-range) or 72% (average) of the initial compliance costs for
each successive year. This commenter also cited a survey completed by 128 public companies,
the majority of which were large companies with assets well over $2 billion, to assert that the
average cost of outside securities compliance counsel is $700 per hour, rather than the $400 per
hour used in the PRA estimates. 709
Several companies submitted estimates of burdens and costs without commenting on the
our estimates. One company estimated that compliance with the proposed rule would require
100-150 hours of work by internal staff and 20 to 40 hours of external consulting time at a total
“internal cost” of $1 million to $1.5 million.710 Another company estimated that it would take
over 1,000 internal burden hours to develop the database and methodology to derive the pay ratio
information, and that ongoing burden hours would be approximately 50% (500 hours) of the
initial compliance burden hours. 711 It also asserted that this represents an approximate cost of

708

See letters from COEC I and COEC II.

709

As noted in our Economic Analysis, we continue to believe that $400 per hour is the appropriate rate to use
for PRA purposes. This is the rate we typically estimate for outside legal services used in connection with
public company reporting and is intended to represent an average to cover all registrants of varying sizes. In
addition, some commenters indicated that they would retain external advisors such as payroll specialists,
human resource consultants, and compensation consultants. See letters from Avery Dennison (stating that it
expects to retain two to three external advisors, including legal advisers and HR consultants) and General
Mills (indicating that it expects to hire outside advisors, such as compensation consultants and payroll
specialists). Generally, we expect the hourly fees for such external advisors to be much lower than those of
legal counsel.

710

See letter from Avery Dennison. Although this commenter used the phrase “internal cost” of compliance,
we assume that this cost includes more than internal staff time. Otherwise, the internal cost of compliance
could range from approximately $6,667 to $15,000 per hour ($1 million divided by 150 hours or $1.5
million divided by 100 hours).

711

See letter from FEI.

265

over $250,000 on an initial basis and $100,000 on an ongoing basis. 712 Another large corporate
commenter asserted that it would require up to approximately 3,000 internal burden hours to
comply with the proposed rule in the initial year of compliance, and that ongoing compliance
burdens after the initial compliance year would be approximately 28% of the initial burden hours
(850 hours per year thereafter). 713 Another global issuer estimated that it may take between
$500,000 and $1 million to establish and automate the process to comply with the proposed
rule. 714
We are adopting the final rule as proposed with modifications that may help mitigate
compliance costs and burdens. First, we provide two tailored exemptions for non-U.S. employees
from the definition of “employee”: an exemption for circumstances in which a foreign
jurisdiction’s laws or regulations governing privacy are such that, despite its reasonable efforts to
obtain or process the information necessary for compliance with the final rule, the registrant is
unable to do so without violating such data privacy laws or regulations and a de minimis
exemption. Second, the final rule defines “employee” to include only the employees of the
registrant’s consolidated subsidiaries, instead of all subsidiaries as proposed. Third, to provide
consistency and flexibility, the final rule permits registrants to use any date within three months
of the last day of their last completed fiscal year to identify the median employee. Fourth, the
final rule allows registrants to identify the median employee every three years, instead of every
year, if there has been no change in their employee population or employee compensation
arrangements that they reasonably believe would result in a significant change in their pay ratio
disclosure.

D. Revisions to PRA Reporting and Cost Burden Estimates
For purposes of the PRA, in the Proposing Release, we estimated that the total annual
increase in the paperwork burden for all affected companies to prepare the disclosure that would
be required under the adopted amendments would be approximately 545,792 hours of company
personnel time and a cost of approximately $72,772,200 for the services of outside professionals.
As discussed in more detail below, we are revising our PRA burden and cost estimates to reflect
the responses of commenters, as well as the modifications we have made to the final rule to
reduce compliance burdens.
For purposes of the PRA for the final rule, we estimate the total annual increase in the
paperwork burden for all affected companies to comply with the collection of information
requirements in our final rule is approximately 2,367,573 hours of company personnel time and
approximately $315,390,720 for the services of outside professionals. 715 These estimates include
the time and the cost of implementing data gathering systems and disclosure controls and
procedures, compiling necessary data, preparing and reviewing disclosure, filing documents and
retaining records.
In deriving these estimates, we have assumed that:
•

Registrants subject to the final rule would satisfy the new requirements by either
including the information directly in annual reports on Form 10-K or incorporating
the information by reference from a proxy statement on Schedule 14A or
information statement on Schedule 14C. Our estimates assume that substantially

715

We describe how we derived the three-year average hour and cost burdens per response below. The portion
of the burden carried by outside professionals is reflected as a cost, while the portion of the burden carried
by the company internally is reflected in hours. For administrative convenience, the presentation of the
totals related to the paperwork burden hours have been rounded to the nearest whole number and the cost
totals have been rounded to the nearest dollar.

all of the burden relating to the new disclosure requirements would be associated
with Form 10-K;
•

For registrants that would be permitted to provide their pay ratio disclosure in a
filing made in accordance with Item 5.02 of Form 8-K, rather than in Form 10-K,
the burden relating to the new disclosure requirements would be associated
primarily with Form 10-K rather than Form 8-K; 716 and

•

100% of new registrants would use the transition provisions allowing them to omit
the required disclosure from their initial registration statements and, for follow-on
offerings by these registrants, the burden relating to the new disclosure
requirements would be associated primarily with Form 10-K rather than Forms S1, S-11 or N-2 as applicable (because registrants would incorporate the disclosure
from Form 10-K).

We understand from commenters that the burdens and costs of compliance will likely vary
among individual companies based on a number of factors, including the size and complexity of
their organizations, the nature of their operations and workforce, the location of their operations,
and, significantly, the extent that their existing payroll systems collect the information necessary
to identify the median of the annual total compensation of their employees. Because the final rule
provides additional flexibility in identifying the median and the annual total compensation of
employees, the actual burden could be lower if the methodology used is able to reduce the effort
needed to collect the data or if the registrant is able to use information that it collects for other

Our PRA estimates for Form 8-K include an estimated one hour burden to account for the inclusion of the
new pay ratio disclosure.

268

purposes. 717 We believe that the actual burdens will likely vary significantly among individual
companies based on these factors. Our estimates in this PRA analysis reflect average burdens,
and, therefore, some companies may experience costs in excess of our estimates and some
companies may experience costs that are lower than our estimates. 718
1. Estimated Internal Burden Hours
Commenters estimated that registrants would spend anywhere from 100 burden hours 719 to
3000 burden hours to prepare and review the pay ratio disclosure.

720

One commenter estimated

that affected companies would on average spend 952 hours per year to comply with the new
disclosure requirement. 721 This estimate was based on a survey of a range of companies, some
with operations in more than 50 countries and others with operations in fewer than 10 countries,
and did not take into account the modifications that were made to the rule to reduce compliance
costs.
In our analysis of the economic costs and benefits of the rule, we estimated that the total
initial compliance costs would be $1,314,694,544 or approximately $368,159 per registrant. 722
Our estimate did not break down the costs between internal burden hours and external costs,
which is how the burdens and costs are described for PRA purposes. As discussed later in our
analysis of the estimated cost and hour burdens for each collection of information, 723 we believe
that substantially all of the burden relating to the new disclosure requirements will be associated
717

See Section II of this release for a discussion of the requirements.

718

As in our Economic Analysis, we estimated the PRA costs and burdens to reflect a broad range of
registrants.

269

with Form 10-K. For Exchange Act reports on Form 10-K, we estimate that 75% of the burden of
preparation is carried by the company internally and that 25% of the burden of preparation is
carried by outside professionals. Using that formula, we estimate that the average registrant will
spend 1,105 internal burden hours preparing and reviewing the disclosure for the initial year of
compliance. 724
In the Proposing Release, we estimated that the internal burden hours would be greatest
during the first year of compliance with the rule and would diminish in subsequent years. As
discussed above, we received few estimates of ongoing compliance costs from commenters, and
the estimates we received varied widely. Some commenters suggested that the internal burden
hours and external professional costs would not decrease after the initial compliance year.

725

As

discussed earlier, we believe that part of the initial compliance costs would decline after the first
year. 726 Other commenters provided estimates of ongoing compliance costs that ranged from
28% to 80% of the initial compliance costs. For example, one commenter estimated that its
burden would decrease by approximately 72%, from 3,000 internal hours during the first year to
850 internal hours in subsequent years, approximately 28% of the initial burden. 727 Another
commenter suggested, based on results from a survey that it conducted, that ongoing costs could
be about 80% (median) or 72% (average) of the initial compliance costs. 728 Yet another
724

We did not receive any estimates of the cost per hour related to preparation of disclosures by the company
internally, but expect that such costs will be less than the cost of hiring outside professionals. For ease of
analysis, we assume that internal hourly costs will be approximately half the cost of hiring outside
professionals ($400/2 = $200). Assuming 75% of burden hours are carried internally and 25% are carried
externally, the average compliance cost of $368,159 per registrant corresponds to
$368,159/((.75)$200+(.25)$400) = 1,473 hours, of which 1,105 hours (1,473(.75)) are internal and 368 hours
(1,473(.25)) are external.

commenter estimated its initial burden at 1,000 internal hours and ongoing burden at 50% of the
initial compliance costs (500 internal hours). 729 This commenter also estimated initial compliance
costs at $250,000 with ongoing compliance costs of $100,000, or 40% of the initial compliance
costs.
Because of the limited number of ongoing cost estimates and their wide dispersion, for the
purposes of the PRA we assume that ongoing compliance burdens and costs will be
approximately 40% (the median of the estimates) of the initial compliance burdens and costs.
Thus, we used one commenter’s estimated ongoing burden of 40% of the initial burden for our
estimated three-year average burden. We utilize an estimated burden of 1,105 hours in the initial
year and 442 730 hours in the two years thereafter, for a three-year average burden of 663 hours. 731
2. Estimated Cost Burdens
Commenters provided a wide range of estimated external cost burdens. Commenters
provided estimates of $185,600 per year on average for each company, 732 $250,000 on an initial
basis and $100,000 on an ongoing basis, 733 and 20-40 hours of external consulting time. 734
Another commenter estimated that it may cost between $500,000 and $1 million for each
company to establish and automate the process to comply with the proposed rule, although it is
not clear whether this includes both internal and external costs and burdens. 735 As discussed
above, we estimate that total compliance burdens for the initial year of compliance will be
729

See letter from FEI.

730

1,105 x 40% = 442 burden hours.

731

(1,105 + 442+ 442) /3 = 663 burden hours.

732

271

$1,314,694,544 or $368,159 per registrant. Assuming that 25% of the burden of preparing the
disclosure is carried by outside professionals, we estimate that the average registrant will incur
$147,200 in outside professional costs in the first year to comply with the disclosure
requirement. 736
As with the estimated internal burden hours, we assume that the compliance costs after the
initial year will be reduced because a substantial portion of the costs will be related to establishing
systems and processes to collect the payroll data in the initial year of compliance. Applying the
same assumption used above that the ongoing compliance costs will be approximately 40% of the
estimate for the initial compliance year, we estimate that ongoing compliance costs will be
approximately $58,880 per year on average for each affected company 737 so that the three-year
average cost of compliance is $88,320. 738
3. Estimated cost and hour burdens for each collection of information
For each collection of information, we estimate the following cost and hour burdens:
a. Regulation S-K
While the adopted amendments would make revisions to Regulation S-K, the collection of
information requirements for that regulation are reflected in the burden hours estimated for the
forms and schedules listed below. The rules in Regulation S-K do not impose any separate
burden. Consistent with historical practice, we are retaining an estimate of one burden hour to
Regulation S-K for administrative convenience.
b. Form 10-K
Only Forms 10-K that are filed by registrants that are not smaller reporting companies or
736

368 x $400 = $147,200.

737

$147,200x 40% = $58,880.

738

($147,200 + 58,880 + 58,880)/3 = $88,320.

272

emerging growth companies will be required to include the pay ratio disclosure. For purposes of
our PRA estimates, we have assumed that 100% of asset-backed securities issuers will omit Item
402 disclosure from Form 10-K pursuant to Instruction J of Form 10-K and 100% of whollyowned subsidiary registrants will omit Item 402 disclosure from Form 10-K pursuant to
Instruction I of Form 10-K, and, accordingly, these registrants will also not be subject to the new
disclosure requirements. Based on a review of EDGAR filings in calendar year 2014, we estimate
that of the approximately 7,619 annual reports filed in that year, approximately 3,571 annual
reports are filed by registrants that would be subject to the new disclosure requirements. 739 We
estimate that the new disclosure requirements will add an average of 663 burden hours 740 to the
total burden hours required to produce each Form 10-K that is subject to the new requirements
and approximately $88,320 for outside professionals. 741
We estimate that the preparation of annual reports currently results in a total annual
compliance burden of 12,198,095 hours and an annual cost of outside professionals of
$1,627,400,000. Under the final rule, we estimate that the total incremental cost of outside
professionals for annual reports will be approximately $315,389,390 per year and the total
incremental internal burden will be approximately 2,367,563 hours per year.
c. Form 8-K
739

740

741

Based on a review of EDGAR filings in 2014, approximately 678 annual reports were filed by EGCs, 2,958
by SRCs, and 412 by ABS issuers. See Section III.D.2.b above.
As we discuss below, we estimate that 10 of the Forms 8-K filed in a given year would require one
additional hour for preparing the disclosure required by the amendments. Thus, substantially all of the
internal burden of the pay ratio disclosure is allocated to Form 10-K: 663(3,571)-(110) = 2,367,563 or
approximately 663 (2,367,563/3,571) per response. Burden hours are rounded to the next hour.
As discussed below, we estimate that the requirement to provide updated pay ratio disclosure on Form 8-K
will result in one additional burden hour for that form. We attribute the external costs of the required pay
ratio disclosure proportionately between Form 10-K and Form 8-K based on the estimated internal burden
hours for each form. [1/(663+1)] x $88,320 = $133 per Form 8-K response. The remaining costs have been
attributed to Form 10-K: $88,320)3,571 - $133(10) = $315,389,390 in aggregate or $88,320
($315,389,390/3,571) per response. Costs are rounded up to the next dollar.

273

As described in this release, the final rule will require a registrant that is filing its PEO
total compensation on a delayed basis due to the unavailability of certain components of
compensation on Form 8-K (in accordance with Instruction 1 to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of
Regulation S-K and Item 5.02(f) of Form 8-K) to provide the pay ratio disclosure at the same
time. The final rule also includes a conforming amendment to Item 5.02 of Form 8-K that will
require a registrant to include updated pay ratio disclosure in the Form 8-K that it files to disclose
its PEO total compensation information. 742 We estimate that the burden for adding the pay ratio
disclosure to that Form 8-K filing will be one hour per registrant. 743 We also estimate that the
Form 8-K amendment will not result in additional Form 8-K filings because registrants who omit
disclosure in reliance on Instruction 1 to Items 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) are already required to file a
Form 8-K. The amendments will, however, add pay ratio disclosure requirements to that Form 8K filing.
Based on a review of EDGAR filings for calendar years 2012 and 2013, we estimate that
on average approximately 11 Forms 8-K are filed pursuant to Item 5.02(f) annually and
approximately 10 of these relate to disclosure of PEO compensation. As a result, we estimate that
10 of the Forms 8-K filed in a given year will require one additional hour for preparing the
disclosure required by the amendments, in addition to the total burden hours required to produce
each Form 8-K.
We estimate that the preparation of current reports on Form 8-K currently results in a total
annual compliance burden of 507,675 hours and an annual cost of outside professionals of

742

See Section II.B.6.b.

743

As noted above, we have assumed that the burden relating to the new pay ratio requirements would remain
associated with the registrant’s proxy or information statement or annual report, and, therefore, our PRA
estimates for those forms reflect that burden.

274

$67,688,700. As result of the rule, we estimate that the incremental company burden will be
approximately 10 hours per year and approximately $1,330 in the incremental cost of outside
professionals for current reports on Form 8-K.
d. Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A
Only proxy statements on Schedule 14A that are required to include Item 402 information,
and that are not filed by smaller reporting companies or emerging growth companies, will be
required to include the new pay ratio disclosure. For purposes of our PRA estimates, consistent
with past amendments to Item 402, 744 we have assumed that all of the burden relating to the new
disclosure requirements will be associated with Form 10-K, even if registrants include the new
disclosure required in Form 10-K by incorporating that disclosure by reference from a proxy
statement on Schedule 14A.
e. Information Statements on Schedule 14C
Only information statements on Schedule 14C that are required to include Item 402
information, and that are not filed by smaller reporting companies or emerging growth companies,
are required to include the pay ratio disclosure. For purposes of our PRA estimates, consistent
with past amendments to Item 402, we have assumed that all of the burden relating to the
disclosure requirements will be associated with Form 10-K, even if registrants include the
disclosure required in Form 10-K by incorporating that disclosure by reference from an
information statement on Schedule 14C.
f. Form S-1
Because we have assumed that all new registrants will take advantage of the transition

744

We took a similar approach in connection with the rules for Summary Compensation Table disclosure
required by the 2006 amendments to Item 402. See 2006 Adopting Release, supra note 9.

275

period afforded to them under the final rule, so that all of the registration statements on Form S-1
that will be required to include the pay ratio disclosure will incorporate by reference the
registrant’s disclosure contained in its annual report, we have assumed that all of the burden
relating to the new disclosure requirements will be associated with Form 10-K.
g. Form S-4
We have assumed that registrants filing on Form S-4 for whom executive compensation
information under Item 402 is required pursuant to Items 18 or 19 of Form S-4 will incorporate by
reference the pay ratio disclosure contained in the registrant’s annual report. Thus, we have
assumed that all of the burden relating to the new disclosure requirements will be associated with
Form 10-K.
h. Form S-11
Because we have assumed that all new registrants will take advantage of the transition
period afforded to them under the final rule, so that all of the registration statements on Form S11 that will be required to include the pay ratio disclosure will incorporate by reference the
registrant’s pay ratio disclosure contained in its annual report, we have assumed that all of the
burden relating to the new disclosure requirements will be associated with Form 10-K.
i. Form N-2
Only Forms N-2 filed by business development companies (BDCs) will be subject to the
new disclosure requirements. Furthermore, the final rule will apply only to BDCs internally
managed such that they compensate their own employees. Rather, such employees are generally
compensated by the BDC’s investment adviser. , Because we assume that all of the Forms N-2
that will be filed by internally managed BDCs will incorporate by reference the registrant’s
disclosure contained in its annual report, we have assumed that all of the burden relating to the

276

new disclosure requirements would be associated with Form 10-K.
j. Form 10
Because we have assumed that all new registrants would take advantage of the transition
period afforded to them under the final rule, we estimate no annual incremental increase in the
paperwork burden associated with Form 10 as a result of the new requirements.
E. Summary of Changes to Annual Compliance Burden in Collection of Information
Tables 1 and 2 below illustrate the total annual compliance burden of the collection of
information in hours and in cost under the final rule for annual reports on Form 10-K and current
reports on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act. 745 The burden estimates were calculated by
multiplying the estimated number of annual responses by the estimated average number of hours
it would take a company to prepare and review the new disclosure.
As discussed above, there is no change to the estimated burden of the collection of
information under Forms S-1, S-4, S-11 or N-2 or under Schedule 14A and 14C because we have
assumed that the burden relating to the new disclosure requirements would be associated
primarily with Form 10-K. In addition, there is no change to the estimated burden of the
collection of information under Form 10 because we have assumed that all new registrants would
take advantage of the transition period. There is no change to the estimated burden of the
collection of information under Regulation S-K because the burdens that Regulation S-K imposes
are reflected in our revised estimates for the forms. 746

V. FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT CERTIFICATION
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (“RFA”) 749 requires us, in promulgating rules, to
consider the impact of those rules on small entities. The Commission certified in the Proposing
Release, pursuant to Section 605(b) 750 of the RFA, that the proposed rule, if adopted, would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We received no
comments on this certification.
The final rule amends Item 402 by adding paragraph (u) to implement Section 953(b) of
the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, the final rule requires registrants, other than emerging growth
companies, smaller reporting companies and foreign private issuers, to disclose the median of the
747

For these forms, the number of current annual responses reflected in the table equals the three-year average
of the number of forms filed with us and currently reported by us to OMB.

748

The increase in burden hours reflected in the table is based on the aggregate incremental burden hours per
form multiplied by the annual responses that will be required to include additional disclosure under the new
rules as adopted. As explained in the discussion above, for purposes of determining the total increase in
burden hours, we have reduced the current number of annual responses to reflect that the disclosure
requirements will not apply to all forms filed. See Table 1 for estimates per response.

annual total compensation of all employees of the registrant (excluding the PEO), the annual total
compensation of the registrant’s PEO, and the ratio between these two amounts. The disclosure is
required in any filing described in Item 10(a) of Reg. S-K that requires executive compensation
disclosure pursuant to Item 402.
For purposes of the RFA, under our rules, an issuer, other than an investment company, 751
is a “small business” or “small organization” if it has total assets of $5 million or less as of the
end of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage in an offering of
securities which does not exceed $5 million. 752 We believe that the final rule will affect some
small entities that are business development companies that have a class of securities registered
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. We estimate that there are approximately five of those
business development companies that may be considered small entities. 753 As discussed above,
emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies are excluded from the final rule.
An “emerging growth company” is an issuer that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1
billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. 754 A smaller reporting company is an
issuer, other than certain classes of issuers (including investment companies), that had a public
float of less than $75 million as of the end of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or
in the case of an initial registration statement under the Securities Act or Exchange Act for the
shares of its common equity, had a public float of less than $75 million as of a date within 30 days

751

For purposes of the RFA, an investment company is a “small business” or “small organization” that,
together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment companies, has net assets
of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year. 17 CFR 270.0-10.

752

See Securities Act Rule 157 [17 CFR 230.157] and Exchange Act Rule 0-10(a) [17 CFR 240.0-10(a)].

753

We estimate that there are 13 business development companies that will be subject to the final rule, five of
which may be considered small entities for purposes of the RFA.

754

See Securities Act Section 2(a)(19) [15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19)].

280

of the date of filing of the registration statement. 755 To the extent that a small entity is a
registrant, we believe that there are few, if any, small entities that do not qualify as emerging
growth companies or smaller reporting companies because it is unlikely that an entity with total
assets of $5 million or less would have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, or would
have a public float of $75 million or more. Because emerging growth companies and smaller
reporting companies are excluded from the new disclosure requirement, we believe that the final
rule applies to few, if any, small entities, other than the five business development companies.
For the above reasons, we again certify, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the final rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

in paragraph (u)(1)(i) of this Item shall equal one, or, alternatively, the ratio may be expressed
narratively as the multiple that the amount in paragraph (u)(1)(ii) of this Item bears to the amount
in paragraph (u)(1)(i) of this Item.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph (u),
(i) Total compensation for the median of annual total compensation of all employees of
the registrant and the PEO of the registrant shall be determined in accordance with paragraph
(c)(2)(x) of this Item 402. In determining the total compensation, all references to “named
executive officer” in this Item 402 and the instructions thereto may be deemed to refer instead, as
applicable, to “employee” and, for non-salaried employees, references to “base salary” and
“salary” in this Item 402 and the instructions thereto may be deemed to refer instead, as
applicable, to “wages plus overtime”;
(ii) Annual total compensation means total compensation for the registrant’s last
completed fiscal year; and
(iii) Registrant means the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph (u), employee or employee of the registrant means an
individual employed by the registrant or any of its consolidated subsidiaries, whether as a fulltime, part-time, seasonal, or temporary worker, as of a date chosen by the registrant within the last
three months of the registrant’s last completed fiscal year. The definition of employee or
employee of the registrant does not include those workers who are employed, and whose
compensation is determined, by an unaffiliated third party but who provide services to the
registrant or its consolidated subsidiaries as independent contractors or “leased” workers;
(4) For purposes of this paragraph (u), an employee located in a jurisdiction outside the
United States (a “non-U.S. employee”) may be exempt from the definition of employee or

283

employee of the registrant under either of the following conditions:
(i) The employee is employed in a foreign jurisdiction in which the laws or regulations
governing data privacy are such that, despite its reasonable efforts to obtain or process the
information necessary for compliance with this paragraph (u), the registrant is unable to do so
without violating such data privacy laws or regulations. The registrant’s reasonable efforts shall
include, at a minimum, using or seeking an exemption or other relief under any governing data
privacy laws or regulations. If the registrant chooses to exclude any employees using this
exemption, it shall list the excluded jurisdictions, identify the specific data privacy law or
regulation, explain how complying with this paragraph (u) violates such data privacy law or
regulation (including the efforts made by the registrant to use or seek an exemption or other relief
under such law or regulation), and provide the approximate number of employees exempted from
each jurisdiction based on this exemption. In addition, if a registrant excludes any non-U.S.
employees in a particular jurisdiction under this exemption, it must exclude all non-U.S.
employees in that jurisdiction. Further, the registrant shall obtain a legal opinion from counsel
that opines on the inability of the registrant to obtain or process the information necessary for
compliance with this paragraph (u) without violating the jurisdiction’s laws or regulations
governing data privacy, including the registrant’s inability to obtain an exemption or other relief
under any governing laws or regulations. The registrant shall file the legal opinion as an exhibit
to the filing in which the pay ratio disclosure is included.
(ii) The registrant’s non-U.S. employees account for 5% or less of the registrant’s total
employees. In that circumstance, if the registrant chooses to exclude any non-U.S. employees
under this exemption, it must exclude all non-U.S. employees. Additionally, if a registrant’s nonU.S. employees exceed 5% of the registrant’s total U.S. and non-U.S. employees, it may exclude

284

up to 5% of its total employees who are non-U.S. employees; provided, however, if a registrant
excludes any non-U.S. employees in a particular jurisdiction, it must exclude all non-U.S.
employees in that jurisdiction. If more than 5% of a registrant’s employees are located in any one
non-U.S. jurisdiction, the registrant may not exclude any employees in that jurisdiction under this
exemption.
(A) In calculating the number of non-U.S. employees that may be excluded under this
Item 402(u)(4)(ii) (“de minimis” exemption), a registrant shall count against the total any nonU.S. employee exempted under the data privacy law exemption under Item 402(u)(4)(i) (“data
privacy” exemption). A registrant may exclude any non-U.S. employee from a jurisdiction that
meets the data privacy exemption, even if the number of excluded employees exceeds 5% of the
registrant’s total employees. If, however, the number of employees excluded under the data
privacy exemption equals or exceeds 5% of the registrant’s total employees, the registrant may
not use the de minimis exemption. Additionally, if the number of employees excluded under the
data privacy exemption is less than 5% of the registrant’s total employees, the registrant may use
the de minimis exemption to exclude no more than the number of non-U.S. employees that,
combined with the data privacy exemption, does not exceed 5% of the registrant’s total
employees.
(B) If a registrant excludes non-U.S. employees under the de minimis exemption, it must
disclose the jurisdiction or jurisdictions from which those employees are being excluded, the
approximate number of employees excluded from each jurisdiction under the de minimis
exemption, the total number of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees irrespective of any exemption
(data privacy or de minimis), and the total number of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees used for its
de minimis calculation.

285

Instruction 1 to Item 402(u). Disclosing the date chosen for identifying the median
employee.
A registrant shall disclose the date within the last three months of its last completed fiscal
year that it selected pursuant to paragraph (u)(3) of this Item to identify its median employee. If
the registrant changes the date it uses to identify the median employee from the prior year, the
registrant shall disclose this change and provide a brief explanation about the reason or reasons for
the change.
Instruction 2 to Item 402(u). Identifying the median employee.
A registrant is required to identify its median employee only once every three years and
calculate total compensation for that employee each year; provided that, during a registrant’s last
completed fiscal year there has been no change in its employee population or employee
compensation arrangements that it reasonably believes would result in a significant change to its
pay ratio disclosure. If there have been no changes that the registrant reasonably believes would
significantly affect its pay ratio disclosure, the registrant shall disclose that it is using the same
median employee in its pay ratio calculation and describe briefly the basis for its reasonable belief.
For example, the registrant could disclose that there has been no change in its employee population
or employee compensation arrangements that it believes would significantly impact the pay ratio
disclosure. If there has been a change in the registrant’s employee population or employee
compensation arrangements that the registrant reasonably believes would result in a significant
change in its pay ratio disclosure, the registrant shall re-identify the median employee for that
fiscal year. If it is no longer appropriate for the registrant to use the median employee identified in
year one as the median employee in years two or three because of a change in the original median
employee’s circumstances that the registrant reasonably believes would result in a significant

286

change in its pay ratio disclosure, the registrant may use another employee whose compensation is
substantially similar to the original median employee based on the compensation measure used to
select the original median employee.
Instruction 3 to Item 402(u). Updating for the last completed fiscal year.
Pay ratio information (i.e., the disclosure called for by paragraph (u)(1) of this Item) with
respect to the registrant’s last completed fiscal year is not required to be disclosed until the filing
of its annual report on Form 10-K for that last completed fiscal year or, if later, the filing of a
definitive proxy or information statement relating to its next annual meeting of shareholders (or
written consents in lieu of such a meeting) following the end of such fiscal year; provided that, the
required pay ratio information must, in any event, be filed as provided in General Instruction G(3)
of Form 10-K (17 CFR 249.310) not later than 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.
Instruction 4 to Item 402(u). Methodology and use of estimates.
1. Registrants may use reasonable estimates both in the methodology used to identify the
median employee and in calculating the annual total compensation or any elements of total
compensation for employees other than the PEO.
2. In determining the employees from which the median employee is identified, a
registrant may use its employee population or statistical sampling and/or other reasonable
methods.
3. A registrant may identify the median employee using annual total compensation or any
other compensation measure that is consistently applied to all employees included in the
calculation, such as information derived from the registrant’s tax and/or payroll records. In using
a compensation measure other than annual total compensation to identify the median employee, if
that measure is recorded on a basis other than the registrant’s fiscal year (such as information

287

derived from tax and/or payroll records), the registrant may use the same annual period that is
used to derive those amounts. Where a compensation measure other than annual total
compensation is used to identify the median employee, the registrant must disclose the
compensation measure used.
4. In identifying the median employee, whether using annual total compensation or any
other compensation measure that is consistently applied to all employees included in the
calculation, the registrant may make cost-of-living adjustments to the compensation of employees
in jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides so that the compensation is
adjusted to the cost of living in the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides. If the registrant uses a
cost-of-living adjustment to identify the median employee, and the median employee identified is
an employee in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the PEO resides, the registrant
must use the same cost-of-living adjustment in calculating the median employee’s annual total
compensation and disclose the median employee’s jurisdiction. The registrant also shall briefly
describe the cost-of-living adjustments it used to identify the median employee and briefly
describe the cost-of-living adjustments it used to calculate the median employee’s annual total
compensation, including the measure used as the basis for the cost-of-living adjustment. A
registrant electing to present the pay ratio in this manner also shall disclose the median
employee’s annual total compensation and pay ratio without the cost-of-living adjustment. To
calculate this pay ratio, the registrant will need to identify the median employee without using any
cost-of-living adjustments.
5. The registrant shall briefly describe the methodology it used to identify the median
employee. It shall also briefly describe any material assumptions, adjustments (including any
cost-of-living adjustments), or estimates it used to identify the median employee or to determine

288

total compensation or any elements of total compensation, which shall be consistently applied.
The registrant shall clearly identify any estimates used. The required descriptions should be a
brief overview; it is not necessary for the registrant to provide technical analyses or formulas. If a
registrant changes its methodology or its material assumptions, adjustments, or estimates from
those used in its pay ratio disclosure for the prior fiscal year, and if the effects of any such change
are significant, the registrant shall briefly describe the change and the reasons for the change.
Registrants must also disclose if they changed from using the cost-of-living adjustment to not
using that adjustment and if they changed from not using the cost-of-living adjustment to using it.
6. Registrants may, at their discretion, include personal benefits that aggregate less than
$10,000 and compensation under non-discriminatory benefit plans in calculating the annual total
compensation of the median employee as long as these items are also included in calculating the
PEO’s annual total compensation. The registrant shall also explain any difference between the
PEO’s annual total compensation used in the pay ratio disclosure and the total compensation
amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table, if material.
Instruction 5 to Item 402(u). Permitted annualizing adjustments.
A registrant may annualize the total compensation for all permanent employees (full-time
or part-time) that were employed by the registrant for less than the full fiscal year (such as newly
hired employees or permanent employees on an unpaid leave of absence during the period). A
registrant may not annualize the total compensation for employees in temporary or seasonal
positions. A registrant may not make a full-time equivalent adjustment for any employee.
Instruction 6 to Item 402(u). PEO compensation not available.
A registrant that is relying on Instruction 1 to Item 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) in connection
with the salary or bonus of the PEO for the last completed fiscal year, shall disclose that the pay

289

ratio required by paragraph (u) of this Item is not calculable until the PEO salary or bonus, as
applicable, is determined and shall disclose the date that the PEO’s actual total compensation is
expected to be determined. The disclosure required by paragraph (u) of this Item shall then be
disclosed in the filing under Item 5.02(f) of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308) that discloses the PEO’s
salary or bonus in accordance with Instruction 1 to Item 402(c)(2)(iii) and (iv).
Instruction 7 to Item 402(u). Transition periods for registrants.
1. Upon becoming subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)), a registrant shall comply with paragraph (u) of this Item with
respect to compensation for the first fiscal year following the year in which it became subject to
such requirements, but not for any fiscal year commencing before January 1, 2017. The registrant
may omit the disclosure required by paragraph (u) of this Item from any filing until the filing of
its annual report on Form 10-K (17 CFR 249.310) for such fiscal year or, if later, the filing of a
proxy or information statement relating to its next annual meeting of shareholders (or written
consents in lieu of such a meeting) following the end of such year; provided that, such disclosure
shall, in any event, be filed as provided in General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K not later than
120 days after the end of such fiscal year.
2. A registrant may omit any employees that became its employees as the result of the
business combination or acquisition of a business for the fiscal year in which the transaction
becomes effective, but the registrant must disclose the approximate number of employees it is
omitting. Those employees shall be included in the total employee count for the triennial
calculations of the median employee in the year following the transaction for purposes of
evaluating whether a significant change had occurred. The registrant shall identify the acquired
business excluded for the fiscal year in which the business combination or acquisition becomes

290

effective.
3. A registrant shall comply with paragraph (u) of this Item with respect to compensation
for the first fiscal year commencing on or after the date the registrant ceases to be a smaller
reporting company, but not for any fiscal year commencing before January 1, 2017.
Instruction 8 to Item 402(u). Emerging growth companies.
A registrant is not required to comply with paragraph (u) of this Item if it is an emerging
growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77(b)(a)(19)) or
Section 3(a)(80) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80)). A registrant shall comply with
paragraph (u) of this Item with respect to compensation for the first fiscal year commencing on or
after the date the registrant ceases to be an emerging growth company, but not for any fiscal year
commencing before January 1, 2017.
Instruction 9 to Item 402(u). Additional information.
Registrants may present additional information, including additional ratios, to supplement
the required ratio, but are not required to do so. Any additional information shall be clearly
identified, not misleading, and not presented with greater prominence than the required ratio.
Instruction 10 to Item 402(u). Multiple PEOs during the year.
A registrant with more than one non-concurrent PEO serving during its fiscal year may
calculate the annual total compensation for its PEO in either of the following manners:
1. The registrant may calculate the compensation provided to each person who served as
PEO during the year for the time he or she served as PEO and combine those figures; or
2. The registrant may look to the PEO serving in that position on the date it selects to
identify the median employee and annualize that PEO’s compensation.
Regardless of the alternative selected, the registrant shall disclose which option it chose and how

291

it calculated its PEO’s annual total compensation.
Instruction 11 to Item 402(u). Employees’ personally identifiable information.
Registrants are not required to, and should not, disclose any personally identifiable
information about that employee other than his or her compensation. Registrants may choose to
generally identify an employee’s position to put the employee’s compensation in context, but
registrants are not required to provide this information and should not do so if providing the
information could identify any specific individual.
