In the Matter of
Code Rebel Corporation,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of accurate
information concerning the securities of Code Rebel Corporation (“CDRB”) because of
questions regarding the accuracy of statements in CDRB’s Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended
June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015, and the Form 10-K for the year ending December 31,
2015, concerning the company’s assets and financial condition. CDRB is a Delaware
corporation with its principal executive offices in Kahului, Hawaii. Its stock is listed on
NASDAQ under the symbol CDRB.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on May 6, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 19, 2016.
By the Commission.
