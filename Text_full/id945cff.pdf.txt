INITIAL DECISION
January 27, 2016

Kevin P. O’Rourke and Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the
Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission
David Bercusson, President, for Respondent RKO Resources, Inc.
(a/k/a Shamika 2 Gold, Inc.)1

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of RKO Resources,
Inc. (a/k/a Shamika 2 Gold, Inc.) (RKO). The revocation is based on RKO’s failure to file required
periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Commission initiated this proceeding with an Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP),
pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), on May 5, 2015.
An Initial Decision was issued on May 26, 2015. A.B. Watley Grp., Inc., Initial Decision Release
No. 798, 2015 SEC LEXIS 2100 (A.L.J. May 26, 2015). Thereafter, the Commission vacated the
Initial Decision as to RKO and remanded the case for further proceedings. RKO Res., Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 75765, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3540 (Aug. 26, 2015). At an October 2, 2015,
prehearing conference, the Division of Enforcement requested leave to file a motion for summary
disposition. Leave was granted, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a); the due dates for the motion
for summary disposition, opposition, and reply were October 23, November 13, and November 20,

2015, respectively. RKO Res., Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3191, 2015 SEC LEXIS
4041 (A.L.J. Oct. 2, 2015). The parties timely filed their pleadings.
This Initial Decision is based on the pleadings (including RKO’s June 2015 Motion to
Vacate Default Judgment) and the Commission’s public official records concerning RKO, of which
official notice is taken pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323. There is no genuine issue with regard to
any material fact, and this proceeding may be resolved by summary disposition, pursuant to 17
C.F.R. § 201.250. Any other facts in RKO’s pleadings have been taken as true, in light of the
Division’s burden of proof and pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). All arguments and proposed
findings and conclusions that are inconsistent with this decision were considered and rejected.
B. Allegations and Arguments of the Parties
The OIP alleges that RKO’s securities are registered with the Commission pursuant to
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and that RKO had not filed any required periodic reports since
filing a report for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. RKO urges that its registration not be
revoked. It represents that it will become current if its registration is not revoked. However, RKO
does not consider it appropriate to spend its limited resources on becoming current while facing the
possibility of revocation and consequent waste of the resources.
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
RKO (CIK No. 1330323)2 is a Nevada corporation located in Saint-Laurent, Québec,
Canada, with a class of equity securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). Official notice. The Commission’s public official records contained in EDGAR3
show that RKO is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any
periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q on February 19, 2014, for the quarter ended September
30, 2012. The unaudited financial statements included in that Form 10-Q showed cash on hand of
$149, total assets of $1,916, and current liabilities of $387,476. The financial statements showed a
net loss of $3,712,606 since the company’s January 13, 2010, inception.
In May 2015, RKO’s former sole office and director and controlling stockholder, Henry
Riedel, resigned from his positions and sold his controlling interest to David Bercusson, who then
became president and sole director of RKO.4 Opposition at Aff., pp-1-2; Motion to Vacate Default
at Aff., pp. 1, 3. During Riedel’s tenure, Bercusson believes, RKO lacked the resources necessary
to file the required periodic reports. Motion to Vacate Default at Aff., p. 4. Bercusson contacted an
auditor and discussed the costs and timing of auditing RKO’s financial statements to resolve its

deficient filings. Opposition at Aff., p. 2-3; Motion to Vacate Default at Aff., p. 4. RKO will cure
any deficiencies and make all requisite filings, past and present, if its registration is not revoked.
Opposition at Aff., p. 2; Motion to Vacate Default at Aff., p. 4. Bercusson and other RKO
shareholders believe that revoking RKO’s registration provides no benefit to RKO and makes it less
likely for the company to succeed in the future. Motion to Vacate Default at Aff., p. 5.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
By failing to file required annual and quarterly reports, RKO violated Exchange Act Section
13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
IV. SANCTION
The Division requests that the registration of RKO’s securities be revoked. In proceedings
pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act against issuers that violated Exchange Act Section
13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, the determination “of what sanctions will ensure that
investors will be adequately protected . . . turns on the effect on the investing public, including both
current and prospective investors, of the issuer’s violations, on the one hand, and the Section 12(j)
sanctions, on the other hand.” Gateway Int'l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 53907,
2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006) (citing Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 113940 (5th Cir. 1979)). The Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the
issuer’s violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability
involved, the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future
compliance, and the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Id.
The violations were serious in that failure to file periodic reports violates a crucial provision
of the Exchange Act. The purpose of the periodic reporting requirements is to publicly disclose
current, accurate financial information about an issuer so that investors may make informed
decisions:
The reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is the primary
tool which Congress has fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent,
careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the sale of stock and securities.
Congress has extended the reporting requirements even to companies which are
“relatively unknown and insubstantial.”
SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977) (quoting legislative history); accord
e-Smart Techs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 50514, 2004 SEC LEXIS 2361, at *8-9 (Oct. 12,
2004). The Commission has warned that “many publicly traded companies that fail to file on a
timely basis are ‘shell companies’ and, as such, attractive vehicles for fraudulent stock manipulation
schemes.” e-Smart Techs., Inc., 2004 SEC LEXIS 2361, at *9 n.14.
RKO’s violations are recurrent in that it has repeatedly failed to file periodic reports.
RKO’s effort to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance consists of a promise to
become current if, and only if, its registration is not revoked. However, “Compliance with
[Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13] is mandatory and may not be subject to
conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511,

2007 SEC LEXIS 1241 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007
SEC LEXIS 1242 (June 6, 2007). Further, RKO’s parlous financial situation, as indicated by the
September 30, 2012, unaudited financial statements and Bercusson’s own belief, bodes ill for future
compliance.
Regarding the negative impact of revocation on current investors, while both current and
prospective investors are harmed by the lack of current, accurate financial information about an
issuer, the interests of existing investors must not take precedence over those of prospective
investors. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS
81, at *XX (Jan. 21, 2009); America’s Sports Voice, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *17 n.23; Gateway
Int'l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 n.26.
In sum, revocation accords with Commission sanction considerations set forth in Gateway
Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20, and with the sanctions imposed in similar
cases in which corporations violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) by failing to file required annual
and quarterly reports. See Cobalis Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 64813, 2011 SEC LEXIS
2313 (July 6, 2011); Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., 2009 SEC LEXIS 81; Impax Labs., Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197 (May 23, 2008); America’s Sports Voice,
Inc., 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241; Eagletech Commc’ns, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 54095, 2006
SEC LEXIS 1534 (July 5, 2006). RKO’s violations were recurrent, egregious, and deprived the
investing public of current and accurate financial information on which to make informed decisions.
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15
U.S.C. § 78l(j), the REGISTRATION of the registered securities of RKO Resources, Inc. (a/k/a

motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to
file a petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a

correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the Initial
Decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the Initial Decision shall not become final as to
that party.
