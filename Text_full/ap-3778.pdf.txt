In the Matter of
RINGS TO DINE FOR, INC.

ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING AND
REGARDING SERVICE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
on March 29, 2016, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A hearing
is scheduled for April 18, 2016.
On April 11, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service asserting
that service was effected on April 6, 2016, by mailing the OIP to Respondent’s address listed on
its most recent EDGAR filing in the Philippines. Decl. at 2. The Division attached a printout of
the U.S. Postal Service’s tracking confirmation showing “[a]ddressee not available – [w]ill
attempt delivery on next working day” on April 6 and 7, and that on April 8, 2016, “[c]ustoms
clearance processing [was] complete.” Id. at Ex. 1.
While the Division has provided sufficient support that service by mail is acceptable in
the Philippines, see Decl. at 2 & Ex. 2, I find that the USPS tracking confirmation does not
clearly establish attempted delivery without further information. I ORDER the Division to file a
supplemental service declaration by April 27, 2016, addressing the following issues: (1) the
meaning of “[c]ustoms clearance processing complete” and whether it refers to customs
processing for entry into the Philippines or re-entry into the United States; and (2) the ability of
USPS to track packages once they enter the Philippines’ mail system.
I FURTHER ORDER that the hearing scheduled for April 18 is POSTPONED. I will
schedule a telephonic prehearing conference after reviewing the Division’s supplemental service
declaration.
