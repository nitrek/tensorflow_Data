ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 4022/July 26, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17311

In the Matter of
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
REBORNNE (USA) INC.
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
on June 23, 2016, alleging that Respondent has a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has failed to
file required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement filed a declaration on July 12, 2016,
establishing that Respondent was served with the OIP on June 28, 2016, at the address in New
Zealand that appears on its most recent filing with the Commission, in accordance with
Commission Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(iv). See 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), (iv); Rebornne
(USA) Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3982, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2432 (ALJ July 13,
2016). As an additional measure, the Division also served the OIP on Respondent’s registered
agent in Florida by United Parcel Service on July 14, 2016.
Respondent has not filed an answer, did not appear at the prehearing conference on July
25, 2016, and has not otherwise defended the proceeding. I therefore ORDER Respondent to
SHOW CAUSE by August 12, 2016, why the registration of its securities should not be revoked
by default due to these failures. If the Respondent fails to respond to this order, it will be
deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the registration of its
securities will be revoked. OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
