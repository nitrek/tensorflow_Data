optionsXpress, Inc., a registered broker-dealer (“optionsXpress”), and Jonathan I.
Feldman (“Feldman”), an optionsXpress customer, appeal from an administrative law judge’s
initial decision.1 The law judge found that optionsXpress willfully violated Rules 204 and 204T
of Regulation SHO of the Securities Exchange Act of 19342 by failing to close out certain fail to
deliver positions and that Feldman violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,3
Exchange Act Section 10(b),4 and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 10b-215 by writing call options
with the intent not to make delivery of securities when those options were exercised. For these
violations, the law judge issued a cease-and-desist order, an order to disgorge ill-gotten gains,
and third-tier civil monetary penalties. We find that optionsXpress violated Rules 204 and 204T.
But we find that the Division of Enforcement has not met its burden to show that Feldman
committed fraud. We base our findings on an independent review of the record, except with
respect to those findings not challenged on appeal.
I.

Summary

This matter centers on the concept of “delivery” of securities and the different meanings
that term has for clearing broker-dealers (like optionsXpress) and their customers (like Feldman).
Rule 204 of Regulation SHO requires participants in a registered clearing agency to deliver
securities to the clearing agency within three settlement days of a long or short sale transaction in
an equity security (i.e., T+3).6
For purposes of Rule 204, a “fail to deliver” occurs when the participant broker or dealer
does not have enough shares in its securities-depository account to satisfy its delivery obligation
to the clearing agency. When a fail to deliver occurs, Rule 204 requires the broker or dealer to,
“by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours” on the next settlement day (i.e., T+4),
“immediately close out its fail to deliver position by borrowing or purchasing securities” of like
kind and quantity. Rule 204 applies to participants in registered clearing agencies, and does not

apply to such participants’ retail customers.7 The delivery obligations of customers like Feldman
instead arise from their contractual arrangements with their brokers and any representations they
may have made, whether explicitly or by course of conduct, in connection with their trades.
Ultimately, participants are required to comply with their own delivery obligations, regardless of
whether a customer satisfies his or hers.
optionsXpress was a participant in the National Securities Clearing Corporation
(“NSCC”), a registered clearing agency. Feldman and other retail customers of optionsXpress
(the “Customers”) employed an options trading strategy that contributed to the firm having large
and continuing fail to deliver positions in about two dozen securities between October 2008 and
March 2010 (the “OIP Securities”). The Division claims that optionsXpress violated its
obligations under Rules 204T and 204 when it relied upon buy-writes placed by the Customers to
address the firm’s fail to deliver positions; the buy-writes, the Division claims, did not timely
close out the firm’s fails. It also claims that Feldman violated the antifraud provisions by
allegedly not making delivery when the call options he wrote were exercised. We agree with the
first claim, but find that the record does not support the second.
II.

Overview of the trading activity

This matter involves paired stock and options transactions (i.e., buy-writes) repeatedly
executed by optionsXpress at the behest of certain of its retail customers, including respondent
Feldman, between October 2008 and March 2010. Before turning to our analysis of the
violations alleged in the OIP, we provide an overview of the trading activity and the impact that
the transactions had on each respondent’s distinct delivery obligations.
A.

The Customers’ trading strategy

Call and put options are contracts that give their holders the right, but not the obligation,
to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) a fixed number of shares of the underlying security at
a specific price—called the strike or exercise price—until the expiration date. An option “series”
consists of all the put options or call options on the same underlying security with the same strike
price and the same expiration date.
The Customers’ trading strategy took advantage of a disparity between the price of the
underlying security and the price of options on that security in the OIP Securities. The OIP
Securities were all “hard to borrow,” which means that it was more expensive to borrow them
because they were in high demand by short sellers relative to number of shares that were
available for lending. In hard to borrow securities, puts will appear overpriced in comparison to
7

Rule 204 contains provisions governing situations when a participant allocatesa fail to
deliver position to a broker-dealer customer “for which its clears trades or from which it receives
trades for settlement.” 17 C.F.R. § 242.204(d).

6
calls with the same strike price and expiration date because the higher borrowing costs are
factored into the price of the put.
The Customers sought to profit from this apparent disparity by selling (or writing) puts
and buying calls in identical quantities for the same security. When done together, with the same
expiration date and strike price, these trades created a “synthetic long” position that mimicked
owning the stock through the expiration date of the options. Standing alone, such a position
would expose the Customers to the risk that the underlying security would decline in price.
Thus, at the same time, the Customers would establish a hedge by either selling the stock short
(which, when coupled with a synthetic long, is called a “reverse conversion”) or writing deep-inthe-money call options (which, when coupled with a synthetic long, is called a “three-way
trade”).8
Once the Customers executed these initial trades, optionsXpress’s books would reflect
that they had a short stock position in their accounts with the firm. When they employed a
reverse conversion, this short position was recorded immediately. When they employed a threeway trade, the deep-in the-money calls were typically exercised right away and then assigned to
optionsXpress (which in turn would allocate the assignment to a customer). Once that happened,
a short position would be recorded in the Customers’ accounts, exactly as if they sold the stock
short from the outset.
Either way, when optionsXpress had a fail to deliver position in the security,
optionsXpress would then issue “buy-in” notices, which directed the Customers to “cover” their
short positions with the firm.9 The Customers might have responded by simply purchasing the
stock and doing nothing else; in this case, they would have exposed themselves to directional
risk in the underlying security until the synthetic long expired. The Customers also might have
responded by purchasing the stock and also unwinding the synthetic long prior to expiration. But
this would have eliminated any potential for profit as well. The issue in this case is that when
optionsXpress allowed the Customers to place buy-writes—that is, an order to purchase the stock
and write deep-in-the-money call options for the same number of shares—in response to its buy-

8

Whether the Customers initially proceeded by way of a reverse conversion or a three-way
trade had no effect on the economics of the trading strategy from the Customers’ perspective (or,
as we explain below, on the delivery obligations incurred by optionsXpress). The Customers’
maximum potential profit for any such position was fixed at the outset: It was, at most, the net
premiums received for the synthetic long, less transaction costs, the cost of purchasing the
security upon expiration of the synthetic long, and the ongoing costs to holding the position until
expiration discussed in the next paragraph.
9

The timing of when optionsXpress issued these buy-in notices is discussed infra Section
III.B. Generally, optionsXpress would issue them when the firm had a fail to deliver and the
customer had a short position with the firm.

7
in notices, optionsXpress itself relied upon the buy-writes to satisfy the firm’s delivery
obligations.10 These buy-writes enabled the Customers to keep a hedge in place, and thus hold
the synthetic long position open until expiration while remaining insulated from movements in
the price of the underlying security. Yet each buy-write that the Customers placed cost them a
penny or two per share of stock and thus cut into their profits.
We offer an example based on the three-way trade that Feldman employed in September
and October 2009 in Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD):


On September 16, 2009, Feldman established a synthetic long position.
He bought October 2009 SHLD calls with an expiration date of October
16, 2009 and a strike price of $70; the premium was $1.44/share. He also
wrote October 2009 SHLD puts with the same strike price; the premium
was $6.62/share. On the same day, he completed the three-way trade by
selling deep-in-the-money September 2009 SHLD calls with a strike price
of $10, for which he received a premium of $55.75/share. As a result of
these transactions, Feldman received an up-front premium of $60.94/share
(i.e., $55.75 + $6.62 - $1.44).



On almost every trading day between September 22 and October 16,
optionsXpress had fails to deliver that were perpetuated by assignment of
deep-in-the-money calls and issued Feldman buy-in notices. On each
occasion, Feldman placed a buy-write at a cost of between $0.01 and
$0.02/share, which optionsXpress executed and relied upon to address its
own obligations under Regulation SHO.



On October 16, the options comprising the synthetic long expired.
Because the market price of SHLD was $70.08 (and thus above the $70
strike price of the October 2009 SHLD puts), their holders allowed them
to expire unexercised. The holders of the deep-in-the money calls
exercised the options, and Feldman was required to sell them SHLD for
$10/share. Finally, Feldman exercised his October 2009 SHLD calls and
was able to buy SHLD for $70/share. Feldman thus incurred a loss of
$60/share.11

10

On average, the strike prices of the calls that Feldman wrote were 57% lower than the
closing prices of the underlying securities on the day of the sale.
11

If SHLD market price had been below the $70 strike price, the expected loss would have
been the same, with the holders of the October 2009 puts exercising their options; the holders of
the deep-in-the money calls doing the same; and Feldman’s calls expiring worthless.

8
In summary, Feldman’s overall expected profit from this series of trades was $0.94/share
(i.e., the up-front premium of $60.94/share minus the locked-in $60/share loss upon the
expiration of the synthetic long), less the cost for the buy-writes and other transaction costs, such
as fees and commissions.
B.

The continuing cycle of buy-writes resulting from assignments

The calls written by the Customers were, on an ongoing basis, exercised, assigned to
optionsXpress, and then allocated by optionsXpress to the accounts of its retail customers by its
issuance of buy-in notices. The Customers therefore continued to have a short stock position in
their accounts with optionsXpress. On each successive day, optionsXpress would issue another
buy-in notice, which the firm allowed Customers to respond to by placing yet another buy-write,
thus perpetuating the cycle until the synthetic long finally expired.
Although it was not certain that every call would be exercised and assigned right away,
that was the case for the majority of the buy-write calls because they were written deep in the
money. As Dr. Atanu Saha, optionsXpress’s expert, acknowledged, the “deeper the call is inthe-money, the more likely it is to be assigned.” Reviewing Feldman’s trades in the OIP
Securities, the Division’s expert, Professor Lawrence Harris, determined that assignments to the
buy-write calls very often occurred on the same day that they were sold. For example, on 94%
of the 395 trading days on which either Feldman sold a call or an assignment was made to that
series of options, both a sale of a new buy-write call and an assignment took place. Also, the
size of the assignments correlated closely with the number of options being written on the same
and immediately preceding days.
The Division’s expert also determined that, on average, Feldman would execute a buywrite in the same security every 1.02 trading days. Stated another way, 98% of the time that
Feldman executed a buy-write, he would execute another buy-write in the same security exactly
one trading day later. The longest string of consecutive days in which Feldman used buy-writes
in the same security, Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD), was 50, and the average for all the OIP
Securities was 12 consecutive trading days. Overall, Feldman executed 390 such buy-writes
during the relevant period, and those buy-writes occurred on 386 (or 98%) of the 395 total
trading days during the relevant period.
In short, Professor Harris’s analysis demonstrated that many of the deep-in-the-money
buy-write calls in the OIP Securities were being exercised as they were being written, and that
Feldman would respond by placing yet another buy-write.12

12

As a further indication of the close relationship between calls sold as part of the buy-writes
and subsequent assignments, Professor Harris found that, on a last-in-first-out basis, 92% of the
buy-write call volume that was ultimately closed by assignment was assigned on the same day
(continued…)

9
Because Feldman traded in such large volumes, some of Feldman’s buy-writes were also
quite large. On December 31, 2009, for example, Feldman entered into a buy-write for 516,600
shares of Sears, and a corresponding number of call options, to maintain his hedged position in
Sears. The notional value of the stock purchase was $43 million, and it represented 32% of the
1,603,300 total Sears shares (including those comprising the buy-write) that traded in the United
States on that date.
Respondents contend that the Division’s data does not tell the whole story, noting that,
for trading involving securities not at issue here (and certain other periods of trading),
assignments were often more sporadic or delayed. Their experts also noted that no two OIP
Securities had the same likelihood of assignment and that the precise figure varied over time.
This may be true, but for the OIP Securities during the periods identified in the OIP, there was a
high likelihood that the calls would be immediately assigned (and that a buy-write would
subsequently be placed).
Both optionsXpress and Feldman were aware of these facts at the time of the trades in
question. For example, Feldman sent an instant message to a floor broker, writing, “See how it
happens? Same trade every day. Get assigned stock [sic] + sell options.” He similarly emailed
optionsXpress that responding to its buy-in notices with a buy-write was “part of [his] daily
routine. Brush teeth, get coffee, res[e]t C [Citigroup, Inc.], cover buyin on C.” On another
occasion, emailing optionsXpress, Feldman similarly wrote, “Gmorning. Can do the same today
re [Sears] as yest[erday] re buy writes. Same applies tomorrow (Fri) too. Thx.” Another floor
broker who spoke with Feldman about his trades testified that “Feldman had made it aware to
myself that he would be doing these buy-writes almost daily.”
As Feldman admitted at the hearing, the “buy-writes were, as we all know, repetitious,
and did happen frequently.” He acknowledged this in his briefing as well, noting that “highvolume trading and frequent same-day exercise of the written calls” was evident to the
marketplace.
C.

optionsXpress’s large and persistent fail to deliver positions

Although optionsXpress contractually required Feldman and the other Customers to
respond to its buy-in notices (and permitted them to do so by placing buy-writes), the firm did
not require them to actually locate and deliver shares to optionsXpress (or to anyone else). The
firm’s director of clearing operations, Ronald Molnar, admitted that optionsXpress never
directed Feldman to deliver shares to the firm, whether to cure his short positions with the firm,

(…continued)

that it traded and 97% was assigned on the day of the trade or the first trading day afterwards.
The corresponding figures on a first-in-first-out basis were only slightly lower.

10
in response to the firm’s buy-in notices, or otherwise. Molnar further testified that Feldman
never made any representations about his ability or intention to do so and that, even if Feldman
had made such a representation, the firm “wouldn’t have accepted it.”
The Customers’ obligations to optionsXpress are distinct from the firm’s own delivery
obligations to the clearing agency under Regulation SHO.13 In broad terms, Rule 204 of
Regulation SHO requires participants of a registered clearing agency (such as optionsXpress) to
deliver equity securities to a registered clearing agency (here, NSCC) by the designated
settlement date—typically three days after the trade date, or T+3.14 Put another way, Rule 204
required optionsXpress to deliver securities to NSCC within three days of executing a short sale
order or being assigned on a call option. If optionsXpress did not have enough shares on hand to
satisfy its aggregate delivery obligations, the firm would have a fail to deliver position reflected
in NSCC’s Continuous Net Settlement (“CNS”) system. When this happened, Rule 204 required
optionsXpress, by no later than market open the following day (i.e., T+4), to “immediately close
out” its CNS fail to deliver position “by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and
quantity.”
optionsXpress made no attempt to borrow the OIP Securities.15 Nor did it simply
purchase the stock at market open. It instead relied on the Customers’ buy-writes to satisfy its
obligations under Rule 204. It is clear, based on trading and CNS records, that optionsXpress’s
execution of the Customers’ buy-writes did not close out the CNS fails. Instead, optionsXpress
allowed those fails to persist for weeks—even months—on end. For example, between April 8,
2009 and March 18, 2010, optionsXpress had a fail to deliver position in Sears for 238
consecutive settlement days, during which the market value of the fail position averaged $25
million. By comparison, the next highest number of consecutive days of fails to deliver for Sears
for another broker was two. And between June 19, 2009 and July 24, 2009, optionsXpress had a
fail to deliver position in Citibank for 45 consecutive settlement days, during which the market
value of the position averaged $9 million. These were not isolated occurrences. There were 27
periods in which optionsXpress had a fail to deliver position in one of the OIP Securities that
exceeded a dozen consecutive settlement days. The Division’s expert also showed that the
volume of buy-writes placed by the Customers in a particular OIP Security was closely linked to
13

Our discussion pertains to only retail customers. Nothing in this opinion is intended to
address the allocation of fail to deliver positions to the broker-dealer customers of participants in
registered clearing agencies or any other issue regarding broker-dealer customers of clearing
firms. Cf. 17 C.F.R. § 242.204(d).

If optionsXpress borrowed the stock, it would have had to pay the high stock loan fees
associated with hard-to-borrow securities. Further, if it passed these fees along to Feldman, they
would have more than offset the potential profits from establishing the synthetic long positions.
Reverse conversions and three-way trades typically are not profitable for that reason.

An example series of transactions

To illustrate the trading activity and its effect on the Customers’ accounts with the firm
and optionsXpress’s CNS positions, consider Feldman’s trades in The Talbots Inc. (TLB) in
February and March 2010. In the days before February 9, optionsXpress had a flat or slightly
negative (i.e., in the low hundreds) CNS position. Beginning on February 9, Feldman entered
into a series of three-way trades consisting of paired synthetic long positions and deep-in-themoney call options representing about 330,000 shares of TLB. By the end of February 22,
because of these trades and the trades of other customers, optionsXpress had a fail to deliver
position of 336,200 shares (and thus owed that number of shares to NSCC).16 At the same time,
Feldman had a short stock position in his optionsXpress account because of the exercise and
assignment of some of the options that he had previously written. On February 23, the following
trades took place:


Beginning of the day: Feldman was short shares in his optionsXpress account;
optionsXpress owed (i.e., had a fail to deliver of) 336,200 shares to NSCC



Morning: optionsXpress issued a buy-in notice to Feldman, who bought 335,900
shares and wrote 3,359 deep-in-the-money call options representing 335,900
shares (the buy-write)



During the day: Deep-in-the-money call options were exercised



Evening: optionsXpress received assignment on 3,329 calls and in turn allocated
it to Feldman



End of the day: Feldman still was short 332,900 shares to optionsXpress;
optionsXpress still had a fail to deliver of 336,000 shares to NSCC

Similarly, on the next day, February 24:

16



Morning: optionsXpress issued another buy-in notice to Feldman, who bought
332,900 shares and wrote 3,329 deep-in-the-money call options (the buy-write)



During the day: Deep-in-the-money call options were exercised

The numbers do not sum exactly because of a handful of much smaller trades by other
optionsXpress customers.

12


Evening: optionsXpress received assignment on 3,359 calls and in turn allocated
it to Feldman



End of the day: Feldman still was short 335,900 shares to optionsXpress;
optionsXpress still had a fail to deliver of 336,000 shares to NSCC

And again on February 25:


Morning: optionsXpress issued another buy-in notice to Feldman, who bought
335,900 shares and wrote 3,359 deep-in-the-money call options (the buy-write)



During the day: Deep-in-the-money call options were exercised



Evening: optionsXpress received assignment on 3,359 calls and in turn allocated
it to Feldman



End of the day: Feldman still was short 335,900 shares to optionsXpress;
optionsXpress still had a fail to deliver of 335,861 shares to NSCC

And again on February 26:


Morning: optionsXpress issued another buy-in notice to Feldman, who bought
335,900 shares and wrote 3,359 deep-in-the-money call options (the buy-write)



During the day: Deep-in-the-money call options were exercised



Evening: optionsXpress received assignment on 3,359 calls and in turn allocated
it to Feldman



End of the day: Feldman still was short 335,900 to optionsXpress; optionsXpress
still had a fail to deliver of 330,820 shares to NSCC

This pattern repeated itself for the next several weeks, with optionsXpress immediately
being assigned on the calls and Feldman repeatedly receiving a buy-in notice from optionsXpress
and then placing a deep-in-the-money buy-write in response. optionsXpress’s fail to deliver
position likewise remained open throughout, hovering around 333,000 until March 15 and then
decreasing slowly as the synthetic long unwound. Only on March 18 did this cycle of
assignments and buy-writes end and optionsXpress’s fail was finally closed out. Feldman placed
a buy-write on all of the trading days during the period February 16 to March 18. On 17 of those
23 days, there was a less than 10% difference between the assigned call size and the sold call
size in the buy-write, with an overall correlation for the period of over 0.9. The close
relationship between assignments and buy-writes is confirmed by the analysis of Feldman’s
expert witness, who found with respect to TLB that 77% of the calls in the buy-writes were
assigned in full and 100% were assigned at least in part on the same day they were written.

optionsXpress’s reliance upon the buy-writes to satisfy its delivery and close-out
obligations was, under these circumstances, improper. The buy-writes did not result in
optionsXpress delivering shares to NSCC and thus did not “close out its fail to deliver position”
as required by Rule 204(a). Moreover, apart from the fact that the buy-writes did not close out
the fails, the firm did not ensure that the trades were placed at or before market open and
therefore also violated Rule 204(a)’s proviso that firms act to address fails “by no later than the
beginning of regular trading hours.” Here, we provide more background specific to the Rule 204
violations.
A.

How securities are cleared, settled, and delivered

A precise description of a broker’s delivery obligations to NSCC, how those obligations
are tracked and reflected by the CNS system, and what it means for a broker to have a fail to
deliver position at CNS is relevant to our finding that optionsXpress violated Rule 204. As we
detail below, the CNS system nets together a firm’s trading activity on the same day—including
activity from stock purchases and call option assignments—before computing end-of-day
delivery instructions. When, as here, buy-write calls are regularly and immediately exercised
and assigned, the buys and writes will effectively offset each other without the firm making
delivery of securities to NSCC; intraday movement of shares does not occur.
1.

Delivery of securities following a stock transaction

Most stock transactions involving publicly traded U.S. companies, including all trades at
issue here, are centrally cleared through NSCC’s Continuous Net Settlement system. The
process works as follows:17 On the settlement day after the trade date (i.e., T+1), NSCC
becomes the counterparty to the broker-dealers on each side of each trade.18 NSCC assumes the
buying member’s obligation to pay the selling member and the selling member’s obligation to
deliver securities to the buying member.19 At the same time, each member assigns to NSCC its

respective rights to receive securities and payment, which “places the [NSCC] between the
[buying] Member and the [selling] Member.”20
The CNS system nets purchases and sales of each security on a daily basis, so that each
member is required to deliver to NSCC (or becomes entitled to receive from NSCC) only the
difference between the number of shares that it and its customers collectively bought and the
number that they collectively sold.21 Settlement occurs three days after the trade date (i.e., T+3).
Every evening, the CNS system computes a net settlement obligation (or entitlement) for each
member in each security. This has two parts: (1) the contribution from trades settling that day
(i.e., those taking place three settlement days ago) and (2) the member’s “closing position” in the
CNS system from the previous day.22 In other words, on day T+3, the total number of shares
collectively purchased or sold by the member’s customers on day T is added to the member’s
CNS position carried over from day T+2.
A member that owes NSCC securities has a short, or negative, CNS position; a member
that is entitled to receive securities from NSCC has a long, or positive, CNS position; and a
member that is neither obligated to deliver nor entitled to receive securities has a flat CNS
position.23 “Short position” in this context means that the member has an obligation to deliver
securities to NSCC; that position did not necessarily result from the member or its customers
selling the stock short in the market.
The CNS system tracks a firm’s delivery obligations to and right to receive shares from
NSCC. CNS positions do not reflect beneficial ownership, which instead is reflected in the
books and records of the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), the registered holder of record.
Every NSCC member, as well as NSCC itself, has an account at DTC. “Delivery” of securities
to NSCC occurs when, after the close of business on settlement date, NSCC instructs DTC to
move shares from the accounts of members with a short CNS position to NSCC’s own DTC
account.24 NSCC then directs DTC to move shares from NSCC’s account to the DTC accounts
of members with long CNS positions.
When a member does not have enough shares in its DTC account to satisfy its full
delivery obligation to NSCC, a “fail to deliver” occurs. In that event, NSCC instructs DTC to
remove securities from the member’s account to the extent possible and any deficit is reflected in
that member having a short CNS closing position, which is carried forward to the next settlement

day.25 Until the member delivers securities to NSCC in sufficient quantity to make its CNS
position flat or long, a fail will remain open.
Put another way, there must be a transfer of shares from the member’s DTC account to
NSCC’s DTC account for a CNS fail to be cured. But because transactions settling the same day
are netted together in the CNS system’s “evening cycle”—before NSCC communicates delivery
instructions to DTC—same-day stock purchases and sales (or, as discussed in the next section,
stock purchases and assignments of a call option) for the same amount of a given security net
each other out and will not result in the broker delivering shares to NSCC.26 As a result,
offsetting intraday transactions do not change the member’s CNS position or close out a fail to
deliver.
Because CNS operates on a net basis, the total number of shares that NSCC owes to
members necessarily equals the total number of shares that are owed to NSCC by its members.
When a member has a fail to deliver, NSCC will not have enough shares available to satisfy all
of its members to whom it owes shares.27 A member that does not receive all of the shares to
which it is entitled is said to have a “fail to receive” and will end the day with a long CNS
position.
A member that does not receive securities has two options. First, it may do nothing and
wait for delivery to be made as securities are delivered to NSCC. The CNS system allocates
incoming shares to the members by prioritizing deliveries to firms with the oldest long
positions.28 Therefore, even when the same firm has continuing fails to deliver, any specific
member’s fail to receive is likely to resolve itself in a relatively short period of time (as other
firms deliver shares to NSCC). Second, if the member with the fail to receive desires shares
sooner, it may file a Notice of Intention to Buy-in with NSCC, which gives the member still

have been completed,” each “[m]ember’s positions are passed to” DTC. Id. § C(3) (emphasis

positions.” Id. (emphasis added).

higher allocation priority in the CNS system.29 Most fails to receive will resolve within a few
days without the need for further action.
If NSCC nevertheless remains unable to deliver shares to the member, NSCC will issue
CNS Retransmittal Notices to members with the oldest unsettled short positions.30 Colloquially,
these NSCC-issued notices are called “buy-in notices,” but they are unrelated to the buy-in
notices that a broker might issue to its retail customers; to avoid confusion, we will refer to the
former only as CNS Retransmittal Notices. Two days after it submits a Notice of Intention to
Buy-in, the member with the fail to receive can instruct NSCC to purchase the remainder of the
position that it still has not received.31 The firms that receive the CNS Retransmittal Notices are
liable for any financial loss incurred in the purchase. Whether NSCC issues a CNS Retransmittal
Notice is irrelevant to Rule 204 compliance.
2.

Delivery of securities following assignment of an option

Besides the delivery obligations resulting from stock transactions, the CNS system also
processes those resulting from options assignments. The options at issue in this proceeding are
traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (“CBOE”) and conform to CBOE’s standardized
specifications. Each contract in a given series, which represents 100 shares of the underlying
security, is fungible with every other contract in that series, because all of them are issued and
guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC”).
Retail customers generally hold options indirectly through their brokers, who are
members of OCC. There is no direct contractual relationship between the purchaser and the
writer of an option (or, for that matter, their respective brokers). Trades are reported by brokers
to OCC and then “accepted” by OCC.32 At that point, OCC becomes the buyer to the broker
representing the writer and the seller to the broker representing the purchaser. In its books and
records, OCC credits the account of the purchasing member with the number of contracts
purchased in that series and debits the account of the writing member with the same number.33 A
member will have a short position in an option series—and thus be subject to assignment—if its
customers collectively have written more options in that series than they have purchased.

17
Because OCC is the central counterparty, all rights run against OCC and all obligations
run to OCC.34 The holder of a call option has the right to exercise the option and thus to receive
from OCC the specified number of shares of the underlying security upon payment of the
exercise price.35 A retail customer exercising a call option notifies his or her broker, which in
turn notifies OCC. At the end of the day, OCC randomly allocates exercise notices among its
members that have a short position in that option series.36 OCC reduces the long positions of
those members that have exercised options and reduces the short positions of those members that
have been assigned.37 All this occurs on a net basis, and the exercising member does not know
(or care) who the assigned member is.
A member receiving an assignment of a call option is required to deliver the number of
shares of the underlying security represented by the option.38 For options in the OIP Securities,
delivery occurs through the CNS system.39 The “obligations among [OCC] Clearing Members
resulting from the exercise of Options calling for the delivery of stocks are . . . discharged
through” NSCC.40 OCC automatically reports settlement instructions reflecting exercise and
assignment to NSCC.41 By arrangement with NSCC, the “date of the exercise at OCC is
recorded as the trade date” in CNS (i.e., T).42 “Exercised calls . . . appear [in CNS] as
purchases” of the security by the member, while “assigned calls appear as sells.”43 These

Id. §§ 5-6, 9 & Interp. 6.01. As far as OCC (or NSCC or the CNS system) is concerned, it
is the responsibility of the member representing the option writer to ensure that the member
delivers shares to NSCC. How the member goes on to allocate the assignment among its
customers who have written an option in that series and whether that customer discharges his or
her delivery obligation to the member is immaterial to the member’s obligation to deliver shares
to NSCC. Although a customer that writes an option is contractually bound to his or her broker
to perform in accordance with the terms of the option, brokers are required to perform their own
obligations regardless of whether their customers perform.

“purchases” and “sells” settle at CNS three days after the exercise date (i.e., T+3)—that is, the
same settlement timeframe as a stock transaction taking place on the exercise date.
Thus, from the perspective of the CNS system, exercises of call options look just like
stock purchases and assignments look just like stock sales. All such transactions occurring on
day T are netted together to determine the number of shares that the member will be obliged to
deliver or entitled to receive on day T+3. When a member is assigned on day T, this creates a
duty to deliver to NSCC on day T+3 that is indistinguishable from the obligation it would owe
NSCC if it had simply sold on T the same number of shares of the security represented by the
option. Dr. Erik Sirri, Feldman’s expert witness, explained: “Stock trades that result from the
assignment of options are . . . cleared through CNS on a T+3 basis . . . [O]ption assignment
trades are included in the batch of trades that is netted together to determine the number of shares
the Clearing Member will deliver or receive on T+3.”
As with all trades settled through CNS, there is no intraday delivery of shares when a
stock purchase occurs the same day as an option exercise or assignment. Consequently, as Dr.
Sirri explained, if the “written call [leg of a buy-write] is exercised and assigned on the same day
the buy-write was executed, the settlement of the option assignment would occur on the same
day as that of the stock purchase, the two components would offset each other, and the stock
purchase would not change the Clearing Member’s net delivery position at CNS.”
3.

CNS Accounting Summaries

The CNS system generates reports that notify participants of their delivery obligations
and settlement activity. On the evening of every settlement day, NSCC issues a CNS
Accounting Summary to each participant; retail customers do not have access to this information.
For each security, that summary presents, inter alia, the “Member’s opening Long or Short
Position [i.e., that carried over in the CNS system from the previous day], the Member’s activity
in such CNS Securities for that day, the transactions into and out of its Qualified Securities
Depository [i.e.., DTC] account . . . , [and] the Closing Position for that day.” In particular:


The OPEN POSITION (or OPENING POSITION) column shows
the member’s closing position carried over from the previous day.
If this is negative, the member owes that many shares to NSCC; if
this is positive, the member is owed that many shares by NSCC.



Activity (i.e., changes in the net obligation that the member owes
to NSCC or is owed by NSCC) is divided into two categories. The
SETT TRADES (or SETTLING TRADES) column shows activity
from stock transactions or options assignments settling on that day.
The MISC/DIVID (or STOCK DIV/MISC. ACTIV) column
captures miscellaneous activity, such as stock splits or stock
dividends.

19


The ALLOC/RCYC (or RECEIPTS/DELIVERY) column shows
transfers into or out of the member’s DTC account during that
CNS evening cycle. If this is negative, the member received that
many shares from NSCC; if this is positive, the member delivered
that many shares to NSCC. If the number is zero, then the member
neither received nor delivered stock to NSCC.



The CLOSING POS or (CLOSING POSITION) column shows the
member’s closing position, which is the net of its opening position,
activity settling during the day, and any receipts or delivery.

Based on the CNS Accounting Summary, a participant knows how many shares it owes
to NSCC, how many shares it actually delivered to NSCC, and whether it has a fail to deliver
position. It also knows the age of a fail, as reflected in the number of consecutive days that the
open position column was negative in past accounting summaries.
B.

optionsXpress’s procedures for sending buy-in notices to Customers

The basic purpose of optionsXpress’s buy-in procedures was to distribute its fail to
deliver position at CNS among its retail customers whose transactions contributed to the firm’s
fail and to inform the responsible customers of the need to take action via buy-in notices. A
participant’s delivery and close-out obligations under Rule 204 are distinct from its customers’
obligations to the firm under the firm’s internal buy-in procedures: In all events, the firm is the
entity responsible for compliance with Rule 204(a)’s requirement that securities be “borrow[ed]
or purchas[ed]” at or before market open in sufficient quantity to “close out its fail to deliver
position.” In the following sections, we describe how optionsXpress determined which of its
retail customers were issued buy-in notices (and for what number of shares), as well as how the
firm’s buy-in procedures changed over time.
1.

Overview of optionsXpress’s process

optionsXpress used a three-step process for identifying the customers who would be
issued buy-in notices. In the first step, which took place after the close of trading, optionsXpress
allocated the assignments that it received from OCC among its retail customers. It randomly
selected customers who wrote options in that series to be responsible for the assignment. If the
customer’s account did not have enough shares to cover the assignment, then optionsXpress
recorded a short position in the customer’s account.
In the second step, optionsXpress determined whether it had a fail to deliver position at
CNS in the security. Using the CNS Accounting Summaries, optionsXpress’s information
technology group prepared a report listing all securities “with [a] fail at CNS.” This meant, as
Scott Tortorella, a manager in optionsXpress’s Clearing Department acknowledged, any security
“that reaches T+3 or higher.” If optionsXpress did not have a CNS fail in a security, then it did
not issue any buy-in notices and allowed the customers who were short in that security to remain

20
so without taking any further action. If optionsXpress did have a fail, optionsXpress’s Clearing
Department was notified the next day (i.e., T+4).
Unless the security was readily and cheaply available for borrowing, optionsXpress
moved on to the third and final step.44 The OIP Securities all were hard to borrow and had high
stock loan fees, so optionsXpress did not borrow them. It distributed its total CNS fail amount
among the customers who were short and determined “how much each one of those accounts . . .
should be required to buy-in.” If the customer covered the short on his or her own initiative (i.e.,
by purchasing the shares in a transaction that has not yet settled), no further action was required.
Otherwise, when customers’ short positions remained outstanding, the Clearing Department sent
an email to the Trading Desk (also called the Execution Desk) listing the security, the
responsible accounts, and the number of shares that the customer would be directed to buy-in.
Most customers of optionsXpress were notified of buy-ins only after the Trading Desk
had purchased the stock on their behalf. The Customers, on the other hand, were given notice
before the firm executed a purchase order at market open. This advance notice allowed them to
place a buy-write in response to the buy-in notices (instead of having the stock purchased on
their behalf by the firm).45 Throughout the period at issue, a “special rep” at optionsXpress’s
Trading Desk, trading specialist Jeremy Coronado, assisted the Customers in “build[ing]” buywrites.
2.

Procedures from September 2008 to August 2009

In September and October 2008, optionsXpress gave the Customers “throughout the day”
on T+4 to respond to its buy-in notices. Only when a Customer failed to take action would
August Payne—the Trading Desk employee responsible for monitoring fails and making sure
they were covered—place a “market on close” order to purchase the stock. Payne did not recall
being told that buy-ins had to be accomplished by market open for the firm to rely on those
trades to satisfy its obligation under Rule 204T to act “by no later than the beginning of regular
trading hours.” The Clearing Department also lacked procedures for timely sending the buy-in
list to the Trading Desk. Every morning, Tortorella, a manager in the department, had to
manually “sort[] out what . . . shares were in T+4” and which customers should be directed to

44

When optionsXpress borrowed stock, it allowed its customers to remain short. The firm
was willing to absorb modest borrowing costs and did not pass them along to customers. Its
policy in this regard was not unusual. As a vice president at E*TRADE explained, “[w]e don’t
have the mechanics or the facility to pass along those charges.”
45

An optionsXpress employee denied that the Customers got more favorable treatment,
testifying that the firm would have been “more than happy to call” other customers and give
them notice of a buy-in if they “wanted to receive” notice. But he conceded that he had no idea
how these customers would have known to ask.

21
buy in. As a result, there were a number of days that the Clearing Department did not even send
the buy-in list to the Trading Desk until after market open.
Towards the end of October 2008, some optionsXpress employees began expressing
concerns about the timing of this process in light of Rule 204T, which was issued on September
17, 2008. On October 27, Payne sent an email to Tortorella, copied to Ronald Molnar (who was
Tortorella’s supervisor), inquiring about the proper “timeline” since he had been “letting
[customers] close-out by the end of the day.” Molnar in turn asked Kevin Strine,
optionsXpress’s vice president of compliance, by “when we need to cover our CNS fails”: “Is it
by the opening, or anytime today as long as the position is covered?” Strine replied (correctly)
that this needed to be done “at the opening.”
Notwithstanding Strine’s recognition that Rule 204T required the firm to take action to
address fails by market open, optionsXpress did not implement procedures to ensure that the
requisite purchases or borrows took place then. Instead, it permitted the Customers to place buywrites well after market open.46 One reason for this was that the Clearing Department continued
to have difficulties delivering the buy-in list to the Trading Desk. On a number of occasions—
e.g., July 31, 2009 and August 10, 2009—Tortorella did not send the Trading Desk the buy-in
list until half an hour or more after the open. This did not go unnoticed by Payne, who wrote on
August 10 that the Trading Desk was “still getting the buy-in report pretty late in the morning”—
on that day, 10:10 am ET. Molnar, too, stressed that the department “need[ed] to get better” and
“need[ed] to get the list out to prevent the SEC . . . to come in and fine us because of a tardy buyin.” Moreover, at the hearing, Tortorella and another optionsXpress employee, Jay Risley,
admitted that buy-in lists were not being provided in a timely fashion.
Even when the list of buy-ins was being sent to the Trading Desk before market open,
Payne and others continued to notify the Customers (to enable them to place buy-writes) instead
of immediately purchasing stock on their behalf. For example, on June 29, 2009, Payne
informed Feldman that optionsXpress’s “current practices” gave him the entire “day of for buyins.” Two days later, a trader sent a mid-afternoon email stating that the buy-ins were “covered,”
prompting Tortorella to say: “Surely it’s ‘opening of business’ somewhere.”
We find persuasive the analysis of optionsXpress’s trading records performed by the
Division’s expert, Professor Harris, which showed that optionsXpress executed 97% percent
(i.e., 1173 out of 1205) of the Customers’ buy-writes in the period between September 30, 2008
and August 20, 2009 (when optionsXpress changed its buy-in procedures) after 10:00 am ET on
T+4. On average, buy-writes were executed 2 hours and 40 minutes after market open on T+4.
46

To be clear, Rule 204T did not by itself require optionsXpress to ensure that the buy-writes
were executed by a certain time (or, for that matter, that optionsXpress take any other action with
respect to its retail customers). But here, the firm was relying on its execution of the Customers’
buy-writes to satisfy its own obligations under Rule 204T.

22
3.

Procedures after August 2009

August 2009 brought a shift in how optionsXpress handled buy-ins for the Customers.
According to optionsXpress, these changes were prompted by the Commission’s promulgation of
Rule 204, which made permanent the delivery and close-out requirements of Rule 204T and
became effective on July 31, 2009.47 Around the same time, on August 5, 2009, the Commission
instituted and settled actions in Hazan Capital Management, LLC, and TJM Proprietary Trading,
LLC, which involved violations by broker-dealers of the analogous delivery and close-out
requirements of Rule 203 of Regulation SHO and are described more below. In response to
these developments, optionsXpress made two principal changes. First, it established special
procedures for hard-to-borrow securities that always appeared on the Clearing Department’s
buy-in lists in large amounts, including many of the OIP Securities. Second, it changed how it
processed the Customers’ buy-writes.
a.

The “perpetual fail” list

On August 19, 2009, optionsXpress’s Compliance Department instituted new procedures
effective the next day. The decision to implement these procedures was made by a group that
included Thomas Stern, optionsXpress’s CFO and primary regulatory liaison.48 These
procedures called for the Clearing Department to send the Trading Desk two buy-in lists.

47

On August 6, 2009, Payne informed Feldman that buy-ins would have to be completed
“immediately,” instead of “by the end of the trading day.” Payne stated that the Commission’s
promulgation of Rule 204 changed the buy-in deadline. He asserted that the Commission “did
not approve the buy-ins to be covered by the end of the trading day.” In a subsequent email,
Payne asserted the Commission “actually voted . . . and still decided it must be done at the
open.” Payne’s implication that Rule 204 changed the deadline was inaccurate: Both Rule 204T
and Rule 204 require participants to close out fails “no later than the beginning of regular trading
hours” on T+4. But his email to Feldman nonetheless confirms that optionsXpress perceived the
need to change its buy-in procedures precisely because, prior to August 2009, it understood that
it had not even been requiring customers to execute buy-ins at market open.
48

The OIP alleged, and the law judge found, that Stern caused and aided and abetted the
other respondents’ violations in this case. The law judge imposed a cease-and-desist order,
directed that Stern pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and barred him from the securities industry.
Although Stern sought Commission review of the initial decision, he later agreed to withdraw his
petition for review as a condition of settling another administrative proceeding involving him,
optionsXpress, and OX Trading, LLC, an optionsXpress affiliate. The initial decision in this
proceeding has become final as to Stern. optionsXpress, Inc., Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 71354, 2014 WL 217060 (Jan. 17, 2014); see also OX Trading, LLC, Exchange Act Release
No. 70739, 2013 WL 5740457 (Oct. 22, 2013) (accepting offer of settlement); OX Trading, LLC,
Exchange Act Release No. 70740, 2013 WL 5740458 (Oct. 22, 2013) (same). The other settled
administrative proceeding involved violations of Section 15(a) and 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act
(continued…)

23
The first list, which Tortorella aimed to send Payne shortly before market open, identified
securities (and customer accounts that had short positions in those securities) that were
“appearing on the [buy-in] list pretty much day after day” because “the fail is continuously open
due to customers being assigned in the money short calls.” These were considered “perpetual
buy-ins” because the Customers were “[a]lways short, cover[] [their] buys by buying [sic] short
options deep in the money, so they get assigned” and, as a result, their “settled position never
closes or goes long.” When the list was instituted, it covered four of the OIP Securities,
American International Group, Inc. (AIG); Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG); Sears Holdings
Corp. (SHLD); and Shanda Interactive Entertainment Limited (SNDA); others were later added.
This first list was called the “chronic” list, the “rolling fail” list, or the “perpetual failure list.”
Feldman and four other Customers were the accounts that appeared most frequently on it. The
second list, which Tortorella aimed to send shortly after market open, addressed all other
securities and customer accounts. On several occasions—e.g., August 31, 2009 and September
14, 2009—the second list was sent a half hour or more after the beginning of trading.
As before, Payne provided advance notice to the Customers when they appeared on either
list. optionsXpress wanted to give them “time to formulate a strategy before calling the
execution desk.” For “any other” customer, optionsXpress continued to go “ahead and place
market orders to cover” the buy-in at market open—i.e., execute stock purchase orders that were
“filled immediately”—and notified them only afterwards.
Special procedures applied to the “perpetual failure” list. Instead of running a lottery to
distribute optionsXpress’s fail to deliver position proportionately among the customers,
optionsXpress would issue a buy-in notice for the entire amount of each customers’ short
position, including whatever additional shares they owed from option assignments the previous
day. For example, if optionsXpress’s CNS fail to deliver position was 250 shares, and there
were three customers whose accounts were 200, 300, and 400 shares short, respectively, every
customer would still be required to buy-in 100% of his or her short position, for a total of 900
shares. As a result, buy-in notices were often issued for a number of shares that in the aggregate
exceeded optionsXpress’s total CNS fail to deliver position.
b.

Pre-building the buy-writes

Around the same time, optionsXpress also made cosmetic changes to how it accepted
buy-writes from the Customers. In essence, the Trading Desk would enter stock purchase orders
in the Customers’ accounts before market open, but purposely delay their execution to allow the

orders are not binding on respondents and we do not consider them.

24
Customers to place the call component of the buy-write. Only then would the Trading Desk send
the stock and options trades for execution as a single order.
On August 20, 2009, Payne asked Strine and Phillip Hoeh, optionsXpress’s Chief
Compliance Officer, whether the Customers could still respond to the buy-in notices by placing
buy-writes “as one order.” Strine, who had reviewed the Hazan and TJM settled actions finding
violations of Regulation SHO, replied “absolutely not.” He worried that if optionsXpress
“process[ed] the buy-write, regulators could consider the buy-ins as sham transactions.”49 Hoeh
was also emphatic, explaining his view that optionsXpress “has to begin the buy-in process at the
open . . . [and] must execute the buy-in on the open for the specified amount to cover the fail.”
Despite this apparent recognition by compliance personnel that relying on the buy-writes
to satisfy its obligations under Rule 204 could raise regulatory concerns, optionsXpress
continued to permit the Customers to place them in response to its buy-in notices.50 At a later
meeting among Hoeh, Coronado, and Peter Bottini, who was in charge of trading and customer
service for optionsXpress, they decided that buy-writes had to be formally entered in each
customer’s account as two separate orders. Thus, the Trading Desk would prepare a stock
purchase order, “the customer would put in an order to sell to open calls and then . . . [the firm]
would bundle those orders and send them as a buy-write” for execution.51
Accordingly, Payne instructed the other traders:
Compliance is telling us that buy-writes can no longer be used . . .
[W]e can place them another way. Execution will put in market
orders to cover the shares at the open. All we require the customer
to do is call in and place a not held option order . . . . The outcome
will basically be the same, but two separate orders will be in [the]
customers[’] account, which the SEC wants to see.
Afterwards, the Trading Desk generally “built” a stock purchase order in the Customers’
accounts before or around market open, but marked that order as “do not send to exchange,”
49

Strine later elaborated: “I believe that if we do the buy-write for them, auditors will
consider them sham transactions as the SEC did with the two fined prop trading institutions,”
i.e., the respondents in the Hazan and TJM cases discussed infra.
50

As discussed above, we focus on the buy-writes because optionsXpress was using those
trades to address its Rule 204(a) obligations. See supra note 46. We do not suggest that
optionsXpress was required under all circumstances to prohibit the Customers from placing the
buy-writes or making any other trades.
51

Bottini stated that he believed that optionsXpress’s “best execution” obligation required the
bundling of the buy and the write, because if they were executed separately, the price of the
underlying security might change in the meantime.

25
meaning that the order would not immediately be executed. Instead, the Trading Desk would
wait until after the customers phoned in a “not held” order for the call component of the buywrite (which could happen after market open).52 A “not held” order gave optionsXpress
discretion on the price of execution and allowed the Trading Desk to match up the price of the
stock with the option contract. Otherwise, the customer risked “paying a lot more” to transact
the buy-write if the prices diverged.
After waiting to pair the orders, the Trading Desk would transmit the buy-write as a
single package to PrecISE, an electronic trading platform, or to On Point Executions LLC, a
floor (or “two-dollar”) broker. In both cases, the buy-write was placed and executed as a single
order; indeed, neither PrecISE nor On Point, operating on options exchanges and accepting stock
orders only as part of a complex order, would have accepted a standalone stock purchase.
Because optionsXpress placed the buy-writes on a “very price sensitive” basis—i.e., as limit
orders rather than as market orders—it took additional time to arrange for execution of the buywrites.53 optionsXpress never informed On Point that the buy-writes had to be executed at
market open and, with a single exception, never expressed any concern about the timing of
execution. To the contrary, Coronado told On Point to “take [its] time” and that he
“underst[ood]” there would be delays.
As Professor Harris’s analysis of optionsXpress’s trading records demonstrated, the firm
still was not executing buy-writes at or near market open. True, after August 20, 2009,
optionsXpress did input buy-writes much earlier because it pre-built them in the Customers’
accounts. But because optionsXpress did not send the buy-writes immediately to the exchange
for execution, and instead waited for the Customers to phone in the option order, 51% (i.e., 1105
out of 2186) of the buy-writes were not actually executed until after 10:00 am ET. On average,
the buy-writes were executed 58 minutes after market open.
IV.

optionsXpress analysis

We conclude that optionsXpress violated Rule 204(a)’s close-out requirement (and the
identical provision of Rule 204T) by relying upon the buy-writes to address to its CNS fail to
deliver positions when those transactions did not result in the firm making delivery to NSCC and
thus did not close out its fails. We also find that optionsXpress violated Rules 204 and 204T for
52

The Trading Desk did not always follow this procedure. Sometimes, Coronado would
allow Feldman to place a “standing order” for the buy-write on the expectation that he would
want to execute the same or similar trades on subsequent days. On at least one occasion,
Coronado even placed a buy-write without hearing from Feldman at all. On January 19, 2010,
Coronado told Feldman that he “put [the buy-write] up” already even though he “didn’t hear
from [Feldman] on it” because he had to “get these things in the morning.”
53

Because of the frequency of the buy-writes, other, unidentified market participants began to
anticipate the trades and often had “resting orders” in place to take the other side.

26
the independent reason that the transactions it relied upon to address its fails, irrespective of
whether or not they actually effected a close out, frequently were not executed at or before
market open on T+4.
A.

The purposes and objectives of Rule 204’s close-out requirement

The Commission promulgated Rule 204 to address persistent fails to deliver by
participant brokers or dealers and to curb certain abusive and manipulative “naked” short selling
practices (such as selling stock short while intentionally failing to deliver or selling stock short
and failing to deliver with the purpose of driving down the security’s price).54 On a number of
prior occasions, we have recognized that sellers of securities should promptly deliver (or arrange
for delivery of) securities and that buyers of securities have a right to expect prompt delivery of
securities.55 Fails to deliver have potential negative effects on investors and the marketplace. As
Rule 204’s adopting release explained, “[l]arge and persistent fails to deliver may deprive
shareholders of the benefits of ownership, such as voting and lending.”56 “[I]ssuers and investors
have repeatedly expressed concerns about fails to deliver in connection with manipulative
‘naked’ short selling,” which “could be used as a tool to drive down a company’s stock price,”
“undermine the confidence of investors,” and cause “unwarranted reputational damage due to
investors’ negative perceptions regarding fails to deliver.”57
optionsXpress contends that the concerns that prompted us to promulgate Rule 204 and
its predecessors are largely speculative. It asserts that the Division did not present testimony
from a “single ‘victim’” of the fails to deliver or introduce a “single letter of complaint from a
counterparty” or another entity that failed to receive shares on any particular occasion.58
optionsXpress misses the point: Persistent fails to deliver undermine market integrity in
concrete, tangible ways, even when the centralized system for clearing and settling securities

sale, in which the seller does not borrow or arrange to borrow the securities in time to make
delivery to the buyer within the standard settlement period, is not itself improper.

Of course, the Division is not required to prove actual harm to investors to establish
liability. See, e.g., SEC v. Morgan Keegan & Co., 678 F.3d 1233, 1244 (11th Cir. 2012); SEC v.
Wolfson, 539 F.3d 1249, 1256 (10th Cir. 2008); Graham v. SEC, 222 F.3d 994, 1001 n.15 (D.C.
Cir. 2000); SEC v. Blavin, 760 F.2d 706, 711 (6th Cir.1985).

27
transactions may make it difficult to identify specific victims.59 This was the premise of our
decision to adopt Rule 204’s requirements, and optionsXpress may not second-guess the
Commission’s policy judgments in the context of this enforcement proceeding.
Therefore, although the record contains relatively little evidence of harm to specific
investors,60 we reiterate that fails to deliver—particularly large and persistent ones—can and do
have a “negative effect on the securities markets and investors.”61 As the adopting release
explained, the “close-out requirements of Rule 204 help address these concerns by prohibiting
the persistence of fails to deliver.”62 That “strict close-out requirement[]”63 is integral to
“advancing our goal of further reducing fails to deliver.”64 Rule 204(a) thus “protect[s] and
enhance[s] the operation, integrity, and stability of the markets.”65
B.

optionsXpress violated Rules 204 and 204T because it did not close out its fail
to deliver positions

Rule 204, which is entitled “[c]lose-out requirement,” provides that a participant of a
clearing agency, such as optionsXpress, must “deliver securities” to the clearing agency by the
settlement date after a transaction, which under present practice takes place on T+3.66 It is not
by itself unlawful for a broker-dealer to have a fail to deliver. But when a firm does have such a
fail to deliver position, Rule 204(a) requires it to, “by no later than the beginning of regular
trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date [i.e., T+4], immediately close
out its fail to deliver position by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.”67
The Division argues (and we agree) that optionsXpress violated this close-out requirement.

risk of systemic harm to market participants and market integrity.

28
1.

Rule 204(a) unambiguously required optionsXpress to “close out”
fails to deliver, which the firm did not accomplish when it relied on its
execution of the Customers’ buy-writes to address its fails

optionsXpress had fail to deliver positions at CNS on T+3 (and later). The firm received
CNS Accounting Summaries indicating that it had a negative “closing position”—i.e., reflecting
a T+3 or even older fail to deliver—in the 25 OIP Securities. These summaries showed that the
firm’s fails continued day after day, often for weeks and months; they dwarfed any other
participant’s failures to deliver. For instance, with respect to Sears Holding Corp. (SHLD),
optionsXpress had a fail at CNS for 240 settlement days during the period at issue here. Finally,
testimony and other documentary evidence demonstrated that optionsXpress employees were
well aware throughout that the firm had T+3 fails that it was required to close out. As detailed
above, they described the fails as “perpetual,” “chronic,” or “rolling,” and characterized the firm
as being caught in a “vicious cycle” of “open CNS fail[s].”
These T+3 failures to deliver triggered Rule 204(a)’s close-out requirement. When a
participant has a fail to deliver position, Rule 204(a) requires it to take affirmative action “no
later than the beginning of regular trading hours” on T+4 to “immediately close out its fail to
deliver position by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.”68 It may not
“offset the amount of its fail to deliver position with shares that the participant receives or will
receive during the applicable close-out date.”69
optionsXpress chose to rely upon its execution of the Customers’ buy-writes to address
its fails to deliver. But those transactions did not close out optionsXpress’s fail to deliver
position as required by Rule 204(a) and as demonstrated by its “perpetual” CNS fail positions.
The CNS system nets together all trades settling the same day and there is no intraday delivery.
When a stock purchase and a call assignment occurs on the same day, NSCC and OCC
procedures specify that those transactions will be netted together before NSCC provides
settlement and delivery instructions to DTC; there is no intraday delivery. Although not every
buy-write call was immediately assigned, most were because the options were deep in the money
and represented a large proportion of the open interest in that option series. We credit Professor
Harris’s analysis (see supra Section II.B) in finding that the buy-write calls were frequently
being exercised as they were being written. That being the case, the “buy” component of the

29
Customers’ buy-writes was offset by the same-day exercise and assignment of their “write”
component.70
The CNS Accounting Summaries confirm that, on account of the same-day assignments
of buy-write calls, shares of the OIP Securities were not being transferred from optionsXpress’s
DTC account to NSCC’s DTC account—that is, delivered71—in sufficient quantities to close out
optionsXpress’s failures to deliver. optionsXpress’s decision to rely on the buy-write
transactions perpetuated and maintained its original fail position. Often no delivery occurred at
all, and even when the firm made delivery of some shares, it did not deliver enough: The
ALLOC/RECYC column of the summaries in subsequent days was less than the quantity of
optionsXpress’s fail to deliver position, and often zero. As a result, optionsXpress’s fail to
deliver positions remained open for days, weeks, and often months on end, instead of being
closed out by its transactions on T+4.72 We conclude, therefore, that optionsXpress failed to
satisfy Rule 204(a)’s close-out requirement.
We highlight two examples when optionsXpress attempted to address a fail to deliver
position by executing buy-writes that did not result in the firm delivering shares to NSCC in
sufficient quantities to close out the fail.73
The transactions in China Sky One Medical, Inc. (CSKI) in January 2010 and February
2010 are illustrative. Feldman initiated a three-way trade on Wednesday, January 6 by entering
into a synthetic long representing 20,400 shares and writing 204 deep-in-the-money call
contracts. That same day (i.e., T), optionsXpress was assigned on 147 contracts, which it
allocated to Feldman. optionsXpress’s closing position on Monday, January 11 (i.e., T+3) was a
fail to deliver in the amount of 15,176 shares. At that point Rule 204(a) required optionsXpress
to “immediately close out its fail to deliver position by borrowing or purchasing securities of like
kind and quantity” by market open on T+4. optionsXpress responded instead by relying on its
execution of a buy-write placed by Feldman, purchasing 14,700 shares and writing 147 call
options. Feldman placed buy-writes on the subsequent days as well (corresponding to 13,700
shares and 137 contracts on January 13 through January 15 and 20,400 shares and 204 contracts

70

To the extent that the calls were not fully assigned, that meant that the stock purchases were
not wholly cancelled out. When this happened, delivery of some shares may have occurred, but
not enough shares to close out optionsXpress’s fails.
71

See, e.g., CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, 749 F.3d 967, 978 (11th Cir. 2014)
(finding that the “ordinary meaning” of the word “delivery” is “a transfer of possession”).
72

Transactions taking place on T+4 do not settle until three settlement days later; therefore,
we look to the firm’s CNS activity and positions on T+7.
73

See also supra Section II.D (discussing optionsXpress’s reliance on Feldman’s buy-writes
to address its large and continuing fail to deliver position in Talbots Inc. (TLB)).

30
on January 19 through mid-February). In other words, virtually all of the call portion of
Feldman’s buy-writes in CSKI were exercised and assigned on an ongoing basis:

31

The assignments of these calls offset the stock purchases in CNS. Consequently, in
executing the buy-writes, optionsXpress did not deliver shares to NSCC and did not successfully
close out its fails. The ALLOC/RCYC column of the CNS Accounting Summaries for CSKI,
which shows optionsXpress’s deliveries to NSCC, was 0 on January 11 through January 29 and
hovered at most in the low hundreds thereafter. And the CLOSING POS column likewise stayed
stubbornly negative, ranging from about negative thirteen thousand to negative twenty thousand,
showing that optionsXpress continued to have a fail. Indeed, optionsXpress’s fail to deliver
position increased on January 21 to 20,641 shares and remained in that range until February 17,
when Feldman’s buy-writes in CSKI ceased. Only then was optionsXpress’s original, January
11 fail eventually closed out.
The transactions in Under Armour, Inc. (UA) provide another example of how by relying
on the Customers’ buy-writes, optionsXpress did not close out its fail to deliver positions. On
Tuesday, August 4, 2009, optionsXpress had a CNS fail of 7,255 shares for UA. It issued a buyin notice to Feldman, who placed a buy-write for 7,200 shares and 72 calls. The options were
exercised and assigned later that day. The CNS Accounting Summary for Friday, August 7,
2009—that is, the settlement day for the buy-write, as well as the options assignment—shows
that optionsXpress did not deliver any shares to NSCC (the ALLOC/RCYC column was 0) and
that optionsXpress continued to have a fail. Nor did optionsXpress deliver shares to NSCC on
any intermediate day. It had fail to deliver positions for UA of 972 shares on August 5 and 5,572

32
shares on August 6, which corresponded almost exactly to Feldman’s buy-writes on those days:
He executed a buy-write for 1,000 shares and 10 calls on August 5 and for 5,600 shares and 56
calls on August 6.
To summarize, the CNS records unequivocally show that the buy-writes resulted in no (or
an insufficient number of) shares being delivered to NSCC. Under these circumstances,
optionsXpress could not rely on the buy-writes to close out its fail to deliver positions, as
required by Rule 204(a).
2.

The Commission’s releases and other guidance issued by regulators
confirm that participants cannot rely upon buy-writes that do not
close out fails to satisfy Rule 204(a).

For the above reasons, we have concluded that optionsXpress’s reliance on the buywrites to satisfy its obligations under Rule 204(a) is violative of the plain text of that rule. That
conclusion is consistent with published guidance that the Commission and other regulators have
provided on previous occasions about the close-out requirements and its applicability to paired
stock-and-option transactions.
a.

Guidance on fails and close outs before the adoption of Rule 204T

The concept of closing out a fail to deliver existed in other Commission rules before our
promulgation of Rule 204T in September 2008. Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO provided
that a participant who has a fail to deliver position in a so-called “threshold” security for 13
consecutive settlement days is required to immediately “close out the fail to deliver position by
purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.”74 In two cases from July 2007 (the Arenstein
cases), the American Stock Exchange (“AMEX”) fined several broker-dealers (and their
managing members) because, among other things, the brokers had failed to close out fails in
violation of Rule 203.75 The broker-dealers in the Arenstein cases executed transactions that
“appeared to close out their fail to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and
quantity,” but that in reality had only “reset[] the buy-in date.” These transactions included buywrites that paired a purchase of stock with the sale of one-day and two-day, deep-in-the money

74

17 C.F.R. § 242.203(b)(3). A threshold security is one that has an aggregate (i.e., summed
across all brokers) fail-to-deliver position at a clearing agency exceeding a certain, specified
limit. Id. § 242.203(c)(6).
75

In re: Scott H. Arenstein & SBA Trading, LLC, Case No. 07-71 (July 20, 2007); In re:
Brian A. Arenstein & ALA Trading, LLC, Case No. 07-174 (July 20, 2007).

33
FLEX call options.76 By repeatedly engaging in transactions like these, the broker-dealers were
able to maintain fails in threshold securities for extended periods.
Following the release of the Arenstein decisions, AMEX issued Circular Reg. 2007-35 in
August 2007 to provide additional guidance regarding Regulation SHO’s close-out requirement.
The circular cautioned participants that a “purchase of stock paired with one or more short term
option transactions such as, for example, a one-day in-the-money FLEX option, or a married put
or buy write transaction,” that “does not result in actual delivery of the shares in question may
not satisfy the Regulation SHO close-out requirement and will invite regulatory scrutiny.” It
went on to explain that the use of a “one-day, deep-in-the-money FLEX option to nominally
close out a fail to deliver position and then . . . reestablish or ‘reset’ the fail to deliver position is
not the only means by which an aged fail can be reset. Other transactions that can result in an
improper “‘reset’ of an aged fail include, but are not limited to . . . buy[-]writes, . . . or other
delta[-]neutral short term strategies matching options with stock.”
Around the same time, CBOE issued Regulatory Circular RG07-87 “strongly cautioning”
its members that transactions “pairing the close-out with one or more short-term options
positions that are utilized to reverse that close-out are deemed improper reset arrangements that
do not satisfy the Regulation SHO close-out requirement.” The circular observed that
“[e]ntering into a stock/option combination transaction that includes a very short-term option in
connection with a mandatory Regulation SHO close-out obligation, as opposed to just buying the
stock in the open market, brings such transactions under greater scrutiny.” It also recognized
that “transactions matching options with stock may be used as part of a legitimate hedging
strategy,” but not when they are “abusive” or “are used in a scheme to evade” regulatory
requirements. CBOE reiterated this caution a year later, in May 2008, reminding participants
that, “[w]hen accompanied by certain option transactions, stock purchases that are intended to
effect close-outs of fail to deliver positions may bring into question whether a bona-fide purchase
has occurred.”
optionsXpress management and compliance staff reviewed and discussed the Arenstein
decisions and the CBOE circulars. For example, in a November 13, 2008 email, Bottini (who
was in charge of trading and customer service) forwarded Risley (a supervisor in the Clearing
Department) a Wall Street Journal article describing, in Bottini’s words, how short sellers in
Sears were using “options to circumvent the SEC cover rule”; the article mentioned AMEX’s
Arenstein settlements. Risley responded with the comment, “[t]hey’re [i.e., the Customers]
definitely doing this.” optionsXpress never sought guidance from any of the AMEX or CBOE

employees listed in the circulars. It not only allowed the Customers’ buy-writes to go on, but
continued to rely on those trades to address the firm’s CNS fails.77
b.

Settled enforcement actions in Hazan and TJM

The AMEX and CBOE orders cautioned that buy-writes (and other transactions matching
options with stock) were among the kinds of transactions that could be used to evade regulatory
requirements by improperly resetting aged fails. We endorsed this view as consistent with our
own interpretation of our regulations when we brought settled enforcement actions finding
violations of Rule 203’s analogous close-out requirement in August 2009.78 In the Hazan and
TJM cases, we found that the firms (which, like the respondents in the Arenstein cases, were
trading for their own accounts) had engaged in a series of “reset” transactions to “create[] the
illusion” that the firm “satisfied the close out obligation of Reg[.] SHO.”79 The firms used a
reverse conversion strategy that coupled establishing a synthetic long position while selling short
the underlying stock. When a fail resulted, the firms would respond by:
buy[ing] shares of that security while simultaneously selling shortterm, deep[-]in-the-money call options to . . . the counterparty to
the share purchase. . . . [T]he shares that are apparently purchased
in the reset transactions are never actually delivered to the
purchaser because on the day after executing the reset, the option is
. . . exercised . . . transferring the shares back to the party that
apparently sold them the previous day.80
The Hazan settlement noted that some of the reset transactions took the form of buy-writes and
that although the option component of the “reset transactions were usually established using
‘FLEX’ options,” they could also be “created using standard options.”81

Strine, optionsXpress’s Vice President of Compliance, read the Hazan and TJM decisions
when they were issued. He discussed them with other compliance and business personnel at
optionsXpress. On August 6, Strine wrote to Hillary Victor (an in-house lawyer) and others at
optionsXpress noting that the similarities between the Customers’ trading and the trades in
Hazan and TJM:
The troublesome part is that the SEC characterized, and found as a
violation, the fail to deliver close-out process used by both firms as
“sham reset transactions.” In both cases, the firms would either
use married-put or buy-write transactions to close-out their
Regulation SHO fails-to-deliver. Our customers have been
engaging in buy-write transactions, or simply selling deep-in-themoney calls after we process buy-ins in their accounts. The end
result in all situations is similar: the shares are bought-in, but the
subsequent exercise or assignment of the option that night results
in a continuation of the fail.
(Emphasis added.) Strine’s email concluded that, “[a]lthough troublesome,” he believed that
“the two cases can be distinguished from [optionsXpress’s] customers’ activity.” Later, on
August 20, when asked by traders if optionsXpress should continue to allow the customers to
respond to its buy-in notices by placing buy-writes, Strine recalled the “sham transaction”
concept from the Hazan and TJM cases and, in an email to the firm’s Chief Compliance Officer,
stated his “belie[f] that if [optionsXpress] d[id] the buy-write,” the firm might be seen as having
engaged in the same kind of violative transactions as those “two fined prop trading institutions.”
On September 22, Strine and Stella, one of optionsXpress’s traders, discussed the Hazan
case. Strine told Stella that the trades in that case had similarities to what the Customers were
doing. The following morning, on September 23, Stella emailed excerpts of the case—the

trading strategies were similar. Bottini nevertheless directed Coronado and Stella to “execute the

Guidance accompanying the adoption of Rules 204T and 204

Our adopting releases for Rule 204T and Rule 204 made clear that participants cannot
employ combined purchase-and-sale transactions to circumvent the requirements contained
therein. The adopting release for Rule 204T explained that the “purchase of paired positions of
stock and options that are designed to create the appearance of a bona fide purchase of securities
but that are nothing more than a temporary stock lending arrangement would not satisfy
Regulation SHO’s close-out requirement.”82 Along similar lines, we stated in footnote 82 of
Rule 204’s adopting release that even when “a participant subject to the close-out requirement
purchases or borrows securities” on a close-out day, if it also on that same date engages in
transactions that can be used “to re-establish or otherwise extend the participant’s fail,” and for
which the “participant is unable to demonstrate a legitimate economic purpose,” it “will not be
deemed to have satisfied the close-out requirement.”83
***
The clarity of this guidance is evidenced by the fact that optionsXpress employees who
reviewed these materials contemporaneously recognized that “they’re [that is, the Customers]
definitely doing this.” They understood that the “end result” of the Customers’ buy-writes was
“similar” to the transactions found violative in prior cases and recognized these similarities as
“troublesome.” Its chief compliance officer recognized footnote 82 of the Rule 204 adopting
release—addressing same-day transactions that re-establish or otherwise extend a fail—as a
“very pertinent section” in response to an inquiry regarding the Customers’ use of buy-writes.
optionsXpress’s efforts to distinguish these settled cases by identifying marginal factual

Rule 204 Adopting Release, 74 Fed. Reg. at 38,272 n.82 (emphasis added). We have
found a violation of Rule 204(a)’s plain language, pursuant to which a firm must “close out its
fail to deliver position.” 17 C.F.R. § 242.204(a) (emphasis added). Therefore, we see no need to
consider in this proceeding under what circumstances the absence of a “legitimate economic
purpose” would present an independent basis for finding a violation of Rule 204. Although we
do not need to determine whether the buy-writes that optionsXpress relied on to address its fail to
deliver positions lacked a legitimate economic purpose, we do not believe that the firm has on
this record sustained its burden of demonstrating that those transactions had such a purpose. We
recognize that the Customers desired to place buy-writes because alternative courses of action
would not have allowed them to profitably exploit the put/call disparity in the initial synthetic
long. But an economic purpose—e.g., making money by avoiding costs—is not a legitimate
economic purpose when, as here, the profits can be exploited only because a regulatory
requirement has been circumvented.

37
differences—e.g., between FLEX options and standardized options—are unpersuasive. Our
Hazan order, for instance, specifically observed that some of the violative transactions took the
form of buy-writes and that the option component of these buy-writes could be “created using
standard [call] options,” as well as the short-term FLEX options that were principally employed
by the respondents in that case.84 Likewise, the fact that many of the previous settled cases
involved broker-dealers trading for their own accounts, and not firms executing trades for retail
customers, is immaterial for the point at issue here: That a firm’s reliance on buy-writes to
address its fails to deliver, however those trades come to be placed, raises serious concerns as to
compliance with Rule 204(a)’s close-out requirement.
In short, Rule 204(a) is, as we stated earlier, clear on its face in imposing a close-out
requirement in the event a firm has a fail to deliver position on T+3: Specifically, the firm must
“borrow[] or purchas[e] securities of like kind and quantity” by market open on T+4 and its
transactions on that date must “close out its fail to deliver position” at CNS. Yet even if that
were not so, the regulatory guidance available to optionsXpress throughout the OIP Period
consistently stated that relying on paired stock and option transactions to satisfy Rule 204(a)’s
close-out requirement would be impermissible when, as here, the effect of those transaction is to
maintain an open fail to deliver position.85

optionsXpress’s arguments are unpersuasive

The various arguments that optionsXpress raises about the scope, interpretation, and
application of Rule 204 are without merit. We also reject optionsXpress’s arguments about the
relevance of CNS data and its due process claim.
a.

The interpretation of Rule 204

optionsXpress asserts that the Division has not established that Rule 204 “applies in the
options context” and that the rule governs only the handling of fails arising from long or short
sales.86 It long has been clear that the assignment of a call option is, like an explicit short sale,
subject to Regulation SHO and triggers an obligation to “deliver the security by settlement

normally ‘must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the
regulation’”) (quoting Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994)). A contrary
interpretation of Rule 204(a) would not accord with “advancing our goal of further reducing fails
to deliver” and “prohibiting the persistence of fails to deliver.” Rule 204 Adopting Release, 74

The Customers’ reverse conversions—which coupled a synthetic long with a hedge created
by selling stock short—involved an explicit, initial short sale of a stock.

38
date.”87 It would be anomalous to exclude such transactions from Rule 204 given that, under
NSCC’s and OCC’s procedures, the CNS system treats call assignments indistinguishably from
stock sales. Indeed, industry participants immediately recognized Rule 204’s potential
applicability to options transactions.88 optionsXpress itself implemented procedures in response
to Rule 204 and those procedures did not distinguish between fails arising from stock or option
transactions
Next, optionsXpress argues that Rule 204’s close-out requirement is applicable only
when the participant has a fail to deliver on T+3, whereas its August 2009 adoption of a policy to
require customers to place buy-writes on “T+1” for securities on the “perpetual fail” list
eliminated aged fails. Put another way, optionsXpress contends that the Division has failed to
prove that the closing positions listed on the CNS Accounting Summaries actually reflected T+3
fails in the “perpetual fail” securities.89 According to optionsXpress, they instead were fails that
had already been closed out by buy-writes that the firm executed on T+1 that had not yet settled.
optionsXpress’s argument assumes that the buy-writes operated to close out its open fail
to deliver positions. This assumption is flatly contradicted by the record—a fact evident in the
“perpetual fail” procedures themselves, which applied only when the “fail is continuously open
due” to the “assign[ment] [of] in the money short calls.” (Emphasis added.) Just as before the
policy was put into place, the buy-writes still involved a stock purchase order paired with the
writing of a deep-in-the-money call option that was very likely to be assigned the same day.
Because same-day stock purchases and options assignments are netted together, the firm did not

Some of the OIP Securities were never on any perpetual fail list, and were always were
governed by optionsXpress’s pre-August 2009 policy. optionsXpress’s witnesses acknowledged
that buy-ins notices for such securities in the list continued to be issued “based on the T+4”
position.

39
deliver shares to NSCC. Thus, in executing the buy-writes, the firm at no time—i.e., whether
three days later or on any other day—actually closed out the fail.90
Moreover, under the August 2009 policy, each of the Customers was issued a buy-in
notice in the amount of the Customer’s entire short position regardless of the size of the firm’s
fail to deliver at CNS. Therefore, the buy-writes would have quickly reduced optionsXpress’s
fails—because the firm’s customers were nominally “purchasing” in the aggregate more shares
than the amount of optionsXpress’s fail to deliver—if they truly resulted in delivery to NSCC. In
fact, optionsXpress’s fails persisted well past August 2009 precisely because the calls were
continually assigned and delivery did not occur. Instead, the fails remained open and their age
crept steadily upwards. As a result, subsequent buy-writes occurred well after T+1 and also did
not result in delivery to NSCC. In short, the buy-writes did not restart the fail to deliver clock
and create new fails; the original fail remained open, and subsequent buy-writes were actually
being executed on, for example, T+10 or T+55 or even later.
optionsXpress also argues that Rule 204 requires only that the participant place an order
to “borrow or purchase securities,” regardless of whether that trade ultimately results in shares
being delivered to NSCC or the CNS fail being closed out. It urges that, because Rule 204
imposes strict liability, it must be applied in a “mechanical” and “literal” fashion.91 Yet it is
optionsXpress’s reading of that rule that runs counter to ordinary principles of statutory
interpretation. Rule 204(a) provides that the participant must “immediately close out its fail to
deliver position by borrowing or purchasing securities.”92 optionsXpress’s interpretation would

90

This argument fails for the additional reason that Rule 204(e) contains a specific provision
relating to “pre-fail” close-outs—i.e., close-outs that the firm places on T+1, T+2, or T+3—that
optionsXpress does not invoke in either its petition for review or its briefs to the Commission.
91

See Gollust v. Mendell, 501 U.S. 115, 122 (1991). Contrary to optionsXpress’s suggestion,
courts employ the usual tools of statutory interpretation when construing a strict liability
provision. E.g., PCS Nitrogen Inc. v. Ashley II of Charleston LLC, 714 F.3d 161, 185 (4th Cir.
2013) (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act); Miller v.
Javitch, Block & Rathbone, 561 F.3d 588, 592 (6th Cir. 2009) (Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act); Wallace v. Korean Air, 214 F.3d 293, 299 (2d Cir. 2000) (Warsaw Convention).
The initial decision found that the use of buy-writes constituted a “sham transaction”
although it did not formally fall within Rule 204(f)’s prohibition of sham close outs because
there was not a prior “arrangement” or collusion with a counterparty to avoid delivery. The
Division argues only that optionsXpress violated Rule 204(a)’s close-out requirement when it
relied on buy-writes that did not result in delivery to NSCC to satisfy that requirement; it does
not assert that optionsXpress violated Rule 204(f) and we therefore do not discuss the sham
transaction doctrine further.
92

17 C.F.R. § 242.204(a) (emphasis added).

40
render the italicized portion of the provision superfluous.93 That interpretation also would leave
Rule 204(a) ineffectual in accomplishing its purposes: If optionsXpress were correct that the
mere placement of a stock purchase order was sufficient to achieve Rule 204(a) compliance, a
participant could buy stock and then, an instant later, sell the same number of shares—i.e., a
wash sale. Because these transactions would cancel each other out, the firm would maintain its
net short CNS position, and the fail to deliver position would be allowed to remain open
indefinitely, confounding our “goal of reducing fails to deliver.”94
In support of its interpretation, optionsXpress relies on the testimony of Dr. Erik Sirri, a
former Director of the Division of Trading and Markets and Chief Economist of the
Commission. Dr. Sirri initially asserted that Rule 204 was “not written” to “require the broker to
make progress on [i.e., close out] its CNS position.” But we do not defer to expert testimony
about the meaning of the law.95 And the fact that Dr. Sirri used to work at the Commission does
not mean that his understanding of the Commission’s regulations are those of the Commission or
bind the Commission.96 Moreover, in the course of cross examination, Dr. Sirri ultimately
disavowed “offering any opinions about whether optionsXpress complied with SHO” because he
did not “have the information to do it even if [he] were to try.”
optionsXpress also claims that reading Rule 204(a) to include a close-out requirement
would have absurd consequences, such as “barring all buy-writes in response to fail to deliver
positions” or requiring brokers to prohibit all further sales transactions on a close-out day.
Although we do not address the applicability of Rule 204(a) to conduct that is not before us in
this proceeding, optionsXpress’s asserted fears are unfounded.97 Feldman attempted to employ
his trading strategy at a number of other brokers, and every such broker faced with a similar use

prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant”) (internal

A clearing broker is free to execute legitimate transactions subject to Regulation SHO’s
requirements. Moreover, in this proceeding, we are not presented with the question of how
uncoordinated or unrelated transactions effected by a firm’s other customers later on a close-out
day should be treated under Rule 204. We accordingly leave such questions for another day.

41
of buy-writes decided not to accommodate it.98 Moreover, the size and persistence of
optionsXpress’s fails was truly extraordinary; a FINRA investigator recalled that they were
among the longest fails that she had ever seen. optionsXpress was by itself responsible for 64%
of all shares that all 273 clearing brokers failed to settle in the CNS system during the periods
and in the stocks identified in the OIP. It ranked first among all clearing brokers for the largest
fails in 26 of the 44 periods in the OIP and it was ranked among the top three clearing brokers in
38 of the periods.
b.

CNS data

Another category of arguments raised by optionsXpress pertains to the relevance and
meaning of CNS data. In large part, these arguments are premised upon optionsXpress’s
erroneous characterization of the CNS system and, in particular, its conflation of failures to
deliver and failures to receive. For example, optionsXpress cites a portion of Professor Harris’s
expert report that discusses how long it took other firms to receive their shares. But the fact that
other firms often received shares of the OIP Securities from CNS without great delay does not
mean that optionsXpress timely (or ever) delivered a sufficient number of shares to CNS to close
out its fail to deliver positions. For a given security, the right to receive shares from NSCC, and
the priority among members with fails to receive, is independent of other members’ obligations
to deliver shares to NSCC. Accordingly, optionsXpress’s argument is inapposite to the question
whether it closed out its fail to deliver position.
optionsXpress also claims that the “age of fails cannot be determined by looking” at CNS
data. To support this assertion, optionsXpress cites a statement on the Commission’s Freedom of
Information Act website that supplies the “total number of fails-to-deliver . . . recorded in the . . .
CNS system aggregated over all NSCC members.”99 The data on the website is not tied to
specific NSCC participants. Unlike the data on the Commission’s website, the CNS Accounting
Summaries introduced in this case break out the fail to deliver positions for each participant
individually, including optionsXpress, and allow the age of each such fail to be determined.100

98

The other brokers borrowed securities in response to the fails, which resulted in them
incurring high borrowing costs.
99

Frequently Requested FOIA Document: Fails-to-Deliver Data, https://www.sec.gov/
foia/docs/failsdata.htm (last visited August 17, 2016) (emphasis added).
100

optionsXpress also posits that fails might persist on CNS Accounting Summaries for an
extended period (e.g., between T+4 and T+7 or perhaps later) “even when Rule 204(a)
admittedly is satisfied” because of the three-day settlement cycle. Its expert sketched out an
elaborate hypothetical in which multiple “trades occur in a Regulation SHO compliant way” and,
because of delays in settlement, a CNS fail remains open for a number of consecutive days. This
scenario, where one day’s fails might be unrelated to any subsequent day’s fails on account of
transactions coincidentally “cancelling” and netting against each other, bears no resemblance to
(continued…)

42
Finally, optionsXpress claims that CNS data cannot measure compliance with Rule 204.
optionsXpress contends that compliance is determined by looking at the participant’s own books
and records to determine whether the participant has a stock purchase transaction on the close
out date. It purports to find support for this position in the Rule 204 adopting release, which it
selectively quotes to omit the italicized language:
[A] participant must take affirmative action to close out a fail to
deliver position by purchasing or borrowing securities . . . . In
addition, . . . to meet its close-out obligation a participant also
must be able to demonstrate on its books and records that on the
applicable close-out date, it purchased or borrowed shares in the
full quantity of its fail to deliver position and, therefore, that the
participant has a net flat or net long position on its books and
records.101
Thus, read in context, the adopting release actually makes clear the standalone requirement that
“a participant . . . take affirmative action to close out a fail to deliver position by purchasing or
borrowing securities.”102 The “close-out requirements of Rule 204 are based on a participant’s
fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency”—that is, the firm’s CNS fails.103

(…continued)

the facts established by the record in this case. Here, a small number of optionsXpress’s
customers employed an options trading strategy from which arose the firm’s fail to deliver
positions, which persisted in some cases for dozens of consecutive days. On a continuing basis,
the firm relied on buy-writes placed by the Customers to address its fails, even though the calls
were being immediately and repeatedly assigned to optionsXpress and thus no delivery and no
close out resulted. Expert analysis of the customers’ trading records and CNS data demonstrated
that the buy-write volume was closely correlated with the size of optionsXpress’s fail to deliver
positions in surrounding days.

Id.; see also id. at 38,272 n.81 (referencing a firm’s “notification from NSCC regarding its
securities delivery . . . obligations”). In any event, optionsXpress never produced its entire books
and records, and thus we have no basis to determine whether optionsXpress’s “books and
records” contention is factually supported. Its expert, Dr. Atanu Saha, reviewed only the trades
in the Customers’ accounts. His report asserted that he conducted an “analysis of aggregate data
across all its customers’ accounts” showing that “optionsXpress complied with . . . Regulation
SHO.” But he conceded in his hearing testimony that his review was actually confined to the
firm’s “books and records for these six accounts”— i.e., the Customers’ accounts.

43
c.

Due process

optionsXpress also claims that its due process rights were violated. We do not agree. It
is settled that “[r]egulations satisfy due process as long as they are sufficiently specific that a
regulated entity ‘acting in good faith would be able to identify, with ascertainable certainty, the
standards with which the agency expects’ it to conform by ‘reviewing the regulations and other
public statements issued by the agency.’”104 Rules 204T and 204 straightforwardly required
participants to immediately close out their CNS failures to deliver. The requirements of those
rules were apparent on their face and, standing alone, adequately placed optionsXpress on notice
of the proscribed conduct.
Also, there was an abundance of regulatory guidance available—for example, the
Arenstein and Hazan orders and the adopting releases for Rules 204T and 204 described supra
Section IV.B.2—that informed optionsXpress that its reliance on the Customers’ buy-writes to
satisfy its obligations under Regulation SHO was not proper insofar as they did not result in
delivery and thus did not close out its fails.105 Indeed, the applicability of this guidance was so
clear that, after reading reports of settled enforcement orders involving similar trading activity,
one of optionsXpress’s traders immediately recognized the potential peril: “I’m not placing any
trades today.” When nonetheless directed to “execute the buy ins and customer orders today,” he
felt the need to forward that response to his personal, Yahoo email account. Another trader who
was copied on the email exchange did the same thing, explaining that it “[d]oesn’t hurt” to have
“some sort of documentation” that he raised the issue with his superiors.
For essentially the same reasons, we find that optionsXpress acted willfully and with
deliberate and reckless disregard for the risk that its conduct violated Rule 204. optionsXpress
knew that it was not closing out its fails by executing the buy-writes. It asserts that it received
“green flags” from regulators about relying on buy-writes to satisfy its obligations under Rule

regulations.”). Further, although optionsXpress correctly points out that settled cases are not
precedent (and are not binding on non-parties to the settlement), that is beside the point. E.g.,

44
204, but the record does not support that claim.106 As detailed below, optionsXpress was not
forthcoming in its discussions with CBOE, FINRA, and Commission staff.
i.

Interactions with CBOE

Contrary to optionsXpress’s contentions, an investigation by CBOE did not conclude that
optionsXpress complied with Regulation SHO. On February 26, 2009, CBOE staff notified
optionsXpress that it was investigating the repeated use of buy-writes by two customers in a
hard-to-borrow stock in January and February of that year.
CBOE’s lead investigator and his supervisor misunderstood the requirements of
Regulation SHO.107 For example, CBOE staff incorrectly believed that retail customers could
violate Regulation SHO; the investigator testified that “anyone can violate Reg[.] SHO.” As a
result, CBOE’s investigation focused on whether the customers—not optionsXpress—were
violating Rule 204T. CBOE staff also incorrectly believed that a fail to deliver could not occur
unless NSCC issued a CNS Retransmittal Notice. Therefore, although optionsXpress told CBOE
staff in response to an April 2009 inquiry that its customers used buy-writes and provided CBOE
with CNS accounting data, CBOE staff did not appreciate that optionsXpress had CNS fails
during that period or that optionsXpress was relying on the buy-writes to close out those fails.
Rather, they were puzzled as to “the purpose of doing buy-writes if [the] fail has been closed.”
These misunderstandings are further evidenced by the conversations between CBOE staff
and staff from the Commission’s Division of Trading and Markets. CBOE staff inaccurately told
Trading and Markets staff that optionsXpress did not have any fails to deliver. In response,
Trading and Markets staff correctly advised CBOE of the “basic rule” that Rule 204T could not
be violated without a CNS fail.108 Another call between CBOE and Trading and Markets staff

106

See Graham, 222 F.3d at 1008 (“[W]hat we have in this case is nothing more than a series
of investigations into [the defendant’s] trades . . . Neither [the defendant] nor the [other
respondents] can be said to have been cleared along the way.”).
107

Neither CBOE employee received formal training in Regulation SHO and their knowledge
of Rule 204T was limited to reading the rule itself. Moreover, they were unaware of the
Arenstein and Hazan settled cases or the related regulatory circulars. They admitted, among
other things, that they did not know what a fail to deliver was, how the age of a fail could be
determined from CNS Accounting Summaries, or when on T+4 a fail had to be closed out.
108

According to notes by FINRA staff with whom the CBOE investigator discussed his
investigation, Trading and Markets staff reminded CBOE staff that Rule 204T imposes
obligations only on brokers, not retail customers. Thus, the CBOE investigator was correctly
told that optionsXpress’s customers could “not officially [be] violating” Rule 204.

45
covering similar ground took place in June 2009. CBOE staff reiterated their assumption that
“due to [the] buy-writes, they [i.e., optionsXpress] never had [a] fail.”109
On neither the May 2009 call nor the June 2009 call did Trading and Markets staff opine
that optionsXpress was in compliance with Regulation SHO or that its reliance on buy-writes
was proper. One participant from Trading and Markets recalled that both calls were “incredibly
confusing” and requested additional information in writing. In response, the CBOE investigator
sent Trading and Markets staff a memo, which gave an example of the Zeleznys’ “deep call buywrite strategy.” Trading and Markets staff did not speak with either CBOE investigator again
after receiving the June 16 memo. And CBOE staff never discussed their consultations with
Trading and Markets staff with optionsXpress.
On June 19, the CBOE investigator recommended that his investigation be “Filed without
Action” because, in his view, “[n]o fails ever occurred.” In a follow-up email to his supervisor,
he stated that his conclusion that there was no Regulation SHO violation was based on his
assessment that there was no “fail[] on any security.” On September 23, 2009, CBOE closed its
investigation by issuing a Letter of Caution. The letter found a technical violation of
optionsXpress’s buy-in procedures unrelated to Regulation SHO. It did not mention Regulation
SHO, Rule 204T, or Rule 204, or state that the buy-writes satisfied the firm’s obligations
thereunder. Nor did CBOE investigators otherwise assure optionsXpress that the buy-writes
were appropriate or that optionsXpress should continue to rely on them to address its fail to
deliver positions.
Some months later, in January 2010, CBOE opened unrelated, routine surveillance
inquiries. These “short sale reviews” were limited in scope and triggered by automated
“exceptions reports.” CBOE requested that optionsXpress “[p]rovide any fail or buy-in [i.e.,
CNS Retransmittal] notices” with respect to certain securities. The CBOE investigator in charge
of the routine surveillance misunderstood Rule 204 as well. He was not a lawyer, received no
formal training on Regulation SHO, never read any of the relevant CBOE circulars, and had only
briefly perused the rules. He testified that these inquiries could be closed without further
investigation if the firm did not receive any CNS Retransmittal Notices (which he called “buyins”).

109

Another topic that was discussed was Rule 204(f)’s “sham transaction” exception, which
provides that a “participant of a registered clearing agency shall not be deemed to have fulfilled”
the delivery or close-out requirements when “the participant enters into an arrangement with
another person to purchase or borrow securities” and “knows or has reason to know that the other
person will not deliver securities.” 17 C.F.R. § 242.204(f). Because a violation of Rule 204(f) is
not advanced in this proceeding (see supra note 91), the guidance (if any) that Trading and
Markets staff provided about its potential applicability is irrelevant.

46
In February 2010, optionsXpress informed the CBOE investigator that it “[d]id not
receive buy-in notices from CNS” and attached CNS Accounting Summary excerpts. The
investigator testified that he spent about a half hour checking to see whether the securities and
trade dates listed “matched up” with those identified in the automated exceptions reports. He
had never seen a CNS Accounting Summary before and he did not understand the connection
between CNS data and fails to deliver. He consequently sent optionsXpress form letters in
December 2010 stating that no violations were apparent with respect to the materials reviewed.
The “sole basis” for this determination was, he acknowledged, optionsXpress’ representation
“that it did not receive any buy-in notifications from CNS.”
ii.

Interactions with FINRA and Commission staff

In the first half of 2009, FINRA opened an investigation of optionsXpress because of its
extended fails to deliver in three securities, Greenhill & Co., Inc. (GHL); Jos. A. Bank Clothiers,
Inc. (JOSB); and Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD). The fails, which in one case persisted over 120
consecutive days, were among the longest ones that the FINRA investigator had ever seen. Over
the next several months, optionsXpress provided FINRA staff with trade data showing that
certain of its customers were using buy-writes.
1.
September 23 and 24, 2009 calls between optionsXpress and FINRA staff: After
receiving CBOE’s Letter of Caution in September 2009, optionsXpress spoke with the FINRA
investigator and her supervisor. optionsXpress represented that CBOE had investigated the same
activity and found that it was not actionable under Regulation SHO. It is undisputed that FINRA
staff did not tell optionsXpress that it was in compliance with Rule 204 or otherwise provide any
guidance about Rule 204 because its investigation was still ongoing.
2.
September 24 call between optionsXpress and Trading and Markets staff: Later
on September 24, Stern, Victor, Hoeh, and Strine from optionsXpress spoke with Trading and
Markets staff. Stern took the lead on the call and described the Customers’ trading activity.
According to the testimony of the optionsXpress witnesses, Trading and Markets staff told
optionsXpress to “keep doing what you’re doing—keep closing out.” Victor’s notes also state
“we do not fall into the sham transaction  the customer may.”
One of the Trading and Markets staff members testified at the hearing. Her recollection
of the September 24 call was markedly different. She testified that optionsXpress told Trading
and Markets staff that its customers were engaging in an “arbitrage strategy” that involved
selling deep-in-the-money calls, getting assigned on those calls, and then selling more calls when
the firm directed them to buy-in. She did not recall using the phrase “keep doing what you’re
doing,” and emphasized that if she did say it, it was only in the context of stating the obvious—
i.e., that optionsXpress had to continue complying with Regulation SHO and closing out its CNS
fail to deliver positions. She thought that it was improbable that she would have assured
optionsXpress that it was complying with Regulation SHO because it was not the typical practice

47
of Trading and Markets staff to tell broker-dealers over the phone that a specific fact pattern did
or did not violate the law.
We are not convinced that Trading and Markets staff advised optionsXpress on
September 24 that the trading activity described by Stern would not violate Rule 204.110 But we
need not (and do not) rest our ultimate conclusions on this point because any guidance that
hypothetically might have been given by Trading and Markets staff was premised on the
materially inaccurate and incomplete information provided by optionsXpress. optionsXpress
was not, therefore, entitled rely on it.
optionsXpress did not reveal that it was under investigation by FINRA—a consequential
omission since Trading and Markets staff would have told optionsXpress that it could not give
guidance in light of that pending investigation. In testimony that the law judge found credible,
the staff member specifically denied that optionsXpress disclosed the FINRA investigation.
Additionally, her testimony was corroborated by notes maintained by other Trading and Markets
staff (which do not mention any FINRA investigation), Victor’s own notes,111 and subsequent
emails to FINRA and individuals at the Commission describing the conversation.
optionsXpress also did not reveal that, at the time of the call, the firm had longstanding
fails to deliver in the OIP Securities—for example, in the case of Sears, 120 consecutive
settlement days. Moreover, optionsXpress repeatedly assured Trading and Markets staff that it
was closing out fails to deliver as they arose. Trading and Markets staff understood this to mean
that optionsXpress was purchasing or borrowing securities “in a bona fide” manner so as to
“close[] out the amount that was failing” every morning.
Although optionsXpress may have mentioned the concept of “bundling” buy-writes in
some general way, it did not reveal that it was relying on its execution of paired stock and
options transactions placed by customers to close out its fails.112 The Trading and Market staff
member testified that the use of buy-writes to address fails would have raised a “red flag” for her
given the Hazan and TJM settled cases.
optionsXpress also did not reveal that that it was not consistently executing transactions
at market open. According to Victor’s notes, optionsXpress instead told Trading and Markets

110

There was conflicting testimony on this issue, as well as ambiguous indications in the
available documentary evidence.
111

Victor’s notes contain the phrase “we got okay from FINRA,” which suggests that
optionsXpress misled Trading and Markets staff about the status of the FINRA investigation.
112

It is undisputed that Trading and Markets staff told optionsXpress that it was not in a
position to give any advice on whether the firm could bundle the buy-writes to achieve “best
execution.”

48
staff that it bought in customers “at the open” and only “contact[ed] [the] customers [to] tell
them [it] [was] buying in” after the stock purchases already had been executed.
Finally, optionsXpress did not reveal that the Customers were in practice selling calls
corresponding to roughly the same number of shares that the firm specified in its buy-in notices.
In the example that Stern gave Trading and Markets staff, optionsXpress was assigned on 100
calls (i.e., corresponding to 10,000 shares). The next day, the firm issued the hypothetical
customer a buy-in notice for 10,000 shares, in response to which the customer wrote options
corresponding to a different number of shares—88 calls (i.e., 8,800 shares). Moreover, in Stern’s
example, still another number of those options, 44, were assigned later that day. This example
was purposely misleading in multiple respects. He admitted that his example was intended to
give Trading and Markets staff the impression that the number of calls written for the “buy-in
was not specifically linked to the amount of the assignment” on prior or subsequent days.113
Victor’s notes confirm that optionsXpress thought it was “important” to convey that “every new
day is a ‘different’ number”—which was not in fact the case.
Stern further misled Trading and Markets staff by explaining that the Customers might
want to sell fewer calls than the buy-in amount if they expected the stock to increase in price
(and thus desired to establish a long position). In fact, Stern was well aware that the customers
used buy-writes precisely because they wanted to hedge their synthetic long positions and
maintain an overall directionally neutral position.
3.
October 2 calls between Trading and Markets staff and FINRA staff and between
Trading and Markets staff and optionsXpress: On October 2, Trading and Markets staff learned
additional facts from FINRA staff that optionsXpress did not disclose during the September 24
call. Among other things, Trading and Markets staff learned that FINRA had an open
investigation into the activity, that the calls were being written simultaneously with the stock
purchase orders, and that FINRA suspected buy-writes were being used to circumvent the closeout requirement. Based on this new information, Trading and Markets staff stated that they
would contact optionsXpress and tell the firm it would not provide an opinion given the
“difference in the facts as they were presented.” Shortly after getting off the phone with FINRA,
Trading and Markets staff called optionsXpress and told Victor that staff could provide the firm
with “no comfort” and that optionsXpress needed to discuss the matter with FINRA.
4.
October 2 call between optionsXpress and FINRA staff: optionsXpress reported
to FINRA that it was “at a loss about what it should be doing.” FINRA staff did not provide any
guidance about optionsXpress’s compliance with Rule 204 on this call (or on any other

113

In fact, there was a close correlation between these numbers, as established by Professor
Harris’s analysis.

49
occasion). It advised optionsXpress to submit its request for guidance in writing to FINRA’s
Office of General Counsel, which optionsXpress never did.
5.
January 14, 2010 call between optionsXpress and FINRA staff: In connection
with FINRA’s ongoing investigation, Stern, Victor, and others at optionsXpress had another call
with FINRA staff, including a FINRA Senior Vice President who headed the Options Regulatory
Team and co-authored AMEX’s circular Reg. 2007-35. Before the call, the FINRA team
reviewed the trading and determined that continued investigation was warranted. The January 14
call occurred because the team was concerned that optionsXpress’s activity was similar to that in
prior Regulation SHO cases that FINRA had brought involving the use of buy-writes. FINRA
staff did not tell optionsXpress that its activity was consistent with Regulation SHO.
Notwithstanding the call, the trading activity went on for another two months and optionsXpress
continued to rely on the Customers’ buy-writes to address the firm’s fails to deliver and satisfy
its obligations under Rule 204(a).
FINRA’s investigation of optionsXpress continued. Eventually FINRA made an internal
decision to defer further action because the Commission’s own investigation was ongoing. In
February 2010, optionsXpress received investigative subpoenas from the Commission. On
March 9, optionsXpress halted the trading, but allowed Customers’ options positions to remain
open until their expiration later that month.
***
In sum, we find that optionsXpress failed to fully describe the trading activity and
provide essential context for how the buy-writes were being relied upon by the firm. Given this,
we do not think that optionsXpress could reasonably have believed that any statements made by
staff amounted to a reassurance that the firm’s conduct complied with Rule 204(a). In any event,
it is undisputed that, on October 2, 2009, FINRA and Trading and Markets staff specifically told
optionsXpress that they could provide “no comfort.” Yet optionsXpress changed nothing about
how it addressed fail to deliver positions for almost another half year, which standing alone is
flatly inconsistent with optionsXpress’s protestations that it made good faith efforts to comply
with the law.
C.

optionsXpress also violated Rule 204 because the transactions it relied upon
to comply with that rule were not executed at or before market open

We find that optionsXpress violated Rule 204 in a second respect. Rule 204(a) requires
the firm to take affirmative action in response to a fail to deliver “by no later than the beginning
of regular trading hours” on the applicable close-out day.114 Therefore, regardless of whether or
not the firm was actually complying with Rule 204(a)’s close-out requirement, optionsXpress
114

17 C.F.R. § 242.204(a).

50
relied upon the buy-writes for that purpose, and that meant they had to be executed by market
open on T+4.115 As detailed above, optionsXpress frequently was not executing buy-writes at
market open. Before August 2009, optionsXpress required its customers to respond to buy-in
notices when the Clearing Department calculated a fail to deliver on T+4. The Clearing
Department often did not even calculate the buy-in list until well after the market opened, and
the Trading Desk allowed the Customers to place buy-writes throughout the day. For the 1,205
buy-writes executed before August 20, 2009, 97% were executed after 10:00 am. For the entire
OIP Period, 67% of the buy-writes were executed after 10:00 am, and on average approximately
an hour and a half after the market opened.
We therefore conclude that optionsXpress willfully violated Rule 204(a) by not taking
affirmative action in response to its fails “no later than” the time required by the Rule.
V.

optionsXpress Sanctions

The law judge issued a cease-and-desist order, an order to disgorge ill-gotten gains, and a
third-tier civil monetary penalty of $2,000,000 against optionsXpress. We impose the same
sanctions.
A.

Cease-and-desist order

Securities Act Section 8A116 and Exchange Act Section 21C117 authorize the Commission
to impose a cease-and-desist order on any person we find has violated or caused a violation of
those acts or rules thereunder. In determining whether a cease-and-desist order is appropriate,
we consider whether there is a reasonable likelihood of violations in the future, the seriousness of
the violation, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violation, the respondent’s state of mind in
committing violations, the respondent’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his or her conduct,
and how recent the violations are.118 Absent evidence to the contrary, a single past violation

115

The parties agree that a close-out trade after 10:00 am ET on T+4 does not take place by
the “beginning of regular trading hours” and have framed their arguments and analysis on this
premise. We resolve this case based on the parties’ shared premise, but in so doing, we
emphasize that “regular trading hours” generally “means the time between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00
p.m. Eastern Time,” and caution that a participant must not delay in placing a close-out trade.

51
ordinarily suffices to establish a risk of future violations.119 The risk of future violations required
to support a cease-and-desist order is significantly less than that required for an injunction.120
We find that these factors weigh in favor of imposing a cease-and-desist order against
optionsXpress. optionsXpress’s violations were repeated and serious. Day after day,
optionsXpress failed to close out fails to deliver with market values often individually exceeding
a million dollars. In doing so, optionsXpress disregarded explicit guidance from the
Commission and other regulators cautioning market participants against the use of paired
stock/option transactions to give the appearance of satisfying Rule 204’s close-out requirement.
The firm essentially took the position that, until a regulator explicitly told it to stop, it would
continue to rely on its execution of buy-writes for the Customers to satisfy its obligations. The
firm also failed to act transparently with regulators when the firm’s activities were under
investigation, and it continues to insist that its conduct was lawful.
optionsXpress’s arguments against imposing a cease-and-desist order do not outweigh
these considerations. The firm notes, for example, that its violations are not recent, and it cites
WHX Corp. v. SEC for the proposition that “automatic” cease-and-desist orders are improper.121
But our decision to impose a cease-and-desist order is not automatic, and no one factor is
dispositive.122 Even though the violations occurred some time ago, we are still concerned about
the risk that optionsXpress will commit future violations because of the seriousness and recurrent
nature of optionsXpress’s violations, the firm’s failure to accept responsibility for its conduct,
and its efforts to deflect responsibility onto regulators.123 Nor are those concerns mollified by
the optionsXpress’s argument that it has subsequently been acquired by Schwab and that the
managers who were most involved with the violations have since left the company.124

a cease-and-desist order “need to be considered, and none of them, by itself, is dispositive”).
123

By comparison, the D.C. Circuit found that the respondent in WHX committed only “a
single, isolated violation” that it voluntarily and immediately corrected upon notification by
Commission staff, suggesting a minimal risk of recurrence. WHX Corp., 362 F.3d at 861.

unwarranted because the responsible employee was “no longer associated with [the firm] and . . .
it is ‘unlikely that the precise situation will arise again in the future’“); City of Miami, Exchange
Act Release No. 47552, 2003 WL 1412636, at *11 (Mar. 21, 2003) (explaining that the
“departures” of the city “officials involved with that [violative] conduct” did not provide
“assurance that [the city] will not commit similar violations in the future”).

52
optionsXpress continues to operate as a registered broker-dealer and will therefore continue to
have the opportunity to commit future violations of Regulation SHO.125 We thus find that a
sufficient risk of future violations exists so as to order optionsXpress to cease and desist from
violating Exchange Act Rule 204 of Regulation SHO.
B.

Disgorgement

Securities Act Section 8A(e) and Exchange Act Section 21C(e) authorize us to impose
disgorgement and reasonable interest.126 “[D]isgorgement’s underlying purpose is to make
lawbreaking unprofitable for the law-breaker[.]”127 Accordingly, “the amount of disgorgement
should include all gains flowing from the illegal activities,” but calculating the amount of
disgorgement “requires only a reasonable approximation of profits causally connected to the
violation.”128 Once the Division shows that its disgorgement figure is a reasonable
approximation of the amount of unjust enrichment, the burden shifts to the respondent to
demonstrate that the Division’s estimate is not a reasonable approximation.129
Here, we find that an appropriate disgorgement amount is $1,574,599. This represents
the commissions that optionsXpress earned by executing the buy-writes for the Customer
accounts listed in the OIP. We find that this is a reasonable approximation for how much the
firm profited from its decision to rely on its execution of those trades to satisfy its close-out

125

optionsXpress also subsequently altered its policies to forbid the use of buy-writes in
similar circumstances, but our assessment of the “risk of future violations . . . arises not so much
from the likelihood that [the firm] will again rely on the same [transactions], but that it will again
provide the same inadequate level of scrutiny” to compliance issues relating to optionsXpress’s
obligations under Regulation SHO. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 2001 WL 47245, at *27 n.151.

1989) (noting that, when calculating disgorgement, “separating legal from illegal profits exactly
may at times be a near-impossible task”).
129

SEC v. Lorin, 76 F.3d 458, 462 (2d Cir. 2006); see also, e.g., Zacharias v. SEC, 569 F.3d
458, 472–73 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (noting that, where disgorgement cannot be exact, the “wellestablished principle” is that the burden of uncertainty in calculating ill-gotten gains falls on the
wrongdoer whose illegal conduct created that uncertainty); SEC v. Calvo, 378 F.3d 1211, 1217
(11th Cir. 2004) (“Exactitude is not a requirement; so long as the measure of disgorgement is
reasonable, any risk of uncertainty should fall on the wrongdoer whose illegal conduct created
that uncertainty.” (quotations omitted)).

53
obligations.130 optionsXpress challenges this calculation by arguing that any disgorgement
against the firm should reflect only its net profits (i.e., the total amount of commissions less
overhead and operating expenses) rather than its gross revenue (i.e., the total amount of
commissions). According to optionsXpress, the firm’s overall profit margin was approximately
44% in 2010. However, because the “gross proceeds” that optionsXpress received are a “prima
facie reasonable approximation of profits connected to the securities violation,” the burden rests
on optionsXpress to demonstrate why that is not a reasonable approximation of its ill-gotten
gains.131
optionsXpress has not met this burden. Even if a respondent may in some circumstances
be “entitled to a deduction for all marginal costs incurred in producing the revenues that are
subject to disgorgement,” it is not entitled “to deduct expenses (such as ordinary overhead) that
would have been incurred in any event, if the result would be that [respondent’s] wrongful
activities—by defraying a portion of overall expenses—yield an increased profit from
[respondent’s] operations as a whole.”132 optionsXpress does not attempt to separate out these
costs and, instead, points only to the firm’s overall profit margin across all of its activities in
2010. The Commission and courts have repeatedly rejected this approach, finding that
130

The Commission has authority to require disgorgement of avoided losses. See, e.g., SEC v.
Patel, 61 F.3d 137, 139 (2d Cir. 1995) (insider trading); Restatement (Third) of Restitution § 51
cmt. e (“Profit results in some cases from the avoidance of an otherwise necessary
expenditure.”). But under the circumstances of this case, we decline to accept the Division’s
suggestion that the Commission should order disgorgement in the amount of the hard-to-borrow
fees that optionsXpress would have paid if it had borrowed shares to close out the fails to deliver.
Rule 204 does not require firms to borrow shares; the rule instead gives firms a choice of
“borrowing or purchasing securities” to close out a fail. And a firm is not required to allow its
customers to employ whatever trading strategies they may choose. Other brokers declined to
accommodate Feldman’s trading strategy precisely because they did not want to incur high
borrowing costs. Thus, we do not believe that the borrow costs are “otherwise necessary
expenditures”: But for the misconduct, optionsXpress likely would have disallowed the trades
altogether, rather than allow the trading to go on and absorb the borrow fees.
131

SEC v. Whittemore, 659 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2011); see also SEC v. Platforms Wireless
Int’l Corp., 617 F.3d 1072, 1096 (9th Cir. 2010); SEC v. Manor Nursing Ctrs., Inc., 458 F.2d
1082, 1104–05 (2d Cir. 1972). Any risk of uncertainty in distinguishing between lawful and
unlawful proceeds must “fall on the wrongdoer whose illegal conduct created the uncertainty.”
First City Fin. Corp., 890 F.2d at 1232; see also SEC v. Razmilovic, 738 F.3d 14, 31 (2d Cir.
2013).
132

Restatement (Third) of Restitution § 51 cmt. H; see also id. § 51(5)(c) (stating that a
“defendant will ordinarily be denied any credit . . . for expenditures incurred directly in the
commission of a wrong”); JT Wallenbrock, 440 F.3d at 1114 (“expenses in carrying out a
fraudulent scheme . . . are hardly appropriate or legitimate deductions” (quotation marks
omitted)).

54
wrongdoers are not entitled to an offset against the disgorgement amount for ordinary business
expenses.133 We therefore find it appropriate to order optionsXpress to disgorge $1,574,599,
plus prejudgment interest.134
C.

Third-tier civil penalties

Sections 8A(g) of the Securities Act and 21B(a) of the Exchange Act authorize us to
impose civil monetary penalties for willful violations of these Acts.135 In considering whether a
civil penalty is in the public interest, we may consider (1) whether the act or omission involved
fraud or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement; (2) whether the act or
omission resulted in harm, or risk of harm, to others; (3) the extent to which any person was
unjustly enriched, taking into account restitution made to injured persons; (4) whether the
individual has committed previous violations; (5) the need to deter such person and others from
committing violations; and (6) such other matters as justice may require.136
These public interest factors weigh in favor of imposing a substantial monetary sanction
against optionsXpress. As discussed above, optionsXpress acted in deliberate and reckless
disregard of its regulatory obligations over a prolonged period.137 In repeatedly violating Rules
204 and 204T, optionsXpress ignored explicit guidance from the Commission and other
regulators; took the position that, until a regulator explicitly told it to stop, it could continue to

use buy-writes to address its fail to deliver positions; and instead of proactively seeking guidance
from regulators (as optionsXpress claims), the firm tried to keep them in the dark about the
trading activity.
We find it proper to impose a sanction for every occasion that optionsXpress violated
Rules 204 and 204T by failing to close out a fail to deliver position as required by Rule 204(a).
The Division argues (and the law judge found) that these violations occurred on at least 1,200
occasions based on its expert’s analysis of optionsXpress’s CNS Accounting Summaries. We
find that the record supports this finding and we accordingly accept it.138 Moreover, the record
also establishes that optionsXpress independently violated Rules 204 and 204T each time it
executed the transactions it was relying on for Rule 204 compliance—i.e., the buy-writes—after
10:00 am ET on T+4 (and thus well after market open). That was the case for 1,173 out of the
1,205 buy-writes placed by the Customers between September 30, 2008 and August 20, 2009,
and additional buy-writes placed in the period after August 20. We accordingly find that a
preponderance of the evidence establishes optionsXpress violated Rules 204 and 204T at least
1,200 times.
We further find that a third-tier penalty is appropriate because optionsXpress deliberately
and recklessly disregarded regulatory requirements and its violations created a substantial risk of
loss to investors.139 In promulgating Regulation SHO, the Commission found that fails to deliver
pose a substantial risk of systemic harm to market participants and market integrity.140 As we
explained, “[l]arge and persistent fails to deliver may have a negative effect on shareholders,
potentially depriving them of the benefits of ownership, such as voting and lending . . . .
138

Specifically, the Division’s expert found that optionsXpress had a total of 1,271
consecutive days with fails to deliver for the securities and time periods listed in the OIP. The
law judge relied on this evidence to find that optionsXpress violated Rule 204 on at least 1,200
occasions. optionsXpress does not challenge that figure in either its petition for review or its
briefs to the Commission; optionsXpress instead argues only that there were no Regulation SHO
violations (a position we reject).
139

For each violative “act or omission,” the Commission may impose one of three tiers of
penalties, depending on the nature of the violation. From October 2008 to March 3, 2009, the
Commission could impose first-tier penalties of up to $6,500 for violations of the securities laws;
second-tier penalties of up to $65,000 for violations of the securities laws that “involved fraud,
deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement;” or thirdtier penalties of up to $130,000 for violations that satisfy the requirement for a second-tier
penalty and “resulted in substantial losses or created significant risk of substantial losses to other
persons or resulted in substantial pecuniary gain.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(b)(3)(A)(B) (emphasis
added). After March 3, 2009, the maximum amount of civil penalty for each act or omission at
the second tier was $75,000 for a natural person, and at the third tier was $150,000 for a natural
person and $725,000 for any other person.
140

See, e.g., 74 Fed. Reg. at 38,267; 72 Fed. Reg. at 45,544; 68 Fed. Reg. at 62,975.

56
Persistent fails to deliver in a security may also be perceived by potential investors negatively
and may affect their investment decisions.”141
optionsXpress argues that there is little evidence that its conduct actually undermined
market integrity on any specific occasion—e.g., there is no record of an identifiable counterparty
suffering concrete harm because it did not timely receive shares.142 But this is not unexpected,
given NSCC’s role as a central counterparty in clearing and settling transactions and the indirect
means by which securities are held through DTC. Although harms from persistent fails to
deliver by nature tend to be diffuse, a significant risk of substantial harm is all that is required to
impose a third-tier penalty under the statutory scheme. We determined that such a risk exists
when we promulgated Rule 204 and we adhere to that finding.
Specifically, when a broker has a fail to deliver position, it necessarily follows that
another broker (or set of brokers) will have a fail to receive position because CNS functions on a
net basis. When a broker has a fail to receive in a security, the number of shares in its DTC
account for that security will be less than the total number of shares that have been purchased by
its customers. In other words, the broker’s books may reflect that its customers collectively hold
more shares with the broker than the broker itself holds with DTC, with the difference being the
broker’s long CNS position. Because the rights associated with ownership—e.g., the right to
vote the stock, receive dividends, or lend the stock out in exchange for fees—pass through DTC
to the member and then finally to the purchaser, the broker’s failure to receive may impair the
rights of its customers.
This indirect system of securities holdings is governed by Article 8 of the Uniform
Commercial Code, which has been enacted by the legislatures of all 50 states. The central
concept of Article 8 is that of a “security entitlement,” which is a special kind of undertaking in
which a securities intermediary (such as DTC or a broker) agrees to treat the entitlement holder
as being entitled to exercise the economic benefits and governance rights that comprise the
security.143 Thus, instead of possessing rights directly against the issuer, the entitlement holder
has rights only against its own securities intermediary—i.e., against DTC in the case of a broker
and against the broker in the case of a broker’s customers.144 The intermediary must pass

141

74 Fed. Reg. at 38,281.

142

There was evidence that other brokers submitted a number of Notices of Intention to Buyin with CNS for the OIP Securities meaning that they had fails to receive that they desired to
promptly resolve. There also was evidence that optionsXpress received CNS Retransmittal
Notices from NSCC on several occasions, placing it on notice that it might be required to
compulsorily purchase the securities and deliver them.
143

See generally U.C.C. § 8-102(a)(17) & cmt. 17; § 8-501(a)-(b) & cmt. 1.

144

See generally U.C.C. §§ 8-102 cmt. 17, 8-503 & cmt.2.

57
through the benefits and rights of ownership to the entitlement holder.145 Importantly, though, a
securities intermediary may credit its customers’ accounts with a security entitlement even when
the intermediary does not yet hold the security at DTC (or have enough securities entitlements
with its own, upstream securities intermediary).146
A customer’s contractual rights against its broker do not depend on whether the broker
has sufficient holdings of the asset with DTC.147 But that customer’s security entitlement against
his or her broker does not give him or her contractual rights against anyone else. Accordingly,
when a broker has a fail to receive at CNS and thus a shortfall of shares in its DTC account, it
may be unable to see to it that its customer receives the economic and corporate rights that
comprise the financial asset.148 For example, although customers are entitled to instruct their
broker how to vote the shares in their accounts (and a broker is in turn obliged to direct DTC
accordingly), the broker may cast only as many votes as it has shares in its account with DTC as
of the record date. Therefore, as the Division’s expert put it, a failure to receive may prevent the
broker from “own[ing] the stock legally” and thus “hav[ing] the right to vote the shares.”149
Likewise, fails to receive may prevent purchasers from receiving the full economic benefit of
dividend payments—e.g., because payments in lieu of dividends credited by the CNS system
may not be eligible for preferred tax treatment as qualified dividend income—or taking
advantage of the opportunity to lend shares to others.
The risk of these systemic harms, which we previously identified in the Rule 204T and
Rule 204 adopting releases, creates a substantial need to deter optionsXpress and others from
committing similar Rule 204 violations in the future by imposing significant penalties. By
earning more than $1 million in commissions, optionsXpress’s violative conduct also resulted in
a “substantial pecuniary gain,” which itself exposes optionsXpress to third-tier civil penalties.

145

See generally U.C.C. §§ 8-505 to 8-508.

146

U.C.C. § 8-501(c) & cmt. 3; see also id. §§ 8-504, 8-509(a); 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c6-1.

147

U.C.C. § 8-501 cmt. 3.

148

When brokers credit entitlements to their accounts before they receive the security via
CNS, the total number of entitlements credited to all customer accounts across all brokers may
exceed the total number of shares registered at the DTC. That latter figure is unaffected by fails
to deliver or fails to receive at CNS, because only the issuer itself can create more shares.
149

Put another way, the aggregate number of votes that potentially could be submitted by
customers might exceed the number of shares that the broker is entitled to vote on their behalf.
Whether a fail to receive impacts any particular customer’s right to vote shares would depend on
the number of votes actually cast and the broker’s method for reconciling excess votes. “Neither
our rules nor SRO rules currently mandate . . . the use of a particular reconciliation or allocation
methodology.” Concept Release on the U.S. Proxy System, Exchange Act Release No. 62495,
2010 WL 2779423, at *13 (July 14, 2010).

58
Considering these circumstances, we find that a total monetary penalty of $2 million is
appropriate. This amount is well within the maximum amount allowed under the Securities Act
and Exchange Act—indeed, that is so regardless of which of the three tiers of penalties is
applicable to each of optionsXpress’s violations. A $2 million civil penalty is comparable to the
amount that optionsXpress was unjustly enriched by the violations (that is, the $1,574,599 in illgotten gains that we have ordered be disgorged).150 Finally, a $2 million third-tier penalty serves
the public interest of deterring optionsXpress and others in similar positions from committing
future violations.151
VI.

Feldman background

Although we find that optionsXpress violated Rule 204 by relying on Feldman’s and
other Customers’ buy-writes to satisfy the firm’s delivery obligations when those trades did not
result in the firm closing out its fails, the record does not contain sufficient evidence for us to
find that Feldman failed to fulfil his own, distinct delivery obligations or that he otherwise
violated the anti-fraud provisions. We begin with a recitation of the relevant facts about
Feldman’s trading activity.
A.

Feldman was open about his trading strategy

The allegations against Feldman arise from options trades that he executed through
optionsXpress between October 2008 and March 18, 2010.152 Feldman was notably transparent
about those trades. The Division does not dispute that Feldman fully disclosed his trading
strategy to optionsXpress and other brokers with which he placed trades. The Division also
acknowledges that the public could determine that the calls written by Feldman (and other
Customers similarly engaged in the repeated use of buy-writes) were likely to be exercised and

150

See, e.g., Collins v. SEC, 736 F.3d 521, 525 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (noting that, “in
administrative proceedings before the SEC,” civil penalties “ranging from roughly one-half of
the disgorgement” to “about 25 times the disgorgement” have typically been observed).
151

optionsXpress argues that that the proceeding must be dismissed because it is time-barred
under Section 4E(a) of the Exchange Act, which sets forth certain deadlines “for completing
enforcement investigations.” 15 U.S.C. § 78d-5. The D.C. Circuit recently rejected this
argument, holding that Section 4E does “not impos[e] a jurisdictional bar” as to the
Commission’s authority to bring administrative proceedings regardless of whether those
deadlines have been met. Montford & Co., Inc. v. SEC, 793 F.3d 76, 81 (D.C. Cir. 2015).
152

At the time of the trades, Feldman worked as a Senior Vice President at Eastern Savings
Bank in Hunt Valley, Maryland. Feldman’s options trading had no connection to that job, and
Feldman had no formal securities training, held no securities licenses, and was not a compliance
professional. Rather, Feldman traded options in his spare time.

59
assigned by looking at the “open interest” and volume of options in those series.153 Feldman
even posted a comment on a public Internet blog in June 2009 using his own name and
describing his strategy, including the buy-in notices that he repeatedly received from
optionsXpress:
I have been in this Citi/Preferred Arb trade for 3 months now.[] While I
some[how] am not paying the “cost to borrow” fees (don’t ask me how), the risk
of “buy[-]in” is huge. You’ve done a great job of using the analogy of the loan
that does not renew. I went 2 months with zero buy-ins (miraculously), but the
past 2-3 weeks the buy[-]ins have been fast and furious. However, when[e]ver I
get a buy-in (I’m talking hund[re]ds of thousands of shares sometimes), I recreate
the position by selling in-the-money calls, which of cou[r]se then get assigned,
leaving me short again. It’s a viscious [sic] cycle, [b]ut worth the [transaction
costs] (and the .01-.02 loss per round turn) in order to make the .785/share profit
(now closer to .50 as the gap narrowed yesterday).
The Division notes that, two days after Feldman last posted to this blog, someone posted
a question asking Feldman “if you get assigned on the short call, you have to deliver stock. How
do you do this?” The poster continued, “My understanding is that if you do nothing, you will get
bought in (by your clearer) to make delivery on the assignment. Fascinated to hear if/how you
get around this.” The record contains no evidence that Feldman ever saw this post or responded
to it.
B.

optionsXpress changed its buy-in policy, but told Feldman it wanted to “keep
his business”

In July 2009, optionsXpress notified Feldman that it had changed its procedures.
optionsXpress previously gave Feldman the entire day to place buy-writes in response to its buyin notices. Beginning in July 2009, the firm told Feldman that it would start requiring him to
cover “immediately.”154 In notifying Feldman of this change, Payne assured Feldman in an
email dated August 6, 2009, that “[t]his process has been a headache from the beginning, but I do
appreciate you continuing to work with optionsXpress with your orders.”
Responding to Payne’s email, Feldman wrote that “[i]t is very distressing that I (and I
assume other clients) learn the rules, adapt to them, base strategies on them, and play by them.
Only to have them changed.” Feldman then asked whether the change in policy would impact

153

Open interest refers to the total number of contracts in a particular series that are currently
outstanding—i.e., contracts that have been written, but not yet exercised.
154

As discussed supra Section III.B.3, optionsXpress began pre-building the buy-writes before
market open, but delayed executing them until the Customers placed an order.

60
his ability to continue doing buy-writes by noting that buy-writes were “crucial to maintain the
neutral hedge” of his strategy and that “[s]eparating [the buy and the write into separate
transactions] creates mkt (sic) risk for you and the client.” Feldman also asked whether the
change in policy was due to a Commission or internal optionsXpress rule, writing that he was
“just trying to understand what the heck is behind this. People too often make up rules and
forget they’re in business to do business.”
Payne wrote back that “[t]his is definitely an SEC regulation, and not one from our
compliance department.” He also attached a link to the adopting release for the amendments to
Regulation SHO, asserting that the issue with Feldman’s trades was that, “[b]y shorting options
deep in the money, to get assigned, your trade date position stays constant, and the settled
position never closes or goes long.” Because of this, Payne wrote, the firm would have to
require Feldman to respond to buy-in notices for those trades “at the open.” Payne nevertheless
assured Feldman that “[w]e definitely want to keep your business,” and that an optionsXpress
broker was “here to take any orders you wish to work.” Payne also added, “we have to follow
the rules.” Payne did not tell Feldman that the trades ran afoul of any Commission rule. To the
contrary, Payne’s comments conveyed the impression that the timing of the buy-writes was
changed to assist with regulatory compliance.
C.

Feldman received assurances from optionsXpress

At some point, optionsXpress began limiting the size of Feldman’s trades by charging an
extra half cent per share when he executed buy-writes in response to certain large buy-in notices.
Feldman testified that optionsXpress’s VP of Trading/Customer Service, Peter Bottini
(“Bottini”), explained to him that “the real reason why we are trying to limit your position . . .
[i]s because the SEC had been looking at the trades . . . and had a concern.” According to
Feldman, Bottini also told him that optionsXpress was supposed to have a conference call with
the Commission to discuss the matter.
On September 23, 2009, Bottini emailed Feldman a link to the then-recent Commission
settlement in Hazan Capital Management LLC.155 Feldman responded via email: “I do
appreciate you taking the time to finally give me the opportunity to understand the issues
involved here,” and “I would certainly appreciate being kept in the loop as to any potential SECmandated changes as to that issue.” Later the same day, Feldman emailed Bottini again, writing
that he thought that the trading described in Hazan “was really very different” from his trades.
Among other things, Feldman wrote that, while he used standard options, which “many times . . .
do not get assigned 100%,” Hazan involved FLEX options, which involved a one-day expiration.
On this basis, Feldman “assume[d]” that his use of standard options was “thus very legitimate,
and is indeed [m]ore arm[’]s length than those ‘FLEX’ options.”

155

See supra Section IV.B.2 (discussing Hazan).

61
Feldman emailed Bottini again several days later, asking about the call that
optionsXpress was supposed to have had with the Commission. Feldman wrote that “I obviously
would like to continue trading when appropriate” and asked “what will be needed to resume
‘normal’ operations.” Bottini responded that he was “available to discuss” the matter more in a
few days, but that “[t]hings look positive.” Feldman testified that he and Bottini did, in fact,
discuss the matter a few days later and that Bottini assured him “that the SEC had looked at it,
and everything was fine going forward.”156
D.

Feldman openly pursued his options strategy at other broker-dealers

In October 2009, Feldman transferred part of his account from optionsXpress to another
broker-dealer, Terra Nova Financial Group, Inc., and continued pursing his options strategy in
his new account. Approximately a month later, however, Terra Nova’s clearing firm, Penson
Financial Services (“Penson”), told Feldman that his trades were causing the firm to incur
increased collateral requirements. Penson therefore directed Feldman to move his trading
positions back to optionsXpress, which Feldman did around December 2009.
In October 2010, the Commission informed Feldman that it intended to recommend
instituting a proceeding against him. Despite this, Feldman continued using his trading strategy
at two other brokers. These additional trades are not at issue here, but, by way of example,
Feldman began placing trades with E*TRADE sometime around April 2011. He emailed Oscar
Zeron (“Zeron”) at E*TRADE to confirm whether he could use buy-writes: “I just want to
confirm that, per your compliance ppl to whom you spoke, as long as the short shares are
covered, it’s no problem setting additional calls ico (to maintain the neutral hedge). Thanks, pls
confirm.” Zeron responded on June 27, 2011: “Correct! You can sell calls to hedge anytime.”
Zeron added on June 29, 2011, “Yes, you may implement BUY-Writes if applicable.”
Although E*TRADE never expressed concern that Feldman’s trades might themselves be
violating Commission rules, the firm nevertheless became concerned with the potential strain
that they could put on the firm’s operations. As Roderick Mikus (“Mikus”), E*TRADE

156

After Bottini told Feldman that the Commission had determined that his trading activity
was “fine,” Feldman became aware of anonymous Yahoo! message board participants who were
discussing an increase in Sears’s trading volume, which was attributable to Feldman’s trades.
When a friend of Feldman’s told him that the commenters had posited a variety of theories for
the spike, including that Sears could be going private or instituting some type of stock buy-back
program. Feldman emailed his friend that he “read the latest thread on the [Sears] ‘volume
spikes.’ Very entertaining. (Until someone notifies the SEC, and they shut down the strategy!!
Then we’ll need a real job . . LOL.” At the hearing, Feldman testified that his reference to the
Commission was a self-deprecating joke, which is consistent with the evidence that, based on his
communications with optionsXpress, he believed that the Commission was already fully aware
of his strategy when he wrote the email.

62
Financial’s Vice President of Securities Lending Operations and former COO for E*TRADE
Clearing, explained, the firm (not Feldman) was obligated to deliver the shares related to
Feldman’s trades. Because of this, the firm was required “to go out and either have the customer
cover or recall shares with a counterparty, or a multitude of different reasons to ensure that we
have got enough shares to satisfy the delivery obligation.” E*TRADE was concerned that the
volume of Feldman’s trades, combined with the volume of other customers’ trades, could cause a
“strain on the system.” Mikus explained that this volume could, “at some point,” cause
E*TRADE not to “have enough shares available” to deliver to NSCC. Mikus nevertheless
emphasized that the firm was meeting its delivery obligations by delivering shares from its
inventory or from borrowing shares, which meant that Feldman’s buy-writes neither caused
E*TRADE to violate Regulation SHO nor caused the firm to have an ongoing CNS fail. Mikus
eventually told Feldman to close out his positions. As Feldman explained it during the hearing,
E*TRADE “asked [him] not to do [his trades] anymore, and [his] presumption was because it
was costing them too much of a fee.”
Feldman also employed his options strategy at TD Ameritrade. But TD Ameritrade told
Feldman to stop after a couple months. Feldman testified that “what they told me was that the
borrowing costs for them were so high on some of these stocks that they were actually paying
out of pocket that they warned me to not do any more of those . . . and asked me not to do any
more because it was costing them too much money.”
VII.
A.

Feldman’s Alleged Antifraud Violations

The Division failed to establish a violation of Securities Act Section 17(a),
Exchange Act Section 10(b), or Exchange Act Rule 10b-5

The Division alleges that Feldman willfully violated Securities Act Section 17(a),157
Exchange Act Section 10(b), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 10b-21,158 which each prohibit
fraudulent conduct.159 In doing so, the Division makes essentially two fraud-related allegations
157

15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1) and (3) (prohibiting “employ[ing] any device, scheme, or artifice to
defraud” and “engag[ing] in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or
would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser”).
158

15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) (making it unlawful for any person to “use or employ. . . any
manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as
the Commission may prescribe”); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(a) and (c) (barring “employ[ing] any
device, scheme, or artifice to defraud” and “engag[ing] in any act, practice, or course of business
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person”).
159

Because the Division does not allege that Feldman made “any untrue statement of a
material fact or [omitted] to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made .
. . not misleading,” neither Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) or Securities Act Rule 10b-5(b) are
relevant here. 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b).

63
against Feldman. The first is a contract-based theory: that Feldman sold call options with no
intention of fulfilling the resultant delivery obligations when the options were exercised. The
second is a more expansive manipulation-based theory: that Feldman’s repeated use of buywrites deceived market participants about the timely delivery of their shares. As explained
below, the record does not support a finding of fraud under either theory.
1.

Insufficient evidence of making promises with the intention not to
fully perform them

Regarding the Division’s first, contract-based fraud theory, courts have long held that
entering into a promise with the secret reservation not to perform can amount to securities
fraud.160 That is not the case here. The Division claims that Feldman did this by repeatedly
placing buy-writes with the secret intention of not fulfilling the delivery obligations that arose
upon the exercise of the call options—or, at the very least, that he knew that his continual use of
buy-writes made non-performance likely. The record and the law does not support imposing
antifraud liability on such a theory.
The record contains no evidence that Feldman had any obligation, or even ability, to
deliver shares to the entity exercising the call option (or, for that matter, to anyone other than
optionsXpress).161 Instead, it was the broker-dealers, like optionsXpress, that had the obligation
and ability to deliver shares to NSCC upon receiving an assignment from OCC.162 Although a
160

See, e.g., Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. v. United Int’l Holdings, Inc., 532 U.S. 588, 589, 596-97
(2001) (finding a Rule 10b-5 violation by noting that, “[t]o sell an option while secretly
intending not to permit the option’s exercise is misleading, because a buyer normally presumes
good faith”); Threadgill v. Black, 730 F.2d 810, 811–12 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (stating that “fraud in
the purchase or sale includes ‘[e]ntering into a contract of sale [of a security] with the secret
reservation not to fully perform’“ (quoting Walling v. Beverly Enters., 476 F.2d 393, 396 (9th
Cir. 1973) (observing that “[e]ntering into a contract of sale with the secret reservation not to
fully perform it is fraud cognizable under §10(b)”))).
161

As evidence that Feldman was required to deliver shares to the entities that ultimately
exercised the call options, the Division points to CBOE’s product specifications for equity
options, found on its website, which states that “[e]xchange traded equity options are ‘physical
delivery’ options[, which] means that there is a physical delivery of the underlying stock to or
from your brokerage account if the option is exercised.” http://www.cboe.com/products/
equityoptionspecs.aspx (last visited Aug. 17, 2016). The OCC’s website somewhat similarly
states that “[e]xercise or assignment of equity options results in acquisition or delivery of the
underlying shares.” http://www.optionsclearing.com/clearing/clearing-services/specificationsequity-options.jsp (last visited Aug. 17, 2016). Neither of these statements articulate who must
effect delivery (let alone state that a retail customer has the obligation to deliver shares).
162

NSCC then delivered the shares to the downstream purchaser’s broker, who in turn
delivered the shares to the purchaser. See supra Section III.A.

64
“customer that writes an Option is contractually bound to its broker to perform,”163 the broker
has its own obligation as a NSCC and OCC participant to effect “delivery” of the underlying
securities via the CNS system “regardless of whether [its] customers perform.”164 The
Division’s own expert conceded that optionsXpress, not Feldman, had control over the logistics
of settlement and that Feldman relied on optionsXpress to effect delivery of securities. As the
Commission has stated, when, as here, a seller “is relying on a broker-dealer . . . to make
delivery on a sale, the seller would not be representing at the time it submits an order to sell a
security that it can or intends to deliver securities on the date delivery is due.”165 There is no
evidence that Feldman assumed any part of optionsXpress’s delivery obligations, nor is there any
evidence that optionsXpress (or any of the other brokers with which Feldman placed trades)
asked Feldman to locate or deliver shares in response to an options assignment. Instead, the
record suggests that, by complying with the broker-dealers’ directions, Feldman did “just what
he promised” the firms he would do.166 And the Division’s expert agreed that a “customer who
satisfied all the obligations presented by [his] broker-dealer could do nothing more to satisfy any
delivery” obligations that the customer might have.
Second, instead of evidence indicating that Feldman secretly intended not to deliver
shares, as the Division alleges, the record shows that Feldman was notably open about what he
was doing. There is no dispute that his brokers, including optionsXpress, were aware of
Feldman’s trading strategy and its reliance on the repeated use of buy-writes. Feldman also
posted his trading strategy on a public web forum, and the Division concedes that the open
interest and volume of written calls was publicly available information, which allowed the
marketplace to see the high-volume and frequent same-day exercise of written calls. Nor does
the record provide evidence that Feldman impliedly or explicitly promised any other entity that
he would make additional undertakings to effect delivery of the underlying securities.

163

Form S-20, Registration Statement, The Options Clearing Corporation at p. 6 (Mar. 18,
2002) (emphasis added). Feldman’s brokerage agreement with optionsXpress required Feldman
to comply with the firm’s buy-in directions. That agreement also gave optionsXpress control
over Feldman’s account so that it could take steps to fulfill its own delivery obligations—
regardless of how or whether Feldman responded to the firm’s buy-in directions. optionsXpress
had the authority, for example, to use the funds in Feldman’s account to purchase the shares on
his behalf (even if that meant liquidating his other holdings) or to borrow shares without
Feldman’s consent.

And when it relied on Feldman’s buy-writes to address its fails, optionsXpress did not timely
close them out. But responsibility for the fails belonged to optionsXpress, which allowed them
to persist through optionsXpress’s own conduct (such as its decision to allow Feldman to place
buy-writes in response to the firm’s buy-in notices and its decision to rely on those buy-writes to
satisfy the firm’s obligations under Rule 204).167 We accordingly find insufficient evidence to
conclude that Feldman violated the anti-fraud provisions by making promises that he did not
intend to keep.
2.

Insufficient evidence of market manipulation

We similarly find that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to find market
manipulation. Liability for market manipulation stems from Section 10(b)’s prohibition against
“any manipulative or deceptive practice or contrivance.”168 The Commission has interpreted this
prohibition as outlawing the “intentional interference with the free forces of supply and
demand.”169 Investors, the Commission has explained, are “entitled to assume that the prices
they pay and receive are determined by the unimpeded interaction of real supply and real
demand.”170 Manipulative transactions “frustrate these expectations” by substituting “fiction for
fact” and transforming a market into “a stage managed performance.”171 The key question for
determining liability is whether a respondent engaged in a transaction that sent “a false . . . signal
to the market.”172

167

Feldman also employed the same trading strategy at other firms, and there is no evidence
that his trades caused ongoing CNS fails to deliver or Regulation SHO violations elsewhere.

Open-market transactions, like the buy-writes used here, can form the basis for unlawful
market manipulation if the alleged manipulator acts with the necessary intent.173 As the
Commission has held, although “fictitious trades frequently form the basis of manipulative
activity [,] . . . it is not necessary that the transactions in question be fictitious.”174 It is enough if
those otherwise legal trades were done with the intent to manipulate the market.175 To establish
such intent, the Division must show either that (1) the respondent intended “to deceive,
manipulate, or defraud” or (2) the respondent’s conduct was such “‘an extreme departure from
the standards of ordinary care . . . that the danger was either known to [respondent] or so obvious
that the [respondent] must have been aware of it.’”176 Here, there is insufficient evidence in the
record for us to find that Feldman acted with scienter.
The Division’s primary evidence of scienter are Feldman’s various statements that he did
not want to “settle” his position. The Division contends that these statements show that Feldman
was intentionally using buy-writes to avoid delivering shares. Yet, as noted above, this argument
conflates the concept of “delivery” applicable to broker-dealers and that applicable to customers
like Feldman. Feldman did not have any reason to avoid delivery (or to cause broker-dealers like
optionsXpress to avoid delivery): As the Division’s expert conceded, Feldman’s profits were
unaffected by whether his broker-dealer actually delivered the shares via CNS. When read in
this context, Feldman’s statements about not wanting to “settle” suggest that he was simply
trying to avoid exiting (i.e., settling) his overall position, not that he was attempting to prevent
shares from being delivered to those exercising the options that he wrote. In fact, Feldman tried
to find ways to avoid the repeated cycle of buy-writes, since every buy-write cost him money,
thus diminishing his overall gains.
173

67
Nor is there sufficient evidence to find that it was unreasonable—and therefore at least
negligent under Section 17(a)(3)—for Feldman not to have known that his repeated use of buywrites had a manipulative impact on the market.177 The Division points to Feldman’s alleged
knowledge about the potential regulatory concerns his trades were causing for optionsXpress as
evidence that he should have known that his trades were deceiving market participants about
delivery of their shares. The record does not contain sufficient evidence to accept the Division’s
inference. . Regulation SHO does not apply to retail investors like Feldman, and the record does
not show that he otherwise had any reason to know the regulation’s intricacies. Nor was
Feldman privy to optionsXpress’s internal discussions about its own compliance, and he did not
have access to CNS Accounting Summaries or the firm’s books or records.
The only evidence of Feldman’s insight into the firm’s operations (and whether it was
meeting its CNS delivery obligations) came from what the firm told him—yet he was never told
that his trades were causing optionsXpress to violate Regulation SHO or that investors were not
receiving their shares. To the contrary, optionsXpress repeatedly assured Feldman that his use of
buy-writes was an acceptable response to the firm’s buy-in directions. When Feldman placed a
buy-write, for example, the firm typically would send him a written confirmation that his trade
had covered the short position for which the firm issued a buy-in notice. Although
optionsXpress also told Feldman that the Commission had concerns with his trading strategy, the
firm subsequently assured Feldman that the Commission had reviewed his trading and concluded
that “everything was fine going forward.” To be sure, optionsXpress’s assurances were false—
since optionsXpress had not been forthcoming with Commission staff (as detailed supra Section
IV.B.c). But there is no evidence that Feldman knew that. Similarly, when Penson, E*TRADE,
and TD Ameritrade each told Feldman that they would no longer place his buy-writes, they
explained their actions by referring to only increased fees or increased collateral requirements
that Feldman’s trades caused the firms to incur.178

177

The Supreme Court has never addressed whether negligence is necessary to prove a
violation of those provisions. In fact, the Court has suggested that, at least under Section
17(a)(3), the focus is only on the “effect of particular conduct on members of the investing
public, rather than upon the culpability of the person responsible” for the conduct. Aaron v.
SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 696–97 (1980). But the evidence of even the effect of Feldman’s buy-writes
on members of the investing public is insufficient to find fraud.
178

See supra Section VI.D. Penson and E*TRADE employees had internal discussions about
their firms’ delivering shares to NSCC, but the record contains no evidence that anyone at either
firm shared those concerns with Feldman or that it was failing to deliver shares. On January 14,
2015, Feldman filed a motion to adduce additional evidence and to supplement his brief to the
Commission based on the Commission’s decision to institute administrative proceedings against
certain Penson executives for alleged violations of Regulation SHO in May 2014. See Thomas
R. Delaney II, Exchange Act Release No. 72185, 2014 WL 2038877 (May 19, 2014) (instituting
proceedings). Because we dismiss this proceeding as to Feldman, his motion is moot.

68
Nor do we find that Feldman’s receipt of Hazan was enough to have reasonably alerted
him of the potentially manipulative impacts of his trades. The Hazan proceeding was brought
against a registered broker-dealer, which the Commission found had colluded with a
counterparty to postpone and avoid delivery of shares. Feldman’s case contains no evidence (or
even allegation) of collusion with a counterparty.179 While the facts in Hazan were analogous
enough to optionsXpress’s situation such that the firm reasonably should have questioned its role
as a broker in relying on Feldman’s buy-writes to satisfy its obligations under Rule 204(a), we do
not believe Hazan was analogous enough to Feldman’s situation to suggest to him, in the face of
assurances provided by his broker, that he was violating the law.
Further, there is no evidence, or even allegation, that Feldman had any motive to deceive
the market about the volume of his trades. We accordingly find insufficient evidence to
conclude that Feldman violated the anti-fraud provisions by engaging in market manipulation. In
dismissing the proceedings against Feldman, we do not imply that an investor’s use of buywrites cannot be part of a fraudulent scheme.180
B.

The Division failed to establish a violation of Exchange Act Rule 10b-21

The record also does not support a finding that Feldman violated the so-called “naked
short selling antifraud rule,” which is Exchange Act Rule 10b-21.181 That rule states that it is a
manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance for “any person to submit an order to sell an
equity security if such person deceives a broker or dealer, a participant of a registered clearing
agency, or a purchaser about its intention or ability to deliver the security on or before the
settlement date, and such person fails to deliver the security on or before the settlement date.”182
To demonstrate a violation of Rule 10b-21, we must find “(1) scienter; (2) that an order was
submitted to sell an equity security; (3) the seller deceived a broker or dealer, a participant of a

179

Because of the frequency of the buy-writes, other market participants began to anticipate
them and often had “resting orders” in place to take the other side. In fact, optionsXpress was
aware that a single market maker was on the other side of many buy-writes. But neither the firm
nor Feldman ever found out that counterparty’s identity.
180

See, e.g., Gonul Colak, Exchange Act Release No. 71461, 2014 WL 345644 (Jan. 31, 2014)
(finding fraud in a settled matter against two retail investors for their use of buy-writes); SEC v.
Kupersmith, Litigation Release No. 22637, 2013 WL 865278 (Mar. 7, 2013) (describing consent
decree where defendants allegedly orchestrated an illegal “free-riding” scheme of selling stocks

registered clearing agency, or a purchaser about its intention or ability to deliver the security; and
(4) the seller failed to deliver the security.”183
As discussed above, there is no evidence or allegation that Feldman deceived his broker
about his intent or ability to deliver shares. The only question is whether he knew or should have
known that he was deceiving downstream purchasers about his ability or intent to deliver shares.
The record does not provide sufficient evidence to make such a finding. Among other things,
Feldman was open about his trading strategy, even describing it in a public blog post;
optionsXpress repeatedly assured Feldman that his trades were not causing the firm to have fails
to deliver; optionsXpress had the ability to purchase shares on Feldman’s behalf to address fails
to deliver; and Feldman had no other way to know whether his trades were ultimately causing
purchasers not to receive their shares.184
C.

No aiding and abetting or causing violations by optionsXpress

The Division alleges that optionsXpress aided, abetted, and caused Feldman to commit
antifraud violations. To establish either aiding and abetting or causing liability, there must first
be a primary violation.185 Because the record in this case does not support a finding that
Feldman committed fraud, there is no primary violation and thus no basis for aiding and abetting
or causing liability.
***
For these reasons, we dismiss the proceeding in its entirety as to Feldman.186

Rule 10b-21 to be the same as that required under Rule 10b-5.” “Naked” Short Selling, 2008 WL

violated the securities laws; (2) the aider and abettor provided substantial assistance to the
primary violator; and (3) such assistance was rendered with knowledge of, or extreme
recklessness regarding, the securities law violation); Gregory M. Dearlove, Exchange Act

causer contributed to the violation; and (3) the causer knew that his or her conduct would

VIII. Constitutional Arguments
A.

The Appointments Clause does not apply to Commission ALJs

Respondents argue that Chief ALJ Brenda P. Murray—who presided over this matter and
issued the Initial Decision—was not appointed in a manner consistent with the Appointments
Clause of the Constitution. We find that the appointment of Commission ALJs is not subject to
the requirements of the Appointments Clause.
Under the Appointments Clause, certain high-level government officials must be
appointed in particular ways: “Principal officers” must be appointed by the President (and
confirmed by the Senate), while “inferior officers” must be appointed either by the President, the
heads of departments, or the courts of law.187 The great majority of government personnel are
neither principal nor inferior officers, but rather “mere employees” whose appointments are not
restricted by the Appointments Clause.188 The Division does not dispute that Chief ALJ Murray
was not appointed by the President, the head of a department, or a court of law.189 Respondents
therefore contend that her appointment violates the Appointments Clause because, in their view,
Chief ALJ Murray should be deemed an inferior officer. The Division counters that she is an
employee and thus there was no violation of the Appointments Clause.
As we have previously explained,190 the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Landry v. FDIC
guides our resolution of this question.191 Landry held that, for purposes of the Appointments

deny that motion as moot.
187

The Clause provides that the President “by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,
shall appoint . . . Officers of the United States . . . but the Congress may by Law vest the
Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts
of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.” U.S. Const. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2.

71
Clause, ALJs at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), who oversee
administrative proceedings to remove bank executives, are employees rather than inferior
officers. Landry explained that the touchstone for determining whether adjudicators are inferior
officers is the extent to which they have the power to issue “final decisions.”192 Although ALJs
at the FDIC take testimony, conduct trial-like hearings, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and
have the power to enforce compliance with discovery orders, they “can never render the decision
of the FDIC.”193 Instead, they issue only “recommended decisions,” which are reviewed de novo
by the FDIC Board of Directors; “[f]inal decisions are issued only by the FDIC Board.”194 The
FDIC ALJs thus function as aides who assist the Board in its duties, not officers who exercise
significant authority independent of the Board’s supervision. Because ALJs at the FDIC “have
no such powers” of “final decision,” the D.C. Circuit “conclude[d] that they are not inferior
officers.”195
The mix of duties and powers of the Commission’s ALJs are very similar to those of the
ALJs at the FDIC.196 Like the FDIC’s ALJs, the Commission’s ALJs conduct hearings, take
testimony, rule on admissibility of evidence, and issue subpoenas. And like the FDIC’s ALJs,
the Commission’s ALJs do not issue the final decisions that result from such proceedings. Just
as the FDIC’s ALJs issue only “recommended decisions” that are not final, the Commission’s

Id. at 1133-34. Respondents assert that the Commission has changed its views on this
point, having previously taken the position in Free Enterprise Fund that members of the PCAOB
were inferior officers even though they lacked authority to issue final decisions. See Brief for
the United States, Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477 (2010)
(No. 08-861), 2009 WL 3290435 (Oct. 13, 2009). Respondents misapprehend what was at issue
in Free Enterprise Fund. There, it was “undisputed” that PCAOB Board members were inferior
officers, so there was no occasion to address the distinction between mere employees and
inferior officers. See id. at 29 n.8. Further, that case did not turn on the absence or presence of
adjudicative finality, because PCAOB Board members performed “enforcement or policymaking
functions.” Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 507 n.10.

196

The D.C. Circuit recently rejected the argument that the Commission’s ALJs are
“constitutional Officer[s] who must be appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause,” and, in
so doing, found the “FDIC regime considered in Landry” does not differ in any material way
from the regulatory regime governing our ALJs. Raymond J. Lucia Cos., Inc. v. SEC, ___ F.3d
___, 2016 WL 4191191, at *1, 6 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 9, 2016).

72
ALJs issue “initial decisions” that are likewise not final.197 Respondents may petition the
Commission for review of an ALJ’s initial decision,198 and it is our “longstanding practice [to]
grant[] virtually all [such] petitions for review.”199 Indeed, we are “unaware of any case in
which the Commission has declined to grant” a respondent’s timely petition for review from an
ALJ’s initial decision.200 Absent a petition, we may also choose to review a decision on our own
initiative.201 In either case, our rules expressly provide that “the initial decision [of an ALJ] shall
not become final.”202 Even where an aggrieved person fails to file a timely petition for review of
an initial decision and we do not order review on our own initiative, our rules provide that “the
Commission will issue an order that the decision has become final,” and it becomes final only
“upon issuance of the order” by the Commission.203
Moreover, as does the FDIC, we review our ALJs’ decisions de novo. Upon review, we
“may affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part,”

any initial decision.204 We do not defer to our ALJs’ factual findings.205 Moreover, “any
procedural errors” made by an ALJ in conducting the hearing “are cured” by our “thorough, de
novo review of the record.”206 And although our ALJs may oversee the taking and hearing of
evidence, we have made clear that we have “plenary authority over the course of [our]
administrative proceedings and the rulings of [our] law judges—both before and after the
issuance of the initial decision and irrespective of whether any party has sought relief.”207 This
includes authority over all evidentiary and discovery-related rulings. Lastly, we are not limited
by the record that comes to us from the ALJ. We may expand the record by “hear[ing]
additional evidence” ourselves or remanding for further proceedings before the ALJ, and may
“make any findings or conclusions that in [our] judgment are proper and on the basis of the
record.”208

We do not view the possibility that we might make a factual finding partially based on an
ALJ’s demeanor-based credibility determinations to vest them with the type of authority that
would qualify them as inferior officers. First, as we have repeatedly made clear, we do not
accept such determinations “blindly,” and we will “disregard explicit determinations of
credibility” when our de novo review of the record as a whole convinces us that a witness’s
testimony is credible (or not) or that the weight of the evidence warrants a different finding as to

Respondents rely on several decisions—all since vacated on jurisdictional grounds—in
which district courts have found that the Commission’s ALJs are inferior officers.209 Those
decisions decline to follow the D.C. Circuit’s reasoning in Landry and rely instead on Freytag v.
Commissioner,210 in which the Supreme Court held that a “special trial judge” of the Tax Court
was an inferior officer. But we agree with Landry’s analysis and the distinctions that the D.C.
Circuit identified between ALJs and the special trial judges at issue in Freytag.211 The greater
role and powers of the special trial judges relative to Commission ALJs, in our view, makes
Freytag inapposite here. First, unlike the ALJs whose decisions are reviewed de novo, the
special trial judges made factual findings to which the Tax Court was required to defer, unless
clearly erroneous.212 Second, the special trial judges were authorized by statute to “render the
[final] decisions of the Tax Court” in significant, fully-litigated proceedings involving
declaratory judgments and amounts in controversy below $10,000.213 As discussed above, our
ALJs issue initial decisions that are not final unless the Commission takes some further action.
Third, the Tax Court (and by extension the court’s special tax judges) exercised “a portion of the
judicial power of the United States,” including the “authority to punish contempts by fine or
imprisonment.”214 Commission ALJs, by contrast, do not possess such authority.215 And while

See Rule of Practice 180, 17 C.F.R. § 201.180. The Commission’s rules provide ALJs with
authority to punish contemptuous conduct in only the following, limited ways: If a person
engages in contemptuous conduct before the ALJ during any proceeding, the ALJ may “exclude
that person from such hearing or conference, or any portion thereof” or “summarily suspend that
person from representing others in the proceeding in which such conduct occurred for the
duration, or any portion, of the proceeding.” Id. § 201.180(a). If there are deficiencies in a
filing, a Commission ALJ “may reject, in whole or in part,” the filing, such filing “shall not be
part of the record,” and the ALJ “may direct a party to cure any deficiencies.” Id. § 201.180(b).
Finally, if a party fails to make a required filing or to cure a deficiency with a filing, then a
Commission ALJ “may enter a default . . . , dismiss the case, decide the particular matter at issue
against that person, or prohibit the introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning that

Commission ALJs may issue subpoenas to compel compliance, they are powerless to enforce
their subpoenas; the Commission must seek and then obtain an order from a federal district court
to compel compliance.216 In this respect, too, our ALJs are akin to the FDIC’s ALJs that Landry
found to be “mere employees.” 217 The fact that our ALJs may rule initially on certain
evidentiary matters and discovery issues (subject to our de novo review) does not distinguish
them from the FDIC’s ALJs in Landry who have the same authority.
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the mix of duties and powers of our ALJs is
similar in all material respects to the duties and role of the FDIC’s ALJs in Landry.218
Accordingly, we follow Landry, and we conclude that our ALJs are not “inferior officers” under
the Appointments Clause.219

unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public

review.

218

We do not find any relevance in the fact that the federal securities laws and our regulations
at times refer to ALJs as “officers” or “hearing officers.” There is no indication that Congress
intended “officers” or “hearing officers” to be synonymous with “Officers of the United States,”
U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2, and the word “officer” in our regulations has no such meaning. We
also note in this regard that the Administrative Procedure Act “consistently uses the term
‘officer’ or the term ‘officer, employee, or agent’” to “refer to [agency] staff members.”

612, 615 & n.11 (1948). Cf. 5 U.S.C. §§ 556, 557 (referring to the individual who presides over
a hearing as the “presiding employee”).
219

Beyond Landry, we believe that our ALJs are properly deemed employees (rather than
inferior officers) because this is how Congress has chosen to classify them, and that decision is
entitled to considerable deference. See Burnap v. United States, 252 U.S. 512, 516 (1920). For
example, as we discussed above, Congress created and placed ALJ positions within the
competitive service system, just like most other federal employees. Like such other employees,
an ALJ who believes that his employing agency has engaged in a prohibited personnel practice
can seek redress either through the Office of Special Counsel or the Merit Systems Protection
Board. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204, 1212, 1214, 1215, 1221. And ALJs—like other employees—are
subject to reductions-in-force. See id. § 7521(b).

76
Company Accounting Oversight Board.220 In that case, the Court held that the structure of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was unconstitutional because it
“commit[ed] substantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of for-cause
removal.”221 The PCAOB consisted of inferior officers who exercised executive power, but who
could only be removed for cause by principal officers—SEC Commissioners—who themselves
could only be removed for cause by the President.222 The Court found this “novel structure”
contrary to “Article II’s vesting of the executive power in the President,” including the
President’s obligation to “ensure that the laws are faithfully executed,” because it deprived the
President of sufficient control over members of the PCAOB.223
Based on Free Enterprise, respondents take the position that the Commission’s ALJs are
unconstitutional because they are likewise protected by two layers of for-cause removal:
Commission ALJs can be removed only for cause by the Merit Systems Protection Board, and
members of that board can be removed only for cause by the President.224 But Free Enterprise
did not establish a categorical rule prohibiting two layers of for-cause removal wherever it may
be found in the Executive Branch. Indeed, the Supreme Court emphasized that the “size and
variety of the Federal Government . . . discourage general pronouncements” about what removal
structures may, or may not, be constitutional in different situations.225 Thus, contrary to
respondents’ view, Free Enterprise did not turn on the technicalities of removal; it turned instead
on the core constitutional question of whether “Article II’s vesting of the executive power in the
President,” including his authority to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, was frustrated
by the distinctive structure and features of the PCAOB.226
When Free Enterprise is so understood, it becomes apparent that “the real question is
whether the removal restrictions [at issue] are of such a nature that they impede the President’s
ability to perform his constitutional duty, and the functions of the officials in question must be
analyzed in that light.”227 For the reasons explained below, we adhere to our previously stated
view that ALJs differ from the PCAOB members in a number of significant ways, and those

differences obviate any constitutional concerns from the dual for-cause removal restrictions in
the context of ALJs.228
First, the Court in Free Enterprise made clear that its “holding . . . does not address that
subset of independent agency employees who serve as administrative law judges,” and the Court
indicated that there would be no separation-of-powers problem if ALJs are deemed to be
employees rather than inferior officers.229 Free Enterprise left little doubt that civil servants who
are not “executive officers” may enjoy multiple layers of protection from presidential removal
without violating the separation of powers. Our conclusion supra that the Commission’s ALJs
are employees therefore disposes of respondents’ Free Enterprise objection.
Second, even if the Commission’s ALJs are considered officers in the constitutional
sense, the nature of their duties differs so dramatically from those of the PCAOB as to obviate
any potential concerns about the removal limitations. The PCAOB was “charged with enforcing
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the securities laws, the Commission’s rules, its own rules, and
professional accounting standards,” among other duties.230 It was “empowered to take
significant enforcement actions” and engage in the “daily exercise of prosecutorial discretion”—
all core “executive activities typically carried out by officials within the Executive Branch.”231 In
contrast, as the Court in Free Enterprise recognized, ALJs are “unlike members of the Board”
insofar as they “perform adjudicative rather than enforcement or policymaking functions”232—
and limited adjudicative power at that. And the exercise of such “adjudicative” functions beyond
presidential control has long been deemed constitutionally permissible.233

228

Timbervest, LLC, 2015 WL 5472520, at *26. Courts that have addressed the question have
indicated that the limitations on removal of Commission ALJs are not unconstitutional. See
Duka v. SEC, 2015 WL 1943245, at *8-10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2015) (finding no likelihood of
success on removal issue); Hill, 2015 WL 4307088, at *19 n.12 (expressing “serious doubts” that
the removal restrictions are unconstitutional).

See Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 627-8 (1935) (explaining that a
“judicial aid” who acts in an adjudicative capacity “cannot in any proper sense be characterized
as an arm or an eye of the executive”); Weiner v. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958) (upholding
war claims commission over which the President had no power of removal). Morrison is not to
the contrary. The Court there did “not mean to suggest that an analysis of the functions served
by the officials at issue is irrelevant”—only that the functions “must be analyzed in th[e] light”
(continued…)

78
Third, even if the Commission’s ALJs were empowered to exercise the kind of power
that the Constitution requires the President to control, removal would be only one of many means
of control. Free Enterprise acknowledged that one level of for-cause removal was
permissible.234 But two levels of for-cause removal were problematic in that case because
“[n]either the President, nor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer whose
conduct he may review only for good cause, has full control over the Board.”235 As Free
Enterprise observed, the PCAOB had “significant independence in determining its priorities and
intervening in the affairs of regulated firms (and the lives of their associated persons) without
Commission preapproval or direction.”236 Our ALJs are very different, as they merely take the
cases that we assign to them after we initiate an administrative proceeding, and every one of their
decisions can be revisited in the course of our de novo review. Nor are we even required to
delegate functions to ALJs in the first place.237
Fourth, unlike the structure of the PCAOB, the ALJ system is not novel and has been in
place for over 70 years. The Court emphasized in Free Enterprise that “‘[p]erhaps the most
telling indication of the severe constitutional problem with the [PCAOB] is the lack of historical
precedent for this entity.’”238 But the ALJ system and the tenure protections ALJs enjoy have
been in place since the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted in 1946. This system is not an
unusual innovation, but rather a system that has been working effectively for almost 70 years.
Unlike in Free Enterprise, the challengers here are the ones advocating for radical change.
When persons within an independent agency perform adjudicative functions, they are “to be
nonpartisan; and [they] must, from the very nature of [their] duties, act with entire
impartiality.”239 A system in which adjudicators are brought more directly within the President’s

of “whether the removal restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s ability
to perform his constitutional duty.” 487 U.S. at 691.

control could undermine that impartiality. We do not believe such a result is compelled by Free
Enterprise, nor do we believe that it would be wise.240

We also note that the standard for removing Commission law judges differs from the
“unusually high standard” that was applicable to the PCAOB in Free Enterprise. Id. at 503. The
Board members could only be removed for “willful violations of the Act, Board rules, or the
securities laws; willful abuse of authority; or unreasonable failure to enforce compliance.” Id.
This is different from an “ordinary dual for-cause standard,” id. at 502, like the one that governs
ALJs, see 5 U.S.C. § 7521(a).

We have considered all of the parties’ contentions. We have rejected or sustained them
to the extent that they are inconsistent or in accord with the views expressed in this opinion.
