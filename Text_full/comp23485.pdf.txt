Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) alleges:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1.

This litigation arises from a scheme to defraud and misuse client assets in

connection with investments offered through the Aequitas group of companies, founded by
Robert J. Jesenik and based in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Jesenik controls the entire Aequitas
enterprise, the ultimate parent of which is Aequitas Management, LLC (“Aequitas
Management”). Since 2014, Jesenik, together with his longtime chief fundraiser, Brian A.
Oliver, has defrauded investors into thinking that they were investing in a portfolio of trade
receivables in the healthcare, education, transportation, or consumer credit sectors. In reality,
Jesenik, Oliver, and—after he joined Aequitas in early 2015, former Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Operating Officer, N. Scott Gillis—used the vast majority of investor funds to repay prior
investors and to pay the operating expenses of the Aequitas enterprise, which far exceeded the
fees Aequitas’s affiliated entities told investors they would charge for managing the investments.
2.

Jesenik and Oliver raised funds primarily by issuing promissory notes through

Aequitas Commercial Finance, LLC (“ACF”), an entity wholly owned by Aequitas Holdings,
LLC (“Aequitas Holdings”), and through promissory notes and other interests issued by a series
of Aequitas-affiliated investment funds (the “Aequitas Funds”). The manager of ACF is
Aequitas Capital Management, Inc. (“ACM”) and the manager of the Aequitas Funds is Aequitas
Investment Management, LLC (“AIM”). Aequitas Management, Aequitas Holdings, ACF,
ACM, and AIM are referred to collectively as the “Entity Defendants.”
3.

The ACF notes were typically offered on one to four year terms with interest rates

generally between 5 and 15 percent. According to its financial records, ACF appears to have
been profitable from 2011 to 2013. However, in May 2014, Corinthian Colleges (“Corinthian”),
a for-profit education provider, whose receivables made up 75% of the receivables owned by
ACF, defaulted on its obligations to ACF, exacerbating the significant cash flow shortages of
ACF and its parent, Aequitas Holdings. By at least July 2014, Jesenik and Oliver knew that
redemptions and interest payments to prior investors were being paid primarily from new
COMPLAINT

Page 3 of 30

investor money in a Ponzi-like fashion, and that very little investor money was being used to
purchase trade receivables. The cash flow shortages at ACF and Aequitas Holdings continued
with increased severity through 2015.
4.

Rather than change the business to reduce expenses or increase operating income,

Jesenik and Oliver decided to cover the cash shortfall – and continue paying the growing
expenses of the enterprise, including their own lucrative salaries, a private jet and pilots, and
dinners and golf outings for prospective investors – by raising funds from new investors and
convincing prior investors to reinvest. Between January 2014 and January 2016, they raised
approximately $350 million through ACF and the Aequitas Funds.
5.

However, they never disclosed to investors that: (1) ACF and Aequitas Holdings

were effectively insolvent; (2) the vast majority of investor funds was not used to purchase trade
receivables but instead to pay redemptions and interest to prior investors and to pay for operating
expenses; and (3) only a fraction of the notes issued by ACF and the Aequitas Funds were
backed by trade receivables. ACF and the Aequitas Funds also sent out quarterly updates to
investors, approved by Jesenik and Oliver and with financial information approved by Gillis,
falsely stating in 2015 that ACF was using investor money primarily to purchase receivables. By
the end of 2015, ACF owed investors $312 million and had virtually no operating income to
repay them.
6.

ACF made itself look financially viable by keeping an intercompany loan to its

parent company, Aequitas Holdings, on its books that it counted as its largest asset even though
Jesenik, Oliver and Gillis knew that Aequitas Holdings did not have the assets to pay ACF back.
By the beginning of 2016, the balance on the loan exceeded $180 million and the Aequitas
enterprise began to collapse. ACF announced it could no longer meet its obligations to investors,
and the Aequitas companies announced layoffs of approximately 80 of their 120 employees. In
early February 2016, they hired a consulting firm to conduct an orderly wind-down of the
business.

Defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933

(“Securities Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) in connection with the offer and sale of securities issued
by ACF and the Aequitas Funds. ACM and AIM, the Defendants responsible for managing ACF
and the Aequitas Funds, also breached their fiduciary duties by misusing millions of dollars in
client assets.
JURISDICTION, VENUE AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT
8.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d) and

22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b),77t(d) and 77v(a)]; Sections 21(d), 21(e) and 27
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]; and Sections 209(c), 209(d) and

Defendants, directly or indirectly, have made use of the means and

instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails in connection with the acts, transactions,
practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
10.

Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15

U.S.C. § 77v(a)], Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa], and Section 214 of the
Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14] because acts and transactions constituting violations alleged

RELATED ENTITIES
20.

The Aequitas Funds are a number of Aequitas-affiliated entities, managed by

AIM, that raise money from investors through the issuance of notes. Investor money is pooled
within each Aequitas Fund and then used to invest directly or indirectly in trade receivables. In
2015, the majority of money raised through the Aequitas Funds was raised by Income
Opportunity Fund II, LLC (“IOF II”).
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
A. Aequitas’s Organizational Structure
21.

The Aequitas group of companies was founded by Jesenik in 1993. Over the

years, the Aequitas enterprise has established a complicated organizational structure that
currently involves approximately 75 active entities. The entity at the top of that structure is
Aequitas Management, which is majority owned by Jesenik, Oliver, and Gillis. Aequitas
Management has sole control over, and an 84% ownership interest in, Aequitas Holdings, which
is the sole owner and member of ACF and sole shareholder of ACM. ACM is the manager of
ACF and the sole owner and member of AIM, the manager of and registered investment adviser
to the Aequitas Funds.
22.

ACF and the Aequitas Funds, which hold themselves out as engaged primarily in

the business of investing in securities related to the purchase and financing of trade receivables,

are the primary vehicles through which Jesenik and Oliver raise investor funds. ACM is the
primary operating entity of the Aequitas group of companies and, together with another whollyowned subsidiary of Aequitas Holdings, pays the majority of the overhead, payroll, and other
operating expenses of the enterprise. ACM is funded through management fees charged to ACF
and to the Aequitas Funds, through AIM, and is also funded—increasingly during 2014 and
2015—by investor money from ACF and the Aequitas Funds cycled through Aequitas Holdings.
B. ACF and the Private Note Program
23.

Since its inception in 2003, ACF has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from

thousands of investors through the issuance of promissory notes, referred to at ACF as the
“Private Note Program.” As of December 31, 2015, approximately $312 million in ACF notes
were outstanding to more than 1,500 investors. ACF offers and sells notes both directly to
investors and through registered investments advisers (“RIAs”), many of which are owned in
part by Aequitas Holdings.
24.

The notes issued by ACF typically had terms of one to four years with annual

interest rates ranging between 5% and 15%, with a weighted average interest rate of
approximately 10%. Interest was generally either paid monthly or quarterly, or automatically
reinvested in ACF notes, depending on the agreement with the particular investor.
25.

During 2014 and 2015, ACF investors were generally provided a private

placement memorandum (“PPM”) dated November 2013. Jesenik had ultimate approval
authority over the disclosures contained in the PPM and the distribution of the PPM to investors.
26.

The ACF PPM states that funds raised through the Private Note Program will be

used to “engage in various specialty financing transactions, to provide senior and junior debt and
equity funding for the benefit of its affiliates and its related investment programs and to repay
previously issued [Private] Notes.” The PPM identifies five specific uses of Private Note
Program proceeds: (1) funding or financing the purchase of student loan receivables; (2) funding
or financing the purchase of healthcare receivables; (3) funding or financing the purchase of
other receivables and loan portfolios; (4) engaging in other debt transactions and equity
COMPLAINT

Page 8 of 30

investments in third party private credit strategies; and (5) providing working capital and
operating lines of credit to ACF affiliates. Investors were told that the ACF notes were secured
by all personal property of ACF.
27.

The PPM further states:
ACF generally pays the principal and interest of [the Private Notes] from the
proceeds from repayments of loans, leases, subordinated debt investments and
similar assets of [ACF] and sales of [ACF] assets. From time to time, the
Company may use proceeds of the sale of [Private Notes] to repay the principal
and interest of previously issued [Private Notes] due principally to the illiquid
nature of many of [ACF’s] investments and to [ACF’s] ongoing efforts to reduce
its weighted average cost of capital by, in part, replacing [Private Notes] bearing
higher interest rates with [Private Notes] bearing lower interest rates.

28.

In addition to the PPMs provided to investors at the time of their initial

investment, quarterly updates were sent to investors and potential investors or their RIAs
describing the financial performance, assets, and uses of investor funds for ACF and the
Aequitas Funds. Jesenik and Oliver approved the content and distribution of the quarterly
updates in 2014 and 2015, and Gillis approved the financial information included in the updates
in 2015. Gillis also approved the financial statements of the Aequitas enterprise in 2015,
including audited financials for 2014, and was aware that ACF’s financials were provided to
potential investors or their RIAs.
29.

In 2014 and 2015, Oliver met with prospective investors and RIAs who

recommended the Private Note investment to their clients, oversaw the distribution of PPMs to
prospective investors by investor relations staff, and sometimes personally sent PPMs and other
offering materials to prospective investors.
C. The Aequitas Funds and Income Opportunity Fund II
30.

In addition to raising funds through ACF, the Aequitas group of companies offers

and sells notes issued by the Aequitas Funds, which are managed by AIM. The largest Fund by
notes outstanding as of December 2015 was IOF II with $101.5 million.
31.

The PPMs for the Aequitas Funds state that investment proceeds will be used for

the direct or indirect purchase of trade receivables. The PPM for IOF II, for example, states that
COMPLAINT

7

Case 3:16-cv-00438-PK

Page 9 of 30

proceeds will be used to invest, directly or indirectly, in a portfolio of receivables in various
sectors, including healthcare, education, transportation, and consumer credit. The IOF II PPM
also states that proceeds may be used to make loans to ACF, to be secured by the assets of ACF,
for the purpose of investing in receivables. Jesenik had ultimate approval authority over the
disclosures contained in the Aequitas Funds PPMs, including the IOF II PPM, and the
distribution of the PPMs to investors.
32.

As with the Private Note Program, in 2014 and 2015, Oliver met with prospective

investors and RIAs who recommended investment in the Aequitas Funds to their clients and
oversaw the distribution of PPMs to potential investors by Aequitas investor relations staff.
33.

In addition to the PPMs provided to investors at the time of their initial

investment, quarterly updates were sent to investors and potential investors or their RIAs
describing the financial performance, assets, and uses of investor funds for the Aequitas Funds.
Jesenik and Oliver approved the final content of quarterly updates for the Aequitas Funds in
2014 and 2015 and authorized them for distribution. In 2015, Gillis approved the financial
information stated in the quarterly updates for the Aequitas Funds, including the total assets held
by the particular Fund for which the update was prepared and a breakdown by category of the
assets held within the Fund.
D. ACF’s Operations and Performance Prior to 2014
34.

According to ACF’s consolidated audited financial statements, ACF was

profitable from 2011 through 2013. The largest category of assets on ACF’s balance sheet at the
end of 2013 was $215.1 million in trade receivables. At the end of 2013, ACF’s receivables
business was heavily concentrated in education loan receivables that one of ACF’s subsidiaries,
Campus Student Funding, LLC (“CSF”), purchased from Corinthian.
35.

Pursuant to agreements with Corinthian, CSF purchased pools of student loan

receivables at a discounted value. The receivables purchased from Corinthian were subject to
recourse agreements that required Corinthian to buy back from CSF the full value of any student
loans that became delinquent by 90 days. Of the $215.1 million in receivables on ACF’s balance
COMPLAINT

Page 10 of 30

sheet at the end of 2013, $153.5 million were loans purchased from Corinthian that were subject
to recourse agreements.
E. ACF’s Deteriorating Financial Condition in 2014 and 2015
36.

Through CSF, ACF received recourse payments and other fees from Corinthian

on a monthly basis. In 2014, however, Corinthian was suffering serious financial difficulties.
While ACF received between $4.7 million and $7.1 million a month from Corinthian for the first
five months of 2014, in June 2014 Corinthian failed to make a $4.8 million payment due in
default of its agreement with CSF. Corinthian has made no recourse payments to CSF since its
default in June 2014, and on May 4, 2015, Corinthian filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Without Corinthian’s recourse payments, CSF has been forced to engage in collection efforts
directly from borrowers.
37.

Prior to Corinthian’s default, ACF already relied heavily on raising investor funds

to meet its weekly cash obligations. The loss of income from Corinthian heightened ACF’s cash
crunch and made it even more dependent on investor funds to meet obligations, including
redemptions and interest payments to prior investors.
38.

Aequitas executives, including Jesenik and Oliver through 2014 and 2015 and

Gillis in 2015, received internal cash models and projections on a daily basis that showed the
severity of ACF’s cash issues. Jesenik frequently discussed the cash models and projections
with the Aequitas Treasury Manager who prepared the models and projections.
39.

According to the cash models and projections prepared at the end of April 2014

(before Corinthian’s default), ACF projected sufficient cash to meet obligations for two weeks.
Included in those projections was $6.4 million of monthly cash inflows from Corinthian. By the
end of June 2014 (after Corinthian’s default), projected cash inflows from Corinthian were
removed and Treasury projected a cash shortfall of $3.1 million for the next week. According to
internal projections prepared on July 18, 2014, ACF estimated that it was more than $200,000
short of cash to meet its current obligations and had a cash shortfall of $19.1 million for the
coming two weeks.

Page 11 of 30

Although the then CFO had warned Jesenik face-to-face on several occasions in

2014 of the need to reduce operating expenses in light of ACF’s cash issues, Jesenik and Oliver
satisfied projected cash shortfalls, including for redemptions requested by prior Private Note
investors, not by reducing operating expenses, but primarily by raising investor funds, contrary
to their material representations in the PPM.
41.

Jesenik and Oliver began to issue short-term ACF notes at high interest rates to

attract new investors. Between July 18, 2014 and November 28, 2014, ACF raised $23.7 million
from the issuance and sale of 67 notes with 6-month terms and interest rates of primarily 1112%. In late 2014, ACF began offering 1-year notes at 15% interest, and Jesenik and Oliver also
began to raise money through the offer and sale of notes issued by IOF II.
42.

By 2015, the financial situation for the Aequitas companies was dire. The 67 6-

month notes issued by ACF between July and November 2014 came due between January and
May 2015, further exacerbating ACF’s cash crunch. Indeed, by at least April 2015, Oliver
confirmed to certain investors that ACF could not meet their redemption requests on a timely
basis. ACF’s cash shortage was well known to Jesenik, Oliver, and Gillis, all of whom received
cash models and projections sent by Treasury to them on a daily basis during 2015.
43.

ACF and Aequitas Holdings both had significant operating losses in 2014 and

2015. According to the companies’ financial records, in 2014, Aequitas Holdings lost
approximately $22.2 million, including a $15.3 million loss for ACF. In 2015, Aequitas
Holdings lost approximately $46.7 million, including a $19.5 million loss for ACF.
F. ACF and the Aequitas Funds Have Raised Investor Money Through Fraud Since 2014
44.

Despite ACF’s deteriorating financial condition, Jesenik and Oliver, with Gillis’s

knowledge in 2015, continued to raise funds from new investors and convincing prior investors
to reinvest. Defendants knowingly or recklessly engaged in a scheme to defraud investors in
ACF and the Aequitas Funds. Further, ACF and Jesenik knowingly or recklessly made false and
misleading statements, and material omissions of fact to investors.

Page 12 of 30

Between January 2014 and January 2016, approximately $350 million was raised

from investors through ACF and the Aequitas Funds. The representations made to investors in
ACF and the Aequitas Funds were materially false and misleading for several reasons.
1. The Insolvency of ACF and the Aequitas Enterprise Was Concealed from
Investors
46.

Jesenik, Oliver and Gillis, through the Entity Defendants, did not disclose the

increasing insolvency of ACF and Aequitas Holdings. Instead they acted to conceal the
insolvency of the companies through an intercompany loan from ACF to its parent, Aequitas
Holdings (the “Holdings Note”). ACF counted the Holdings Note on its books as one of its most
valuable assets. As such, Jesenik, Oliver and Gillis knew that its collectability was essential for
the solvency of ACF and the entire Aequitas enterprise.
47.

At the beginning of 2014, the Holdings Note had an outstanding balance of $78.8

million. That increased to $120.9 million by the end of 2014. By the end of 2015, the Holdings
Note had a balance of $180.3 million and was the largest single asset on ACF’s books.
48.

The Holdings Note was used primarily as a means of moving cash from ACF to

Aequitas Management, ACM, and another wholly-owned Aequitas subsidiary, to cover the
operating expenses of the Aequitas enterprise. Those expenses, which far exceeded the amount
of ACM’s and AIM’s management fees, included a private jet, dinners and golf outings with
potential investors and RIAs, the opening of a new office location in New York City, the
renovation of Aequitas’s headquarters in Lake Oswego, and large compensation obligations to
Aequitas employees—the largest of which were Jesenik, Oliver and Gillis’s own. Jesenik
received a salary of $685,000 with a bonus target of 100% of his salary; Oliver received a salary
of $350,000 with a bonus target of 100% of his salary; and Gillis received a salary of $400,000
with a bonus target of 100% of his salary.
49.

ACF’s ability to pay its investors depended on Aequitas Holdings’ ability to pay

ACF. Yet, Aequitas Holdings lost $22.2 million in 2014 and did not have sufficient assets to act

COMPLAINT

11

Case 3:16-cv-00438-PK

Page 13 of 30

as collateral for its debt to ACF. Aequitas’s Controller frequently prepared collateral analyses
that set forth the value of the assets held by Aequitas Holdings as compared to the balance of the
Holdings Note. Those collateral analyses were prepared and presented to Aequitas executives,
including Jesenik and Oliver throughout 2014 and 2015, and Gillis throughout 2015.
50.

According to the collateral analysis for March 2014, Aequitas Holdings was short

about $20 million in assets compare to what it owed to ACF. The gap between what Aequitas
Holdings owed ACF and the assets it had to meet its obligations grew significantly through 2015.
As a result, Aequitas Holdings, and therefore ACF, was becoming more and more insolvent.
51.

According to the collateral analysis for the end of February 2015, Aequitas

Holdings had $67.0 million in assets available as collateral for the $127.6 million outstanding on
the Holdings Note. The collateral analysis for the end of June 2015 showed that assets available
as collateral decreased to $65.3 million and the outstanding balance on the Holdings Note
increased to $147.4 million. At the end of October 2015, $69.8 million in assets was available as
collateral and the Holdings Note balance had soared to $169 million, a nearly $100 million
shortfall.
52.

Jesenik, Oliver and Gillis knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Aequitas

Holdings did not have sufficient assets to pay back the Holdings Note. The collateral analyses
showing the growing shortfall were presented and discussed at regularly-held Asset-Liability
meetings and meetings of the Office of the Chief Investment Officer, both of which were led by
Jesenik and attended by Oliver and Gillis. In addition, Jesenik and Gillis held specific meetings
to discuss the collateral reports with Finance staff throughout 2015.
2. Investors Were Not Told That Their Investments Were Used Primarily to Repay
Prior Investors or Cover Aequitas’s Operating Losses
53.

Jesenik and Oliver, with Gillis’s knowledge in 2015, also raised funds from

investors in ACF and the Aequitas Funds without disclosing that funds raised were primarily

COMPLAINT

12

Case 3:16-cv-00438-PK

Page 14 of 30

used to either repay prior investors or to fund growing operating losses of the Aequitas
companies.
54.

The PPMs for the Aequitas Funds stated that the funds raised would be used for

the direct or indirect purchase of trade receivables. The ACF PPM also disclosed that one of the
primary uses of investor funds was to finance the purchase of trade receivables. However, in
2014 only approximately $44 million (or about 25%) of the money invested in ACF and the
Aequitas Funds was used to purchase trade receivables or other income-generating assets. In
2015, only about $15 million (or 8%) of the money invested in ACF and the Aequitas Funds was
used to purchase trade receivables or other income-generating assets.
55.

Indeed, by at least July 2014, instead of using investors’ money to invest in the

portfolio of trade receivables as described in the offering materials, Jesenik and Oliver were using
the vast majority of investor money to cover redemptions and interest payments to prior investors
and to pay the operating expenses of the entire Aequitas enterprise.
56.

Such uses of investor money were contrary to the disclosures provided to

investors in the Aequitas Funds. Although ACF’s PPM included a disclosure that the proceeds
from the issuance of new notes “may” be used to repay the principal and interest due to prior
investors, Jesenik and Oliver, with Gillis’s knowledge in 2015, deceived investors into believing
that such payments were only made “from time to time” as disclosed in ACF’s PPM. In reality,
at least by July 2014, ACF was generally paying the principal and interest due on prior ACF
notes from the proceeds of investments, in a Ponzi-like fashion.
57.

In addition to the PPMs, the quarterly updates provided to investors and

prospective investors in ACF and the Aequitas Funds from 2014 through the second quarter of
2015 failed to disclose that the primary use of investor funds was to repay prior investors or to
cover the operating expenses of the Aequitas enterprise. However, in a quarterly update
prepared for the third quarter of 2015, ACF acknowledged that “ACF uses proceeds from Private
Note primarily to repay prior investors.” Yet that quarterly update was not even prepared until
late December 2015.

Jesenik, Oliver and Gillis knew or were reckless in not knowing that the

information provided to investors failed to disclose that the primary use of investor funds was to
repay prior investors or to cover the operating expenses of the Aequitas enterprise.
3. Defendants Misrepresented the Underlying Trade Receivables Available as
Collateral for the Notes Issued by ACF and the Aequitas Funds
59.

Jesenik and Oliver since 2014, with Gillis’s knowledge since 2015, further

defrauded investors by misrepresenting the underlying trade receivables available as collateral
for the notes issued by ACF and the Aequitas Funds.
60.

The ACF quarterly updates for the first and second quarters of 2015 listed ACF’s

trade receivable assets with a book value in excess of $200 million, without disclosing that only
a fraction of that value was supported by actual receivables as collateral. In fact, as Jesenik,
Oliver and Gillis knew, the vast majority of those trade receivable assets were already pledged as
security for lines of credit with financial institutions or other senior debt issued by various
Aequitas entities.
61.

Indeed, in the quarterly update prepared for the third quarter of 2015, ACF

acknowledged that only 13% of its assets (about $42 million) were collateralized by trade
receivables. Yet, as described above, that quarterly update was not even prepared until late
December 2015.
62.

In addition to the misrepresentations made to ACF investors, Jesenik, Oliver and

Gillis also misrepresented the underlying trade receivables available as collateral for the notes
issued by the Aequitas Funds. During 2015, the primary Aequitas Fund through which Jesenik
and Oliver raised new investor money was IOF II, which raised a total of $70 million during
2015 alone.
63.

Rather than using the IOF II investor proceeds for the direct or indirect purchase

of trade receivables, as represented in the IOF II PPM, Jesenik, Oliver and Gillis, through AIM
as the manager of IOF II, transferred the proceeds directly to ACF and then used the money

COMPLAINT

14

Case 3:16-cv-00438-PK

Document 1

Filed 03/10/16

Page 16 of 30

either to pay redemptions and interest to prior investors or to continue paying the operating
expenses of the entire enterprise with no documented note or loan agreement between ACF and
IOF II. Jesenik and Oliver continued this practice during the summer and fall of 2015, with
Gillis’s knowledge, over the objections of an IOF II portfolio manager who told Jesenik and
Oliver that these uses of money were not allowed by the IOF II PPM.
64.

The transfer of funds raised through IOF II to ACF resulted in a balance due from

ACF to IOF II. At the end of each month, Aequitas executives, including Jesenik, Oliver and
Gillis, met to account for the balance due through the issuance of notes by ACF subsidiaries to
IOF II.
65.

According to the IOF II PPM, the notes issued by the ACF subsidiaries were to be

collateralized by unpledged trade receivables owned by the subsidiaries. To that end, the
executives, including Jesenik, Oliver and Gillis, reviewed a report prepared by Treasury called
the “Product Menu,” which showed the value of the receivables then owned by ACF’s various
subsidiaries and what portion, if any, of those receivables had already been pledged as collateral
on other obligations. Beginning in early 2015, notes were issued by ACF subsidiaries to IOF II
despite the fact that the Product Menu showed that the subsidiaries no longer held sufficient
trade receivables with which to collateralize the notes.
66.

Between August and December 2015, according to the Product Menu, the

collateral shortfall for notes issued by the subsidiaries, including notes issued to IOF II,
ballooned from $2 million to $54 million. Yet Jesenik and Oliver continued to raise funds from
IOF II investors through the middle of January 2016, telling investors the funds were being used
to acquire trade receivables.
67.

On at least two occasions during 2015, Oliver also raised additional funds for

ACF by selling notes issued by an ACF subsidiary to high net worth investors backed by trade
receivables that had already been used to secure a note to IOF II, further contributing to the
collateral shortfalls on the notes to IOF II. A portfolio manager of IOF II objected to Jesenik and

Oliver about this improper use of the collateral belonging to IOF II, but Jesenik and Oliver
disregarded his objection.
68.

Jesenik, Oliver and Gillis knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that investors

were not told that there were insufficient underlying trade receivables available to secure the
notes issued by ACF and the Aequitas Funds.
G. ACF’s Efforts to Avoid Registration As An Investment Company Demonstrate Its
Insolvency
69.

In late 2014, Aequitas negotiated with a major financial institution for a line of

credit for one of ACF’s subsidiaries. As part of the agreement to provide the line of credit, the
financial institution required ACF to provide a legal opinion in July 2015 that ACF was not
required to register with the Commission as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”).
70.

Jesenik and Oliver, and Gillis in 2015, knew, or were reckless in not knowing,

that registration as an investment company would have significant additional consequences for
Aequitas’s business. In November 2014, Aequitas’s former CFO gave a presentation to Jesenik,
Oliver, and others stating that registration as an investment company would restrict ACF’s ability
to make intercompany loans (such as the Holdings Note) and eliminate Aequitas’s practice of
investing in RIAs that recommend Aequitas investments.
71.

In obtaining a legal opinion, ACF relied upon an exemption from registration as

an investment company that required 55% of ACF’s overall business to consist of a type that
qualifies under the exemption. The Holdings Note was the largest asset on ACF’s balance sheet
that did not qualify for the purposes of that exemption. The value of the Holdings Note as
reflected on ACF’s balance sheet began to cause Jesenik and Aequitas’s prior CFO significant
concern in 2014 that ACF would fall below the 55% threshold in qualifying assets.
72.

As part of ACF’s efforts to show that it was exempt from registration under the

Investment Company Act, Gillis instructed an ACF Finance employee to prepare an internal
report in July 2015 that totaled ACF’s qualifying versus non-qualifying assets. The Holdings
COMPLAINT

16

Case 3:16-cv-00438-PK

Document 1

Page 18 of 30

Note was valued at approximately $147 million on ACF’s balance sheet as of the end of June
2015 and resulted in a 49% ratio of qualifying assets.
73.

Gillis instructed the employee to use the “fair value” of the Holdings Note rather

than the balance of the debt owed as reflected on ACF’s balance sheet. To determine the “fair
value” of the debt owed, Gillis told the employee to use the collateral reports, prepared by
Aequitas’ Controller, which identified the amount of collateral held by Aequitas Holdings that
could be used to satisfy its debt to ACF. The collateral report for June 30, 2015 reflected a total
of $65 million in available collateral at Aequitas Holdings—$82 million less than the balance
owed by Aequitas Holdings as valued on ACF’s balance sheet. At Gillis’s instruction, the
Finance employee valued the Holdings Note at $65 million (rather than $147 million as set forth
on ACF’s balance sheet) in his internal report, which raised the ratio of qualifying assets from
49% to 56%.
74.

In July 2015, Gillis signed a certification for the purpose of obtaining a legal

opinion regarding ACF’s qualification for an exemption from investment company registration.
The certification stated that ACF held at least 55% in qualifying assets, but failed to disclose that
the value of the Holdings Note had been reduced by $82 million from the amount listed on
ACF’s balance sheet.
75.

Based on Gillis’ certification, ACF’s legal counsel provided an opinion letter to

the financial institution that ACF did not need to register as an investment company. At the
time, Gillis, as well as Jesenik (who regularly met with Gillis to discuss ACF’s qualification for
an exemption), knew that ACF’s books reflected a substantially higher value for the Holdings
Note than what was presented to ACF’s legal counsel to meet the 55% threshold.
76.

The Finance employee discussed with Gillis the fact that the Holdings Note was

listed as an asset on ACF’s books at a value $82 million more than the value that had been used
for the certification to obtain the legal opinion. Gillis said that the value used for the legal
opinion could not be reflected on ACF’s books because recognition of an impairment of that
magnitude would have a massive impact on the solvency of the entire Aequitas enterprise. Gillis

received daily cash models showing that ACF and the Aequitas Funds continued to raise millions
of dollars from investors after he acknowledged that disclosing the “fair value” of the Holdings
Note would have a massive impact on Aequitas’s solvency.
H. Aequitas’ Ongoing Collapse in 2016
77.

By mid-January 2016, it became clear that the desperate efforts of Jesenik, Oliver,

and Gillis to conceal ACF’s true financial condition through the inflated value of the Holdings
Note and to continue raising investor money had failed. In late January 2016, they announced
layoffs of approximately 80 of the enterprise’s 120 employees.
78.

On February 2, 2016, ACF sent a letter to investors informing them that ACF had

been unable to keep pace with redemption requests since November 2015 and that ACF was
meeting with advisors to develop a plan to allow for the liquidation of ACF’s assets “in an
orderly fashion over time, with an objective of continued quarterly distributions to investors.”
ACF informed investors that no redemptions would be paid until a formal plan was in place.
79.

In mid-February 2016, Aequitas engaged a consulting firm to oversee the

liquidation and wind-down of ACF and certain other Aequitas companies.
