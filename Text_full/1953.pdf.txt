PART I
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

The Securities .Act of 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to
investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale by use of the mails or other instrumentalities of interstate com
merce, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit or other fraudulent
practices in the sale of securities. Disclosure is obtained by re
quiring the issuer of such securities to file with the Commission a
registration statement, and related prospectus, containing significant
information about the issuer and the offering. These documents are
available for public inspection as soon as they are filed. In addition
the prospectus must be furnished to the purchaser at or before delivery
of the security. The contents of the registration statement are the
primary responsibility of the issuer and the underwriter; the Com
mission has no authority to dictate or control the nature or quality
of a security to be offered for public sale or to approve or disapprove
its merits or the terms of its distribution.
DESCRIPTION OF mE

REGISTRATION PROCESS

The Registration Statement and Prospectus

.Any security proposed to be publicly offered may be registered
by filing with the Commission a registration statement on the ap
propriate form. The Commission has adopted several such forms
designed to disclose appropriately for the class of issues involved the
types of information prescribed in Schedule .Aof the .Act. In general
these forms must reveal the names of persons who exercise control
and direction of the business enterprise; their security holdings,
remuneration, options, and bonus and profit-sharing privileges; the
character and size of the business; financial statements, certified by
independent accountants; the capital structure; underwriters' com
missions; pending or threatened legal proceedings; and the purpose
to which the proceeds of the offering are to be applied. The pro
spectus constitutes part of the registration statement and summarizes
the more important items of the registration statement proper.
Examination Procedure

The Commission is charged with responsibility of preventing the
sale of securities to the public on the basis of inaccurate or incom
plete information. The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance
examines each registration statement for compliance with the stand
ards of disclosure and usually notifies the registrant by an informal
letter of comment of any material respect in which the statement
apparently fails to conform to these requirements. The registrant is
27990O-G4--2

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

thus afforded an opportunity to file an amendment before the statement becomes effective. In addition, the Commission has power to
issue, after notice and opportunity for hearing, an order suspending
the effectiveness of a registration statement. No such orders were
issued during the 1953 fiscal year.
EffectiveDate of Registration Statement

Because speed in the processing of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission completes its analysis in the
shortest possible time consistent with the public interest.
Congress provided for a lapse of 20 days in the ordinary case between the filing date of a registration statement and the time it may
become effective. The waiting period is designed to provide investors
with an opportunity to become familiar with the proposed security
before it is offered to them. In order to achieve this objective immediately upon the filing of a registration statement the information
therein is made available by the Commission to representatives of
financial news services, financial writers, and newspapers generally,
who disseminate such information to the public.
The Commission is empowered to accelerate the effective date so
as to shorten the 20-day waiting period where the facts justify such
action. In exercising this power, the Commission is required by the
statute to take into account the adequacy of the information already
available to the public, the complexity of the particular financing,
and the public interest and protection of investors.
Time Required To Complete Registration

The median time which elapsed between the filing and the effective
date for the 596 registration statements that became effective during
the 1953 fiscal year was 23 days, divided among the three principal
stages of the registration process approximately as follows: (a) from
date of filing registration statement to date of letter of comment, 12
days; (b) from date of letter of comment to date of filing first material
amendment, 6 days; and (c) from date of filing first amendment to
date of filing final amendment, 5 days.
VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED

The amount of securities effectively registered during the 1953
fiscal year was $7,507,000,000, the second largest amount for any
fiscal year since securities have been registered with the Commission,
the high being $9,500,000,000 in the 1952 fiscal year.! Figures are
presented below on the volume of registrations for each fiscal year
since 1944 and the extent to which these registrations were for cash
sale for account of issuers. More detailed information for fiscal year
1953, including monthly figures, is given in table 1 of the Appendix.
I A discussion of all securities offerings, including issues registered under the Securities Act of 1933and
unregistered issues, appears on pages 115-17of this report, while statistical data thereon appear in tables

Type of Offering

About 64 percent of the securities registered for cash sale for
account of issuers in the 1953 fiscal year were to be sold through
investment bankers pursuant to agreements to purchase for resale.
Over 26 percent were to be sold on a best-efforts basis. The term
"best-efforts" as used here means all offerings through investment
bankers other than through agreements to purchase for resale. The
remaining 10 percent were to be sold directly by issuers to investors.

EXEMPTION

FROM REGISTRATION

UNDER THE ACT

The Commission is authorized under section 3 (b) of the Act to
adopt rules providing exemptions from the registration requirements
for security offerings not exceeding a maximum of $300,000. The
Commission has adopted six types of exemptions of small offerings,
including the exemption provided in new Regulation D made effective
toward the close of the 1953 fiscal year, as enumerated below:
Regulation A. General exemption for small issues up to $300,000 for issuers
(limited to $100,000 for controlling stockholders).
Regulation A-R.
Special exemption for notes and bonds secured by first liens
on family dwellings or commercial property up to $100,000.
Regulation A-M.
Special exemption for assessable shares of stock of mining
companies up to $100,000.
Regulation B. Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights
up to $100,000.
Regulation B-T.
Exemption for interests in oil royalty trusts or similar types
of trusts or unincorporated associations up to $100,000 .
.Regulation D. Exemption for Canadian securities up to $300,000 for issuers
(limited to $100,000 for persons other than issuers).

6

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

For a description of changes made during the year in certain or
these regulations reference is made to the discussion under Changes.
in Rules, Regulations, and Forms appearing below.
Exemption from registration does not carry exemption from the
civil liabilities for material misstatements or omissions imposed by
section 12 or from the criminal liabilities for fraud imposed by section 17~
During the 1953 fiscal year the exemptions most frequently sought
were those provided by Regulations A and B, which call for a brief
disclosure of pertinent information which is far less complete than
that prescribed by the Act for a registered security. Under the re
vised Regulation A, the issuer must file with the nearest regional
office of the Commission, 10 days prior to the offering, a notification
on Form I-A, and a brief offering circular containing certain basic
minimum information, including financial data, which may be un
certified. Under Regulation B an offeror must file with the central
office of the Commission, eight days prior to the offering, an Offering
Sheet containing the prescribed basic information. Any sales literature must be filed in advance of its use.
Exempt Offerings under Regulation A

During the 1953 fiscal year 1,528 notifications were filed under
Regulation A to cover proposed offerings of $223,350,026, compared
with 1,494 notifications covering proposed offerings of $210,672,596
in the 1952 fiscal year. Included in the 1953 totals are 235 notifica
tions covering stock offerings of $38,797,997 with respect to com
panies engaged in the oil and gas business. In addition there were
filed 1,562 amendments and 2,199 copies of sales literature.
For 1,521 of these small offerings, information is available to show
their size, sponsorship, and particulars regarding the underwriting, if
any. Thus, 746 covered offerings of $100,000 or less, 257 over
$100,000 but not over $200,000, and 518 over $200,000 but not over
$300,000. Issuers made 1,287 of the offerings, stockholders 227, and
issuers and stockholders jointly the remaining 7. Less than half,
scattered through all size groups, or 686, were underwritten, mostly
by commercial underwriters who marketed 608. Officers, directors
or other persons not regularly engaged in the underwriting business
handled the remaining 78.
Exempt Offerings under Regulation A-M

During the year five prospectuses were filed under Regulation A-M
covering assessable shares of stock of mining companies having an
aggregate offering price of $199,170. All were filed in the Seattle
Regional Office.
Exempt Offerings under Regulation B-Oil and Gas Securities

During the 1953 fiscal year 126 offering sheets and 31 amendments
thereto were filed with the Commission under Regulation B. These

filings were examined by a specialized Oil and Gas Unit which collaborates with the staff of the Commission generally in the solution

Oonfidential reports oj sales.-As an aid in determining whether
violations of law have occurred in the marketing of securities exempt
under Regulation B, the Commission obtains confidential reports of
actual sales made pursuant to such exemption. During the 1953fiscal
year, 2,389 such reports covering aggregate sales of $1,678,898, were
filed.
DISCLOSURE

PROBLEMS

IN EXAMINATION

PROCESS

Following are a few examples of disclosure problems arising in the
examination of registration statements during the 1953 fiscal year.

Latent deject in seller's title to interests in oil or gas rights.-The
issuer, an individual, filed a registration statement under which he
proposed to offer participating interests in the production of two wells
which were being drilled for the production of gas. The prospectus
stated that the issuer had exclusive drilling rights to certain property
and merchantable title to the gas and petroleum to be conveyed to
purchasers of the interests. It was not disclosed that the issuer had
purportedly acquired the rights to be transferred by assignment from
another person, who held them under an agreement which provided
that neither the agreement nor any privilege thereunder could be
transferred without the consent of the grantor, and that the grantor
had refused to consent to such assignment. In a letter of comment
the Division of Corporation Finance took the position that the prospectus should disclose these facts. Following discussions between
the Division's staff and representatives of the issuer the registration
statement was withdrawn.
Excessive reserve estimates oj oil and gas ojferors.-Separate registration statements filed by an oil company and a gas company were
_alike in that both contained estimates of reserves which appeared to
be unreasonably high on the basis of an analysis made by the Commission's petroleum engineer. The registration statement of the

8

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

crude oil producer, as originally filed, stated the company had an
estimated total of 3,081,516 barrels of crude oil from its present wells,
its undrilled locations, and secondary recovery methods not currently
.in successful operation.
By amendment the portion of reserves
allooable to secondary recovery methods was deleted and the other
.reserves were reduced, showing a revised total estimate of 1,032,189
barrels.
The registration statement of the gas company, as originally filed,
stated that the company had consolidated net natural gas reserves
of 267,276,707,000 cubic feet and natural gas liquid reserves of
2,322,220 barrels.
After receipt of the staff's comments the company
filed an amendment revising those overall natural gas reserves to
134,000,000,000 cubic feet and 848,000 barrels, respectively.
Misleading summaries of earnings.-The
summary of past earnings
is one of the most important items in the prospectus.
In the course
-of its examination the staff makes appropriate inquiry with respect
to all uncertified interim periods in such summaries to determine the
-existenoe of any unusual conditions affecting the propriety of the
presentation and the necessity for inclusion of an appropriate previous
period.
If it appears that a significant decline in earnings may have
occurred, unaudited interim figures to the latest practicable date
.and for the same interim period in the previous year are requested.
In one case the prospectus, as originally filed, included a summary
of earnings for nine fiscal years and a statement that the figures
for the subsequent 2-month period would be furnished by amendment .
..AB a result of staff inquiries the summary of earnings was revised to
-state that estimated net earnings for the quarter ended January 31,
1952 was approximately $1,000,000, compared with a net loss of
between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 for the quarter ended January 31,
1953, before adjustments for refund of prior years' Federal taxes on
income, and between $500,000 and $1,000,000 after such adjustments.
The importance of this disclosure was heightened by the fact that
net earnings in the three previous full fiscal years had dropped from
$15,136,000 to $9,786,000 and then to $7,049,000 successively in those
years.
In addition the summary of earnings was revised to state that
the company's sales for the quarter ended January 31, 1953 approxi
mated $13,300,000 whereas comparable sales for the same quarter in
the preceding five years ranged from a low of approximately
$15,200,000 to a high of approximately $40,400,000.
Inadequate accounting records.-Companies
in the promotional
stage present problems resulting from the indifference of the typical
promoter to the need for adequate accounting records. The following
is an extreme example of this type of situation.
A company proposing to engage in locating, exploring, and pro
ducing mineral ores in a foreign country filed a registration statement,

NINETEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

9

from which financial statements were omitted with an explanation
that the company was new, had not been operating, and had no books.
At the insistence of the staff, financial statements examined by
independent certified public accountants were furnished. These
statements and the accompanying certificate of the certifying ac
countants reflected a contract of the registrant to issue 600,000 shares
to the promoter. They also disclosed that 497,500 shares had been
issued, and that action was being taken to cancel 215,000 shares
because of the failure to deliver title to mineral rights under the
agreement pursuant to which the shares were issued.
Property acquisitions from. promoters in exchange for stock.-The
balance sheet of a corporation in the promotional stage disclosed
that land and construction in progress had been acquired for capital
stock of the registrant, and recorded substantial appraisal increases
of each of these items. The text of the prospectus and notes to the
:financial statements disclosed that the promoters had acquired the
properties at a cost of $257,000. Ten days later they exchanged the
properties for 249,000 shares of $1 par value stock and a few days there
after sold 180,000 of these shares at their cost of $1.06 per chare. The
properties were recorded on the books in the aggregate amount of
$514,750 with offsetting credits of $249,000 to capital stock and
$265,750 to appraisal surplus, reflecting an appraisal made by the
executive vice president of the company. The independent certified
public accountants recited the facts with respect to the appraisal in
their certificate and stated that they were not in a position to renderan opinion in regard to such revaluation. At the request of the staff
the financial statements were revised to eliminate the writeup of the
properties to the extent of the excess over the promoters' cost. The
revised statements were certified, without qualification, as being in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS

During the 1953 fiscal year important changes were made in the
rules, regulations, and forms used in the administration of the Se
curities Act. In all cases the adoption of such changes was pre
ceded by the publication of proposals inviting public comment.
Consideration was given to all suggestions received.
Identifying

Statement

On October 27, 1952, the Commission adopted rule 132 under the
Securities Act of 1933, and a statement of certain related policies
having to do with acceleration of the effective date of registration
statements.
This action was designed generally to provide a means,
consistent with the statutory prohibition against selling effort before
the effective date of the registration statement, for achieving more
widespread dissemination of information during that period and t(}

10

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

further the aim of obtaining prospectuses which are reasonably con
cise and readable.
Rule 132.-This rule permits the use of a brief "identifying state
ment," which is intended for use as a screening device to locate per
sons who might be interested in receiving the proposed form of
prospectus pursuant to rule 131 (the "red herring prospectus") or the
final prospectus. The identifying statement is not intended to be a
selling document. The rule is in the form of a definition of the
terms "sale" and "offer" for purposes of section 5 only. The anti
fraud provisions are not affected.
Among other things, the identifying statement may set forth, in
summary form, the title of the security, and certain other salient
facts regarding the offering. It must state from whom copies of the
prospectus or proposed prospectus may be obtained.
Changes in Rules Providing Exemptions

Revision oj Regulation A.-On March 6, 1953, this regulation was
amended in material respects. One of the principal changes effected
is the addition of a requirement that an offering circular containing
certain minimum information, including financial information, must
be employed in the distribution of securities under this regulation.
This new requirement makes possible more effective enforcement of
the anti-fraud provisions of the statute. The revised regulation
contains an innovation in the Commission's rules providing exemp
tions by permitting the use of limited written advertisements or other
written communications prior to sending the offering circular. This
provision permits persons to obtain inquiries from persons who may
be interested in receiving the offering circular.
Provision is also made in the revised regulation for denying or
suspending the exemption in certain cases, such as where the Com
mission finds that the terms and conditions of the exemption have not
been met or that the offering circular is fraudulent.
The revised regulation exempts offerings by an issuer up to a
maximum of $300,000. However, in computing this amount there
must be included all securities of the issuer and its predecessors and
affiliates currently being offered under this regulation or sold pur
suant to an offering thereunder commenced within one year as well
as all securities sold in violation of the registration provisions of the
Act within one year. Offerings on behalf of anyone person other
than the issuer are limited to a maximum of $100,000 but, subject to
this limitation, a number of persons other than the issuer may offer,
in the aggregate, a maximum of $300,000.
The revised regulation also provides for the filing of semiannual
reports showing the progress of the offering until the offering has been
completed or terminated.

NINETEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

11

Adoption oj Regulation D for Canadian offerings.-on
March 6,
1953 the Commission adopted an exemption from the registration re
quirements of the Securities Act of 1933 for offerings of securities, not
exceeding $300,000 in anyone year, made by Canadian issuers or by
domestic issuers having their principal business operations in Canada.
The recently ratified amendments to the extradition treaty between
the United States and Canada, which are designed to cover fraud
offenses of the type indictable in this country under section 17 (a) of
the Act or under the Mail Fraud Statute, has made feasible the pro
mulgation of this exemptive regulation.
The provisions of this new Regulation D are essentially the same as
those incorporated in the revised Regulation A as described above.
However, in order to give full effect to the civil liability provisions of
the Act, the regulation requires that each nonresident connected with
an offering made thereunder must file a written irrevocable consent
and power of attorney which would authorize the commencement of
'any civil action arising out of any offering under the regulation by
the service of process upon the Commission, which forwards copies
thereof to the appropriate person.
Regulation D requires the filing with the Commission at least 15
days before any offering is made, of copies of a Notification on Form
1-D and an offering circular. If the offering circular is thereafter
revised or amended, copies of the revised or amended circular must
be filed with the Commission.
Amendment oj Rules 314. and 334. oj Regulation B.-Under
rule
314 of Regulation B as previously in effect, no exemption was avail
able under the regulation for any oil or gas interests unless it appeared
that the operating lessee would own an unincumbered 40 percent
working interest in the tract at the conclusion of the sale of the issue
to be offered. The result of the rule had been to require registration
of some very small issues in which no substantial public interest had
been involved, merely because the operating lessee at the conclusion
of the offering would not own a 40 percent working interest in the
tract. Accordingly, the Commission amended the requirement, effec
tive December 12, 1952, to make it inapplicable to issues not in excess
of $30,000, provided the smallest interest separately offered is not
less than $300.
Rule 334 of Regulation B under the Securities Act of 1933, as pre
viously in effect, provided that oil or gas interests involving non
contiguous tracts of land may be included in the same offering sheet
under the regulation only if the interests offered were producing
landowners' royalty interests and if certain other conditions were
met. The purpose of this rule was to guard against investors being
misled through the inclusion in a single offering sheet of interests in

12

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

different tracts which might vary greatly in present or prospectivevalue due to their location with reference to other tracts. However,
it had been found that in certain instances the rule had operated with
unnecessary stringency and had resulted in the filing of separateoffering sheets with respect to nonproducing interests in different
noncontiguous tracts in order to obtain the exemption. Where, for
example, all of the tracts involved are located a considerable distance
from any tract tested or proposed to be tested, there may be no dis
cernible difference in the value or prospective value of the several
tracts and consequently in such a case it appears appropriate to in
clude such tracts in a single offering sheet. Accordingly, the Com
mission amended the rule, effective May 25, 1953, so as to provide
that nonproducing landowners' royalty interests in noncontiguous.
tracts may be included in a single offering sheet where it appears that
all of the tracts have equal possibilities.
Revision oj Regulation A-R.-The
Commission amended, effective
May 25, 1953, Regulation A-R under the Securities Act of 1933, which
exempts from registration under the Act certain notes secured by afirst lien on real estate. The previous exemption was available only
for notes secured by liens on residential property, whereas the re
vised regulation applies to notes secured by liens on either residential
or commercial property. The maximum amount of notes which may
be offered under the revised exemption has been raised from $25,00(}
to $100,000. The revised regulation provides that the principal
amount of each note to be offered thereunder shall not be less than
$500 and the total number of notes on any single property shall not
exceed 125. The revised regulation also provides that the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of all indebtedness secured by all liens on
the property shall not exceed 75 percent of the appraised value of
such property. The revised regulation, like the previous one, does.
not require the filing of any papers or documents with the Com
mission.
Other Changes

Amendment oj Rule 427.-This rule had provided that information
contained in a prospectus used more than 13 months after the effec
tive date of the registration statement should include certified financial
statements as of a date not more than 12 months prior to the use of
the prospectus. That requirement compelled the preparation of
audited financial statements more than once a year in those cases.
where an offering was involved which continued beyond the 13-month
period. The rule was amended effective June 3, 1953, to permit the
use of unaudited financial statements as of the latest practicable
date, and certified financial statements as of the end of the preced
ing fiscal year, if the fiscal year of the registrant has ended within 9o.
days prior to the use of the prospectus. In such case certified financial

Adoption oj Form 8-8.-Qn June 16,1953, the Commission adopted
Form S-8, a simplified form for registration under the Securities Act
of 1933 of securities offered pursuant to employees stock purchase
plans. Many such plans provide an opportunity for the accumula
tion by employees of securities of the employer upon favorable terms
and provide for some form of contribution by the employer for the
purpose of assisting the employee to participate in the plan. In con
sequence, the investment decision to be made by the employee is of
a substantially different character than is involved where securities
are offered primarily for the purpose of raising capital.
The new Form 8-8 is available to companies which file reports
pursuant to sections 13 or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and which have created stock purchase plans providing for
periodic contributions by the employer for the benefit of participat
ing employees. The form may not be used, however, unless partici
pating employees may at any time withdraw at least the cash and
securities representing their contributions, nor may it be used for the
registration of securities offered primarily for the purpose of raising
capital. Registration under the new form involves the filing of a
short prospectus consisting, in the main, of a brief description of the
plan and the securities offered thereunder, and certified financial
statements which include a summary of earnings, a balance sheet as
of the close of the issuer's latest fiscal year and an income statement
for such year. The employer company sponsoring the plan will be
required to deliver with the prospectus a copy of the most recent
annual report to stockholders and, thereafter, to transmit to em
ployees participating in the plan copies of all material distributed
from time to time to stockholders. This material, other than the
prospectus, however, is not deemed to be "filed" under the Act except
to the extent incorporated by reference in the prospectus.
LITIGATION

UNDER THE SECURITIES

ACT

Injunctive Actions

It is sometimes necessary to resort to the courts to obtain compliance
with the Securities Act. Such action is generally taken when it
appears that continued violations and resultant damage to the public
is threatened.
A substantial number of cases requiring injunctive action relate to
oil and gas and mining promotions. A characteristic illegal promotion
was that involved in S. E. O. v. Charles William Grader and Oil
Hunters, Inc? The Commission's complaint charged that a highJ

pressure fraudulent mail. campaign to tens of thousands of persons
throughout the country was being employed in the sale of stock of
Oil Hunters, Inc.; that defendants made references to "200-to-l
profits" realized on investments in successful oil ventures, suggesting
a similar expectation in the purchase of Oil Hunters, Inc. stock; and
falsely stated that the company selected only high class drilling properties which would have a real chance of producing oil and would yield
"king-size, grand-price profits" and that the drilling of a well on the
company's leased properties offered possibilities for the finding of
"gigantic, stratigraphic entrapments of oil" similar in size to the
famed East Texas oil field. The defendants consented to a final
judgment enjoining them from further violating the anti-fraud
provisions of the Securities Act.
S. E. C. v. C. C. Julian Associates, Inc. and Harry Arthur Penn 3
was another oil and gas promotion in which an extensive mail campaign was used. The complaint alleged that the selling literature
being used contained incomplete, ambiguous and deceptive statements
concerning services previously rendered to such persons by the
defendant Penn and the opportunity for recoupment of losses and
for profit through the purchase of the stock of the defendant corporation. A final judgment by consent was obtained.'
Other actions brought by the Commission for injunctions for violation of the Securities Act dealt with various other types of securities.
In S. E. C. v. E. P. Floren 5 the Commission's complaint charged the
defendant with selling shares of Baby Care Pharmacies, Inc. and
Baby Care Institute, Inc. without having a registration statement in
effect, and with making false representations concerning tne source
of the stock, the use to be made of the proceeds, the prices at which
such shares could be resold in the future, and the profits to be expected
from the investment.
A permanent injunction was entered by
consent.
In S. E. C. v. Thomas W. MacKenzie and Automatic Telephone
Dialers, Inc.,6 the defendants were charged with selling MacKenzie's
personally owned stock without complying with the registration provisions of the Securities Act and with making false representations
concerning the ownership of the stock, the proceeds to be received by
the company, the listing of the stock on a stock exchange, the extent
of the development of the product, the existence of contracts for the
use, production and sale of the product, and the experience of the
promoter. The defendants consented to the entry of a preliminary
injunction.

In S. E. O. v. Stanford E. Phillips 7 a judgment was entered by
consent permanently enjoining Phillips, individually and doing
business as Attorneys Messenger and Process Service, from further
violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act in the sale of
promissory notes to finance a messenger service.
The Commission also obtained a final judgment and decree by
consent permanently enjoining Evergreen Memorial Park Association
and Thomas A. Morris,s its president and controlling stockholderfrom violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act. The
defendants had sold cemetery lots in wholesale quantities for investment purposes. To induce these purchases by the investing public,
defendants had undertaken to resell these lots at retail on behalf of
wholesale investors at stated prices which would yield large profits on
said investments within relatively short periods. The court found
that the transactions involved sales of securities in the nature of
"investment contracts" subject to the provisions of the Securities Act.
Defendants were also required by the decree to make good their
previous undertakings to resell the lots of prior wholesale investors
without making any charge for the service and to repurchase nonsalable lots, to deposit specified amounts of money in a perpetual care
trust fund for the maintenance of the cemetery property in accordance
with the requirements of applicable state law and the defendant
corporation's charter and sales agreements with wholesale investors,
to maintain necessary books and records in accordance with accepted
accounting principles, and to submit to the Commission semi-annual
reports showing compliance with the court's decree.
Injunctions were also obtained in several other cases for sales of
securities without registration. Among these are S. E. O. v. R. H.
Rucker and Wabash Oil Company,9 S. E. O. v. Silver Bell Mines 00.,10
S. E. O. v. Francis J. Suendemam,'? S. E. O. v. Magar Home Products

Several actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933 which

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Ninth Circuit affirmed the order of the District Court for the Southern
District of California requiring the defendant to produce certain
books and records in connection with a pending Commission investigation. An application for certiorari was denied. 18
In S. E. O. v. Ralston Purina Oompany, the Commission sought
an injunction prohibiting the company from selling its stock to its
more than 500 employees without registration under section 5 of the
Securities Act. The district court denied the injunction, holding
that such sales were exempt under section 4 (1) of the Act, as not
constituting a public offering, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit affirmed. 19 The Supreme Court reversed the action of the
lower court,20holding that the number of persons to whom an offering
is made is immaterial, that the crucial test is whether the offerees are
persons who "need the protection of the Act," that "employees are
just as much members of the investing 'public' as any of their neighbors in the community."
The opinion concluded with the statement
that "The employees here were not shown to have access to the kind
of information which registration would disclose. The obvious opportunities for pressure and imposition make it advisable that they be
entitled to compliance with section 5."
Participation as Amicus Curiae

Appellate court rulings involving significant interpretations of the
Securities Act were handed down during the :fiscalyear in two cases
in which the Commission participated as amicus curiae. In Blackwell v. Bentsen 21a complaint, which asserted civil causes of action
under section 12 (2) of the Securities Act for fraud, alleged that
defendants had sold plaintiffs 20-acre tracts of purported citrus land
in an 800-acre development in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas together with management contracts pursuant to which defendants
undertook to cultivate and develop the acreage, and to harvest and
market the crop. According to the complaint, defendants had
represented that plaintiffs would be getting into an 800-acre unit
which would be developed uniformly by defendants' citrus experts
for the joint benefit of all investors, that defendants would take care
of everything, and that plaintiffs would "only have to sit back and
reap the dividends." The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
agreeing with the views expressed by the Commission, held that the
complaint alleged sufficient facts to establish that the transactions
involved sales of "investment contracts," which are "securities"
under the Act, and not merely sales of realty. The court ruled, also,
that the alleged uses of the mails to deliver the warranty deeds and

management contracts and to obtain the payments contracted for
were sufficient to bring the case within the purview of section 12 (2).
In Wilko v. Swan,22 a majority of the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, disagreeing with the Commission, upheld a compulsory
arbitration provision in a form agreement between a securities firm
and a customer. The court action brought by the customer against
the securities firm under section 12 (2) for alleged fraud in the sale
of securities, accordingly, was ordered stayed, and the customer's
claim was referred to arbitration. The Commission, as amicus
curiae, supported a petition for a writ of certiorari which was granted
on June 1, 1953.23 The case was pending in the Supreme Court at

PART I1 

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 

1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities transactions on the
organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets. Accordingly
the Act provides for the regulation of such transactions and of matters
related thereto. It requires that information as to the condition of
corporations whose securities are listed on a nat,ional securities .exchange shall be made available to t,he public and provides for the
registration of such securities, such exchanges, brokers and dealers
in securities, and associations of brokers and dealers. It also regulates
the use of the nation's credit in securities trading. While the authority to issue rules regarding such credit is lodged in the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the administration of these
rules and of the other provisions of the Act is vested in the Commission.
REGULATION O F EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING

Examination of Applications and Reports

Applications for registration of securities and periodic reports are
examined by the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance to
determine whether fair and adequate disclosure has been made.
Where examination shows a need for correcting amendments, they
are requested. The results achieved by these examinations may be
illustrated by reference to a few filings reviewed during the 1953 fiscal
year.
A Canadian mining company filed an application for registration
to which were attached as exhibits two engineering reports containing
an optimistic dollar estimate of the value of total future production
based on unacceptable procedures in valuing mineral content per ton
of ore and in estimating reserves. The company had not yet pro
duced any commercial ore but was nevertheless constructing a mill
costing $1,500,000. The stock of the company, which was traded
on two Canadian exchanges, had shown an extraordinary price rise,
apparently resulting from the publication of such engineering reports.
Objections were raised by the staff of the Commission to the reports,
and the company proposed to overcome them by filing an amended
application deleting the reports. However, in view of the previous
widespread dissemination of the information contained in the reports
the company was advised that the amended application should
nevertheless indicate that the conclusions of the engineering reports
were not justified by the exploratory work, should state unequivocally
whether or not commercial ore reserves existed on the property and
state that the construction of a mill under the circumstances would
be contrary to accepted mining practice. The company was un
willing to make these disclosures, the exchange withdrew its certifi
cation of approval and the application was withdrawn.
In an application for the registration of additional shares a registrant
described a merger resulting in the acquisition of the assets of another
company by the issuance of preferred stock of the registrant in
exchange for all of the common stock of such company, which was to be
dissolved and its plant operated as a division of the registrant. The
net assets to be obtained after assumption of liabilities amounted to
$1,667,00U less than the aggregate par value of the registrant's
preferred stock to be issued. The registrant indicated it would
charge off this difference of $1,667,000 to earned surplus. The
registrant was advised that the proposed accounting treatment ap
peared to be inappropriate in the circumstances since it appeared
that the plan was developed primarily for the purpose of acquiring
additional plant. Accordingly the registrant filed an amendment
in which it was stated that the difference would be added to the

NINETEENTH

ANNUAL

21

REPORT

cost of buildings. The registrant stated that the other company was
acquired in order to obtain urgently needed building space and that
the past earnings of the acquired company did not justify capitalization of any part of the consideration as having been paid for goodwill
or for any other intangible. Acceptance of the originally proposed
accounting would have resulted in an understatement of the assets to
be acquired and thereafter in an understatement of depreciation
charges, with a corresponding overstatement of income.
The balance sheet included in an application by an oil company
for registration of its shares showed the stockholders' equity in the
company at $4,365,383. Comparison of this balance sheet with one
as of a year earlier indicated that the property account and capital
surplus had each been increased by some $2,100,000 during the year.
In a letter of comment this apparently unjustified property write-up
was questioned. Thereafter revised financial statements were
prepared by a new firm of certified public accountants in which the
property accounts were restated at more realistic values as of the date
of inception of the company, and depletion and depreciation reserve
provisions and balances were computed on the basis of revised valuations, showing the stockholders' equity at $1,099,571, approximately
one-fourth of the amount shown in the application as originally
filed.
Statistics

of Securities Registered on Exchanges

At the close of the 1953 fiscal year, 2,210 issuers had 3,653 security
issues listed and registered on national securities exchanges. These
securities comprised 2,651 stock issues totaling 3,904,577,424 shares,
and 1,002 bond issues totaling $23,509,748,966 in principal amount.
These figures reflect net increases for the year of 18 issuers, 27 stock
issues, 233,722,158 shares, 38 bond issues, and $2,099,644,615 in
principal amount of bonds over the corresponding amounts at the
close of the 1952 fiscal year. During the fiscal year 71 new issuers
registered securities on exchanges while the registration of all
securities of 53 issuers was terminated.
The following table shows for the fiscal year the number of applications filed under section 12 and of reports filed under section 13 and,
pursuant to undertakings contained in registration statements filed
under the Securities Act, under section 15 (d) of the Securities
Exchange Act:

or admitted to unlisted trading on the regional exchanges during
1952. Of the issues shown, 109 were newly admitted to trading on 1
regional exchange, 22 on 2, 2 on 3, and 1 on 4.
The consolidation of industry into units of national importance
and the growing availability of their shares for trading on both the
N ew York and the regional exchanges have brought about a heavy
concentration of trading volumes in a small proportion of the total
available stock issues. At the close of 1952, 179 stocks listed on the
New York Stock Exchange were also available for trading on 4 or
more of the 8 largest regional exchanges: Boston, Cincinnati, Detroit,
Los Angeles, Midwest, Philadelphia-Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and San
Francisco. The dollar volume of stock sales on these 8 exchanges
during 1952 was reported at $1,323,000,000 or 98.6% of the total on
all 18 regional exchanges. Of this $1,323,000,000, over one-third was
accounted for by 29 stocks available on all 8 exchanges, over one-half
by 79 stocks available on 6 or more of the 8 exchanges, and over twothirds by the entire 179stocks available on 4 or more of the 8 exchanges.
Stock volumes and their percentage distribution on the stock exchanges were shown for the years 1935-51 inclusive by tables and
charts on pages 41-43 of the Commission's 18th Annual Report.

ANNUAL REPORT

Bonds on Exchanges

The New York Stock Exchange is the principal market for bond
trading on the exchanges. The relative proportion of bond volumes
on that exchange has risen over the years, from less than threequarters of the total on all the stock exchanges in 1935 to around
97% in 1952. The course of bond volumes, other than in United
States Government bonds, on the New York Stock Exchange in
recent years has been as follows:

The "face value of bonds listed" excludes United States Government and subdivision issues, amounting, for example, to approximately $79.8 billion United States Government and $1.1 billion State
and City of New York securities as of December 31, 1952. The
annual volumes as shown exclude sales of United States Government
bonds, reported at $46.2 million on the Exchange for the decade, but
include sales in the subdivision issues, of which, however, only the
issue of New York City Transit Unification 3s of 1980 is active on
the Exchange.
Domestic corporation bonds are the principal components of the
amounts shown in the table as listed. These have risen from $16.4
billion face value at the close of 1943 to $19.1 billion December 31,
1952.2
OVER-THE-COUNTER

MARKET

An estimate of the value of stocks traded over the counter in
various categories has been developed by the Commission and is
referred to at page 40 of the 18th Annual Report. Supplementing
this information, it has been estimated that at the close of 1952, some
3,500 domestic issuers whose stocks are traded over the counter and
who reported having or appeared to have more than 300 stockholders,
had outstanding stocks having a value of approximately $28 billion,
divided among $10 billion industrial, $7 or $8 billion bank, $4.5 billion
utility, $4 billion insurance and $1.5 billion finance, real estate and
I

A1l of June 30, 1953, the amount

was $19.6 billion.

miscellaneous. About 500 of these issuers had outstanding stocks in
excess of $10 millions and 34 had stocks in excess of $100 million.
These totals are exclusive of investment companies, stocks admitted
to unlisted trading privileges on stock exchanges and Canadian and
other nondomestic issues.

TRADING PRIVILEGES

ON EXCHANGES

Number of Issues Admitted to Unlisted Trading

Securities are said to be admitted to unlisted trading on the stock
exchanges when the admission to trading is approved by an exchange
without application by or agreement with the issuer. Such admissions are governed by section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act,
whose respective clauses are referred to in the following text and tables.
In the tables, the "Clause I" stocks are those admitted to unlisted
trading prior to March 1, 1934, and they are shown in two categories,
those which are "unlisted only" and those which are also listed and
registered on a stock exchange other than that where they are admitted
to unlisted trading. The "Clause 2" stocks are those admitted to
unlisted trading pursuant to applications by stock exchanges conditioned on an existing listing and registration on some other stock
exchange. The "Clause 3" stocks are those admitted to unlisted
trading pursuant to grants of applications by stock exchanges conditioned upon the availability of information SUbstantially equivalent
to that filed in the case of listed issues. The following table, for
comparative purposes, also shows the number of listed stock issues
on each stock exchange.

Changes in Securities Admitted to Unlisted Trading Privileges

The usual considerable number of notifications of minor changes in
securities admitted to unlisted trading was received during the fiscal
year from the stock exchanges pursuant to paragraph (a) of rule
X-12F-2.
Applications for continuance of trading in unlisted issues after
more important changes than those contemplated under paragraph
(a) of rule X-12F-2 are made under paragraph (b) thereof, and were
limited during the fiscal year to 2 by the American Stock Exchange.
An application with respect to stock of Simpsons, Ltd. was granted
in full, and an application with respect to Arkansas Natural Gas
Corporation successions was granted in part.
DELISTING

OF SECURITIES

FROM EXCHANGES

Securities Delisted by Application

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1953, the Commission
granted 20 applications filed by various national securities exchanges
and issuers of listed securities pursuant to section 12 (d) of the
Securities Exchange Act and rule X-12D2-1 thereunder to strike
securities from exchange listing and registration. The applications
included 12 by exchanges, covering 13 stock issues, and 8 by issuers,
covering 9 stock issues of which 1 was on 2 exchanges. In many of
the cases, the amount of securities available for trading had become so
reduced, by reason of the concentration of holdings in the hands of

30

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

controlling stockholders or the exchange into new issues, as to make
continuation of listing undesirable. In other cases, such as open-end
investment company stocks, exchange trading had become inactive
over the years. Some of the applications by exchanges were based on
the failure of issuers to file reports and their prospective liquidation.
Securities

Dclisted

by Notification

Securities which have been paid at maturity, redeemed or retired
in full, or become exchangeable for other securities, may be removed
from listing and registration on a national securities exchange by the
exchange filing a notification with the Commission to that effect.
Notifications effecting the removal of 132 separate issues were filed
and, since in some instances the same issue was removed from more
than one exchange, the total number of removals, including duplica
tions, was 164. Successor issues to those removed became listed and
registered on exchanges in many cases.
In accordance with the provisions of rule X-12D2-1 (d), the
American Stock Exchange removed 5 issues from listing and registra
tion when they became listed and registered on the N ew York Stock
Exchange.
MANIPULATION

AND STABILIZATION

Manipulation

Provisions to eliminate manipulative practices in the securities
markets are included in the Securities Exchange Act. The Com
mission's analysts continuously watch the tickers of the leading
exchanges and the quotation sheets of the exchanges, newspapers and
other media for unusual market activity and unexplained price
deviations. Activity in the over-the-counter market is examined as
it is reported in a national quotation service. Less obvious changes in
price or volume are revealed by charts which are kept on all securities
which have an actively quoted market.
Investigations are undertaken when unusual price movements
apparently bear no relation to the published news or when unusual
market behavior indicates the probability of manipulative practices.
The Commission's investigations are private in order to prevent any
unfair reflections upon individuals or securities.
As soon as unusual market activity is observed, all the known in
formation regarding the security is re-examined and a decision made
as to the necessity for an investigation. Investigations take two
forms. The "quiz" or preliminary investigation is designed to de
tect and discourage incipient manipulation by a prompt determina
tion of the reasons for unusual market behavior. When the "quiz"
discloses no violations of the anti-manipulative or fraud provisions of

NINETEENTH ~AL

31

REPORT

the securities acts it is closed. If any violations are revealed, the
information obtained in the "quiz" is made available to the proper
division of the Commission or to the appropriate outside agency for
punitive or corrective action. When facts are uncovered which require more intensive investigation, formal orders are issued by the
Commission. In a formal investigation, members of the Commission
staff are empowered to subpoena pertinent material and to take testimony under oath. The following table shows the number of
"quizzes" and formal investigations initiated in the fiscal year 1953
and the number closed or completed during the period:

===WI==U

The markets for securities about to be sold to the public are watched
very closely. In this connection the markets for 1552 issues in the
amount of $225,275,000 offered pursuant to Regulations A and D
under the Securities Act were carefully checked for market grooming. Over 500 other securities having a market value of more than
a billion dollars were kept under special daily observation during the
1953 fiscal year for periods of 10 to 30 days, largely because It public
offering under a registration statement was proposed with the right
to stabilize reserved by the underwriter or issuer.
Stabilization

The Act vests in the Commission the right to regulate stabilizing
practices. The Commission has permitted various stabilizing practices to facilitate the raising of capital. Because of the high manipulative potential inherent in stabilizing operations, however, all such
operations are kept under most careful observation by the Commission.
During the fiscal year stabilization was effected in connection with
registered stock offerings aggregating 29,340,046 shares with an aggregate public offering price of $623,525,000, and bond issues having a
total face amount of $19,644,500. To accomplish this stabilization
460,635 shares of stock were purchased at a cost of $9,429,938 and
bonds having a face amount of $103,500 were bought by the stabilizers.
More than 12,000 reports of stabilizing transactions were received and
examined during the year.

Description of Regulation

Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act provides that every
person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than
10 per cent of any class of equity security which is listed and registered on a national securities exchange, or who is an officer or a
director of the issuer of any such security, shall file with the Commission and the exchange a statement of his beneficial ownership of all
equity securities of the issuer and additional statements Indicating
changes in such ownership. The Public Utility Holding Company
Act and the Investment Company Act contain similar provisions.
Publication of Data Contained in Reports

Recognizing that a vast majority of public stockholders do not
have ready access to the statements filed with the Commission and
the various exchanges, the Commission summarizes and publishes the
data contained in the reports in a monthly Official Summary of
Security Transactions and Holdings which is sold to interested persons.
Volume of Reports Filed and Examined

The number of ownership and transaction reports filed during the
1953 fiscal year increased by more than 1,200 over the previous year.
The volume has steadily grown from 14,972 reports filed during the
1943 fiscal year to 22,333 in 1953.

Unfair Use of Inside Information

For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which
may have been obtained by an insider by reason of his relationship
to his company, Section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 17 (b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 30 (f) of the In
vestment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf of
the issuer of any profit realized by the insider from certain purchases
and sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within
any period of less than 6 months. The Commission is not charged
with the enforcement of the civil remedies created by these pro
visions, which are matters for determination by the courts in actions
brought by the proper parties. The Commission has participated as
amicus curiae in a number of suits instituted under these provisions
where questions of statutory interpretation are involved.
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS
Nature of Proxy Regulation

Pursuant to sections 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12 (e)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20 (a) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 the Oommission has adopted
Regulation X-14 relating to the solicitation of proxies, consents
and authorizations in connection with securities of companies subject
to those statutes requiring the disclosure of certain information at the
time proxies are solicited. The regulation also contains provisions
enabling security holders to communicate with other security holders
when management is soliciting proxies, either by arranging for the
distribution of their own proxy statements or through the inclusion
of their proposals in the proxy statements of management.
Copies of proposed proxy material are required to be filed with
the Commission in preliminary form at least 10 days prior to the date
of the proposed solicitation. Where preliminary material fails to
meet the disclosure standards, the management or other group re
sponsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an
opportunity to avoid such defects in the preparation of the definitive
proxy material.
Statistics

Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1953 fiscal year the Commission received material re
lating to 1,817 solicitations of security holders' proxies as well as
"follow-up" material used in 99 of these cases. These figures show
little change when compared with 1,818 solicitations and the use of
"follow-up" material in 158 instances during the preceding fiscal
year.
Much more detailed information about proxy solicitations has
been compiled on a calendar year basis. The total number of
27990o-ri4---4

34

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

solicitations made in 1952 was 1,803. Nearly 99 percent of these, or
1,776 were made by management and the remaining 27 by nonmanagement groups. Of the proxy statements filed by management
45 included, as required under the regulation, 70 proposals of 29
different stockholders who were not connected with the management.
In 1951 there were 40 such minority stockholder proposals.
The business of electing directors is the purpose for which proxies
are most often sought. In 1952, there were 1,623 stockholders'
meetings where such election was an item of business, and 160
meetings not involving such election, while the 20 remaining solicitations sought consents and authorizations which did not involve
any meeting or any election of directors.

election of directors on which stockholders' action was sought in 1952

REGULATION

OF BROKERS

AND DEALERS
MARKETS

IN OVER-TIlE-COUNTER

Section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires registration
of brokers and dealers who use the mails or instruments of interstate
commerce to effect transactions in securities on over-the-counter
markets. Exemption from registration, however, is provided for
those brokers and dealers whose business is exclusively intrastate or
exclusively in exempt securities. Jurisdiction to deny or revoke
registration is vested in the Commission under section 15 (b) of the
Act; to suspend or expel brokers and dealers from membership in a
national securities association under section 15 A; and to suspend or
expel from membership on a national securities exchange under section
19 (a). In proceedings ordered to determine whether any such sanction should be invoked, the respondent is given notice of the specific
charges of misconduct and afforded opportunity for hearing thereon.
The following tabulations reflect certain data with respect to
registrations of brokers and dealers and administrative proceedings
involving the various sanctions above referred to.

Registration

The problem of registration of brokers and dealers with principal
offices outside the United States raises important questions both with
respect to the enforcement of civil liabilities arising out of violations
of the Act and with respect to the enforcement of sanctions which the
Commission may invoke against such violations. 3 At the year-end
51 nonresident firms were registered, 49 of them being Canadian firms.
Rights arising because of violations may be unenforceable against
non-resident broker-dealers or individual partners in such firms where
it is impossible to obtain service upon such persons. In order to
afford to the Commission and others the same opportunity to enforce
rights or duties against such persons as they have in the case of
resident broker-dealers and resident partners in such firms, the
Commission promulgated rule X-15B-7.4
This rule requires each
non-resident broker or dealer, general partner, and managing agent
to file with the Commission a written irrevocable consent and power
of attorney, designating the Commission as an agent upon whom may
be served any process, pleadings, or other papers in certain civil suits
or actions brought in the United States.
The Commission also adopted four forms, designated as 7-M,
8-M, 9-M, and 10-M, to be used for the filing of irrevocable consents
to service by the various persons subject to the rule.
I The Commission's investigative work with respect to the antifraud provisions of the Acts has included
many investigations of mail and telephone campaigns by Canadian brokers and dealers to sell unregistered
securities to residents of this country. While many of the investigations disclosed gross misrepresentations
and the employment of other fraudulent schemes and devices the enforcement of enmmal penalties against
the wrongdoers was a "catch as catch can" matter. Crimlnal indictments were obtained in many instances
but apprehension and arrest of those indicted was possible only when they could be found within the borders of the United States. However, following prolonged negotiations by our government an amended
extradition treaty between the United States and Canada was ratified by both governments and became
effective on July 11, 1952. The amended treaty permits extradtnon of persons indicted for securities frauds
in this country.

.All but two of the 49 Canadian firms mentioned above filed applications after the adoption by the Commission of Regulation D discussed at page 11, above. Fifteen of these firms became registered
before the close of the year, one withdrew its application after the
Commission had instituted proceedings to deny registration, and two
others withdrew their applications shortly after they had been filed,"
Administrative Proceedings

Four proceedings on the question of denial of registration were instituted during the year. Three of these proceedings were dismissed on
the withdrawal of the applications. In the fourth, the order for proceedings charged that 1. Nelson Dennis had transacted business in violation of law without being registered as a broker-dealer pursuant to section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act, that he had sold unregistered
stock of Ameranium Mines, Limited, in violation of section 5 (a) of
the Securities Act of 1933, and that Dennis was enjoiued under New
York law from the further sale of Ameranium stock. Since Dennis
admitted these allegations, the only question was whether it was necessary in the public interest to deny registration. The Commission's
opinion concluded as follows: "Experience has demonstrated that
promotional appeals to our investing public made from Canada by
means of the mass mailing and telephone techniques have most frequently provided a medium for over-reaching. We must approach
such cases with the utmost caution and, therefore, have searched this
record carefully. However, we find no showing of actual fraud has
been made. We note further that the Ameranium stock distribution
was applicant's first and only venture in the securities business. Applicant has not been charged with any infraction of Ontario's securities
regulations, and since May 2, 1952, he has not engaged in the sale of
securities in the United States. Ameranium has since filed a registration statement with us pursuant to the Securities Act covering the
shares previously sold by applicant in the United States and additional
shares, and this statement is now pending. Moreover, applicant has
stated that, if his application for registration is permitted to become
effective, he will make every effort to comply with Federal and state
requirements, and to that end will retain counsel to advise him with
respect to such requirements. Accordingly, we do not believe that the
public interest requires denial of registration." 6
A total of 45 proceedings on the question of revocation of registration were disposed of during the fiscal year. In 30 proceedings registration was revoked because of the failure of the firms to file financial
reports pursuant to rule X-17A-5, and 6 revocations were based on
_findings of fraudulent conduct .
• After the close of the year registrations of 14 additional firms became effective; denial proceedings were
Instituted against 13 of the remaining applicants. Two of the latter subsequently withdrew their applications .
• Securities Exchange Act release No. 4769(November 20. 1952).

SECURITIES

A..1I/"D
EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Two administrative proceedings decided during the year involved
charges of manipulation of the market in anticipation of the distribution of an offering of stock on the over-the-counter markets. In
proceedings against Floyd A. Allen & Co., Inc., the Commission
found that the respondent and certain of its associates had artificially
raised the price of the outstanding stock of Loven Chemical Company
by publishing bids at successively higher prices and effecting purchases
at such higher prices. Subsequently, respondents sold the new stock
to customers at the raised prices by means of false and misleading statements. The Commission revoked the firm's broker-dealer registration
and expelled it from membership in the National Association of Securi ties Dealers, Ino.'
The other proceeding was brought against R. L. Emacio & Company, Inc. on similar charges. The Emacio firm had negotiated with
Silver Crescent Mining Company for the sale of new stock of that
company. In anticipation of the distribution of the new stock, the
Emacio Company, through its president Emacio and another associate,
acquired control of the market for the old shares and raised the market
for such shares. The Emacio Company then sold the new shares at
the raised prices. The Commission found that in addition to carrying
out this manipulative scheme to raise the price for the purpose of
distributing the new shares at the higher prices Emacio and his associate made many false and misleading statements in the sale of the
stock. The Commission revoked the registration of Emacio & Company and expelled the firm from membership on the Spokane Stock
Exchange."
Broker-Dealer

Inspections

Under section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, which authorizes the Commission to make reasonable periodic, special, or other
examinations of the books and records of brokers and dealers, the
Commission makes inspections to determine whether brokers and
dealers are complying with the requirements of the securities acts.
During the fiscal year, the Commission's regional offices reported on
686 such inspections, 525 of which were inspections of members of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. As has been the
experience in previous years, a substantial number of violations of
the rules and regulations were uncovered. These violations included
noncompliance with the Commission's capital and hypothecation
rules and with Regulation .T prescribed by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System. In a limited number of instances
brokers and dealers were taking secret profits. As in other years,
there were transactions in which the reasonableness of the price
charged to the customer in relation to the current market price was

open to question, and miscellaneous violations in large number which
would be difficult to classify because of their variety.
The Commission does not necessarily take formal action against a
broker or dealer who appears from these inspections to be violating
the Acts. If the violations appear to be inadvertent or the result of
misinformation, the Commission affords the broker-dealer an opportunity to correct his practices if possible or to assure the Commission that he will not persist in them.
Investigations

Investigations of brokers and dealers may result from the inspections, complaints from customers, or information received from sources
such as state securities commissions, securities exchanges and associations, and better business bureaus. After the completion of an investigation, the staff analyzes the evidence developed and where
appropriate recommends that the Commission institute injunctive
action, proceedings to revoke registration or to suspend or expel from
membership in a national securities exchange or association, or reference to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The
following schedule shows the number of such investigations during
the fiscal year.

Reports

Rule X-17 A-5 under the Securities Exchange Act requires brokers

During the 1953 fiscal year, 3,936 reports of financial condition were
filed. These reports are examined and analyzed to determine whether
the broker-dealer was in compliance with the capital requirements
prescribed by rule X-15C3-1. If a broker-dealer is found not to comply, he is generally afforded a reasonable time in which to correct his
financial condition so that it meets the requirements. If he fails to
do so the Commission takes such action as may be appropriate for
the protection of customers.

The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) continued as the only national securities association registered as such

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

year to 3,034 at June 30, 1953 as a consequence of 284 admissions to,
and 200 terminations of, membership. At June 30, 1953 there were
registered with the NASD as registered representatives 35,577 in
dividuals, including generally all officers, partners, salesmen and other
persons associated with or employed by member firms in capacities
which involve their doing business directly with the public. The
number of individuals so registered increased by 2,524 during the
fiscal year as a result of 5,127 initial registrations, 2,079 reregistrations
and 4,682 terminations of registration.
Disciplinary

Actions

The Commission received from the NASD, in the 1953 fiscal year,
reports of final disciplinary action by the Association in 68 cases in
which formal complaints had been filed against members. These
cases fell into three broad categories. The first category included 45
complaints filed against various members on the grounds that they
had not offered to the public, at the public offering price, shares
acquired in an initial public offering. Three of these complaints
were subsequently dismissed on findings by the appropriate committees
that the firms concerned had not violated the Association's rules, as
interpreted by the Association, designed to prevent this practice of
"free riding." In the remaining 42 cases the Committees found
violations by the respondent firms. One of these firms was fined
$500; the others were censured and some were also required to submit
a statement pledging future compliance and observance of the Rules
of Fair Practice.
The second type of case included 14 complaints against members
only on charges of violations of various other rules, 2 of which were
subsequently dismissed on findings that no violations had occurred.
In the remaining 12 cases violations were found as alleged in the
complaints and various penalties were imposed. Five members were
expelled; 3 were suspended for periods of 1, 2 and 3 weeks; and 4
firms were fined an aggregate of $2,310.
The remaining nine disciplinary actions involved complaints against
members as well as their registered representatives.
One such case
was subsequently dismissed on findings that no violations were
involved. In four cases complaints were dismissed against the mem
ber firms; but the registrations of the firms' registered representatives
were revoked. In other cases one firm was fined $1,500 and its
representative $500; another firm was fined $1,000 and its representa
tive $500; another firm was fined $1,000 and the .firm and two of its
representatives were suspended for 30 days. In the last of these
cases fines aggregating $15,000 were imposed upon one firm and five
of its representatives; in addition the registrations of two represent
atives were revoked and one representative was suspended for 2 years.

The decision in this case was appealed to the Commission pursuant
to the provisions of section 15A (g) of the Securities Exchange Act
by Earl L. Combest who was fined $2,500and suspended as a registered
representative for 2 years. At the year-end, the matter was pending
before the Commission.9
The Commission referred to the NASD facts concerning the
business practices of members which tended to indicate possible
violations of NASD Rules of Fair Practice. At the beginning of
the fiscal year there were seven such matters pending before the
Association, and four such cases were referred during the year.
Reports on the disposition of nine cases were received from the Association during the year. In two, formal complaints were filed by the
Association, violations were found and penalties were imposed. The
remaining seven cases were disposed of by informal means, without
formal complaint procedure. Two cases were unreported at the
year-end.
Commission

Review of NASD Disciplinary

Actions

Section 15A (g) of the Act provides that disciplinary actions by
the NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own
motion or on the application of an aggrieved party. The Commission
disposed of three such petitions during the year and at the year-end
two were pending.
Petitions for review in one such case were filed by Geo. J. Martin
Co., which had been expelled from the NASD, and by Irving A.
Shayne and Alfred Shayne, two salesmen of the :firmwhose registrations as registered representatives had been revoked. Alfred Shayne
later withdrew his petition," and the :firm and Irving A. Shayne
failed to perfect their appeals." Accordingly, the three petitions
were dismissed.
Another review arose from the expulsion of Tyson & Co., Inc.
~rom membership and the revocation of the registration as registered
representative of Albert B. Tyson, Joseph Tyson, and Gilbert Parker.
Albert Tyson filed an application for review but failed to perfect it
and accordingly it was dismissed." On review of Parker's petition,
the Commission concluded that he had violated designated NASD
rules and that such violations constituted conduct inconsistent with
just and equitable principles of trade and that the sanction imposed
on him was not excessive or oppressive." The petition was therefore
dismissed.
The other petition disposed of during the year was filed on behalf
of Standard Bond and Share Co. and its president and controlling

from membership for 30 days and Stien's registration as representative
of the firm was suspended for the same period. On findings that the
member and its representative had engaged in business conduct
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade and that the
penalties imposed by the NASD were not excessive or oppressive, 14
the Commission dismissed the petition.
Commission

Review of Action

on Membership

Section 15A (b) (4) of the Act and the by-laws of the NASD provide
that, except where the Commission with due regard to the public
interest approves or directs to the contrary, no broker or dealer
may be admitted to or continued in membership if he or any
controlling or controlled person is expelled or is currently under
suspension from such an association for violation of a rule prohibiting
conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, or is
subject to an order of the Commission denying or revoking his brokerdealer registration, or was a "cause" of any such order of expulsion,
current suspension or denial or revocation. The Commission disposed
of two petitions seeking "approval or direction" pursuant to this
statutory provision during the year and at the year-end two such
petitions were still pending. IS
Such a petition was filed by the NASD for approval of the continuation in membership of Delaware Fund Distributors, Inc. notwithstanding a disqualification arising from action by the Commission
against Van Alstyne, Noel & Co., which controlled Distributors.
The petition was later withdrawn, with notice to the Commission of
the dissolution of Delaware Fund Distributors, Inc., and the proceeding was dismissed."
Another petition was filed by the NASD on behalf of an applicant
seeking to retain membership while employing George T. Anderson
as a controlled person. Anderson had been a partner of Junger,
Anderson & Co. and a "cause" of the order of the Commission revoking that firm's broker-dealer registration. On review of the
record, and after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission
concluded that it was necessary in the public interest to deny the
relief requested and by order disapproved the application."
CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS,

AND FORMS

of clarifying the rules in certain respects and providing certain new

requirements where previous requirements had proved to be inade
quate.
Under the amended rules, the form of proxy must include a spe
cifically designated blank space for dating the proxy. They also
prohibit the solicitation of any undated or postdated proxy or any
proxy which provides that it shall be deemed to be dated as of any
date subsequent to the date on which it is signed by the security
holder.
The previous rules permitted the management of a company to
omit from its proxy material stockholder proposals which are sub
mitted primarily for the purpose of enforcing a personal claim or
redressing a personal grievance against the issuer or its management.
The amended rules also permit the omission of stockholder proposals
submitted primarily for the purpose of promoting general economic,
political, racial, religious, social, or similar causes.
The requirements with respect to showing remuneration in the
proxy statement have been revised generally. Under the revised
requirements, salaries, fees, and commissions may be combined with
bonuses and shares in profits so as to show the aggregate remuneration
for specified persons or groups. The requirements as to showing
deferred remuneration have been made more explicit as to the infor
mation required.
Where action is to be taken with respect to a bonus, profit sharing,
pension, retirement or other remuneration plan or with respect to
the granting or extension of options, information is required to be
given which will show adequately what similar provisions have
already been made for the benefit of directors, officersand employees.
Amendment oj Form lO.-The instructions as to exhibits in Form
10 for registration of securities on exchanges under the Securities Ex
change Act Wereamended, effective December 12, 1952, to simplify the
requirements relating to the filing of copies of options, warrants or
rights under certain circumstances. Since the exhibit requirements of
Forms 8-K and 10-K are keyed to those of Form 10, the amendment
also effected a similar simplification in the filing of exhibits to reports
on those forms.
Amendment oj R'Il1eX-12A-4 and rescission oj Form AN-4.-Rule
X-12A-4, providing an exemption from registration under section 12
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for certain short term warrants,
was amended, effective December 29, 1952, for the purpose of simpli
fying the exemption procedure. The rule as it was previously in effect
required the filing with the Commission of a statement on Form AN-4.
The amendme It substitutes for this requiremen, a provision that the
exchange on which the warrants are to be traded shall notify che
Commission when the warrants have been admitted to dealing. Form
AN-4 was rescinded. The amendment also deletes from the rule a

44

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

requirement, applicable in certain cases, that the exchange's quota
tions of transactions in the warrants and members' confirmations to
purchasers shall indicate that the security subject to the warrants is
neither admitted nor in process of admission to dealing on any
national securities exchange.
Amendment of Rule X-12A-5.-Rule
X-12A-5 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 provides that whenever by operation of law or
otherwise any instrument evidencing a security listed or admitted to
unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange has come
to evidence another security in substitution for or in addition to the
original security, the substituted or additional security shall be exempt
from registration pending the effective registration of, or the granting
of unlisted trading privileges for, such exempted security on the ex
change. Among the securities temporarily exempted under this rule
are new securities, or additional amounts of the original security,
resulting from the reclassification of the original security by charter
amendment or the declaration of stock distributions and stock divi
dends, and securities resulting from reorganization plans. Securities
sold for cash or securities issued under voluntary exchange offers are
not entitled to the temporary exemption provided by this rule.
Previously, transactions on the exchanges in securities temporarily
exempted by this rule could be made only on a "regular way" or
"when distributed" basis because, by its term.s, the rule was applica
ble only to issued securities. The rule was amended, effective March
20, 1953, so that any unissued security m.ay be admitted to "when
issued" trading on a national securities exchange provided that upon
the issuance of such security trading therein would be lawful under
this rule and that all necessary action, other than the filing or record
ing of charter amendments or other documents with the appropriate
state authorities, has been taken to authorize and assure the issuance
of any such security. This amendment makes it unnecessary tor
issuers or exchanges to effect registration uoder Regulation X-12D-3
on Form 2-.J to permit "when issued" trading in such unissued secu
rities. Form 2-J will continue to be used for the registration for
"when issued" trading in certain unissued securities not entitled to
the temporary exemption under rule X-12A-5.
Amendments to Instruction Books for Forms 12-K and 12A-K.-The
Commission adopted certain amendments to the instruction books for
annual report Forms 12-K and 12A-K under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, discontinuing the provisions of those forms which per
mitted companies reporting to the Interstate Commerce Commission
on its Form A to file certain selected schedules of such form with
their annual reports on Forms 12-K and 12A-K, in lieu of filing
complete copies of their Form A reports. The Commission found

NINETEENTH

REPORT

45

that this procedure had been followed by a very limited number
of companies.
Amendment oj rules under Section l6.-During
the 1953fiscal year
the Commission made extensive changes in the rules issued under
section 16 of the Securities Exchange Ac«. These changes were de
signed to clarify and enlarge the requirements relating to the report
ing of transactions by directors, officers and 10 per cent scockholders
and to grant exemptions where experience with the administration of
the section indicated that exemptions were desirable. The changes
made were as follows:
Rule X-16A-l was amended to require holders of options, puts,
calls, spreads and straddles to file the reports required by section
16 (a). Rule X-16A-3 was amended to require any person who is a
member of a partnership which owns securities of an issuer of which
he is an officer, director or 10 percent stockholder to report all hold
ings and all changes in the beneficial ownership of equity securities
of that issuer held by the partnership.
The former rule permitted
the person filing the report to elect whether he should file such reports
or reports reflecting his individual interest only. Rule X-16A-4
was amended in order to clarify the prior rule, and to reduce the
period of time during which the exemptions specified in the rule
were effective from two years to one year. Rule X-16A-8 established
for the first time a complete set of instructions to guide trustees in
filing reports. Rule X-16A-9 is a new rule providing all exemption
for transactions in which the amounts involved are so small that
there appears to be no public interest in requiring reports of the
transactions when they occur. Rule X-16A-IO was adopted in
order to exempt from section 16 (b) those transactions which need
not be reported pursuant to the requirements of section 16 (a).
Rule X-16B-2 was amended to broaden the prior rule governing
distributions of securities by providing that the exemption would
be available for transactions of purchase and sale in the course of a
distribution of a block of securities on behalf of a security holder not
standing in a control relationship to the issuer. The prior rule was
applicable only when the distribution was on behalf of the issuer or
a person standing in a control relationship to the issuer. Rule
X-16B-3 was amended to broaden the exemption applicable to
acquisitions of stock pursuant to a bonus or similar plan so that
nontransferable options might have the benefit of the rule. Rule
X-16B-5 was amended in order to clarify a rule that had been the
subject of many requests for interpretation.
The clarification was
not intended as a change in the substance of the rule.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

LITIGATION

UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Following is a summary of the more significant aspects of the civil
litigation in the courts in which the Commission participated during
the fiscal year.
During the fiscal year the Commission obtained a preliminary
injunction against the broker-dealer firm of J. Arthur Warner and Co.
and others." Defendants were alleged to have obtained the trust
and confidence of customers who were unfamiliar with securities and
finance by falsely representing that the customers would receive
impartial investment advice with respect to the purchase and sale
of securities and that the defendants would at all times act in the
best interests of customers, whereas defendants grossly overtraded
the accounts of the customers for the purpose of taking large commissions and large profits for the defendants, to the great financial
loss of customers.
It was also charged that the defendants, without the knowledge
or consent of customers, arranged for collateral bank loans to finance
the purchase of additional securities for such customers, and induced
the customers to sell high-grade, conservative securities, to withdraw
funds from savings banks, and to sell United States savings bonds,
to entrust the proceeds and funds to the defendants to purchase other
securities on the false representation that they were as safe as government bonds and deposits in savings banks and to purchase specific
securities on the basis of numerous fraudulent representations as to
safety of principal, capital appreciation, and increased income.
At the request of the Commission, the court entered an order
restraining the defendant J. Arthur Warner & Co. Inc. from permitting the withdrawal of capital from the corporation pending the
further order of the court. The Commission asked the court to
notify the customers of the firm, at the proper time, of the manner
in which the affairs of the customers were handled by the defendants
and to give the customers an opportunity to establish any claims
they may have for redress."
Injunction proceedings were also instituted against Lawrence J.
Raymond, Malcolm L. Saunders, and James J. MacKnight,20 partners
of Raymond & Company, a registered broker-dealer. Defendants
organized and became the sole trustees of a Massachusetts voluntary
trust operating under the name of Collective Trading Fund. The
customers of Raymond & Company were induced to purchase shares of
the Fund on the representation that they were purchasing shares of
an investment trust, the assets of which would be invested in sound,
marketable securities and that the Fund was entirely separate from
the partnership of Raymond & Company. Defendants commingled

the assets of the Fund with the capital of Raymond & Company.
The investors were not told that the capital of Raymond & Company
was substantially impaired and that, without appropriating the
assets of the Fund, the broker-dealer firm would be insolvent. Purported dividends were paid to shareholders of Collective Trading
Fund which, the Commission charged, were a return of capital and
not income. Pursuant to the Commission's request a temporary
restraining order was entered and a receiver appointed for Raymond
& Company and defendants were restrained from disposing of the
assets of the Fund. A decree permanently enjoining Saunders
and MacKnight from further violating the provisions of the statutes
was entered and the case was dismissed as to Raymond, who died
during the pendency of the litigation.
Failure to maintain and keep current the books and records as required by the Commission's rules and the failure to permit a representative of the Commission to have access to such books and records
for the purpose of examination led to the filing of a complaint against
Edward H. Martin, individually and doing business as E. H. Martin
and Co., a registered broker-dealer." In addition, the complaint
charged that a report of financial condition required by the Commission's rules and filed by Martin was false and misleading in that it
failed to disclose certain liabilities. Upon motion of the Commission
the court entered a temporary restraining order and appointed a receiver to conserve the assets of the defendant. The defendant failed
to answer the Commission's complaint and a final judgment was
entered upon such default and the receivership continued.
The Commission filed a complaint against W. ECM'leLutts, doing
business as W. E. Lutts & Company," a registered broker-dealer,
charging that the defendant had been soliciting and accepting the
deposit of money and securities from customers and representing that
he was ready and able to accept customers' orders and to make prompt
settlement, without disclosing that his liabilities exceeded his assets
and he was unable to meet his current liabilities. The complaint
further charged that the defendant had not made and kept current
books and records relating to his business as required by the rules of
the Commission, that he submitted false financial statements to the
Commission, and that he converted to his own use securities which had
been entrusted to him for safekeeping. The defendant consented to
the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from further
violations of the statute.
In S. E. O. v. Zippin & Oompany,23 the Commission charged that
Zippin & Company, a registered broker-dealer, had engaged in a
course of business which operated as a fraud and deceit in that its

liabilities exceeded its assets and it was unable to meet its current
liabilities, and it had made untrue and misleading statements concerning its financial condition. At the request of the Commission a
temporary restraining order was entered and a receiver appointed.
Subsequently, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining the company from further violations of
the statutes.
In S. E. O. v, Stanley Pelz &; 00., Inc. and Stanley A. Pelz,24 the
complaint alleged that the defendants permitted the firm's aggregate
indebtedness to exceed 2000 per centum of its net capital in violation
of the Commission's rules. The defendants had been warned several
times to bring the firm's financial condition into line with the Commission's requirements but failed to do so. The defendants consented
to the entry of a final judgment.
In a broker-dealer revocation proceeding against Henry P. Rosenfeld and others, Samson Wallach, Sr., a salesman of Rosenfeld, had
been found by the Commission to have violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act and to have
been a cause of the order revoking Rosenfeld's registration. He filed
a petition for review contending that the Commission had no jurisdiction to name as a respondent a salesman not registered as a brokerdealer. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sustained
Wallach's petition for review." On remand the Commission dismissed the administrative proceeding as to Wallach. While the
matter was in litigation, Wallach became sales manager for another
registrant, Securities National Oorporation. After a further proceeding
the Commission, relying on the record and findings in the Rosenfeld
case and certain additional evidence, revoked the registration of
Securities National Corporation because of Wallach's association with
it.26 Securities National and Wallach filed petitions with the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review this action. These
petitions were dismissed on ptocedural grounds, the court holding,
among other things, that since Wallach had declined to become a
party to the administrative proceeding he could not invoke the
review jurisdiction of the court."
Participation as Amicus Curiae

During the fiscal year the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
handed down its decision in Frati v. Robinson 28 in which the Commission participated as amicus curiae. The court, agreeing with the
views expressed by the Commission, held: (1) that rule X-lOB-5

under section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act applies to all
fraudulent and deceptive securities transactions involving the use of
the mails or instruments of interstate commerce, and is not limited,
as defendants contended, to transactions in securities traded on
exchanges or traded over the counter by professional brokers and
dealers; (2) that a private civil action for damages may be maintained by a seller of securities injured by a violation of rule X-lOB-5;
(3) that alleged uses of the mails to effect payment for, and to obtain
delivery of, the purchased securities were sufficient under rule X-lOB5, and that it was not necessary that the mails or instruments of
interstate commerce be used to transmit the particular misrepresentation complained of; and (4) that the statute of limitations reference
in a rule X-10B-5 action for damages is the statute of limitations of
the forum jurisdiction applicable to actions for fraud.
In Falco v. Donner Foundation, Inc.29 an action was brought pursuant to section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act to recover
profits resulting from certain purchases and sales of Pittsburgh Steel
Company equity securities by the defendant, a 10 percent stockholder. Both the purchases and sales involved in the litigation were
executed simultaneously. The stockholder plaintiff in the action
computed substantial profits by adding dividends which had been
declared to the price at which the securities were sold. The Commission filed a brief amicus curiae taking the position that, although
the transactions were subject to section 16 (b), the prices at which
they were executed gave rise to no profit. The court agreed with
the views expressed by the Commission. An appeal to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is pending.
In Pellegrino v. Wright the Commission argued, amicus curiae, that
section 16 (b) did not impose a penalty, and that therefore the right
of action survived after the death of the defendant. The District
Court for the District of Maryland agreed with this construction and
refused to dismiss an action brought under that section against the
estate of an officer who had engaged in short-term trading in the
securities of his company."
Further proceedings were had during the 1953 fiscal year in two

Jefferson Lake Sulphur Go. v. Walet the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the decision of the District

Kaiser-Frazer Investigation and Litigation with Otis & Co.

The Commission's investigation into the circumstances surrounding
the failure of a stock offering by Kaiser-Frazer Corporation in early
1948 has resulted in an extensive series of administrative and court
proceedings. Accounts of prior proceedings appear in the 15th,s4
16th,35 and 18th36 Annual Reports of the Commission. At the
beginning of the present fiscal year there were pending before the
Commission an administrative proceeding to determine whether the
registration of Otis & Co. as a broker-dealer should be revoked and
whether it should be suspended or expelled from the NASD, and an
appeal by Otis & Co. from an order of the NASD suspending it from
membership for 2 years.
After the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York had entered judgment in favor of Kaiser-Frazer in that
corporation's suit against Otis & Co. for breach of its underwriting
contract," the Commission sought and obtained a temporary restrain
ing order from the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Ohio restricting various activities by and with respect to
Otis & CO.38 Shortly thereafter, Otis & Co. filed a petition in the
same court for reorganization under chapter X of the Bankruptcy
Act.39 In its order approving the reorganization petition, the court
restrained all persons from commencing or continuing any actions or
proceedings against the debtor. The Commission, appearing spe
cially in its capacity as the agency charged with the administration of
the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, sought clarifica
tion or, if necessary, modification of this order so as to preclude any
question of the propriety of its continuing the prosecution of the two
administrative proceedings pending before it and the injunction action
pending in the District Court. In an order dated April 7, 1952, the
reorganization court construed its previous order as prohibiting the
prosecution of all three proceedings, but modified the order to permit
further prosecution of the Commission's injunction action. The Com
mission filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit insofar as the order restrained the Commission
from continuing the prosecution of the two administrative proceedings
pending before it.40

REPORT

Before the appeal was argued, the United States Supreme Court
denied a petition by Kaiser-Frazer Corporation for a writ of certiorari
to review a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit which reversed the judgment against Otis & Co. in the
New York breach of contract action.". Thereafter the reorganization
court granted Otis' motion for dismissal of the proceedings under chapter X and removed the injunction provisions contained in its order approving the petition for reorganization as modified by its order of April
7. On January 8, 1953, the Commission filed a motion in the Sixth
Circuit to vacate or reverse the April 7 order of the reorganization
court on the ground that the controversy was moot and, on February
2, 1953, the Court of Appeals entered an order vacating the order
appealed from. On May 6, 1953, the United States District Court
entered an order dismissing the Commission's action for an injunction.
Meanwhile, on March 23, 1953, the Sixth Circuit had issued its
opinion affirming the approval of the settlement of the stockholders'
actions which had been instituted against Kaiser-Frazer after the
collapse of its stock offering in 1948.42
On March 25, the Commission directed the resumption of its
broker-dealer proceedings against Otis & Co. and, at the same time,
ordered a further public investigation into the 1948 Kaiser-Frazer
stock offering, such investigation to cover the facts and circumstances
surrounding the preparation, filing and review of the registration
statement. After motions by Otis & Co. in the broker-dealer proceedings to direct Commission counsel to incorporate testimony previously
taken and to quash subpoenas or to dismiss the proceedings were
denied, the hearings were resumed on May 5. After a brief session on
that date, the hearings were adjourned until May 26 and thereafter
several days of testimony were heard.
On June 10, 1953, James F. Masterson and D. Bernard Heffernan,
who had been subpoenaed to appear as witnesses in the proceeding
against Otis & Co., filed an action in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in which they sought to
quash the subpoenas and to stay all proceedings pending the disposition of their complaint." The court issued a rule, returnable on
June 24, to show cause why the application for a stay should not be
allowed and ordered all proceedings to be stayed meanwhile. On
June 16, the court issued an order clarifying the rule to show cause to
stay only the return date of the subpoenas served on the plaintiffs in
the action. On the same date, the Commission filed a motion to
dismiss the action and an answer to the rule to show cause."

PART III
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY
COMPANY ACT OF 1935

HOLDING

The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 provides for three
areas of regulation of public utility holding company systems.
The
first embraces those provisions of the Act which require the physical
integration of the public utility and related properties of a holding
company system and the simplification of intercorporate relationships
and financial structures of the system. The latter includes the removal of unnecessary holding company complexities, the correction of
inequitable distribution of voting power among security holders, and
the strengthening of the financial position of the system. The second
area covers financing operations of holding companies and their subsidiaries, acquisitions and dispositions of properties and securities by
such companies, their accounting practices and servicing arrangements
and other intercompany transactions in holding company systems.
The third includes a group of provisions of the Act designed to insure
that newly created holding company or affiliate relationships shall
meet prescribed standards and certain other provisions of the Act
requiring a very limited degree of surveillance over exempt holding
company systems.
INTEGRATION

AND SIMPLIFICATION-SUMMARY

OF DEVELOPMENTS

At the beginning of the fiscal year 1953, there were forty active
registered holding company systems. In addition, there were .five
registered holding companies which had disposed of all of their utility
subsidiaries and were in the final stages of liquidation.
These comprised a total of 437 companies of which 57 were predominantly holding companies, 192 were electric or gas utility companies and 188 were
engaged in various other businesses.
The 57 holding companies were
registered as such and, in addition, three utility companies and one
other company were also registered as holding companies.
By June 30, 1953 the number of active registered holding company
systems had been reduced to 35. In addition there were 12 registered
holding companies which no longer had any utility subsidiaries.
Eight
of the latter number were in process of final liquidation.
The aggregate of all companies included in the foregoing totaled 385, of which
48 were holding companies, 173 were electric or gas utilities and 164
were nonutility companies.
r -
./"
The .fiscal year 1953 witnessed substantial progress in clearing up the
remaining problems under section 11 of the Act. Forty-six companies
with aggregate assets of $788 millions were divested by registered
holding company systems.

SYSTEMS

American Power & Light Co.

Since the Commission issued its order on August 22, 1942, requiring
American Power & Light Co. to dissolve, numerous plans have been
filed by the company under section l1(e) of the Act for the purpose
of compliance with this order. These developments are described in
previous annual reports.
During the past fiscal year the company filed a plan providing for
its final liquidation by means of the distribution of its remaining assets
totaling approximately $7,000,000 to the holders of its common stock,
the only securities of the company remaining outstanding. These
assets consisted of cash, United States Government securities and 10
percent of the outstanding common stock of Portland Gas & Coke
Company. The Commission approved the plan on March 31, 1953,1
and on May 15, 1953, the United States District Court, District of
Maine, also approved the plan and directed its enforcement." No
appeal was taken.
On September 2, 1953, the company distributed to the holders of
its common stock $0.95 per share in cash, plus one share of Portland's
common stock for each 43 shares of Power & Light's stock held. This
resulted in the disposition by Power & Light of all of its holdings of
Portland stock.
American Natural Gas Co.

On September 3, 1952, the Commission ordered hearings reconvened 3 for the purpose of taking testimony on the question of the retention of the Milwaukee Solvay Coke Company in the American Natural
Gas Company System. In its order dated December 30, 1947, approving a plan for the reorganization of United Light and Railways

pass upon this question, because it was anticipated that Milwaukee
Gas Light Company, the immediate parent of Solvay, would convert
to natural gas in which event the retain ability of the coke and gas
manufacturing facilities of Solvay might become questionable under
the standards of section l1(b)(I) of the Act.' The matter was pending
at the end of the fiscal year.
American Water Works & Electric Company, Inc.

As described in the 18th Annual Report, the United States District
Court, District of Delaware, entered its order on September 17, 1952,6
approving and directing enforcement of the Commission's order of
March 17, 1952,6 approving the payment of a premium of $10 per
share, plus compensation for delay, on the $6 Cumulative Preferred
stock of Water Works. The company had previously liquidated and
dissolved in compliance with section l1(b). The additional payments
were made on November 12, 1952.
Central Public Utility Corporation

This system had consummated four reorganization plans under
section Ll Ie) prior to January 1953. In brief, this accomplished the
liquidation of substantial amounts of system debt, the retirement of
the publicly held preferred stock of Consolidated Electric and Gas
Company, a subsidiary holding company, and the recapitalization of
the top holding company on a one stock basis. These plans and the

ANNUAL

REPORT

On February 2,1953 the Commission approved a plan under section
11 (e) which provided for the dissolution of Central Securities Transfer
Company, an inactive subsidiary of Central Public."
Cities Service Company

Previous annual reports of the Commission have summarized the
numerous proceedings under section 11 which had as their ultimate
objective the disposal by Cities Service Company of all of its public
utility interests. The 18th Annual Report described the plan for the
reorganization of Arkansas Natural Gas Corporation ("ARKNAT"),
a registered holding company subsidiary of Cities, which was approved
by the Commission on October 1, 1952. Subsequently, the Commission applied to the United States District Court, District of Delaware,
for an order approving and enforcing this plan.
Objections were filed with the court by the Public Common Stockholders Committee and the Class A Stockholders Committee, who
attacked the Commission's findings approving the terms of the settlement of claims against Cities, particularly the claims arising out of the
marketing of ARKNAT's Class A stock in the years 1929-30. The
court was called upon to decide whether it was appropriate for the
Commission to dispose of the claims controversy in its consideration
of the amended plan rather than through the processes of litigation
and whether the fairness of the settlement provided by the amended
plan was supported by substantial evidence. The district court
affirmed the Commission's determinations with respect to both questions and directed enforcement of the plan." Upon appeal by the
Public Common Stockholders Committee, the order of the district
court was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals, Third
Circuit, which pointed out in its opinion that the stockholders had
not been affected adversely by the plan and that they should not be
heard to complain." A petition for certiorari was denied."
In connection with the effectuation of the plan the Commission acted
on a number of subsidiary matters. On May 4,1953, the Commission
approved an application of Arkansas Fuel Oil Corporation, formerly
ARKNAT, to sell to the public $23,000,000 of debentures." Subsequently, due to failure of the company to receive any bids, the
application was amended to propose the issuance and sale of
$23,000,000 of 60 day notes." The Commission approved the amendment, and its order was approved by the district court."

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

A similar problem arose in connection with the proposed offering of
$25,000,000 principal amount of bonds by Arkansas Louisiana Gas
Company, formerly a subsidiary of ARKNAT.
The company offered
these bonds at competitive bidding pursuant to _the provisions of the
original plan but rejected the two bids received because of high
interest costs. Subsequently it made application to the Commission
to approve .the elimination of this provision from the original plan
and indicated that it was considering alternative methods of obtaining
funds to retire its funded debt and to finance its construction program.
The Commission approved amendments to the plan covering new
financing proposals on July 22, 1953, and its order was approved by
the district court."
On October 7, 1953 the Commission issued an order pursuant to
section 5 (d) of the Act declaring that Arkansas Fuel Oil Corporation
had ceased to be a holding company."
After the close of the fiscal year, Cities sold its entire interest of
33,746 shares of common stock of Republic Light Heat & Power
Company, Inc. to National Fuel Gas Company, a nonaffiliated registered holding company," in compliance with the Commission's Order
of October 12, 1944 directing Cities to dispose of its utility investments."
In addition, Cities has advised the Commission pursuant
to rule U-44 (c) that it had sold its entire interest in the capital stock
of Tri-City Gas Company on July 16, 1953.
Cities had pending at the close of the fiscal year an application for
approval by the Commission of the proposed sale by competitive
bidding of its holdings in The Gas Service Company.
Because of
unfavorable market conditions, Cities has requested that the Commission defer action on the matter."
Derby Gas & Electric Corporation

Following the divestment by Ogden Corporation of its controlling
interest in Derby Gas & Electric Corporation in 1943, Derby Corp.
has functioned solely as a holding company over The Derby Gas and
Electric Company, Wallingford Gas Light Company, Danbury and
Bethel Gas and Electric Light Company and Derby Gas and Electric
Corporation of Connecticut, all of which subsidiaries are public utilities
under the laws of the State of Connecticut.
During the past fiscal year Derby Corp. filed a plan under section
11 (e) of the Act providing, among other things, for the merger of all
the companies in the system into a single operating utility company,
incorporated in Connecticut, whose name is proposed to be changed
to The Housatonic Public Service Company.

with a par value of $15 each, and an authorized funded debt in a principal amount not exceeding $10,000,000. Upon completion of the
merger Housatonic will have no public utility subsidiaries and therefore will not be subject to the Act. Hearings on the plan were held,"
and on October 9, 1953, the Commission entered an order approving
the plan." The United States District Court, District of Connecticut
approved and enforced the plan on November 16, 1953.24
Eastern Utilities Associates

Except for increases in stock ownership in its subsidiaries, no changes
have occurred in the organization of the Eastern Utilities Associates
holding company system in the past fiscal year.
By order dated April 4, 1950, the Commission directed EUA either
to terminate its existence or to acquire a minimum of 90 percent of
the outstanding common stock of each of its subsidiaries and reclassify
its common and convertible shares into a single class of stock. In
the event the latter alternative was chosen, EUA was also directed
to cause Blackstone Valley Gas and Electric Company, one of its
subsidiaries, to dispose of its gas utility properties." As described
in the 18th Annual Report, EUA elected the second alternative in its
Amended Plan No.4, which the Commission approved in its order
dated December 18, 1952. The plan was approved and ordered enforced by the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts,
on February 10, 1953.26 No appeal was taken. Subsequently EUA
increased its holdings of the common stocks of all of its direct subsidiaries to amounts in excess of 97 per cent as required by the plan.
To finance the acquisition of publicly held stock of one of its subsidaries EUA borrowed $9,000,000 from commercial banks. It is expected that these loans will be refunded with $7,000,000 of collateral
trust bonds and other funds as provided by the plan.
The plan also provided for certain supervision over the selection of
the initial Board of Trustees of EUA to take officefollowing the recapitalization of the company. However, after approval of the plan by
the district court, the parties to the proceedings did not agree to the
nominations to the new Board of Trustees submitted by EUA to the
Commission. Accordingly, the Commission denied a supplemental
application on February 26, 1953, for approval of the new Board."
Subsequently, upon petition of EUA, the district court entered a
further order which suspended, among other things, the operation
of the plan's provision for the selection of EUA's reconstituted Board

the Commission proposing to increase the size of EUA's board and to

ordered enforced by the district COurt.29
Electric Bond and Share Company

As a result of numerous plans of reorganization, Electric Bond and
Share Company had reduced its holdings by the beginning of the
fiscal year to interests in four companies, Ebasco Services, Inc. (100
percent), Two Rector Street Corporation (100 percent), American &
Foreign P wer Company (54.6 percent), and United Gas Corporation
(22.5 percent), plus other miscellaneous investments.
Such plans and
the proceedings before the Commission and the courts relating thereto
have been summarized in previous annual reports.
On June 13, 1952, the company filed a final comprehensive plan
which was designed to complete the resolution of its problems under
section 11 of the Act. This plan, which provided for the transformation of Bond and Share to an investment company, was described in
the 18th Annual Report. The Commission was unable to find the
plan fair and equitable to the persons affected thereoy and, accordingly, withheld its approval pending the filing of appropriate amendments.s" Among the objectionable features of the plan were the
provisions for a discount of at least 25 percent on the price at which
Bond and Share was to offer its holdings of United Gas stock to its
stockholders, the provision for a three year period within which to
distribute the United Gas stock, the absence of cumulative voting
provisions in Bond and Share's charter, and a provision that Bond
and Share would become exempt as a holding company pursuant to
section 3 (a) (5) automatically upon completion of the proposed
distribution of United Gas stock. Satisfactory amendments Were
filed and on February 20, 1953, the Commission approved the plan
as modified."
On application by the Commission to the United States District
Court, Southern District of N ew York, opponents of the plan contended that the Commission lacked power to permit Bond and Share
to embark upon an investment program before it became entitled to
an exemption under section 3 (a). The district court agreed with
this view." The Commission filed a motion for reargument, after
which the court ordered the proceedings returned to the Commission
and authorized Bond and Share to file appropriate amendments to
the plan. The plan was subsequently amended by placing certain

.additional restrictions on the investment program of Bond and Share
until such time as the company should have secured an exemption
from the provisions of the Act and by the insertion of a commitment
by Bond and Share to file and prosecute diligently an application for
such exemption within a prescribed period of time following disposi
tion of certain of its portfolio securities. The plan as modified was
approved by the Commission on July 15, 1953.33 Shortly thereafter
the district court approved the amended plan and directed its en
forcement."
The plan as finally approved provides, among other things, that
Bond and Share's holdings of United Gas common stock will be
reduced to less than 5 percent of the total amount outstanding,
that within 60 days after completion of the disposition program
embodied in the plan Bond and Share shall file with the Commission
an application for exemption under section 3 (a) (5), and that, during
the period from the effective date of the plan to the date exemption
is granted, Bond and Share "ill conform to the substantive require
ments of the Investment Company Act of 1940 limiting' its invest
ments to those normally permitted for registered, closed-end, nondiversified investment companies. On October 5, 1953, Bond and
Share distributed 892,561 shares of United Gas stock to its stock
holders.
An appeal involving Bond and Share which had been pending in
the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, for nearly 2
years was disposed of during the fiscal year. Pursuant to plans
filed in 1945 and 1946 which were approved by the Commission and
ordered enforced by the district court, Bond and Share had paid to
the holder of each share of its $5 preferred stock $100 in cash and
also had delivered to each such holder a certificate evidencing the
right to receive any additional amounts which the Commission or
the courts might approve or direct. Subsequently, the Commission
determined that no additional amounts should be paid to holders of
the certificates. Appellants, a group of $5 Preferred Stockholders of
the company, had appealed from an order of the district court declar
ing these certificates to be void. After a protracted period of failure
on the part of the appellants to prosecute the action the Commission
moved successfully to dismiss the appeal."

and the earlier steps taken by the Trustee toward the eventualliquidation and dissolution of IRES and subsequent proposals to become
an investment company are discussed in the 15th and subsequent
annual reports.
As noted in the 18th Annual Report the Commission issued its
Findings, Opinion, and Order on June 5, 1952, approving the execution by the Trustee, upon satisfactorily resolving the tax problems
involved, of definitive contracts for the sale of all of the propert. es
of Eastern New York Power Corporation ("ENYP"), a subsidiary,
and the interests of IRES in two small subsidiaries." On March 12,
1953, the Trustee requested approval by the Commission of definitive
contracts made by him pursuant to the order of June 5, 1952. The
Trustee also requested authorization to apply the proceeds derived
from the sale of the aforementioned properties and securities (i) to
the retirement of ENYP's first mortgage 3X percent bonds due in
1961 in the principal amount of $7,886,000, and (ii) to the retirement
of the 30,000 shares of preferred stock of ENYP of the par value of
$100 per share or as a distribution to IRES as the holder of all of
ENYP's common stock, or both, and as respects any amounts so
received by IRES, to apply the same to the payment of its bank
indebtedness in the principal amount of $6,050,000. The proposal
was authorized by the Commission on April 13, 1953,43and approved
by the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts on
June 5, 1953.44 After the close of the fiscal year, on an appeal taken
by the City of Plattsburg, N ew York, from that portion of the District Court's order which approved a contract between the Trustee
for the sale of certain properties to New York State Electric and Gas
Corporation, the decision of the District Court was affirmed."
Other sales of properties were approved by the Commission on
April 28, 1953,46and by the district court on June 16, 1953. Representatives of the Class A stockholders of IRES objected to approval
of the proposal on the grounds, among other things, that the sale of
the properties was no longer necessary because of changed conditions,
that competitive conditions had not been maintained, and that the
proposed sale price was inadequate. These objections were overruled
by the court."

to the Commission for the solution of its existing section 11 problems
which relate to the retainability of certain gas and transportation
businesses along with its electric utility system. The Delaware company proposed, among other things, to sell its interest in its larger

the ground that the committee's activities regarding solicitation of

On February 25, 1953, the Commission filed a supplemental appli
cation with the United States District Court, Eastern District of
New York, for approval and enforcement of its order. On May 11,
1953, that court entered its order approving the Commission's de

The court reversed and remanded that portion of the Commission's
order which denied an allowance to the committee for reimbursement
of proxy solicitation expenses." In its order the court stated that
the Commission's findings of fact and conclusion of law were not
supported by substantial evidence and were not arrived at in accord
ance with legal standards. The court added that the expenses in
question arose out of the furnishing of desirable information to a
substantial group of stockholders and that, accordingly, the validity
of the committee's claim should have been recognized.
The Commission has filed an appeal from the decision of the district
court with the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit."
Market

Railway Company

Market Street Railway Company was formerly a nonutility sub
sidiary of Standard Gas and Electric Company. By order dated
October 24, 1950, the Commission had approved a plan for the liqui
dation and dissolution of Market Street pursuant to section 11 (e).
On November 21, 1950, the United States District Court, Northern
District of California, Southern Division, approved and directed
enforcement of Step I of the plan." This step provided for the settle

payment of certain fees and expenses to participants in the reorgani
zation proceedings, the payment of a partial liquidating distribution
of $15 per share to the holders of the company's 6 percent cumulative
Prior Preference Stock, and dissolution.
Step II provided for the subsequent payment of such fees and
expenses in connection with the plan as might be awarded by the
Commission, and the distribution of remaining cash of the company
to the holders of Prior Preference Stock. On May 13, 1953, the Com
mission approved an amendment to Step II, which in substance pro
vided for a second partial distribution of $3.50 per share to the Prior
Preference stockholders, the payment of fees and expenses to certain
participants in the reorganization proceedings, and the distribution

the district court approved the amendment and directed its enforcement on July 3, 1953.59
An appeal from an order of the Commission denying the application
for fees and expenses by an attorney participant in the Market
Street reorganization proceedings was terminated during the fiscal
year. In its order approving the plan for liquidation of Market
Street, the Commission denied the claim for fees and expenses submitted by an attorney for a stockholders' committee, who had been
instrumental in affecting the settlement of intercompany claims
between Market Street and Standard Gas, but whom the Commission
found had lost his independence in representing his client. The district court found that the facts of the case did not warrant the denial
in toto of the attorney's fees and remanded the matter to the Commission with instructions to determine the appropriate amount of
such fee. The Commission appealed to the United States Court of
Appeals, Ninth Circuit. On Decernber Ifi, 1951, the court of appeals
reversed that portion of the district court's order which related to the
denial of the attorney's fee application by the Commission. After
reargument of the matter, the court of appeals changed its determination and affirmed the decision of district court on December 22,
1952.&0 No petition for a writ of certiorari was filed.

In its Memorandum Opinion and Order dated January 14,1953, the
Conuaission authorized and directed Mohawk, as successor in interest
to Niagara Hudson, to pay fees of $428,895 and expenses of $443,598
to various participants in the reorganization proceedings." The fees
allowed several claimants were in amounts less than those requested,
and the claims of others were denied. The application for additional
compensation by a law :firm representing three corporate holders of
Niagara Hudson common stock was denied on the ground that the
:firm did not contribute to the developments or modification of the
plan, and that the firm did not represent the common stockholders as
a class. The Commission also denied in toto the application of
United Corporation, the former parent of Niagara Hudson, for reimbursement of the fees and expenses paid to counsel and other experts
which it had employed in connection with the proceedings. In its
opinion, the Commission stated that United had a statutory duty to

section 11 and for that reason United, and not its subsidiaries, should
bear the expense of such compliance. The Commission also observed
that compliance by its subsidiaries was a necessary prelude to compliance by United itself.
On March 12, 1953, the Commission made application to the United
States District Court, Northern District of New York, for approval
and enforcement of its order. The law firm and United filed objections. On September 15, 1953, the district court affirmed the Commission's order and directed its enforcement." As of October 29,
1953, no appeal had been taken.

As indicated in the 18th Annual Report, the Commission on June 5,
1952,75disapproved a plan which had been submitted by Pennsylvania
-Gas & Electric Corporation ("Penn Corp") to effect its liquidation

Penn Corp undertook to make distributions to its stockholders in the
proportions specified by the Commission. It also proposed to change
the form of the allocations so as to distribute separately the common
stocks of its two operating subsidiaries, North Penn Gas Company
and Crystal City Gas Company." The amended plan provided that
the preferred stockholders of Penn Corp would receive all the common
stock of North Penn and 35 percent of the common stock of Crystal
City; and that the Classes A and B stockholders of Penn Corp would
receive 52 and 13 percent, respectively, of the Crystal City common
stock. Penn Corp's preferred stockholders would also receive a cash
payment equivalent to the accrual of dividends thereon from December 31, 1950, to the date of consummation of the plan. After further
hearings, the Commission approved the plan as amended on December 15, 1952.77
Upon application by the Commission to the United States District
Court, District of Delaware, the amended plan was unopposed and
the court approved the plan and ordered it enforced on January 27,

Republic Service Corporation

By the beginning of 1948 the Republic Service Corporation system
had been reduced in size to a point where it consisted solely of five
electric utility subsidiaries, all of which were organized and doing
business in the State of Pennsylvania, and one service company
subsidiary incorporated in Delaware.
In its order dated April 29, 1948, the Commission approved a plan
:filedby Republic under section 11 (e) in which the company proposed,
among other things, that Republic organize a new Pennsylvania
corporation to take over all of Republic's assets and liabilities and
issue a single class of new common stock to Republic, which would
deliver all of such stock to the holders of its own preferred stock and
thereafter dissolve. The plan further provided that the new Pennsylvania corporation would apply for an exemption pursuant to section
3 (a) (1) as an intrastate holding company system. The plan was
approved by the Commission 79 and ordered enforced by the United
States District Court, District of Delaware, on May 28, 1948.80 On
August 23 of that year, before the plan had been consummated,
Republic amended its plan, with the court's permission, so as to defer
until not later than December 31, 1953, the organization of the new
Pennsylvania corporation and thereby retain for Republic's stockholders the tax benefits accruing from certain capital loss carry-overs.
The plan also provided that, in lieu of the formation of the new
Pennsylvania corporation, Republic would continue in operation
temporarily as a holding company and recapitalize on a one-stock
basis by distributing 70,324 shares of new $10 par value common stock
to the holders of its outstanding preferred stock. The amended plan
was approved by the Commission," ordered enforced by the district
court by order dated September 17, 1948,82 and subsequently was
consummated. Jurisdiction was reserved by the Commission over
the formation of the new Pennsylvania corporation and related
matters.
Subsequently, Republic sold 1 of its 5 electric utility subsidiaries
and caused the merger of three others. At the beginning of the fiscal
year 1953, the company had interests in only 3 subsidiaries: Brockway
Light, Heat & Power Company, Cumberland Valley Electric Company and Republic Service Management Company.
-
 On November 25, 1952, the Commission approved a proposal of
Republic to exchange its interest in Brockway for 20,150 shares of the
common stock of General Public Utilities Corporation ("GPU").

.As described in the 18th Annual Report the Commission approved
a plan filed pursuant to section 11 (e) in which it was proposed that
Birmingham Electric Company be merged into Alabama Power Company. M Both companies were subsidiaries of Southern. On N ovember 26, 1952, the United States District Court, Eastern District of
Alabama, approved the plan and ordered it enforced." No appeal
was taken.
Southern Natural Gas Company

Southern Natural Gas Company operates a natural gas pipeline
system extending from gas fields in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi
to markets in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.
During the past fiscal year Southern filed a plan pursuant to section
11 (e) providing for the divestment of its entire interest in Alabama
Gas Corporation, which was the company's only public utility subsidiary. The plan proposed that the common stock of Alabama be
distributed pro rata to the holders of the common stock of Southern
at the rate of 0.24306 shares of Alabama stock for each share of
Southern stock. The Commission approved the plan on March 4,
1953,86and on April 8, 1953, after the distribution of Alabama stock
had been completed, the Commission entered a further order pursuant
to section 5 (d) declaring that Southern had ceased to be a registered
holding company."

effected the final settlement of all intercompany claims as between
Standard Gas and its parent, Standard Power. These steps reflected
a compromise effected among representatives of the various participants in the proceedings. These steps were approved and ordered
enforced by the United States District Court, District of Delaware,

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Previously, on July 24, 1952, the Commission had approved a plan
of Standard and Philadelphia Company ("Philadelphia") for the
partial liquidation of Philadelphia designed to provide Standard Gas
with 1,004,958 shares of common stock of Duquesne Light Company
substantially all of which was required to carry out Steps I and IA of
the Standard Gas plan described above."
.
The compromise which made possible the consummation of Steps I
and IA also covered Step II of the Standard Gas plan, pursuant to
which its $4 Cumulative Preferred stock was retired by the exchange
for each share thereof of four shares of common stock of Duquesne
Light Company. Subsequently, the Standard Gas plan was further
amended by the filing of Steps IIA and IrB representing the results
of an agreement reached after extended discussions between representatives of Standard Gas and its stockholders and representatives
of the publicly held common stock of Philadelphia, who had alleged
certain acts of mismanagement of Philadelphia on the part of Standard
Gas and claimed that they were entitled to better treatment than that
accorded Standard Gas in the liquidation of Philadelphia. Steps IrA
and IIB provided for the retirement of the publicly held common stock
of Philadelphia and also proposed alternative means for furnishing to
Standard Gas shares of Duquesne common stock required for the
consummation of Step II of its plan. The plan, as thus amended,
provided for the retirement of the publicly held common stock of
Philadelphia on the basis of a distribution to them for each share of
such stock of 0.885 shares of Duquesne common stock with Standard
Gas receiving the balance of the net assets of Philadelphia. This
treatment resulted in the public common stockholders being accorded
a slightly greater participation than would have been the case if they
had shared on a pari passu basis. This plan was approved by the
Commission on March 13, 1953,91 and was approved and ordered
enforced by the United States District Court, District of Delaware,
on April 20, 1953.92 No appeal was taken and the plan was consummated on April 27, 1953.
The outstanding securities of Standard Gas at June 30, 1953,
consisted only of its common stock of 2,163,607 shares. There has
been no final determination of its liability for Federal income and
excess profit taxes for the years 1942 through 1950, and there are
major items of dispute between the Treasury Department and the
system companies as to the amounts of such tax liabilities. In
addition, claims aggregating over $6 million for fees and expenses for
services rendered by the various participants in the proceedings
involving Standard Gas and Philadelphia under section 11 have been
asserted against those companies.

At June 30, 1953, Standard Gas owned all of the 5,040,440 shares
of the outstanding common stock of Philadelphia, 16,903 shares of
the common stock of Duquesne, 3,178 shares of the common stock of
Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company and 46,834 shares of the
common stock of Wisco..'lsinPublic Service Corporation. Its other
assets include cash, the capital stocks of two inactive nonutility
subsidiaries, a short term note of Philadelphia in the principal amount
of $2,500,000, and whatever potential value may be realized in the
event of any reduction of Federal tax liabilities for past periods.
As described in the l Sth Annual Report, the Commission in April
1952 approved the first major plan for the simplification of the
corporate structure of the Philadelphia holding company system which
provided for retirement of the 5 and 6 percent noncallable preferred
stocks of the parent company." This plan was approved and ordered
enforced by the United States District Court, Western District of
Pennsylvania, on October 7, 1952.94 No appeal was taken and the
plan was consummated on November 1, 1952. The next step in
the simplification of Philadelphia took the form of a plan for the
retirement of the company's $5 Cumulative Preference stock. TIlls
was approved by the Commission on December 31, 1952,95and the
plan was approved and ordered enforced by the United States District
Court, Western District of Pennsylvania on January 30, 1953.96
No appeal was taken and the plan was consummated on February
2, 1953, by the exchange of 3.6 shares of Duquesne common stock
for each share of Philadelphia's $5 preferred stock.
This plan completed the retirement of Philadelphia's preferred
stocks, and the company's outstanding securities at June 30, 1953,
consisted of 5,040,440 shares of common stock, all of which is owned
by Standard Gas, $3,500,000 principal amount of 37{percent bank
loan notes maturing August 21, 1954, and the $2,500,000 note due
to Standard Gas. Philadelphia owned 1,360,524 shares, or approximately 23 percent of the 6,000,009 outstanding shares of Duquesne
common stock; 24,264 shares, or 4.41 percent of the 4 percent Cumulative Preferred stock of Duquesne, 547,678 shares, or 50.9 percent of
the common stock of its nonutility subsidiary, Pittsburgh Railways
Company; all of the common stock of Equitable Auto Company, a
subsidiary service company; and certain real estate in the City
of Pittsburgh.
The proposed sale of Philadelphia's office building in the City of

for a period of 35 years. The proceeds from such sale were used to
discharge the mortgage on said property and to reduce Philadelphia's
bank loan notes to $3,500,000. Objections to this plan had been
raised on the ground that competitive conditions were not maintained in the sale of the property. The Commission held, however,
that competitive conditions had been sufficiently maintained to satisfy the requirements of the Act and it approved the plan on March
23, 1953. The United States District Court, Western District of
Pennsylvania, approved the plan and directed its enforcement on
.A.pril17, 1953.97
On May 18, 1953, the Commission approved a plan submitted by
Standard Power for the retirement of its outstanding issue of 34,054
shares of $7 Cumulative Preferred stock on a voluntary basis, at the
redemption price and dividend arrearages aggregating $212.82 per
share, payable on the basis of three shares of Duquesne common
stock and five shares of Wisconsin common stock, both at market
value, plus cash." Approximately 62 percent of the preferred stock
was tendered for exchange and the remainder was called for redemption in cash. Since this plan provided solely for voluntary actions
by the affected parties, no application to the district court for enforcement was necessary. The remaining outstanding securities of Standard Power consist of two series of common stock and short term bank
loan notes in the principal amount of $1,500,000.
In connection with the latter plan Standard Power has advised the
Commission of its intention to request a modification of the Com.
mission's 1942 order requiring the company to liquidate and dissolve,
so as to permit the company to continue in business as a registered
investment company. No application or declaration in this respect
has been filed with the Commission.
The United Gas Improvement Company

The 18th Annual Report contains a description of the plan for
reorganization of The United Gas Improvement Company ("UGI"),
which provided in substance for the transformation of UGr into a
Pennsylvania operating utility company. Following approval of
the plan by the Commission on September 18, 195299 and the entry
of an order by the district court on November 12, 19521 directing its
enforcement, the various steps of the plan, with minor exceptions,
were consummated by July 31, 1953. No appeals were taken.
On September 18, 1953, UGr filed an application with the Commission pursuant to section 5 (d) requesting an order declaring that

In 1950 the Commission instituted proceedings pursuant to section
11 (b) (1) to determine what properties could be retained in WEPCO's
electric holding company system. No determination of this issue has
been made. In the meantime the company filed a voluntary plan pur
suant to section 11 (e), which the Commission approved December 24,
1952,0 providing for the sale of WEPCO's subsidiary, Milwaukee
Electric Railway & Transport Company, of its transportation prop
erties which the record made in the section 11 (b) (1) proceedings
clearly showed were not retainable in the system. These were to be
sold to the Milwaukee & Suburban Transport Corporation, a non
affiliated company, for a consideration consisting of $4 million cash,
$3 million principal amount of 5 percent secured promissory notes and
$3 million par value of 5 percent cumulative preference stock of Subur

waukee Railway to retain the securities received from Suburban
Transport on a temporary basis. The sale was consummated on
January 28,1953.
The remaining problems of WEPCO under section 11 relate to the
retention of certain gas and auto parking facilities with the electric

FINANCING OF REGISTERED PUBLIC UTILITY HOWING COMPANY
SYSTEMS

Aside from reorganizations and dispositions of properties under
taken in compliance with section 11, the financing operations of
registered holding company systems have accounted for the major
portion of the transactions required to be acted upon by the Com
mission under the Act. In spite of the continued contraction of sys
tems as a consequence of the operation of section 11, the volume of
financing by these systems in 1953 reached almost the same level as
that recorded for 1952.
During the 12 months ended June 30, 1953, 311 matters were
presented for determination pursuant to sections 6 and 7 of the Act,
relating to the issuance of securities and assumptions of liability and
alterations of rights of securities holders by registered holding com
panies and their subsidiaries. A total of 320 matters were disposed of
during the year, including a few carried over from the latter part of the
preceding year. All but 36 related to issuances of securities. In the
fiscal year 1952, 352 matters were presented for determination and 374
were disposed of. All but 32 of the latter related to the issuance of
securities.
The following table sets forth for the fiscal years 1952 and 1953 the
volumes of securities of various types sold for cash, or issued in ex
change for refunding purposes, by registered holding companies and
their subsidiaries under sections 6 and 7 of the Act. Portfolio sales

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The increase of 15 percent in the number of issues sold in 1953,
accompanied by a 10 percent decrease in dollar volume, is accounted
for principally by recurring issues of small amounts under blanket.
authorizations for long term construction commitments and intercompany stock purchase agreements. Of the total sales of securities of $993,328,444by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries in 1953, $719,295,659 were purchased by stockholders of top
holding companies and by outside purchasers. This represented the
net external financing of registered systems for the year. The balance of $274,032,785 represented direct purchases of subsidiaries'
securities by their respective parent holding companies. Approximately one-half of the latter amount consisted of additions to the
common equity of the subsidiaries. Nearly 83 percent of the $145,015,261 of securities sold by holding companies were common stocks.
The continuation of the high level of financing activity by registered
systems during 1953 followed the pattern of the electric and gas
utility industries as a whole. This is demonstrated by the following
table which summarizes the volume of securities sold for cash in the
past 2 years by all electric and gas utilities, including holding companies and gas transmission companies. Because of the inclusion of
the last mentioned two types of companies for the first time this year,
these tables are not comparable with those appearing in previous
annual reports.

financing of $2,752 million for the entire electric and gas utility industries of the country. The following table shows the volumes of the
various types of securities included in these amounts.

As in previous years, registered holding company systems and the
industry as a whole have continued to sell ample amounts of common
stock thereby maintaining the fiscal position which has been characteristic of this business since the close of WorId War II.
On the basis of industry estimates of construction expenditures
for 1953 and 1954, it was anticipated that the volume of permanent
:financing by electric and gas utilities for the fiscal year 1953 would
register some increase over 1952. The projected increase in outlays
for new plant facilities materialized, but sales of long-term securities
to finance these additions declined slightly as noted above. The
difference was made up from retained earnings and temporary borrowings. This is illustrated by the following summary table:

The construction expenditures recorded for the fis-cal year 1953
established 8. new high record and industry projections indicate a
further modest increase in 1954. Consequently, it appears reasonable to expect a continuation of the high level of utility financing
which has been in evidence during the past 2 years.

SECURri'IES

AND 'EXCHANGE <JOMMISSION

Until recently it has been the policy of the Commission in the
administration of the Act to require that sales of additional common
stock by registered holding companies be made by means of rights
offerings to their common stockholders except where it could be shown
that unusual circumstances were present," During the year the
Commission directed its staff to undertake a detailed study of the
results of several rights offerings by a group of companies subject to
the Act and another group not subject to the statute. As a consequence of this reexamination of the problem the following new policy
was announced: ,,* * * it is our view that, while there are many
advantages to a rights offering, these advantages are not so conclusive
as to warrant a strict policy in favor of rights as against an underwriting by competitive bidding without an offer to stockholders.
Accordingly, it will be the policy * * * not to insist upon a rights
offering where management can make a showing that an underwriting by competitive bidding without an offer to stockholders would
be preferable." 7
It is still too early to evaluate the effects of this change of policy.
Subsequent to the announcement, six: companies subject to the Act
have offered common stock by means of rights and two have sold
their shares to the public through competitive bidding.
As indicated by the following table, the rights offering procedure
has been employed in the majority of common stock financings by
registered holding company systems and by all other electric and gas
utilities during the fiscal year 1953:
Common equity financing by registered holding company systems and by all other

Sales of securities by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries pursuant to sections 6 and 7 and portfolio sales by registered
holding companies under section 12 (d) are required to be made at
competitive bidding in accordance with the provisions of rule U-50.
Certain special types of sales, including issues of less than $1 million,
short term bank loans, issues the acquisition of which have been
authorized under section 10 and pro rata issues to existing security
holders, are automatically exempt from the competitive bidding
requirements under clauses (1) through (4) of paragraph (a) of the
rule. In clause (5) of paragraph (a), the Commission retains the
right to grant exemptions by order where it appears that competitive
bidding is not necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of
the Act.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

As previously indicated, a total of $993 million of securities were
sold for cash in the fiscal year 1953 by registered holding companies
and their subsidiaries. The difference of $394 million between this
amount and the $599 million of securities sold at competitive bidding
is accounted for by $307 million of securities automatically exempt
pursuant to clauses (1) through (4) of paragraph (a) of the rule and
$87 million of issues exempted by order. During the past fiscal year
five issues were exempted from competitive bidding requirements by
orders. One issue of bonds privately placed by Electric Energy, InC.,8
accounted for $65 million of this amount. The following table summarizes the numbers of issues and volumes of securities exempted in
this manner from the effective date of the rule to June 30, 1953.

Petitions To Review Orders of the Commission Pursuant to Section 24 (a)

The Commission participated in 6 proceedings during the past
fiscal year which were initiated by petitions to United States courts
of appeal to review its orders pursuant to section 24 (a). Three were
pending at the beginning of the fiscal year and 3 were initiated during
the year. One of the 6 petitions was withdrawn, 3 were dismissed
and 1 was pending in the court at the close of the fiscal year. A
petition for a writ of certiorari was filed with the United States
Supreme Court to review the decision of the court of appeals in the
sixth case.
One of the petitions involved an order of the Commission dated
February 6, 1952, denying Electric Bond and Share Company relief
from its previous commitment to dispose of its holdings of 27 percent of the common stock of United Gas Corporation." After extended proceedings in the United States Court of Appeals, District
of Columbia Circuit, in which there were motions for intervention
and motions to extend time to answer and file briefs, the petitioner
ultimately filed a motion to withdraw the petition. The court granted
this motion.'?

stockholders of Portland Railroad Company, an indirect subsidiary
of New England Public Service Company, who sought review of
orders entered by the Commission in 1944 and 1951 directing termination of a lease under which Central Maine Power Company, the
immediate parent of Portland, operated the latter's properties."
The court of a-ppeals pointed out that the period of appeal for the
1944 order had lapsed, and that, even if it thought it had some measure
of authority to review the proceedings it would not exercise such
jurisdiction because it found no abuse of discretion on the part of
the Commission."
Another petition for review involved certain orders of the Commission approving a plan for the corporate simplification of The
United Corporation."
This plan was described in the 18th annual
report. Certain stockholders of United filed a petition in the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in which
they attacked various provisions of the plan and sought enforcement
in that court of other provisions which were conditioned upon district
court enforcement. The court of appeals held that it had jurisdiction
to review the entire order, including those provisions subject to
enforcement by a district court, and on the merits affirmed the Commission's order in its entirety.'! Two petitions for a writ of certiorari
for review of the court of appeals' decision were filed by the petitioners
with the United States Supreme Court on June 27, 1953. On October
12, 1953, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, limiting the scope of
its review to the question of the jurisdiction of the court of appeals."
A petition by Randolph Phillips requesting the court of appeals to
set aside or modify orders of the Commission allowing and denying
certain fees and expenses claimed by petitioner for services alleged
to have been rendered in connection with proceedings for reorganization of The United Corporation was dismissed."
A third petition for review of an order of the Commission involving
The United Corporation was pending in the United States Court of
Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, at the close of the fiscal year.
In this case petitioners, who are stockholders of United, requested
the Court of Appeals to set aside the order of the Commission dated
May 2, 1952,17approving an investment program for United under
section 9 (c) (3) of the Act and its order dated June 24,1952, approving
a proposal of United to make a public offering of its entire holdings of

Another petition requested a review of the Commission's order of
July 24, 1952r approving a plan for reorganization of Philadelphia
Company, which provided, among other things, for a distribution of 1
share of common stock of Duquesne Light Company in exchange for 5
shares of common stock of Philadelphia. Petitioners, the 6 percent
Cumulative Preferred Stockholders Protective Committee, requested
the court of appeals to set aside the Commission's order. Subsequently, the petition for review was dismissed on stipulation of the
parties."
Petitions to United States Supreme Court for Writs of Certiorari

Two petitions for certiorari were filed with the United States
Supreme Court during the year for review of orders by United States
Courts of Appeals relating to orders issued by the Commission in
connection with proceedings under section 11 (e) of the Act.
In one case involving a plan for the reorganization of The United
Corporation, described above, the Supreme Oourt granted certiorari,
limiting the scope of its review to the question of the jurisdiction of
the court of appeals."
The second petition arose out of an order of the Commission dated
May 5, 1951,22denying the claim of James F. Masterson, an attorney,
for additional compensation for services in connection with the proceedings for the reorganization and dissolution of North American
Light and Power Company. Following application for enforcement
of that order, the United States District Court, District of Delaware,
directed the Commission to grant Masterson an additional award of
$10,000,23which determination was affirmed by the United States
Court of Appeals, Third Oircuit." On October 12,1953, the Supreme
Court denied the petition for certiorari."
Participation as Intervenor

The Commission moved and was granted permission to intervene
in proceedings initiated by a complaint filed against the Long Island
Lighting Company in the United States District Court, Eastern
District of New York, by Ennis M. Nichols, individually and on
behalf of other stockholders of the company. Among other things,

district court sustained the Commission's position and dismissed the
action on the ground that it violated the injunction provision of the
district court's order of February 17, 1950, enforcing the plan."
After the close of the fiscal year, the decision of the district court was

Miscellaneous Proceedings

During the fiscal year the Commission instituted an action in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
to compel the Philadelphia law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius to
file the 'informational statements which Section 12 (i) of the Act and
Rule U-71 thereunder require of all persons who "present, advocate
or oppose any matter affecting any registered holding company or
any subsidiary company thereof" before, inter alia, the Commission
or any member, officer or employee thereof. In refusing to file these
statements the law firm had contended principally that Section 12 (i)
is inapplicable to lawyers practicing before the Commission absent
proof of "lobbying." The:firm also interposed other defenses, including a claim that Section 12 (i)is unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.
The proffered defenses were rejected by the District Court which
granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment."
Defendants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third

PART IV

PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE

REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE


BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED

Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure for reor
ganizing corporations (other than railroads) in the Federal courts.
The Commission's duties under Chapter X are, at the request or
with the approval of the court, to provide the court and investors
with independent expert assistance on the various legal and financial
questions that arise in the proceeding and to prepare advisory reports
-on plans of reorganization. The Commission has no statutory right
of appeal in a Chapter X proceeding, but it may participate in appeals
taken by others.
The Commission acts in a purely advisory capacity. It has no
authority either to veto or to require the adoption of a plan of reor
ganization or to render a decision on any other issue in the proceeding.
Its recommendations are made for the benefit of the judge and the
security holders, affording them its disinterested views in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. Generally, the Commis
sion participates only in proceedings in which there is a substantial
public investor interest.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission participated during the 1953 fiscal year in 55
proceedings involving the reorganization of 80 companies with
aggregate stated assets of $561,930,000 and aggregate stated indebt
edness of $339,452,000. During the year the Commission with court
approval filed notices of appearances in 4 new proceedings under
Chapter X involving 7 companies with aggregate stated assets of
$7,761,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $3,661,000. Pro
ceedings involving 10 principal debtor corporations and 7 subsidiary
debtors were closed during the year. At the close of the year, the
Commission was actively participating in 45 reorganization proceed
ings involving 63 companies with aggregate stated assets of
$539,598,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $326,551)000.
Problems in the Administration

of the Estate

A fundamental aim of Chapter X is to make available to the court,
the parties and the security holders full and accurate information re
garding the debtor's affairs. The independent trustee customarily
transmits to security holders, pursuant to Section 167 (5), a report on
the history and financial condition of the debtor, the operation of its
8G

COMMISSION

business, and the desirability of its continuance. Such reports enable
security holders to consider suggestions for a plan of reorganization
or proposed plans of others and aid the court in considering problems
before it. The Commission has consulted through its staff with
trustees in connection with their investigations and the preparation of
their reports.
The Commission generally renders assistance to the trustee, the
court and security holders in connection with the varied problems that
arise in the administration of the estate. Of these, the most important
have involved the discovery and prosecution of causes of action against
former management or other .fiduciaries who may have misused their
positions of trust. In this .field of activity, the Commission had
occasion to express its views on several jurisdictional aspects of reor
ganization law during the past year. In one case the Commission sup
ported the contention that the Chapter X trustee had power to pros
ecute and the reorganization court could entertain causes of action
on behalf of debenture holders against their indenture trustee, based
upon alleged breaches of trust, where the debenture holders constituted
only one of several classes of creditors. The Commission took the
view that, since the indenture trustee had .filedan accounting as well as
claims against the estate based upon the balance of an unpaid prom
issory note and indenture trusteeship fees, the Chapter X court had
summary jurisdiction in respect of the causes of action asserted by
the Chapter X trustee in answers and counterclaims to the claims and
accounting. The Commission's view was upheld by the District
Court, and affirmed on appeal.'
Another case in the same field involved the question of the jurisdic
tion of the Chapter X court over certain Swiss banks upon the trustee's
petition for an accounting and other relief. The Commission argued
that the court had summary jurisdiction over the Swiss banks because
they had .filed proofs of claim and received interim distributions on
bonds and because of their active role in the Chapter X proceeding.
The District Court dismissed the trustee's petition and on appeal
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the receipt by the

of plan procedure which would not prevail if such sales were treated
as an administrative matter. In the Toy Pop Oorporation ease," an
offeror agreed to pay the trustee a specified price for all of the debtor's
remaining assets "subject to the approval of the Court." However,
when the trustee filed a plan providing for a sale of the assets at public
auction at not less than the agreed price, the offeror attempted to
withdraw his offer. At the hearing on confirmation of the plan no
other bids were made. The District Court held that the offeror could
withdraw from the agreement because, until court approval, the contract lacked mutuality and was therefore not binding. On appeal,
in an amicus brief, the Commission urged that the contract provision
"subject to the approval of the Court" was a commitment by the
offeror that the contract would be the subject of a plan providing for
a public sale, which was to be subject to approval and confirmation
by the court. The Commission pointed out that the holding of the
District Court would expose sales plans to such contingencies as would
seriously impair the effectiveness of that method of solving the problems of public investors. It was noted that sales plans commonly
incorporated a definite negotiated proposal used either as an upset
price submitted for approval, acceptance and confirmation followed
by a public sale, or as the opening bid of a public sale held in the
course of and as part of the plan hearings, the highest offer being
substituted for the original by amendment to the plan.
The Court of Appeals reversed the order of the District Court 4 and
held that the condition making the contract "subject to the approval
of the Court" could not be held to require approval of the agreement
"without exposing the property to public bidding for a better price."
The Court of Appeals stated that in view of section 216 (10) a contract
of sale entered into with a Chapter X trustee, subject to the approval
of the court "foreshadows, if it does not presuppose, competitive
bidding usually at a public auction."
Activities with Respect to Allowances

The Commission makes specific recommendations to the courts
respecting allowance for fees and expenses. The Commission itself
receives no fees or expenses from estates in reorganization and is
primarily concerned with the fairness of the result to the parties and
the public investors.
In one case during the past year where appeals were taken from an
order of the District Court making certain allowances," the Commission
argued that the fees awarded were excessive in view of the limited
size of the estate, the small amounts realized by creditors and the
amount of services required, and that the allocation of fees was unfair

in that the awards to certain representatives of security holders and
creditors were so low in relation to the benefits performed as to be
contrary to the aims of the statute to encourage contributions by
security holders and creditors. The Commission also pointed out
that the District Court's awards were not based upon specific findings.
The Court of Appeals remanded the matter to the district judge for
specific findings.
In another case the district judge in a detailed opinion 6 acknowl
edged the assistance rendered by the Commission in the evaluation
of the services rendered by the various applicants. The court ob
served that, although not conclusive, the detailed statement of the
Commission indicated a "careful study * * * and a reasonable
valuation of the services rendered, * * *" and that it consequently
should be given "great weight."
Consummation

of Plan

The Commission gives detailed scrutiny to the corporate charters,
bylaws, trust indentures, and other instruments which are to govern
the internal structure of the reorganized debtor. In general the Com
mission strives to assure to investors the inclusion of protective features
and safeguards which its experience has shown to be desirable.
AJ.other matter with which the Commission has been concerned in
connection with the consummation of plan of reorganization is the
problem of unexchanged securities. The Commission has been
anxious to assure that all security holders obtain the new securities
or cash distributable to them under the plan of reorganization.
Chap
ter X provides that a period of not less than five years following the
final decree may be fixed by the judge within which security holders
may make the exchange called for by the plan, after which they are
barred from any participation.
After some experience with the opera
tion of this provision the Commission concluded that in the larger
cases five years may be too short a period and that a longer period
would be more appropriate, depending upon the facts.
The Commission has requested the courts to make provision in the
final decree for diligent efforts by trustees to locate missing security
holders. The Commission has also recommended that before the
bar date is permitted to become effective reports should be filed
of efforts made to locate such security holders, and if adequate efforts
have not been made, the time be extended. In several cases, the
extension of time granted by the court has been efficacious in reducing
the number of security holders who fail to make the exchange. In
some cases, exchanges or securities were complete, or nearly so, as a
result of the activities of the Commission.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939

PURPOSE OF TRUST INDENTURE REGULATION

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes,
debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as
specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an inde rture which
meets the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with
the Commission. The Act operates by requiring the inclusion in
indentures to be qualified of specified provisions which provide means
by which the rights of holders of securities issued under such inden
tures may be protected and enforced. These provisions relate pri
marily to the corporate trustee which must possess designated
standards of eligibility and qualification so as to provide reasonable
financial responsibility and to minimize con:fl.icting interests. The
Act outlaws exculpatory provisions used in the past to eliminate all
liability of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after
default, the duty to use the same degree of care and skill as a prudent
man would use in the conduct ot his own affairs.
QUALIFICATION PROCEDURE

Provisions of the Trust Indenture Act were drafted so as to inte
grate this regulation closely with the requirements of the Securities
Act. Registration pursuant to the Securities Act of securities to be
issued under a trust indenture subjec to the Trust Indenture Act is
not permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms to
the requirements of the latter Act, and necessary information as to
the trustee and the indenture must be contained in the registration
statement.
In the case of securities issued in exchange for other
securities of the same issuer and securities issued under a plan
approved by a court or other proper authority which, although
exempted .rom the registration requirements of the Securities Act,
are not exempted from the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act,
the obligor must file an application for the qualification of the inden
ture, including a statement of the required information concerning
the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.
The Commission's work of examination and qualification of inden
tures during the 1953 fiscal year is shown in tabular form below.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
OF 1940

The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of investment companies, that is, companies engaged
primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, and trading in
securities. The Act requires, among other things, disclosure of the
finances and investment policies of these companies in order to afford
investors complete information with respect to their activities, pro
hibits such companies from changing the nature of their business or
their investment policies without the approval of their stockholders,
bars persons guilty of security frauds from serving as officers and
directors of such companies, regulates the means of custody of the
assets of investment companies, prohibits underwriters, investment
bankers, and brokers from constituting more than a minority of the
directors of such companies, requires management contracts to be
submitted to security holders for their approval, prohibits transactions
between such companies and their officers and directors except with
the approval of the Commission, regulates the issuance of senior
securities of such companies, and prohibits pyramiding of such
companies and cross-ownership of their securities. The Act requires
face amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to
meet maturity payments upon their certificates.
COMPANIES REGISTERED

UNDER THE ACT

As of June 30, 1953, 369 investment companies were' registered
under the Act, and it is estimated that on that date the aggregate
value of their assets was approximately $7,000,000,000. This repre
sents an increase of approximately $200,000,000 in such valuation
over the corresponding total at the beginning of the 1953 fiscal year.
During the nearest comparable period for which data are available,
the 12 months ended March 31, 1953, about 216 registered open-end
management and closed-end management investment companies
reported to the Commission sales to the public of approximately
$764,000,000 of their securities and redemptions and retirements of
approximately $219,000,000, leaving a net investment by the public
in such companies of approximately $545,000,000, compared with a
corresponding net investment for the preceding 12-month period of
approximately $425,000,000.

TYPES OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES REGISTERED DlJRING THE
FISCAL YEAR

During the 1953 :fiscalyear, 17 new investment companies registered
under the Act, of which 8 were open-end management companies
(companies which redeem their shares on presentation by the stock
holders) and 6 were closed-end management companies (in which the
shareholder can realize on his security only by selling it in the open
market). Two unit type companies and one face amount company
were also registered.
Of the 8 open-end management companies which registered under
the Act during the 1953 :fiscal year 2 were organized to invest pri
marily for income consistent with the greatest possible safety of
principal, 1 was organized expressly to seek capital appreciation with
a lesser emphasis upon income, and 1 was unique in that it proposed
to subject up to 25 percent of its investment securities to "puts and
calls." Of the 6 closed-end companies which registered during the
year, 2 were organized to provide media for investment of American
funds in industry in the State of Israel and 2 were industrial companies
which disposed of their business assets and employed the proceeds in
security investments.
The 1953 fiscal year marked the :first registra
tion with the Commission since 1941 of a face amount certificate
company, a type of investment company selling investment contracts
by the terms of which a specified sum is agreed to be paid to the in
vestor if he makes stipulated monthly payments over a period of years.
APPLICATIONS FOR REGISTRATION OF CANADIAN INVESTMENT
COMPANIES

. While foreign investment companies are not forbidden under the
Investment Company Act from purchasing and selling investments in
this country, they must obtain an order by the Commission permitting
them to register under the Act in order to sell their own securities in
the United States. Such an order may be issued by the Commission
only if it :finds that "by reason of special circumstances, it is both
legally and practically feasible effectively to enforce the provision of
the title against such company and that the issuance of such. order is
otherwise consistent with the public interest and the protection of
investors." During the 1953 fiscal year certain applications were
pending on behalf of investment companies incorporated under the
laws of Canada seeking authority to register under the Act and to

NINETEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

sell their securities in this country. These applications present complex legal and other problems, the resolution of which involves many
questions of public policy and the protection of investors.
SELLING LITERATURE
During 1950 the Commission promulgated a Statement of Policy
as to various types of statements commonly employed in the sale of
shares of open-end investment companies which it would thereafter
regard as misleading. In giving effect to this policy the Commission
has been greatly aided by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. The Association with the assistance of the Commission's staff has been engaged in the preparation of a book of interpretations and explanations of the meaning of such Statement of Policy
and what is permissible and not permissible thereunder. It is believed
that the publication of such a book will do much to simplify the work
of explaining and interpreting the Statement of Policy.
During the fiscal year the Commission's staff continued its explora1
tion with the National Association of Securities Dealers of the per- '
missible scope under the Securities Act of so-called institutional !
literature" of open-end investment companies, that is, advertisements,
circulars and other written material which describe open-end investment companies generally without naming any particular company.
Much of this literature has made extravagant and misleading claims
in respect of the merits of investment in such companies. Discussions
have centered upon the possibility of a rule to be promulgated by the
Commission which would permit advertising by brochures, describing
such companies, their types and purposes in a factual manner, before
the solicitation of a purchase by an investor, in order to enable the
investor to appraise these companies generally prior to any offer to
purchase the securities of a specific company.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

APPLICATIONS FILED

One of the functions of the Commission in its regulation of investment companies is to determine whether applications for exemption
filed under various provisions of the Act meet the statutory standards.
During the fiscal year a total of 71 applications were filed under the
various provisions of the Act, including 24 seeking exemption of
proposed transactions between investment companies and affiliates
and 18 seeking a determination that the applicant had ceased to be
an investment company within the meaning of the Act. Since there
were 42 1 applications pending at the beginning of the year, a total
of 113 applications required examination and consideration by the
Commission during the year. Sixty-four were disposed of and 49 were
pending at the close of the year. The various sections of the Act
under which these applications were filed, and the number disposed
of in each category, are shown in the following table.

During the 1953 fiscal year the Commission reviewed its previous
position that section 17 of the Act did not apply to mergers and consolidations of affiliates of investment companies. That section,
generally speaking, prohibits purchases and sales of securities and
other property between affiliates of registered investment companies
and such investment companies or their controlled companies unless
the Commission by order finds the transaction to be fair and consistent with the policies of the investment companies concerned and
the purposes of the Act. In Matter of Phoenix Securities Oorporation,
9 S. E. O. 241 (1941), the Commission had previously determined
that mergers and consolidations were not "sales" or "purchases"
within the scope of section 17 and were therefore outside the jurisdiction of the Commission even though they are effected by affiliates of,

or concern the assets of, registered investment companies or their
affiliates. This decision was based primarily upon the Commission's
previous interpretations of the word "sale" in its administration of
the Securities Act. However, in Matter of E. 1. duPont de Nemours
and Company, Investment Company Act release No. 1837 (1953),
decided during the 1953 fiscal year, the Commission reexamined its
previous position and came to the conclusion that, because of the
essentially different scheme and purpose of the regulation imposed
by the Investment Company Act, the public interest and the protec
tion of investors demanded a construction of section 17 which would
require the approval by the Commission of the merger and consolida
tion of companies affiliated with or controlled by investment com
panies.
One of the more complex applications under the Act was filed in
connection with the merger of Capital Administration Company, Ltd.
into Tri-Continental Corporation. involving section 17 (a) as to the
merger itself (the companies being affiliated) and section 18 (d) as to
the issuance of additional warrants of Tri-Continental in connection
with the merger. The chief problem was the fairness of the issuance
of specified amounts of common stock and warrants of Tri-Continental
for the Class A and Class B stocks of Capital Administration, which
had unique provisions. The Commission, in granting the requested
exemptions, found the terms of the merger reasonable and fair and
permitted the issuance of additional warrants necessary for consum
mation of the plan,"
LITIGATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940

On December 8, 1952, the Commission filed a complaint in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
charging certain individuals, directors and officers of three registered
investment companies, with gross misconduct and gross abuse of
trust pursuant to section 36 of the Investment Company Act and
violations of sections 12 (d), 17 (a) and 18 of that Act. The com
plaint seeks the removal of these individuals from their positions
as officers and directors, an injunction against further violations of
the Act, and the appointment of a receiver to reorganize and liquidate
one or more of these investment companies. Certain preferred stock
holders have intervened in support of the Commission's complaint.
An answer was filed on behalf of the defendants, admitting virtually
all the factual allegations of the complaint but denying the legal
conclusions. S. E. C. v. Home and Foreign Securities Corporation,
et al., S. D. N. Y., Civil Action No. 80-382.
The Commission's complaint alleges that, contrary to their fiduciary
duty, the individual defendants have managed the assets of the in
vestment companies in such manner as to yield no substantial income,
J

Investment Company Act release No. 1845(March 6, 1953).

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and no reasonable expectation of income, for the payment of dividends
on the preferred stocks in the foreseeable future and so as to increase
unfairly and disproportionately the risks and burdens of these pre
ferred stocks. It is further alleged that the individual defendants
have caused the investment companies and their subsidiaries to engage
in excessive borrowing and the pyramiding of control and to enter
into transactions in violation of the Investment Company Act, with
consequences prejudicial to the interests of public security holders
of these investment companies. The defendants, the complaint
alleges, have benefited from their position as members of the manage
ment of these companies by enlarging and perpetuating their control
over the investment companies and of 'the subsidiary companies,
from which the individual defendants receive substantial salaries.

OF THE INVESTMENT
ACT OF 1940

ADVISERS

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration as
investment advisers of persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising others with respect to securities. The Commission
is empowered to deny registration to or revoke the registration of any
adviser who, after notice and opportunity tor hearing, is found by the
Commission to have been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct
in connection with securities transactions or to have made false
statements in his application for registration. The Act makes it
unlawful for investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud or deceit, requires investment advisers to disclose the nature
of their interest in transactions executed for their clients, prohibits
profit-sharing arrangements, and prevents assignment of investment
advisory contracts without the client's consent.

Of the registered investment advisers 263 represented in their

A total of 235 investment advisers are registered also as brokers and
dealers in securities. Most of the remainder offer various combina~ionsof invest-nent services.
During fiscal 1953, the Commission instituted proceedings under
the Invest-nent Advisers Act to revoke the registration of Amleto
Gudenzi and under the Securities Exchange Act to revoke his brokerdealer registration. The Commission found that respondent and his
son, who was employed in respondent's business as manager, were

permanently enjoined by a decree of the Supreme Court of the State
of N ew York from engaging in or continuing certain conduct and
practices in connection with the purchase and sale of securities and
that his son had been convicted of a felony involving the purchase
and sale of securities arising out of the conduct of the broker-dealer
and investment advisory business of respondent. Both the injunction
and the conviction were based on misappropriations of securities and
funds of customers by the son, to whom respondent had given a
blanket power of attorney. The registrations of Gudenzi as an
investment adviser and a broker-dealer were revoked.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION


COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

At the beginning of the 1953 fiscal year there were pending in the
courts 19 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices
in the sale of securities. During the year, 22 additional proceedings
were instituted and 28 cases were disposed of, leaving 13 proceedings
pending at the end of the year. In addition the Commission partici
pated in a large number of reorganization cases under Chapter X of
the Bankruptcy Act, in 23 proceedings in the district courts under
section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and in 16
miscellaneous actions, usually as amicus curiae, to advise the court of
its views regarding the construction of provisions of statutes adminis
tered by it which were involved in private lawsuits. The Commission
also participated in 39 appeals. Of these, 10 came before the courts
on petition for review of an administrative order, 10 arose out of corpo
rate reorganizations in which the Commission had taken an active
part, 4 were appeals in actions brought by or against the Commission,
7 were appeals from orders entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 8 were appeals in cases in
which the Commission appeared as amicus curiae.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year,
are contained in the appendix tables.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during the
year are discussed in the sections of this report devoted to the statutes
under which the litigation arose.
CriJninal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the trans
mission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General, who may
institute criminal proceedings. The Commission, largely through its
regional offices, investigates suspected violations and, in cases where
the facts appear to warrant criminal prosecution, prepares detailed
reports which are forwarded to the Attorney General. Commission
employees familiar with the case often assist the United States attor
neys in its presentation to the grand jury, the conduct of the trial, and
the preparation of briefs on appeal. The Commission also submits
parole reports prepared by its investigators relating to convicted
offenders. Where an investigation discloses violations of statutes

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

other than those administered by the Commission, the Commission
advises the appropriate Federal or State agency.
Indictments were returned against 2,184 defendants in 505 cases
developed by the Commission prior to JUly 1, 1953.1 These figures
include 23 defendants in 14 cases in which indictments were returned
during the 1953 fiscal year. At the close of the fiscal year, of .468
cases disposed of as to 1 or more defendants, convictions had been
obtained in 409 cases," or over 87 percent, against a total of 1,179
defendants. Convictions were obtained of 19 defendants in 12 cases
during the fiscal year."
In addition, two defendants in one case were found guilty of criminal contempt for violating an injunctive decree' and in two other
cases the parole of one defendant and conditional release of another
were revoked as a result of Commission investigations.
A judgment of conviction was affirmed on appeal in one case as to
one defendant and the convictions of two defendants were reversed
for trial errors in two other cases, but convictions were obtained
in both of these cases upon retrial." After the close of the fiscal year,
the convictions of seven defendants in another case were all sustained
on appeal.
As in prior years, the criminal cases developed and prosecuted
during the fiscal year covered a wide variety of fraudulent conduct.
They included frauds relating to mining and oil and gas ventures,
insurance company promotions, the operation of purported investment
plans, the promotion of inventions and new businesses and the manipulation of securities on a national stock exchange, as well as fraudulent
practices on the part of securities brokers and dealers and their representatives and an investment adviser. In a number of fraud cases,
the defendants also were charged with willfully violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act.
Convictions for the fraudulent sale of securities in connection with
oil and gas ventures were obtained in U. S. v. Floyd J. W~lson6 (N. D.
Tex.) and U. S. v. Joseph Popkins, et al. (W. D. Tenn.). Wilson and
Popkins entered pleas of guilty and were sentenced to prison terms of
5 and 3 years, respectively. The defendants in these cases were
charged with making false representations concerning ownership of
the oil and gas leases involved, drilling operations, oil producing

potentialities of the properties, value of the securities being sold and
numerous other matters.
Other oil and gas promotions in which indictments are pending are
U. S. v. George F. Vasen (N. D. Ill.); U. S. v. Ben H. Frank (W. D.
Okla.); U. S. v. Ralph Frank Hamilton (D. Mont.) i U. S. v. Melton
E. Lightfoot (S. D. Fla.); and U. S. v. Francis N. Campbell (N. D.
Ill.).
In the Vasen case, which is said to involve the second deepest well
in existence, the well having reached a depth of 20,450 feet, it is
charged that the defendant made misrepresentations such as that the
well was going through an "Atlantic Ocean of Oil," that geologists
believed that the producing formation extended completely across the
state of Mississippi and possibly up to Pennsylvania, and that the oil
sands encountered assured production of thousands of barrels of oil
per day. The Frank case includes charges of misrepresentation concerning a so-called "magnetic logger" device which was held out to
investors as insuring 100 percent accuracy in the location of oil pools.
In the Hamilton and Lightfoot cases, the defendants are charged with
misrepresenting to investors, among other things, the likelihood of
returns on their investments and the use which was to be made of the
funds obtained from them. In the Campbell case, the indictment,
among other things, charges the defendant with employing the fraudulent "Ponzi" technique, in that, in order to induce investors to make
additional investments, he caused to be returned to them as "dividends" a portion of their prior investments.
The "Ponzi" device also was employed in U. S. v. Peter E. Picotte
(E. D. Mo.), where the defendant was sentenced to a 5 year prison
term for the fraudulent sale of notes in connection with the promotion
of an insurance business financing scheme." In U. S. v. Floyd W. Beck
et al. (W. D. Mo.), where prison terms of 4 years and 3 years were
imposed on two defendants and a third defendant was placed on probation for 3 years for the fraudulent sale of preferred and common
stock of United Insurers Service Company of Missouri, a corporation
falsely described by the defendants as an insurance company.'
The defendant in U. S. v. Theodore E. Lobman (N. D. Ill.) entered
a plea of guilty of charges that he fraudulently sold stock and other
securities relating to spurious profit-sharing plans purportedly controlled by him," Fictitious profit-sharing opportunities also are included as part of the fraudulent scheme charged in the indictment
pending in U. S. v. Hardy Joseph Owens et 01. (S. D. Fla.). The defendants are alleged to have established dummy corporations whose
capitalization consisted of worthless checks and represented that they
were engaged in negotiating many business transactions in which inFor additional details concerning this case, see 18th Annual Report p, 174.

vestors might profitably participate, when, in fact, such negotiations
were either non-existent or were not being carried on in good faith
with any intent to consummate them. In U. S. v. LeRoy Williams
Ross (S. D. Okla.), another pending case, the indictment charges that
in the sale of stock of Gulf Coast Oil Processing, Inc., the defendant
made false representations concerning the establishment and financing
of a tung oil plant through funds purportedly available from the defendant, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and money obtained from investors.
Fraud in the sale of stock of the American Patent Protective Association, Inc., and the Association for Promotion of Patented Articles,
Inc., and other securities is charged in the pending indictment in U. S.
v. Adolph F. von Soden et al. (D. Nev.), which involved the alleged
promotion of a "Dust Collector and Air Purifier," a "Ribbon-Reinking
device," a "Tweezer-Lite" and other patented devices purportedly
owned by the Association for Promotion of Patented Articles, Inc."
A gold mining promotion, involving the sale of stock of Yankee
Mines, Inc. resulted in conviction of all three defendants in U. S. v,
Troy E. Becker et al. (D. Idabo). Becker and his co-defendants entered pleas of guilty to fraud charges which included alleged misrepresentations concerning the availability of ore deposits on the properties controlled by Yankee Mines, Inc. and the use to be made of the
proceeds received from investors, as well as other matters. The defendants were sentenced to 3 year suspended prison terms and placed
on probation for 5 years.
An alleged manipulation of the stock of Universal Laboratories, Inc.
is involved in the pending indictment in U. S. v. David L. Shindler et al.
(S. D. N. Y.). The defendants are charged with effecting on the New
York Stock Exchange a series of transactions creating actual and
apparently active trading in and raising the price of the common stock
of Universal Laboratories, Inc., for the purpose of inducing others to
buy that stock.
A conviction for fraudulent conduct on the part of a broker-dealer
was obtained in U. S. v. Kenneth B. Hill (D. Mass.). Hill entered a
plea of guilty to an information charging him with the sale of forged
securities and the filing of a false financial statement with the Commission. In U. S. v. RU8seU K. Barnes (S. D. Cal.), the defendant, a
securities salesman for a broker-dealer firm, pleaded guilty to a fraud
indictment which charged him with converting funds received from
customers for the purchase of securities and with paying fictitious dividends and profits to such customers for the purpose of concealing his
conversions.

Inc. (now known as Doubling Company, Inc.), and certain of its
representatives with having engaged in a course of business which
operated as a fraud and deceit upon the firm's customers. Among
other things, the indictment charges that the defendants obtained the
trust and confidence of persons inexperienced in securities matters
who were induced to become customers of the firm and that, contrary
to the best interests of these customers, the defendants overtraded and
"churned" their customers' accounts for the purpose of increasing their
own commissions, fees, and profits."
The first criminal convictions for violation of the antifraud provi
sions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 were obtained during
the fiscal year in U. S. v. Howard C. Hageman et al. (S. D. N. Y.).
Hageman and two corporate codefendants entered pleas of guilty to
charges that they employed a scheme to defraud their investment
advisory clients. Hageman was sentenced to a two year prison term.
The corporations were each fined nominal amounts. According to the
indictment, the defendants, under the pretext of rendering impartial
investment advice to their clients, induced them to purchase the stock
of Hageman Properties, Inc., on the basis of false representations con
cerning the value of the assets owned by the corporation, the profitable
ness of its operations, its financial condition and other matters; and
also concealed from them that the defendant Hageman had suffered
substantial losses in connection with the operation of various of the
properties transferred by him to Hageman Properties, Inc., had
organized this corporation in an attempt to salvage his previous unsuc
cessful financial operations and had transferred these properties to it at
prices greatly in excess ot the cost of such properties to him.
In the Matter oj Francis D. Graves and Earl E. Brown (E. D. Wash.),
both respondents were found guilty of criminal contempt for violating
an injunctive decree, entered March 5, 1951, enjoining them from
further violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the
Securities Act. The respondents entered pleas of guilty to charges
that, in contempt of the decree, they had continued to sell interests in
certain mining and timber leases in Idaho by means of untrue state
ments relating to such matters as the ownership of the leases, the use
to be made of the proceeds received from the sale of interests and the
amount and value of the ore on the properties.
Another criminal contempt action is pending in U. S. ex rel. SEC v .
E. Randall Henderson (E. D. Mich.). Henderson is alleged to have
continued to sell a variety of unregistered oil securities to residents of
Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Indiana, in violation of an injunc
tive decree prohibiting him and others from selling fractional undivided
interests in oil and gas rights and like securities without such securities
being registered with the Commission under the Securities Act.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

On appeal, a conviction for the fraudulent sale of securities in the
promotion of an allegedly new type of lawnmower was affirmed in
Bobbro.ffv. U. S., 202 F. 2d 389 (C. A. 9,1953).11 In two other appel
late cases, Price v. U. S., 200 F. 2d 652 (C. A. 5, 1953), and Henderson

lant on basis of other alleged errors denied, 204 F. 2d 126) convictions
were reversed for certain trial errors, but in each of these cases the
defendants were convicted upon retrial. In the Price case, after re
versal of his conviction, the defendant was fined $5,000 upon his plea
of nolo contendere to charges that he violated the registration provisions
of the Securities Act in the sale of investment contracts involving
Texas oil and gas lease assignments." The defendant in the Henderson
case, upon retrial after the close of the :fiscal year, was again found
guilty by a jury of violating the mail fraud statute in connection with
sale of fractional undivided interests in oil and gas rights relating to
certain Louisiana properties." Henderson, who was sentenced to a
five year prison term and fined $1,000, has appealed again.
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, judgments of convictions
of all seven defendants were sustained on appeal in Llanos et al. v,
U. S., 206 F. 2d 852 (C. A. 9, 1953). This case involved a scheme to
defraud residents of the Territory of Hawaii, principally plantation
laborers, in connection with the sale of securities issued by the
defendants."
COMPLAINTS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission contains pro
visions authorizing investigations of possible violations thereof. These
investigations are conducted primarily by the regional offices under
the administrative supervision of the principal officewhich also, when
possible, makes available members of its staff to assist in the more
complex investigations.
Investigations are classified as preliminary or docketed. A pre
liminary investigation is initiated when information is received
indicating a possible violation of one of the Acts and is usually con
ducted by telephone inquiries, interviews or a limited amount of
correspondence. This frequently will disclose either that no violation
has occurred, or that there may have been an inadvertent violation
through misunderstanding of the law. The inquiry in many cases
serves to educate inadvertent violators and to bring about compliance
before any damage or loss results to the investing public. Should

the preliminary investigation reveal a wide-spread public interest
or the likelihood of a substantial violation, the case becomes docketed
and a full scale investigation is undertaken.
The Commission is authorized, under the various Acts, to issue
subpoenas and to delegate this power to its employees. An officer
designated by the Commission in a particular case may issue a subpoena requiring the production of books, records, and other documents
for examination, and may require the attendance of witnesses to
testify under oath, which the officer is empowered to administer.
This delegation is made by the Commission in specific instances
through the issuance of an order, limited to the persons named
therein as officers and to the purposes of the particular investigation,
and only upon a showing to the Commission that necessary evidence
cannot be otherwise obtained. During the fiscal year 56 such orders
were entered.
Upon completion of an investigation, a report is prepared in the
regional office which is transmitted to the principal office with the
recommendation of the Regional Administrator for the institution
of appropriate action, or for closing the investigation if the evidence
does not appear to warrant action by the Commission. These reports
and recommendations are reviewed in the principal officebefore being
presented to the Commission.
The statutes administered by the Commission provide for civil
proceedings to enjoin violations, reference of evidence to the Attorney
General where the evidence warrants criminal prosecution, and administrative proceedings with respect to registered securities and brokerdealers. In addition to those mentioned, the Commission also refers
evidence of violations of other federal statutes and state laws to •
appropriate federal or state authorities. During the fiscal year,
references were made to other authorities in 44 instances.
The following table reflects the investigative activities of the Commission during the fiscal year:

S~CURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

The Commission maintains in the Office of the General Counsel a
Section of Securities Violations for assistance in the enforcement of
the various statutes which it administers and to provide a further
means of preventing fraud in the purchase and sale of securities.
This Section has developed files which serve as a clearing house for
information concerning persons who have been charged with violations
of various Federal and State securities statutes which the Section
maintains. The specialized information in these files has been kept
current through the cooperation of the United States Post Office
Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials, State securities commissions, Federal and State
prosecuting attorneys, police officers, Better Business Bureaus, and
members of the United States Chamber of Commerce. By the end
of the 1953 fiscal year these records contained data concerning
58,211 persons against whom Federal or State action had been taken
in connection with securities violations.
During the past year alone additional items of information relating
to 4,387 persons were added to the records of this Section, including
information concerning 1,692persons not previously identified therein.
Extensive use is made of this clearing house of information. During
the past year, the Commission received 3,330 securities violations
letters or reports and dispatched 2,236 communications to cooperating
agencies.
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The several Acts administered by the Commission provide that
•
 dependable, informative financial statements, which disclose the
financial status and earnings history and potentialities of a corporation or other commercial entity, shall be made a part of registration
statements, applications for registration, and periodic reports required
to be filed with the Commission.
The Acts administered by the Commission and rules adopted thereunder provide that the financial statements required to be filed with
the Commission shall be certified by independent public accountants.
The value of certification by qualified accountants has been conceded
for many years, but the requirement as to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some individual accountants, was for the
first time authoritatively and explicitly introduced into statutes. Out
of these provisions and the administration thereof by the Commission
there have grown concepts of accountant-client relationships that
have strengthened the protection afforded investors.
The Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for
companies subject to the provisions of the Holding Company Act,ll;

has adopted rules under the Securities Exchange Act governing ac
counting and auditing of securities brokers and dealers, and has
promulgated rules contained in a single, comprehensive regulation,
known as Regulation S_X,16which govern the form and content of
financial statements filed in compliance with the various Acts. These
regulations are implemented by the Accounting Series releases, of
which about 75 have been issued, designed to make public from time
to time opinions on accounting principles for the purpose of contrib
uti ig to the development of uniform standards and practice in major
accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established,
except for the uniform systems of accounts, prescribe the accounting
to be followed only in certain basic respects. In the large area not
covered by such rules the Commission's principal reliance for the
protection of investors is on the determination and application of
accounting principles and standards which are recognized as sound and
which have attained general acceptance.
Changes and new developments in financial and economic condi
tions affect the operations and financial status of the several thousand
commercial and industrial companies required to file statements with
the Commission. The Commission, therefore, must be informed of
changes and new developments in these fields and must make certain
that the effects thereof are properly reported to investors. The
Commission's accounting staff therefore engages in study and research
designed to establish and maintain appropriate accounting procedures
and practices. Furtherance of these activities requires constant con
tact and cooperation between the staff and accountants both individu
ally and through such representative groups as, among others, the
American Accounting Association, the American Institute of Ac
countants, the Controllers Institute of America, and the National
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, as well as other
governmental agencies.
During the year the Commission found it necessary to give con
sideration to a change in procedure recommended by the American
Institute of Accountants with respect to the accounting for options
granted by corporations to their employees and officers to purchase
stock of such corporations. These option arrangements, which have
been adopted by an increasing number of industrial companies filing
financial statements with the Commission, are found in a variety of
forms. While some of the plans have given the optionees the unre
stricted right to exercise the options immediately, others have required
that the optionees remain in the employ of the company for a specific
period before they have the unrestricted right to exercise the options,
and still others have been granted the right to purchase a specified
'number of shares each year over a period of years provided the

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

optionees are in the employ of the company upon each such option
date.
Prior to 1950 many of these plans fixed the purchase price at sub
stantially less than the market price of the stock optioned at the date
the option was granted. Because of the change in the income tax
law in 1950 with respect to the saxability of optioned stock, many
corporations have changed their methods of granting options. Some
of the plans adopted since that date continue to set the option price
at varying amounts under the market price, but in most instances
the option price is substantially the same as market.
The fact that such plans afford benefits to the participating em
ployees which are susceptible of monetary expression has been recog
nized in court decisions and in the varying treatments which have
been accorded such options under the Internal Revenue Code.
Under these circumstances the Commission has required financial
statements filed with it to reflect amounts corresponding to the
benefit to the optionees as charges against income of the issuer in the
period or periods in which the optionees first obtained the unrestricted
right to exercise their options, a procedure concurred in by the ac
counting profession, as indicated by Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 37, issued in November 1948 by the American Institute of Ac
countants. As of a recent date this bulletin was revised to indicate
that the date on which an option is granted is the date that should
be used in determining such compensation and that the amount of
compensation to be recorded in the accounts of the corporation should
be the excess of the fair value of the optioned stock over the option
price as at that date.
In view of the revision of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 37,
the Commission deemed it necessary and appropriate to give consid
eration to the adoption of a rule requiring a corporation which grants
options to its officers and employees to acquire its capital stock,
thereby incurring costs in the form of compensation to the optionees,
to account for such costs, at the time the optionees have complied
fully with the terms of the option, by charging corporate income with
an amount equal to the fair value of the stock over the option price
at that date. This would continue in effect the procedure the Com
mission had required in the past.
The Commission announced its intention of promulgating such a
rule in a public release and invited all interested persons to express
their views thereon. After further consideration of the question
in the light of the comments received the Commission deemed it
inappropriate to prescribe a procedure for determining the amount of
cost, if any, of these stock options to be reflected in profit and loss
or income statements filed with the Commission. However, in order
that investors may be apprised of the monetary significance of the
concessions made by registrants to officers and employees through

NINETEENTH

the granting of stock options, the Commission, on November 3,
1953, adopted rule 3-20 (d), to be added to Regulation S-X, which
requires full and complete disclosure of all stock option arrangements
in financial statements filed with the Commission."
During the fiscal year the Commission issued its Findings, Opinion
and Order in a proceeding instituted under rule II (e) of its Rules of
Practice against Haskins & Sells, a firm of certified public accountants,
and Andrew Stewart, a partner in that firm. The Commission found
that respondents had failed to devote the care and inquiry required
by the circumstances in connection with the preparation and certifi
cation of balance sheets for use in a registration statement filed by
Thomascolor, Incorporated, grossly overstating intangible assets and
attributing to apparently potentially productive items material
amounts which should have been shown as promotion services. The
Commission concluded that it was necessary to deny respondents the
privilege of practicing before the Con-mission for a period of ten days.
OFFICE

OF OPINION WRITING

The Office of Opinion Writing aids the Commission in the prepara
tion of :findings, opinions, and orders promulgated by the Commission
in contested and other cases arising under statutes administered by
it. These statutes provide for a wide variety of administrative pro
ceedings which require quasi-judicial determination by the Commis
sion. Formal opinions are issued in all cases where the matter to be
decided, whether substantive or procedural, is of sufficient impor
tance to warrant a formal expression of views.
The Office of Opinion Writing is an independent staff office which
is directly responsible to the Commission. It receives all assignments
and instructions from and makes recommendations and submits its
work to the Commission directly. In the preparation of opinions
assigned to the Office of Opinion Writing, the members of this office
do not consult with members of the operating division actively par
ticipating in the proceedings and it is an invariable rule that those
assigned to prepare such an opinion must not have had any prior
participation in any phase of the proceedings with respect to which
the opinion is to be prepared. Commission experts are from time to
time consulted on technical problems arising in the course of the
preparation of opinions and :findings, but these experts are never
individuals who have participated in the development of the case.
The :findingsof fact, opinions, and orders adopted and promulgated
by the Commission serve as an aid and guide to the bench and bar.
With minor exceptions (e. g., certain opinions dealing with requests
for confidential treatment) all are publicly released and distributed
to representatives of the press and persons on the Commission's
mailing list.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The creation of the Office of Opinion Writing as an independent
staff unit in 1942 was based on the view that the exercise of the Com
mission's adjudicatory functions in many types of cases made it
appropriate that it be assisted in that function by members of its
staff who were independent of units engaged in investigation or
prosecution of cases. The desirability of this arrangement was sub
sequently given express recognition in specific provisions of the
Administrative Procedure Act, which in certain types of cases requires
that there be a separation between quasi-prosecutory functions and
quasi-judicial functions. The existence of the Office of Opinion
Writing thus facilitated the Commission's compliance with the sepa
ration of function requirements contained in that Act.
In addition to its primary function, the Office of Opinion Writing
is given assignments of a general nature which are not inconsistent
with the objective of the separation between the investigatory and
quasi-judicial functions, for example, supervising the preparation of
the Commission's annual report to the Congress.
INTERNATIONAL

FINANCIAL

AND ECONOMIC MATTERS

During the fiscal year registration statements covering $198.275,539
of securities issued by foreign issuers, government and private, wero
filed under the Securities Act. Of this amount $184,710,539 repre
sented Canadian offerings, and the balance of $12,565,000 represented
the offerings of two private foreign issuers.
The Commission had representation on the Staff Committee of tho
National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial
Problems, and on the United Nations Economic Committee of the
Department of State. The Commission furnished information to
other departments of government and to the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development concerning the effect of a Brazilian
decree governing treatment of United States investors in that country.
Consultations were held on a proposed law for the treatment of
foreign investors to be adopted by the government of Greece, and
on a law for the modification of securities proposed by the govern
ment of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Commission's For
eign Economic Adviser has also consulted with the Office of Alien
Property with respect to Japanese and German bonds which had
been vested by that agency.
In September 1952 a delegation representing the government of
Japan informed the Commission of the progress in the settlement of
Japan's prewar bonded debt and sought information as to the require
ments applicable to new bonds to be offered under the settlement.
On February 27, 1953, negotiations for the settlement of the pre
war external German debts, in which the Commission had partici
pated through representation on the Interdepartmental Committee
on German Debts, were concluded by the signing of the Agreement

~NETEENTH

~AL

REPORT

111

on German External Debts. This Agreement and other agreements
with the Federal Republic of Germany were forwarded to the Senate
for ratification on April 10, 1953, and referred to the Committee on
Foreign Relations. The Commission's Foreign Economic Adviser
testified before that Committee.
After discussions in which the Commission participated, the Ger
man govemment enacted on August 25, 1952, a law for the Valida
tion of German Foreign Currency Bonds. Thereupon representatives
of the Commission and the State Department prepared drafts of the
implementing ordinance, and of the agreement between the United
States and Germany regarding the validation of German dollar bonds.
These drafts were discussed with representatives of the financial com
munity so that implementation of the German validation law would
be adapted to the practice of United States securities markets. Vali
dation procedures are necessary to prevent the sale or the settlement
of German dollar bonds previously purchased for retirement, but
which had disappeared when the Soviet armed forces occupied Berlin
in 1945. To prevent the sale of these looted bonds in the United
States markets, the Commission on two occasions during the fiscal
year publicly renewed its request that brokers and dealers refrain
from dealing in German dollar bonds until the establishment of vali
dation procedures and the filing of appropriate reports with the
Commission.
The then Chairman of the Commission headed a mission to Ger
many early in 1953 to discuss (1) resumption of trading in German
securities on United States markets, especially the requirements of
registration and the filing of information under the Securities Act and
the Securities Exchange Act; (2) extension by the German Federal
Republic of the bar dates for validation of German securities denom
inated in reichsmarks; and (3) problems relating to the application
in the United States of German law for validation of securities denom
inated in foreign currencies. Following these discussions the imple
menting ordinance under the German Validation Law for German
dollar bonds was approved by the two governments and, following
informal consultation with the Foreign Relations Committee of the
Senate, the Executive Agreement regarding validation of German
dollar bonds was signed in Bonn on February 27, 1953. On June 9,
1953, the Validation Board for German Dollar Bonds announced the
opening of its offices at 30 Broad Street, New York City. Holders of
German dollar bonds may present them to that Board for validation.
During the fiscal year the Department of State and the Commis

of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and
the International Monetary Fund held in Mexico City in September
1952.
The International Bank in October 1952 offered in the United
States $60 million 3~ percent bonds due October 15, 1971. The bonds
were offered at 98 by an underwriting group of 139 members. It is
reported that purchases of this issue were made by persons in 34 states
and the District of Columbia and in 8 foreign countries. Domestic
purchases accounted for 65 percent of the total issue and were made
principally by savings banks, life insurance companies, and pension
and trust funds. During the year the Bank also offered 50 million
Swiss franc 3~ percent bonds due 1962. These bonds were offered
in Switzerland in November 1952 at a price of 98~. In the distribution of these issues of bonds, the Bank made available a prospectus
giving information about the Bank's structure and operation. It
also filed with the Commission, pursuant to Regulation BW adopted
by the Commission under the amendment to the Bretton Woods
Agreements Act, information comparable to that which would be
required if its securities had been registered under the Securities Act
and the Securities Exchange Act.
The Commission does not at this time recommend any change in
the exempt status of securities of the International Bank.
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS,
DOCUMENTS

REPORTS,

OR

The Commission is empowered to grant confidential treatment,
upon application by registrants, to certain types of information which
would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications, reports,
or other documents filed under Acts administered by the Commission.
Accordingly, rule 485 under the Securities Act provides that information as to material contracts, or portions thereof, filed as a part of
a registration statement will be held confidential by the Commission
if it determines that disclosure would impair the value of the contracts
and is not necessary for the protection of investors. Other rules
prescribe the holding of information confidential where disclosure
thereof would be detrimental to the national security and under
other circumstances.
The number and disposition of applications for confidential treatment pending during the year under specified statutes are tabulated
below.

STATISTICS

AND SPECIAL STUDIES

The Commission has a considerable amount of financial data
concerning American corporations accumulated in connection with
its administrative functions and publishes certain statistical series,
which are used by the Congress, other governmental departments,
investment and financial institutions, and the general public. The
statistical series which have been prepared during the last fiscal
year are described below.
CAPITAL MARKETS
AU New Securities Offerings

The Commission has continued its monthly series on new securities
offerings which is published in the Statistical Bulletin, and a quarterly
series which is published in release form and contains a brief analysis
of the data. These statistics show the volume and character of all
new securities offered for cash sale in the United States, including
both registered and unregistered securities, and public and private
offerings.
According to these data, corporations offered for cash sale during
the fiscal year securities having a value of $9 billion, the largest amount
of new issues in any year since 1929, and exceeding the amount offered
in the 1952 fiscal period, which was the previous record volume in
recent years, by $800 million. These figures are exclusive of sales
by investment companies and other issues sold continuously, such as
special offerings to employees. Thus the figures differ from statistics
of issues effectively registered under the Securities Act shown in other
sections of this report. There are other important differences as well.
For example, the series on offerings includes only issues offered for
cash sale for the account of issuers, includes not only issues publicly
offered but also those privately placed, and includes other issues
exempt from registration under the Securities Act, such as intrastate
offerings and railroad securities. The statistics on new cash offerings
are given in tables 2 through 4 of the appendix, and more details on
the coverage of the series appear in the footnotes to the tables. The
chart on page 114 shows the classification of all new corporate offer
ings according to type of security, public and private offering, and
uses of net proceeds.
The $9.4 billion of corporate securities offered in the 1953 fiscal
year compares with $8.6 billion in the 1952 fiscal year and $6.7 billion
in the 1951 year. The amount of net proceeds from securities offer
ings designated for plant and equipment expenditures by all com
panies totaled $6.0 billion while the amount used to supplement
working capital was $2.1 billion. In addition, $1.2 billion was to be

used for refunding outstanding securities, repayment of bank loans
and other purposes.
Of total corporate securities issued in the 1953 period, 58 percent
was publicly offered and 42 percent privately placed. Private place
ments reached a new record for such transactions, totaling $4.0
billion. Separate statistics on private placements of corporate issues,
classified by type of security and industry of issuer, appear in appendix
table 2, part 4, while comparisons of the volume of public and private
offerings are given in appendix table 4.
Including both public and private offerings, debt financing by cor
porations amounted to $7.5 billion, preferred stock issues, $500 million,
and common stock, $1.4 billion. The distribution of offerings among
the various industry groups was as follows: manufacturing, 34 percent;.
electric, gas and water, 30 percent; financial (exclusive of net sales byinvestment companies) and real estate, 14 percent; communication, g.
percent; and the balance of 14 percent composed of issues in the railroad, other transportation, commercial and miscellaneous categories;
The noncorporate securities included $14.2 billion of U. S. Govern
ment securities, $4.5 billion of state and local securities, $300 million
of Federal agency securities and $200 million foreign government
issues.
Issues Registered Under Securities Act of 1933

Statistics of all securities registered under the Securities Act of
1933 are published at quarterly intervals in the Statistical Bulletin.
and a discussion of the data for the fiscal year ended June 1953 appears.
in part I of this report. In addition, appendix table 1 presents infor..
mation on the number and volume of registrations by months and
also classifies the issues registered according to method of distribu ..
tion, industry of issuer, purpose of registration, and use of net proceeds.
Investmenr Cempanfes

Data are published quarterly in the Statistical Bulletin for over
200 management investment companies registered under the Invest

ment Company Act of 1940. The statistics include purchases and
sales of their own securities, portfolio changes, and aggregates of
securities and assets, segregated by open-end and closed-end types.
Sales, net of repurchases, of the issues of these companies amounted
to half a billion dollars in the fiscal year ended June 1953, approxi
mately the same as in the preceding fiscal year.
Cost of Flotation

Data are collected on the costs of selling securities, including
issues registered under the Securities Act and issues placed privately.
These data cover commissions and fees of investment bankers and
other expenses incurred in marketing securities, such as fees to
attorneys, accountants, taxes, printing expenses, etc.

116

SECURITIES AND EXcHANGE

COMMISSION

STOCK MARKETS

Statistics are regularly compiled and published in the Statistical
Bulletin on the market value and volume of sales on registered and
exempted securities exchanges, round-lot stock transactions on the
N ew York exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, oddlot stock transactions on the N ew York exchanges, special offerings
and secondary distributions. Figures on round-lot and odd-lot stock
transactions are also published weekly with the release on stock market
indexes.
The indexes of stock market prices were continued during the 1953
fiscal year. These indexes are based upon the weekly closing market
prices of 265 common stocks listed on the N ew York Stock Exchange,
and are composed of seven major industry groups, 29 subordinate
groups, and a composite group. These data are published in the
Statistical Bulletin and are also released weekly.
SAVING STUDY

The Commission compiles and releases at quarterly intervals esti
mates of the volume and composition of individuals' saving in the
United States. The study shows aggregate value of saving in each
quarter and also the form in which the saving was made such as
investment in securities, expansion of currency holdings, bank
deposits, etc.
The estimates show that during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1953 individuals saved more in liquid form than at any time since the
end of the war, the amount totalling $17.1 billion. Individuals
added $8.4 billion to their equity in life insurance and government
pension reserves, such as Social Security funds, increased their cur
rency and bank deposits by $7.4 billion, made net purchases of
-seeurities totalling $8.2 billion and in addition, increased their shares
in savings and loan associations' by $3.5 billion. During the same
period individuals added substantially to their debt, increasing
mortgage debt by $6.3 billion and other debt by $4.1 billion.
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

EXPENDITURES

OF U. S. BUSINESS

The Commission, with the Department of Commerce, continued
the joint series of quarterly releases on the plant and equipment
expenditures of United States business other than agriculture. Shortly
after the close of each quarter these releases present industry totals
on the actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated
expenditure,s for the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is
made at the beginning of each year of the plans of business as regards
expansion during that year. These data have provided an index of
present and future activity in the capital markets and of business in
general.

NINETEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

117

The survey indicates that during the fiscal year ended June 1953,
American business, exclusive of agriculture, spent a record amount
of $26.9 billion for expansion of plant and new equipment. According
to their plans at mid-1953, manufacturing companies expected to
make plant and equipment expenditures of $12.7 billion in the calendar
year 1953, about 6 percent above the 1952 amount. A larger increase
was expected in the expenditures of nondurable goods industries than
of manufacturers of durable goods as compared with 1952.
FINANCIAL

POSITION

OF CORPORATIONS

Working Capital Position

The series of quarterly releases on the working capital position of

all United States corporations, exclusive of banks and insurance
companies, was continued. These releases show the principal com
ponents of current assets and current liabilities and an abbreviated
analysis of the sources and uses of corporate funds. These data are
important in measuring the liquid position of the corporate segment
of the economy taken as a whole.
At the end of June 1953, the net working capital of United States
corporations reached a record of $88.2 billion. At that date corpo
rations held $29.2 billion of cash and $19.2 billion of United States
Government securities, these together amounting to 52.3 percent of
their current liabilities.
Balance Sheet and Income

Statements

The Commission, with the Federal Trade Commission, continued
the joint series of quarterly industrial financial reports, which were
developed as an extension of the working capital series. Complete
balance sheet data and an abbreviated income account have been
published for manufacturing companies since the first quarter of 1947.
Data are shown for various size groups of corporations and for minor
industry groups. The financial report program includes data on
profits.
RECOMMENDATIONS

FOR FURTHER

LEGISLATION

The Commission has under study a number of legislative proposals
relating to the Acts it administers which have been received from
various groups in the field of securities and finance. These legislative
proposals are largely concerned with technical changes in these Acts.
It is expected that these proposals shortly will be submitted to the
Executive Office of the President and to the appropriate Congressional
committees for consideration.

773

During the fiscal year 1953, a further reduction in its appropriation
compelled the Commission to reduce its staff from 866 to 773. This
was accomplished by reduction in force and by not filling vacancies
which arose through normal turnover. This reduction continued a
downward trend which has seen average employment drop to a figure
which is less than half of what it was in 1941. Since June 30, 1950,
the Commission has reduced its payroll by 225 persons, or 22.5
percent. The appropriation for the 1953 fiscal year permitted an
average employment of 814 and in fiscal 1954, the Commission's
appropriation will allow an estimated average employment of 750.
As is apparent from the preceding discussions of the work of the
Commission, these decreases in personnel have not been accompanied
by commensurate decreases in duties.
To increase the efficiency and economy of operations, the Commission effected several organizational and operating changes in the
fiscal year 1953.
In May 1953, the Commission separated the administration of its
regulatory functions under the Investment Company Act of 1940
from the administration of the disclosure and reporting requirements
of that Act by transferring the regulatory functions from the Division
of Corporation Finance to the Division of Public Utilities, which was
redesignated the Division of Corporate Regulation. Reductions in
the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance suggested the desirability of a redistribution of the workload within the Commission in
order to ensure that the analysis of registration statements covering
new security offerings and new listings on securities exchanges be
conducted as expeditiously as possible.
, In June 1953 the Commission transferred from the Division of
Corporate Regulation to the Office of the General Counsel the responsibility for conducting judicial proceedings before the district
courts with respect to the enforcement of orders approving reorganization plans and other orders of the Commission under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act.

REPORT

During the :fiscal year 1953, the Commission was able to effect
further economies in the operation of its duplicating facilities by
renting special reproduction equipment.
On February 4, 1953, the Commission adopted a comprehensive
regulation restating the ethical principles which govern the conduct
of members and employees and former members and employees of
the Commission. The regulation, which represents in large part a
consolidation of rules which had been in existence during prior years,
includes a general statement of policy following essentially language
used by a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public
WeHare in its report on Ethical Standards in Government, and in
the related bill, S. 2293, 82nd Cong., 1st Sess., 1951. The regulation
also deals more specifically with limitations on outside or private
employment, securities transactions, disclosure to superiors of personal
interests which might conflict with official duties, negotiation for
private employment by persons interested in matters pending before
the Commission, and practice before the Commission by former
members and employees of the Commission.
