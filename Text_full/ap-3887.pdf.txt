In the Matter of

TECHNOLOGY CAYMAN LTD.,
JINZANGHUANG TIBET
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., and
MACAU RESOURCES GROUP LTD.

ORDER REGARDING SERVICE
ON RESPONDENT
JINZANGHUANG TIBET
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

On May 20, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. On May 26, I postponed the hearing and scheduled a prehearing conference for June 8,
2016. Dragon Bright Mintai Botanical Tech. Cayman Ltd., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
3874, https://www.sec.gov/alj/aljorders/2016/ap-3874.pdf. I also found that two Respondents were
served with the OIP on May 24, and that their answers are due June 6. Id. But as to Respondent
JinZangHuang Tibet Pharmaceuticals, Inc., I found that service of the OIP had not yet been
established due to issues with the relevant service declaration, and ordered the Division to file an
updated declaration. Id.
Today, the Division submitted updated declarations establishing that JinZangHuang is a
void Delaware corporation, that it no longer has a registered agent, that its officers and directors are
most likely located in China, and that a process server delivered two copies of the OIP to the
Delaware Secretary of State on May 23, 2016. I therefore find that JinZangHuang was served with
the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii) on May 23, 2016. See Del. Code Ann. tit.
8, § 321(b); SEC v. Am. Land Co., No. 87-cv-1453, 1987 WL 19930, at *4 (D.D.C. Nov. 6, 1987)
(“Delaware law plainly provides for service upon the Secretary of State in the case of a dissolved
corporation with no resident agent.”). As such, JinZangHuang’s answer is due June 6, 2016. OIP at
3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b).
If Respondents fail to file timely answers, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise
defend the proceeding, I will deem them in default and revoke the registrations of their securities.
OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
