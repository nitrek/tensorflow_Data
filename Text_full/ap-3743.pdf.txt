JANICE D. REY
On March 1, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding
against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During a
telephonic prehearing conference on March 22, Respondent indicated that she would likely not
contest this proceeding, and I decided that a second telephonic prehearing conference should be
held to allow the Division of Enforcement to explain settlement documents to Respondent and to
allow Respondent to ask me or the Division any questions she may have. Janice D. Rey, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3730, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1087 (ALJ Mar. 23, 2016).
Based on information provided to my office by the Division concerning the partiesâ€™
availability, I ORDER that the telephonic prehearing conference be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern on
March 31, 2016.
