Human Resources Policy

Each section has an overall objective, followed by a procedure/policy for each element in that
section.
This manual is intended as a working document for use by the HR discipline and line
management. The manual is by no means intended to be restrictive, nor is it intended to be
confidential – all staff should have knowledge of this manual, its contents and its
whereabouts. A copy should be available at each head of discipline for staff to view.
All relevant current legislation has been incorporated into policies, but in an ever changing
environment we will continue to update the policies in line with legislative requirements.
Should a specific policy become outdated, the matter should be brought to the attention of the
HR Manager. It is imperative that policies/ procedures are not changed at Unit or Department
level in isolation.

SECTION TWO – RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION
1.

Policy Statement

It is the policy of the company to promote, as far as possible, the principle of “staffing from
within”. Every attempt will hence be made to identify and develop the potential of existing
employees to enable them to fill vacancies as and when they arise. The latter can however
not be done at the cost of the operational requirements of the company or in a way that may
jeopardise the company‟s commitment to advancing potential employees from traditionally
disadvantages groups. All recruitment and selection decisions will, however always be made
in a fair and transparent manner, in accordance with job and organizational requirements and
in line with all legislative requirements as a minimum.
2.

Objectives





To ensure that there is fairness in all staffing decisions.
To ensure equal employment opportunities.
To ensure that the company attracts, recruit and retain the right people with the right
competencies, at the right time.
To ensure that if recruitment and selection take place against set and defined criteria.
To ensure that as far as operationally possible all positions first be advertised
internally and subsequently externally should suitably qualified candidates not be
found internally.
To facilitate where operationally possible that succession planning is in place.
To ensure that the correct administrative processes are followed.
To ensure that all new employee are orientated and familiarized with all relevant
company benefits.
To ensure that all new employees undergo a probationary period in a consistent and
fair manner.
To ensure that the best possible field of candidates is attracted to apply for vacant
positions.
To ensure that recruitment and selection is cost effective

In achieving these objectives, the Company will uphold the rights of the individual, as set out
in the Constitution and comply with the laws and statutes regarding fair employment
practices.

DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS OF LABOUR

The different ways in which labour can be utilised, as well as the circumstances in which it
would be appropriate, are described in summary as follows:
3.1

Permanent employment

When a person is employed on an indefinite basis, subject to a probationary period (that is
reasonable with reference to the nature of the job) this is normally referred to as permanent
employment. During probation employment may be terminated, but with due regard to the
reasons and applicable procedures laid down by the Labour Relations Act No.66 of 1995. Is
appropriate where a full time vacancy exists or there is an operational need to create a full
time position.
3.2

Temporary employment
Page 11
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

In this case the employer engages the services of persons for a fixed term or in respect of a
particular project. These employees enjoy similar basic conditions of employment to
permanent employees, but proportionate to the period of employment (although full
entitlement to leave is delayed - 4 months in the case of annual and family responsibility leave
and 6 months in the case of sick leave). Upon expiry of the fixed term or termination of the
project, the contract may or may not be renewed. It is not necessary to follow any of the
procedures mentioned in respect of permanent employment. There must be a good
underlying reason for entering into a temporary contract (e.g. a temporary replacement of a
permanent staff member, seasonal fluctuation in work load or a particular project that is of a
temporary nature). The regular renewal of a fixed term contract can lead to an employee
claiming that he/she has a reasonable expectation of a further renewal - not renewing a
contract where there is such a reasonable expectation could be regarded as unfair dismissal.
Appropriate in cases where the commitment of a full-time employee is required, but only for a
fixed term or in respect of a particular project.
3.3

Temporary employment service

As an alternative to employing persons on a temporary basis, an employer may approach a
temporary employment service. The labour that is needed is employed by the temporary
employment service ("TES") and you are regarded as the client. However, the TES and the
client are jointly and severally liable for compliance with the Basic Conditions of Employment
Act (i.e. with regard to working hours, overtime, annual leave, sick leave, etc.). As far as
security and termination of employment are concerned (i.e. protection against unfair dismissal
and unfair labour practices), the responsibility remains with the TES as the employer This
type of utilisation of labour is more appropriate in industries where there are projects that
require temporary labour or there are seasonal fluctuations in the need for labour, particularly
unskilled or semi-skilled labour. Appropriate where there is a need for labour flexibility based
on temporary projects or seasonal fluctuation, normally unskilled or semi-skilled labour.
3.4.

"Casual" employment

Since the Basic Conditions of Employment Act of 1997 became law the concept of a "casual"
employee has virtually fallen away. Any person who is employed for 24 hours or more per
month enjoys the protection afforded by the Act. This means that the provisions regarding
working hours, overtime and meal intervals would apply. The employee may even qualify for
annual leave, sick leave, family responsibility leave, etc. Very seldom appropriate - only for
one off cleaning jobs, loading, etc.
3.5.

Independent contracting

To determine whether a person can be regarded as a independent contractor includes the
following: Would the manner in which the person works and the hours of work be subject to
the control or direction of another person?; Will the person forms part of the organisation
(business card, uniform, etc.)?; Have the person worked for that person or organisation for an
average of at least 40 hours per month over the last three months?; Is there is economic
dependency?; Will person be provided with his or her tools of trade or work equipment?; Does
the person only works or supplies services to one person or organization?
If one or more of the above-mentioned factors are present, a person who provides a service
to the company would be presumed to be an employee until the contrary is proved.
Appropriate where certain specialist skills are needed on a temporary basis; the contractor is
required to provided a result - supervision and control not required; contractor acts
independently and invoices the client.
4.

NEPOTISM

Page 12
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

It is the policy of NRC to seek the best qualified applicants for positions and to further the
careers of those employed regardless of whether they have close relatives already employed
by the company. The basic criteria for appointment and retention are appropriate
qualifications, experience and professional development.
Family relationships shall therefore constitute neither an advantage nor a deterrent to
appointment and retention at the company provided the individual meets and fulfils the
appropriate appointment and professional development standards.
"Nepotism" is defined as favouritism in appointment or advancement based on family
relationship.
For the purpose of policy "close relatives" are defined as spouse, domestic partner, parent,
mother-in-law, father-in-law, step-parent, children, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, step-child,
brother, step-brother, brother-in-law, sister, step-sister, sister-in-law, grandchild, aunt, uncle,
nephew and niece.
Employment of "close relatives" is therefore limited only where necessary to provide
reasonable assurance that each employee can carry out the responsibilities of his/her
particular position as objectively as possible. Apart from this reasonable limitation, there is to
be no discrimination against the employment or continued employment of any person
because of his/her relationship to a member of the company staff. Where employment of
"close relatives" would be in conflict with the stipulations below, the problems may sometimes
be avoided by adjustment of duties assigned to one or both of the individuals or by
modification of the administrative relationships of their positions, or both.
Stipulations:






"Close relatives" may not be employed in positions where such employment will result
in the existence of a supervisor/sub-ordinate relationship.
"Close relatives" may not be employed in positions where one will have responsibility
for reviewing and approving financial/budget/purchase transactions or in
recommendations and/or decision making in any matter concerning appointment,
promotion, salary, retention or termination of a "close relative".
Procurement Contracts may not be entered with "close relatives" unless the contracts
have been awarded through an open and public process that includes prior public
notice and subsequent disclosure of all proposals considered and contracts awarded.
No member of staff may be appointed as the supervisor/promoter in respect of any
"close relative".

If a situation arises to deviate from the above stipulations, a detailed motivation must be
submitted to the CEO of the company to consider the individual case.
This policy will be applicable to all members of staff, permanent, temporary, or part-time.
5.

RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION PROCEDURE

5.1

Filling of Permanent Posts

Whenever a position becomes vacant or a new position is created, the Head of Department or
Regional Manager shall prepare a Staff Requisition Form (See ANNEXURE 2A:
REQUISITION FOR STAFF). The requisition, together with a job description and job
specification for the position, is to be routed to the Human Resources Department. Where the
approval from the CEO must be obtained.
Based on the approved Staff Requisition Form, the Human Resources Department will
proceed with the necessary action.
Page 13
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

No posts will be filled without the approval of the CEO.
5.2

Filling of Temporary Posts

The Head of Department/Regional Manager must also complete the Requisition for Staff form
and submit to Human Resources who will obtain the necessary approval. Same procedure as
above must be followed.
5.3

Contract Employees

The Head of Department/Regional Manager must also complete the Requisition for Staff form
and submit to Human Resources who will obtain the necessary approval. Same procedure as
above must be followed.
Contract employees should only be employed under the following circumstances:


To replace an employee who is absent for a long period (e.g. maternity, leave/
illness)



To assist with a specific task for a specific period



To extend employment for a limited period on reaching retirement age



The contract period can not be used to replace the probationary period (e.g. to
assess the potential employee)

Contract employees are entitled to similar Conditions of Service as permanent employees,
but on a pro-rata basis excluding pension and medical aid. Consult your Human Resources
Department if it is necessary to employ a contract employee for more than six months.
To ensure that the contract employee does not legitimately expect further employment after
the contract has expired, all contract employees must be issued with a specific contract
detailing functions and time period applicable (See ANNEXURE 2B: LETTER OF
TEMPORARY APPOINTMENT).
5.4 National Transfers between Regions/Departments
The Regional Managers/HOD of both the transferring unit/department and receiving
unit/department must agree on the transfer. The Regional Manager/HOD of the receiving unit
must complete a change of detail form (See ANNEXURE 2C: DETAIL CHANGE FORM). The
change of detail from must be submitted to the Human Resources Department prior to the
inter regional/department transfer. The Human Resources Department must issue the
employee with a revised Letter of Appointment.
Any information (as per the new employee details above) that must be updated not currently
on the current employee file should be submitted to the Human Resources Department.
Permanent and Temporary Transfers within Region
The Unit Managers of both the transferring unit and receiving unit must agree on the transfer.
The Regional Manager must complete an internal transfer form (See ANNEXURE 2T:
INTERNAL TRANSFER FORM). The form must be submitted to the Human Resources
Department prior to the transfer. In the case of a permanent inter unit transfer the Human
Resources Department must issue the employee with a revised Letter of Appointment.
Any information (as per the new employee details above) that must be updated not currently
on the current employee file should be submitted to the Human Resources Department.

ORIENTATION (INDUCTION)

7.1

Introduction

The Oreintation programme is a guide to orientate new employees to the organisation, and to
the job, in order that they settle in and become effective as quickly as possible.
7.2

Objectives of effective orientation



To ensure that the new employee fit in and feel comfortable over the longer term.



To that the new employee is introduced to the company culture.



To ensure that the new employee is shown “The Big Picture”.



To ensure that all job responsibilities and rewards are explained.



To ensure that all administrative matters are dealt with.



To provide reality checks.



To reduce labour turnover and improve staff retention.

7.3

The orientation Process

It is imperative that all new permanent employees are subject to the orientation process. All
new employees must sign the Orientation Checklists. Administration staff must only complete
ANNEXURE 2K: EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION CHECK LIST – GENERAL ORIENTATION
Dialysis staff must complete ANNEXURE 2K: EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION CHECK LIST –
GENERAL ORIENTATION PROGRAM and ANNEXURE 2L: EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION
CHECK LIST – GENERAL NURSING ORIENTATION.
The orientation programme is a guide to orientate new employees to the organisation, job,
unit, department and team, in order that they settle in and become effective as quickly as
possible.
Literature on the subject of orientation and or induction has showed over the years that this
discipline should not be taken lightly or ignored. Literature has proven that effective
orientation leads to improved staff retention, employee commitment and even customer
satisfaction. According to Dirks (2004) staff members who are properly trained and welcomed
Page 19
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

at the beginning of their careers feel good about their choice of employer, fit in quickly with
peers and colleagues and readily contribute new ideas. These employees also speak well
about the company to friends and family and they represent you more confidently to
customers, business partners and suppliers.
It must be stressed that first impressions do count, especially to new employees. If we do not
do the right things at the beginning this can cost the company dearly. Employees who do not
start right don‟t tend to stick around long. The latter contributes to the “start over syndrome”
where we have to recruit, train and orientate new employees all over again and again. The
negative spin off of this is that the employees who stick around may also become infected
and they may begin to wonder ………should we be looking for new employment, too? The
danger in our industry where everybody knows everybody is that word travels fast and this
may have a negative impact on our future recruitment efforts.
Most of us somewhere in our careers were the new person. Some of us may identify with the
following - We did not know anyone, we were unsure whether we made the right decision by
leaving our previous employer for the new one. We were not really sure what we were
supposed to do or we were left on our own because our manager was absent or always in
meetings. There was no space, etc. According to Hacker (2004) new orientation nightmares
range from introducing the new employee to 147 people the first day, none of whose names
he/she can remember, to pointing to a desk or cubical lying on the floor telling him/her, “It‟s
yours; assemble it!”
In hindsight those of us who stayed may joke about these incidents later on and think that it
was funny, but we need to remember how this made us feel. The bottom line is that this
approach is not right and we know it.
We must also remember that sessional or contract employees will also be members of the
team and we want them to be equally productive and motivated as our permanent employees.
Their orientation will be more limited, but we need to give them what they will need to get off
to a good start.
We should never assume that employees know or should have known, we all now what
“assumption” did.
As committed and responsible managers it is our responsibility to ensure that our staff “start
right” from the word go. The team must also help the new employee feel comfortable.
THE PROCESS
The manager must ensure that a contingency plan is always in place in the event that he/she
will not be present in the beginning. Where the manager is not present due to other
commitments i.e. leave, visits etc he/she must delegate the responsibility to another capable
person in the team to ensure that there are no “blank periods” during the process.
Please take note that orientation of a new employee is more than introducing the new
employee to colleagues and completing the standard paper work. The objective of the
orientation programme is to provide new employees with the big picture from the top down.
We should also ensure that we do not overwhelm new employees with information during the
first week on the job. New employees do not have to be exposed to every detail of the
business during the first few days at work.
You are not alone in the process the human resources professional will assume a certain
amount of responsibility for orientating new employees, but the manager will be responsible
for specific orientation to the department/unit and the team must help the new team member
feel comfortable.

Human Resources Policy

What is in it for you?







It can reduce turnover – Research proved that most new employees make a mental
decision to leave or stay in the organisation within the first few days or weeks on the
job.
It cuts down on mistakes.
It clarifies the quality of standards and expectations by which performance will be
measured.
It empowers new employees to be confident.
It helps the new employee to feel welcome.
It costs money – and lots and lots of money when we lose good people.

THE STAGES OF THE PROCESS
When considering the best way to orientate a new employee we need to become creative in
our own ways of doing things and or develop rituals. We need to start thinking “outside of the
box”.
This process is based on the phases as proposed by Hacker (2004).
Stage 1 - Pre-hire Stage
The stage commence once the new employee has accepted the offer of employment, but
before the employee physically commences working.
This stage allows for a lot of creativity and or “thinking outside of the box”.
Step 1: The following “starting right” rituals can be put to use:



Send a welcome card – send a card signed by everyone in the unit/department to the
new employee at his home or place of work. Encourage the team to write a brief note
– the more personal the better.
Distribute an announcement – distribute an announcement to current staff and
include some details about the new employee even a photograph.

You can also use your own ideas and or add to the list. If you use something that is not on the
list that works, please feel free to share your ideas with us all, so that we can spread the
word.
Step 2: Pre-assess training needs



During this step a pre-assessment of the new employee‟s training needs are done.
After the pre-assessment the necessary training must be scheduled before he or she
starts. Please note that the training scheduled will only take place once the employee
physically commences duty. New employees with limited or no experience will be
allocated to the relevant training unit/department. The details of where training will
take place will be given after the pre-assessment. This will ensure that the employee
is able to make the necessary arrangements in advance (no surprises). Training may
be both of an internal and external nature depending on the function. By doing this we
are sending a clear message that we are organised and serious about providing
educational opportunities.

Step 3: Probation expectations


You need to inform the employee what you expect will have to accomplish during the
first three months of employment. You can explain to the new employee that you
Page 21
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy



expect that he/she is able to function independently in the renal discipline as a nurse,
technologist etc.
Make notes of these expectations in order to discuss them during the first week of
employment. The employee will then be aware of the expectations from day one and
there will not be any “grey” or unknown areas regarding the future expectations. The
tone is set for success.

Step 4:


Scope of practice
The manager must define the employee‟s scope of practice during the first three
months of employment, these will include, but is not limited to the following:
o
o

Authority to make decisions regarding the patient or work with or without
obtaining input, permission or guidance from someone else.
Make sure that you explain and discuss your reasons for your decision(s)
during his/her first day at work.

The scope of practice of the new employee must be determined before the employee
commences duty (this can be based on previous experience, job etc). The manager must
make sure that everything is included that is important to the job. These will help the
employee to understand in advance where his/her responsibility and authority begins and
ends in the initial stages. The employee will also be clear on what will be expected from
him/her in terms of his/her scope of practice after the initial period of limited scope of practice.
Step 5: Reality Check
Inform the candidate of the pressures and realities of your company, your unit, your team,
your customers and the competition.
Step 6: The employment pack
The employment pack includes the following:


Application form



Provident Fund Beneficiary Form



Provident nomination of beneficiary form



Medical Aid membership Form



Mandatory master file information form

trolley

Please feel free to add to the list.
The above topics that will have to covered will be listed in the orientation check list attached
hereto. These must preferably covered by the Unit/Department manager.
Step 4: Meetings and Commitment
Involve the new team member in team meetings as soon as possible. The sooner they
become part of the whole, the sooner they will make contributions to the team effort.
Make a commitment at the beginning to make the employee productive from day one.
Step 5: KPA‟s
Ensure that your KPA‟s (job description) are current. Share his or her KPA‟s on day one.
Review the KPA‟s and answer questions and follow up to ensure that all aspect covered are
clearly understood. Please note that new employees are often embarrassed to admit that they
do not understand.
Page 24
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Step 6: Immediate Supervisor
The immediate supervisor should meet with the new employee to discuss team operations
and goals. The supervisor should discuss accountabilities, rules and procedures, off duties,
record keeping requirements and initial responsibilities. Ensure that the supervisor or you
discuss expectations regarding, breaks, lunch times and time for personal business, including
the use of the telephone and internet etc.
Step 6: Be creative
Plan a “bring and braai”, lunch etc so that everybody can celebrate the employees first day or
week on the job. Sound weird, but it works, this is your opportunity to really be creative and
think outside of the box. We normally do this when someone leaves so way not do it when
someone joins the team. The massage should be “Welcome on Board”.
Phase 3 – In-duty Phase
The phase goes beyond the first week and throughout the first three to six months of
employment. This phase will cover those areas that do not necessarily have to be covered
immediately. Some are ongoing and others may occur several weeks or months after the new
employee joins the team.
Step 1: Introduce or reintroduce the new employee
The employee should be introduced to all employees. In the event that some employees
where absent when the new employee commenced employment make sure to introduce the
new employee to them immediately on their return.
An idea can be that the employee is given a card with the names of all the staff in the unit or
department. The “newbie” must then go around and get everybody in the unit/department‟s
signature. This is also an area to be creative.
Step 2: Office and other equipment
All new employees must be shown how the office and or other equipment work. They must
also be sure who to contact in the case of a question or problem. Make sure that the new
employee understands your instructions regarding the equipment. Never assume that your
instructions were understood the first time, follow-up.
Step 3: Probation period
Explain to the employee what he/she can expect during the first three months of employment.
Review the KPA‟s and explain that you will monitor his/her progress monthly via the formal
performance process. Keep notes of your discussion and expectations. It will help both of you
to remain focused.
Establish goals that need to be accomplished during the first three months. Preferably have
an action and or development plan in place, mapping the goals to be accomplished. The latter
must preferably be broken done in stages i.e. month 1, 2, 3 etc.
Step 4: Buddy System
Develop a buddy system for junior employees and inexperienced employees. Identify
“buddies” to be allocated to the new employee for guidance and support.
Step 5: Additional training

Page 25
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Meet with the employee and evaluate the additional training that would assist the new
employee to become more productive. Identify GAPS. Include these additional needs in the
development plan.

SUMMARY
Please note that the above phases are not all-inclusive. There undoubtedly will be tasks that
are specific to your Unit/department that you may want to include. Please ensure that you are
clear, concise and consistent when orientating new employees to the everyday routine and
business practices of the unit and company.
Please take cognisance of the following scenarios when orientating new employees. First, the
new employee may fill the position that was occupied by an outstanding employee and
secondly, replace a poor performer. In the first instance the other employees will quickly
compare the new employee with the outstanding employee. You and the other team members
must be fair when you evaluate the new hire. Compare the new employee against objective
criteria not against the superstar. Make sure that new employee does not have to live in the
shadow of the former employee who was well liked and respected. With regard to the poor
performer ensure that you or any other staff member do not bad-mouth the previous
employee who may have been fired or quit. Use the past only to the extend that it points the
way to the future. The new employee may have a big job ahead of him/her, especially if the
person replaced was a slacker. Recognise the fact and provide the necessary support and
assistance to the new employee.
Lastly, remember THAT THEY ARE NEW, orientation is not a check list, it is a process to
ensure that we “start right” to make it easy and comfortable for the “newbie” for the benefit of
all.
7.4 Follow-up Orientation
After thee weeks with the company the employee does the first of two Probation Reviews.
See the form in the annexure. This also forms part of the performance management system
which is done by the line manager.
The Human Resources Department is responsible to give feedback to the appropriate person
in order to apply remedial action.
8.

PROBATION

8.1

Introduction

All employees employed by NRC are placed on a three-month probationary period. This
enables:


The employee to assess whether he/she enjoys the work environment and
opportunities provided by the company;



The Supervisor / Manager to assess whether the new employee has the ability,
initiative and skills required to function productively in his/her newly appointed
position.



Provide the company an opportunity to evaluate the employee‟s performance before
confirming the appointment.

Please take note of the following points:

Page 26
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy



During the probationary period, the employee‟s performance should be assessed and
the employee should be given reasonable evaluation, instruction, training, guidance
and counselling in order to allow the employee to render satisfactory service.



Probation must be imported into the relationship by including the provision in the
letter of appointment as this is not done automatically.



Probation applies to new employees and not in respect of promotions / internal
transfers.



The employer must set and communicate the standard (both tasks and behaviour)
against which the employee is to be measured.



The employer must give regular feedback. Based on the discrepancy identified
appropriate instruction, training, guidance or counselling should take place.



The decision to terminate the services of a probationer must be preceded by a full
consultation with the employee who has the right to representation.



A dismissal can take place at any stage of the probationary period and the level of
substantive fairness for probationers should be seen as the same as that for
permanent employees.



A probationer has a legitimate expectation of permanent employment, which will
materialise where the period of probation expires without specific and written
indications to the contrary.

During probation employment may be terminated, but with due regard to the reasons and
applicable procedures laid down by the Labour Relations Act No.66 of 1995. During and after
probation the employer cannot simply give notice of termination of employment in terms of the
employment contract. Different procedures have to be followed, depending on whether the
intended termination is due to misconduct, poor work performance, medical incapacity or
operational requirements. These procedures are rather cumbersome and the employer‟s
failure to follow them could result in a claim for reinstatement or compensation.
8.2

Probation Process

First Week of Employment
In the first week the Unit Manager/Departmental Manager must ensure that the following
requirements are met:


Discuss the probationer‟s job description. The job description must include the Key
Result Areas, activities and performance standards for each activity. Both the Unit
Manager and probationer must sign the job description after they have agreed on the
Key Result Areas, activities and performance standards.



Should there be any short-term objectives set, the Unit Manager/Departmental
Manager should complete the Short Term Objective Form in the presence of, and in
conjunction with the probationer.



Ensure that the probationer receive a copy of the job description and the Short Term
Objective Form.

First/Second Month – Performance Appraisal Form
During the First and Second Month of Probation the following requirements must be met:


A performance appraisal form must be completed in the week following the
completion of the first and second month of the probationary period (depending on
the employee‟s position).



The Unit Manager/Departmental Head must complete the appraisal form in the
presence of the new employee. This form is used to assess whether the new
Page 27
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

employee is meeting the agreed performance standards (job description) and short
term objectives. This form is also used to determine any training requirements.


The Performance Appraisal Form and the Short Term Objective Form must be
th
submitted to the Human Resources Department by the 10 day of the following
month. The same applies to the completion of the forms for the second month of the
probationary period.

Third Month – Performance Appraisal
The following requirements must be met in the third month of the probationer‟s employment:


A performance appraisal must be completed by the Unit Manager/Departmental
Manager two weeks prior to the completion of the three-month probationary period.



The Unit Manager/Departmental Manager must also complete the Probationary
Period Outcome Form after the performance appraisal is completed.



Both documents are then to be forwarded to the Human Resources Department on
completion. (At least one week prior to the end of the three month probation period.)
This form is of the utmost importance as it will determine the future of the new
employee at the place of work.



All other relevant documentation i.e. disciplinary hearings and/or counselling sessions
must accompany this form upon submission to the Human Resources Department if
not already submitted.

Should the employee display any behavioural problems i.e. absenteeism, the following
procedure should be followed:


Follow Disciplinary Procedure

Should the employee display Performance Problems i.e. unnecessary mistakes, the following
procedure should be followed:


The Counseling Procedure:

Step 1: Review of standards
The employee‟s job content and standard should be reviewed. The reasonableness of those
standards should be confirmed and, if possible, agreed with the employee. If the employee
does not agree that they are reasonable, the manager may require performance of those
standards if he/she believes that they are reasonable.
Step 2: Identify sub-standard
The manager should identify shortfalls in the performance using the most objective
measurement criteria available. The latter should be discussed with the employee.
Step 3: Identify reasons for sub-standard performance
Reasons why the employee has fallen below the standards should be discussed and
identified.
Step 4: Action Plan
If it has been determined that the reason(s) for non-performance lies with the employee, the
manager should inform the employee on how to achieve the standard(s) and agree on an
action plan. Agreement should also be sought from the employee that the action plan is
acceptable and that he/she is capable of achieving the required standards if the action plan is
Page 28
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

complied with. If the action plan is reasonable but the employee does not agree with it, for no
good reason, it may nonetheless be implemented.
Step 5: Assistance
Thereafter the manager should provide all reasonable assistance which may include suitable
training of the employee to enable the employee to achieve the required standards. In the
case of physical incapacity, the assistance may include reasonable time off for medical
treatment or temporary or permanent transfer to a less onerous job. The latter is only possible
id an alternative vacancy exists within the company and the employee meets at least the
minimum requirements for the job.
Step 6: Review dates
The employee should be given sufficient time to improve and review dates should be
establish\shed in order to monitor progress.
Step 7: Record counseling
The contents of the counseling and the action plan must be recorded in a written document to
the employee in the form of a counseling record. It must be signed by the manager concerned
as a record to which the parties may refer at a latter stage if necessary. The record could also
provide proof of counseling.
Step 8: Further counseling and warning
If the employee does not reach the required standards within the time period set, the manager
should engage in further counseling if it is believed that the employee may still be capable of
improvement given further assistance and time. The manager should also warn the employee
that his/her services may be terminated if he/she fails to perform to the required standards by
the end of the time period set.
Step 9: Inquiry and termination
Even after further counseling or a warning and a reasonable time period the employee still
does not perform to the required standards, or proves to the satisfaction of the manager that
he/she is incapable of achieving the standards, the manager should inform the Human
Resources Department of this situation. The Human Resources Department will convene an
inquiry to consider the case. At this stage the disciplinary procedure will be followed.
8.3

Extension of Probation period

The period of probation may only be extended for a reason that relates to the purpose of
probation. The period of extension should not be disproportionate to the legitimate purpose
that the employer seeks to achieve
Process

SECTION FIVE - WORKPLACE RELATIONS
1.

OBJECTIVES OF WORKPLACE RELATIONS

To effectively regulate the interaction between the employer and employees, this section
outlines mechanisms:




To ensure that any action is taken at the lowest possible level
To ensure fair and equal treatment and consistent treatment for all employees
To facilitate both upward and downward communication.

2.

DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE

2.1

POLICY STATEMENT

It is management‟s belief that a formal Disciplinary Procedure is essential for the efficient
operation of the business, the safety, fair and consistent treatment of all employees and for
ensuring healthy industrial/employment relations. To achieve this aim, the following principles
must be observed:
a.

Administering discipline is the duty of management.

b.

Management will, in the first place, seek to correct an employee‟s poor performance or
conduct through informal counselling by his direct supervisor. The latter will be an
attempt to apply discipline promptly at the lowest possible level.

c.

Management will apply the formal disciplinary process only when informal counseling
has been unsuccessful or the actions of the employee have been such that informal
counseling is inappropriate.

d.

Management accepts that no employee will be disciplined without a fair hearing and an
opportunity to clearly state his case, unless the employee in question waives this right by
failing to attend such a hearing through his/her own choice. In such an instance, the
hearing can/may proceed in his/her absence.

e.

Clear evidence of a breach of the Organisation rules and regulations or unsatisfactory
performance must be established prior to dismissal by means of the proper disciplinary
procedure.

f.

Careful consideration must be given to the circumstances before disciplinary action is
taken.

g.

Management will strive, whenever possible and with due regard to the circumstances of
each case, to be consistent in taking disciplinary action.

h.

The contents of any document handed to the employee in terms of this disciplinary
procedure shall be explained to him/her.

i.

An employee against whom disciplinary action has been instituted in terms of the
disciplinary procedure shall not be entitled to invoke the grievance procedure of the
company should he she disagree with the disciplinary action taken by management.

Page 94
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

2.2

Disciplinary Procedure

Disciplinary Investigation
In instances where facts of the incidents are unclear an investigation will be arranged to verify
the facts of the alleged breach of the Disciplinary Code. No disciplinary action will be taken
as a result of the investigation but based on the evidence found it may be decided that a
disciplinary hearing should be arranged at a later date.
Handling Discipline in an Informal Way
Informal discipline takes place when the Manager, based on the evidence or information
obtained from witnesses or at an enquiry, is of the opinion that it is not so serious to warrant a
formal hearing.
Informal discipline is carried out on a consultation basis between the employee and Manager.
Please note that it is still important to keep record of this consultation and to file it in the
employees‟ file unless the employee is found not to be guilty.
To assist managers to manage absenteeism in the workplace a checklist is provided (see
ANNEXURE 5A: SUPERVISORS CHECKLIST FOR ABSENTEEISM).
Formal Discipline in a Formal Way

In the event where the Manager who investigates the alleged transgression believes there is
sufficient evidence to support his/her case and that it is a serious or repetitive transgression,
he/she will initiate a formal disciplinary hearing.
Step 1:

Initiating a disciplinary hearing

When a complaint has been received or there is an apparent offence requiring disciplinary
action:


The employee must be notified by his Manager or any other person who has the
authority to represent Management, that a disciplinary hearing will take place.



The notification must be in writing and must state the following :
o
o
o
o

Nature of the alleged offence
When and where the hearing will take place
Details of the Chairperson
The employee‟s rights

It is also important to ensure that it is done in a language that the employee can reasonably
understand. Minimum of 48 working hours (2 working days) of the hearing should be given to
the employee concerned. The employee should also be advised of his/her right to be
assisted by a shop steward or fellow employee. The disciplinary procedure must commence
within 5 working days of being notified of the alleged offence and be concluded within 30
days, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon.
Suspension on Full Pay:
In special circumstances where serious misconduct is or appears to be involved, an employee
may be suspended pending the disciplinary hearing. This suspension is without prejudice to
the employee in any way whatsoever.
Reasons to suspend an employee on full pay before a disciplinary hearing:

Page 95
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

a.
b.
c.

The employee may change the evidence or interfere with witnesses. This may be the
case if an investigation is to begin or is in progress.
The employee‟s presence may affect the productivity of other employees.
The nature of the unacceptable behavior is such that the employee / employer
relationship is seriously affected.

Suspension must be done in writing giving the following information:
a.
b.

c.

Reason for the suspension.
The date the employee must return to work or the date by which he/she will be
contacted again. In the case of when the employee will be contacted again, how
he/she will be contacted again. Suspension should never be open-ended but may be
extended.
What access he/she has to his/her workplace during the time of the suspension.
From whom he/she must get permission in order to visit his/her workplace. (In the
case of a disciplinary hearing he/she may want to contact his/her representative or to
arrange witnesses.)

Step 2: Conduct the hearing
The hearing is conducted in accordance with the Checklist.
Step 3: Evaluate the evidence
Assess and evaluate the evidence in terms of which evidence is:


Corroborated



Not denied



Contradicted Materially

Consider the reliability and consistency of witnesses‟ testimony.
Consider whether the complaints (charges) are appropriate and correct in light of the
evidence present.
Consider which version on balance of probability (i.e. Reasonable to believe) is most likely.
(Where reasonable doubt exists, this should favour the alleged offender.)
Prepare and write down your findings under the following headings:






Complaints
Alleged offender‟s submissions and evidence
Other evidence put forward
Hearing officials conclusions
Hearing official‟s findings: “guilty or not guilty”. The Chairperson must give reasons
(i.e. why, how, when, where) for arriving at the conclusion.

Inform the employee and his representative of your findings.
Handle queries, but do not debate the findings.
Ask the employee to submit evidence in mitigation.
Adjourn to decide on the sanction to be imposed.
Step 4: Making the Decision on the Sanction to be imposed
The following questions should be evaluated by the Chairperson.


Is the act committed by the employee a serious breach of regulations / procedures, or
serious misconduct (extent of damage).

Page 96
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy



Does the employee have knowledge of the rule and the consequences of a breach of
the rule?



Is the rule valid and has it been consistently applied.



Consider the following :



Intent



Mitigating circumstances



Employee‟s performance,
circumstances.



Potential to rehabilitate employees behaviour



Assess whether these factors may mitigate against the sanction.



Consistency and precedent – has a similar offence been committed by another
employee and what action was taken? Were the circumstances in that case similar
or different?

Determine appropriate penalty: i.e. verbal warning, written warning, final warning or a

Inform the employee and his representative of the penalty giving reasons for the decision in
writing.
Handle queries, but do not debate the sanction. Inform the employee that he has the right to
appeal to a higher level of authority and identify who this person would be. Such appeal must
be in writing clearly stating reasons within 7 working days.
Types of Sanction:
Verbal Warning
A verbal warning is an informal warning of which record must be kept.
Written Warning
A written warning may be given either when a verbal warning has failed or where the offence
is of such a nature that a verbal warning would not be adequate.
Final Written Warning
A final written warning may be given either where a written warning is considered inadequate
because of the seriousness of the offence or where a written warning has failed. NB: Failure
to heed a final warning may result in a dismissal.
Dismissal
Dismissal may occur where a person fails to heed a final written warning or where the severity
of the offence warrants dismissal.
Retention of Warnings on Employee’s file
Warnings must be retained on the employee file and are valid for the following time periods.


Verbal recorded on file 3 months



Written first warning 6 months



Final warning 12 months
Page 97
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

The full disciplinary records should be on file, inclusive of supporting documentation.
General


When dismissals take place due to the severity of the misconduct, the employee may
be dismissed without notice pay following a hearing.



In the event of other dismissal the employee is entitled to notice pay.



Consultation with Human Resources Manager should take place prior to a dismissal.

DISCIPLINARY CODE

To ensure orderly behavior and to regulate the interaction between the employer and
employees the company has certain standards, rules and regulations. The disciplinary code is
intended to provide a framework of these standards, rules and regulations which ensures that
employees know and understand what the company is expecting from them and what the
employees can expect. The disciplinary code also prescribes the penalties which are likely to
be imposed by the company should employees transgress the rules. The Disciplinary code
provides examples of minor and major transgressions which may lead to disciplinary action
and the code is not intended to be exhaustive of possible offences nor prescriptive for the
only disciplinary sanction.
3.1

Introduction to the Disciplinary Code and Procedure

a.

The implementation of the disciplinary code and procedure by the company is
important to ensure the effective functioning of the organization, and to achieve the
set goals and objectives. The disciplinary procedure is therefore the instrument by
means of which the organization can maintain effective discipline in the workplace.

b.

The disciplinary code and procedure is intended to provide a framework of these
standards, rules and regulations which ensures that employees know and understand
what the company is expecting from them and what the employees can expect in
terms of disciplinary action should an employee transgress any rule or deviate from
appropriate behavior.

c.

The Company may exercise disciplinary action against an employee for good cause not
stipulated in the Disciplinary Code.

d.

Every employee has the right, if he so wishes, to be assisted in any disciplinary action by
a colleague or co-worker of his choice. The representative may present evidence, crossquestion witnesses and raise questions.

e.

Unless the action of misconduct warrants summary dismissal as per the disciplinary
code, an employee will not be dismissed without having had the benefit of a disciplinary
hearing.

f.

Employees should be given at least 48 hours prior notice of the holding of a disciplinary
enquiry.

g.

The Company shall apply the provisions of the Labour Relations Act No. 66 of 1995, and
any other related amendments to the Act, if so effected.

h.

The Disciplinary Code as reduced in matrix form is only to serve as a guideline in terms
of the appropriate disciplinary penalty. Although this is the recommended disciplinary
action, a degree of flexibility should be maintained in order to apply the appropriate
degree of discipline.
Page 98
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

i.

The Disciplinary Code and Procedure is not intended to and does not set out all the
grounds on which disciplinary steps may be taken and the common-law grounds for
discipline and termination of employment exist hand-in-hand with this disciplinary
code and procedure. Where there are not specific regulations set out, integrity,
ethical behavior and responsibility should be a guide.

j.

The Human Resources Manager may be requested to give guidance or assistance at
any stage of the of the disciplinary

3.2

discipline.
“Management” is defined as those capacities with authority to discipline and counsel and is
specifically described as: Supervisors, Managers, Director and Executive Officer.
“Day” shall mean, for the purpose of this procedure, a normal working day and including
Sunday, Saturday and Public Holidays.
“Conduct” (misconduct) by an employee is interpreted to be the unauthorised and / or
inappropriate action by the employee in contravention of the rules and regulations of this code.
“Capacity” (incapacity) shall be defined as the sub-standard performance of an employee in
contravention of the organisation code by reason of incapacity due to illness / poor performance.
“Disciplinary Hearing” refers to a formal meeting, chaired by a manager of the company or any of

conducted, that all evidence has not been taken into account or that certain mitigating
circumstances exists, which were not taken into account by the chairperson of the disciplinary
hearing.
3.3

GENERAL RULES

a.

Disciplinary action should strive to be corrective or constructive.

b.

Discipline and dismissal are regarded as part of Management‟s responsibility (as per
the Disciplinary Code) which will be exercised:





Page 99
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

c.

The severity of disciplinary action will depend upon the circumstances of each case
and mitigating factors will be given proper attention. Importantly, the penalties set out
in the code are intended to act as guidelines. Circumstances may therefore justify
the imposing of a penalty more or less severe than that recommended in the
guidelines.

d.

Although contravention of the code may also constitute criminal acts, the company
shall not be precluded from acting in terms of this procedure where criminal steps
against the employee have been taken or from initiating criminal steps against the
employee at any time.

e.

As the offences stated in the code are not intended to be exhaustive, the company
may exercise disciplinary action against an employee who has committed an offence,
which has not been stated in the disciplinary code.

f.

The managers responsible for exercising disciplinary action will use their discretion
and on occasions may prefer to give a verbal warning for a minor transgression.

g.

A verbal and written warning shall remain valid for a period of six working months.

h.

A third offence, or unrelated offences, warranting a written warning could result in
dismissal pending the outcome of the disciplinary enquiry save for the final written
warning which will remain valid for a period of twelve working months.

i.

The signing of a verbal/written warning by an employee means that he/she
acknowledges receipt thereof, and not acceptance of the contents. Should he/she
deny the allegations contained therein, it must nevertheless be signed by the
applicable employee. An appeal may be lodged against said given warning. If an
employee refuses to sign a written warning, the written warning shall nevertheless be
valid and operative.

j.

Warnings to employees are cumulative only if warnings issued are in the same
offence category as per the Code. Written warnings will be kept in the employee‟s
personal file even after expiration only in order for "The Company" to retain a
comprehensive history of each employee‟s performance during the employment
contract.

k.

Employee representative are required to obtain permission to be absent from their
places of work in order to act in terms of this procedure, which permission shall not
be unreasonably withheld. The employee representative, with the consent of the
employee concerned, shall be entitled to have sight of the disciplinary record of the
employee.

l.

If a manager referred to herein is unavailable, the company may designate another
manager to deal with the matter.

m.

The employee shall be entitled to appeal internally in respect of a disciplinary enquiry,
consequent to which the employee was dismissed.

n.

As the disciplinary process is an in-company procedure, neither party will be
represented by a person who is not an employee of the company. This shall not,
however, preclude the company appointing a person who is not an employee as
chairperson of any hearing in terms of this disciplinary code and procedure.

o.

The Disciplinary Code forms part of the terms and conditions of employment and
applies to all employees of "The Company".
Page 100
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

p.

"The Company" is entitled to suspend an employee on full pay pending an
investigation into any breach of the Disciplinary Code or the Employment Contract.

q.

An employee should be willing to submit himself/herself to a breath test and/or a
blood test by a qualified doctor should his/her behavior / performance necessitates
this.

r.

Where the employment of an employee is terminated with notice, Management may
pay the employee in lieu of the appropriate notice period and may require the
employee to physically leave the place of employment and "The Company‟s"
premises immediately.

s.

Summary dismissal means termination of employment without notice and without
payment in lieu of notice.

t.

Management may, as an alternative sanction to dismissal (which is regarded as the
ultimate sanction) suspend and employee without pay for a period commensurate
with the severity of the particular disciplinary offence.

u.

In the event that an employee wishes to challenge a finding after the exhausting of
the procedure, the employee may refer the issue to the Commission for Conciliation,
Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation and/or arbitration or to the Labour Court or
any other body agreed upon by the parties.

Disciplinary procedures

a.

Discipline should be initiated as soon as reasonable practicable after the alleged
transgression comes to the attention of management.

Page 106
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

b.

Management shall be required to determine whether the alleged transgression
constitutes misconduct or is more properly dealt with as incapacity or poor
performance, in which regard it would be more appropriate in the first instance to
counsel an employee in an endeavor to have the employee meet the standards
required by the company. It should be noted that in this process relating to incapacity
or poor performance (which is not the subject matter of this Disciplinary Code and
Procedure), it may be appropriate to warn the employee formally (and in appropriate
circumstances, progressively) so that the employee is aware that continued
incapacity or poor performance could result in the termination of the employee‟s
services.

c.

Management shall in all circumstances be required to determine the appropriate level
of disciplinary action to be initiated against the employee by having regard to the
provisions of the code and the circumstances of the alleged offence.

d.

It is envisaged in terms of this procedure that an employee shall be entitled to
representation by a fellow employee or shop steward if one is chosen.

e.

Prior to taking disciplinary action an employee is to be informed of the fact that formal
disciplinary action is to be initiated and the nature of the allegations against the
employee as well as the employee‟s right to representation.

f.

Where possible, disciplinary action should be taken by the transgressing employee‟s
direct line manager.

g.

Any party to the disciplinary process is entitled during this process to obtain guidance
from senior management in respect of the procedures contemplated in the
disciplinary process as well as in respect of previous decisions taken by the company
in respect of the particular allegation facing the employee.

3.5.1

Suspension

During an investigation into any offence allegedly committed by an employee and/or pending
the institution and/or finalisation of disciplinary action, a manager may decide that in the
interests of the employee and/or the company, the employee should be suspended from work
on full pay until the conclusion of the investigation or enquiry.
Step 1
3.5.2

Warnings

It shall not be necessary to give an employee written notice of the allegations an employee or
to provide advance notice of the allegations when it is anticipated that only a verbal or written
warning could result.

Verbal Warning
In cases or minor breaches of discipline the employee‟s line manager, if necessary, issue a
formal verbal warning to an employee in the presence of the employee‟s representative, if one
is chosen by the employee, with a view to correcting the situation.
Written Warning
If it is believed that an employee has committed an offence and a verbal warning is
inappropriate, the line manager shall make it clear to the employee that the first formal step in
the disciplinary procedure is being taken.
At a meeting between the parties the complainant and/or line manager of the employee shall
advise the employee of the charges and allow the employee and his representative if one has
been chosen a fair and reasonable opportunity to make representations and/or to call any
witnesses.

Page 108
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

If the line manager is satisfied that a written warning is the appropriate disciplinary action, the
line manager shall record an account of the offence on a warning form, indicate that the
warning is a written warning, state the date the warning was issued.
The line manager shall request the employee to sign if after its contents have been explained
to the employee.
If the employee refuses to sign the written warning, the written warning shall nonetheless be
valid and operative. The line manager shall indicate on the written warning that the employee
refused to sign.
The employee shall be given a copy of the written warning by the line manager.
The written warning form shall be submitted by the line manager for filing to the Human
Resources Department.
A written warning shall lapse after 6 months and a lapsed warning shall not be taken into
account in deciding subsequent disciplinary action.
Step 2
Final Written Warning and Dismissals
If a final written warning/dismissal is the disciplinary action which appears to be appropriate, a
line manager shall decide whether a disciplinary enquiry is necessary and/or whether the
suspension of the employee is appropriate.
In addition, the complainant shall furnish the details of the incident complained of to the
Human Resources Department, of the purpose of drafting a notification to attend a
disciplinary enquiry.
Before any employee is dismissed or issued with a final written warning for a breach of
company rules or ethics, a disciplinary enquiry shall be convened.
3.5.3

Disciplinary Enquiries

Disciplinary enquiries should be chaired, where practical, by a manager no less senior than
the employee being disciplined.

At the hearing, the following people will be present:









the employee charged with misconduct (the accused);
the representative of the accused (if s/he chooses to have one);
an independent chairperson;
the Human Resources Practitioner of the company.
the representative of the employer, putting the charges to the employee (prosecutor);
witnesses from both parties;
a note-keeper (optional); and
interpreter (optional).

The employee’s rights

Page 109
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Every employee has the following rights which will be observed during disciplinary
proceedings/enquiries:











To be given advance warning of any charge against him/her (at least 48 hours)
To be advised of the charge
To be given time to prepare his/her defense.
To be allowed a formal hearing or enquiry.
To be present at a formal hearing or enquiry.
To be represented at a formal hearing or enquiry by a representative of his/her
choice, such representative being an employee of "The Company".
To cross-examine any person giving evidence and to ask questions of any evidence
produced.
To call witnesses to testify on his/her behalf
To an interpreter – if necessary – who is an employee of the company (if possible).
To appeal within five working days against any penalty which may be imposed to a
higher level of management.

The order of proceedings
At the beginning of the hearing, the prosecutor will put the charge to the employee. The
employee will have the opportunity to plead guilty or not guilty. If the employee pleads guilty,
the chairperson may continue to determine an appropriate penalty (after hearing submissions
from parties about mitigating and aggravating factors). If the employee pleads not guilty,
evidence should be presented.
The prosecutor has to present the case of the employer with the aim of proving on a
balance of probability that the accused is guilty. The employee (or his/her representative) will
then get an opportunity to cross-examine (question) the witnesses of the employer.
Hereafter, the prosecutor has an opportunity to re-examine the company witnesses to clear
up any confusion.
The employee then gets an opportunity to state his/her case. The employee testifies first
and may then be cross-examined by the prosecutor. The employee‟s representative may
ask him/her some questions in re-examination to clarify any uncertainties, which arose
during cross-examination. The employee’s witnesses are allowed to testify next. The may
also be cross-examined by the prosecutor and may then be re-examined by the employee
or his/her representative.
At the end of the hearing, the chairperson decides whether the employee is guilty or not
guilty. Should the decision be that the employee is not guilty, it is the end of the matter.
Should the verdict however, be that the employee is guilty, the chairperson should state
his/her decision and then allow both parties (the employee or his/her representative) and the
prosecutor an opportunity to state mitigating or aggravating factors and what the sanction
should be in their view. The chairperson then has to decide on the sanction (penalty). This
may be given there and then, after a short break or within a reasonable time (not more than
five days). The chairperson‟s decision should be given in writing, with reasons for his
decision.
The employee should be informed that s/he has a right to appeal. If the company does not
provide for an appeal (which is not compulsory by law), the employee must be reminded that
he/she could take the case further in a bargaining council, the CCMA or in another agreed
way (e.g. private arbitration).

Page 110
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

3.5.4

Mitigation

a.

The chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry may request the complainant and/or the
manager responsible for personnel administration to furnish evidence in
mitigation/aggravation or as to severity of the offence, if any.

b.

Examples of mitigating factors include:






Length of service;
Past disciplinary record;
Provocation (e.g. in the case of an assault charge);
Other circumstances;
Remorse

c.

The chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry shall only decide on the penalty after he
has considered mitigating and/or aggravation.

d.

The chairperson shall keep or facilitate that minutes of the enquiry proceedings are
kept and shall record decisions made on the disciplinary enquiry form and shall hand
the minute to a representative of the appropriate Human Resources Department, or
filing.

3.5.5

Step 3

Appeals
a.

A former employee or employee who regards any disciplinary action taken as
unjustified may appeal against the disciplinary action in writing, within 5 days of being
informed of the disciplinary action.

b.

An appeal hearing shall be considered by a manager more senior than the manager
who imposed the discipline. If a higher level does not exist or is not appropriate, a
manager of the same level as the manager who imposed the discipline shall hear the
hearing.

c.

An employee wishing to lodge an appeal shall fill out an appeal form, including a
statement outlining the grounds for appeal and shall hand it to the Human Resources
Department for recording and for arranging an appeal hearing.

d.

An appeal hearing in respect of a dismissal is not a rehearing of the disciplinary
enquiry. The appeal chairperson shall hear the appeal by reading the documentation
from the enquiry, including the record of the disciplinary enquiry and hearing
arguments by or on behalf of the employee and the company.

e.

The chairperson conducting the appeal shall exercise his/her discretion regarding
whether new or additional evidence will be received from the employee of the
company and whether or not any witnesses should be recalled.

f.

The appeal chairperson may either approve, reject, increase or vary the disciplinary
action already imposed and may, in his/her discretion, refer the matter to the
disciplinary enquiry or new disciplinary enquiry into the same or similar allegations.

4.

APPEALS

4.1

Procedure

Should the employee wish to appeal against the Chairperson‟s disciplinary sanction he/she
must inform the Human Resources Department of his/her intention.
The Human Resources Department will forward the Appeal Form to the employee and will
advise him/her to complete and return it within five (5) working days of the discipline taken.
The Human Resources Department will inform the complainant and alleged offender
(employee) of the time, date and venue of the hearing and who the Chairperson will be in the
Confirmation of an Appeal Hearing Form, once all the arrangements for the hearing have
been finalised. This hearing has to take place within three (3) working days after the appeal
was lodged and concluded within 30 days, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon.
All relevant documentation, pertaining to the appeal case must be given to the Chairperson
and the employee (if requested) 24 hours in advance. Trade union representation may be
allowed during the appeal stage.
The Chairperson must use the Appeal Checklist and Guidelines in handling the appeal.
Findings will be made available to the employee in writing within seven (7) working days.
In situations where the Chairperson has upheld the decision to dismiss, the Chairperson must
inform the employee that he/she can refer the dispute to the Commission for Conciliation,
Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). The appeal hearing will be the final internal dispute
resolution procedure to an employee before he can refer the dispute to the CCMA.
5.

DISPUTES

5.1

What is the CCMA?

CCMA stands for Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and is an external
dispute resolution body, independent of the state, any political party, trade union, employer
and employer‟s organisation
The Commission is a tripartite body, made up of representatives from the state, business and
labour and they all have local offices in each of the provinces.
5.2

Functions of the Commission

The Commission educates, advises, arbitrates and conciliates between two disputing parties.
In our situation the dispute would be between the company and the employee.
5.3

The Dispute Resolution Process

The employee must refer the dispute to the Commission within 30 days after services have
been terminated. The Commission further requires proof that a copy of the referral has been
sent to the employer. The Commission will appoint a Commissioner who will attempt to
resolve the dispute through Conciliation, if the latter is unsuccessful he can then either refer
the dispute for arbitration or Labour Court – depending on the nature of the dispute.
The onus is on the employee to prove that a dismissal took place. If this is proved then the
onus is on the employer to prove that the dismissal was fair.

6.

INCAPACITY PROCEDURE

6.1

The Purpose of Incapacity Procedure

The purpose of the procedure is to assist managers/supervisors to manage incapacity
efficiently by identifying the reasons for the incapacity so they can provide a structured
system of assisting the employee to improve his or her performance to the required standards
of work required of them in terms of their contracts of employment within a reasonable period
of time.
6.2

The Process of Incapacity Procedure.

Phase 1 – Investigation
Investigate the reasons for the poor performance. That is to establish the gap between the
employees‟ actual performance and the required standards.
Phase 2 – Communicate Performance Standards
Once the supervisor has established the gap he/she will need to set up a meeting with the
employee.
At the meeting the supervisor indicates to the employee what the difference is between
his/her actual performance and the required standards.
Explore and discuss the reasons for the poor performance.
Advise the employee that you wish to explore the next step. Adjourn the meeting for as long
as is necessary, setting up the time for the next meeting.
On your own, consider the reasons for the poor performance, investigating further if
necessary.
If the poor performance is caused by a lack of training, then remedy this. In this case call the
employee in and advise him/her of the plans to provide the training.
If the poor performance is not because of training shortage, then prepare for a Performance
Counselling Meeting.
Preparing For a Performance Counseling Meeting
Examine the employee‟s performance record. Determine whether the employee has ever
performed at the required standards before.
If the employee has, then you are probably dealing with a motivation or willingness problem.
If not, then it is more likely to be a capacity or incapacity problem.
Note: The unwillingness referred to above is usually caused by personal problems and should
be distinguished from an outright refusal to perform, which constitutes insubordination, a form
of misconduct. Insubordination should be dealt with through the Disciplinary Procedure.
Prepare for the performance counselling meeting by writing down all the relevant information
with regard to the employees‟ performance.
Phase 3 – Holding a Performance Counseling Meeting
Advise the employee of the details, which you have established in regard to the poor
performance.
Advise the employee that the company is unable to accept performance, which is below
standard.
Page 113
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Ask the employee if there are any input/suggestions that he/she can make to resolve the
problem.
Discuss any input/suggestions with the employee and try to agree on the methods to solve
the problem.
Advise the employee of a reasonable date by which his/her performance will be reassessed,
reinforcing the standards that must be met.
Set a date for the counselling follow up meeting and advise how he/she will be monitored in
the interim.
After the meeting, record everything in writing and send a copy thereof to the employee.
Phase 4 – Monitoring Performance after Counseling
Measure the performance output as determined at the counselling meeting. Do this as often
as possible and record the performance levels.
Feedback performance to the employee informally and sensitively each time it is monitored.
If the employee has improved then this should be pointed out to him/her with encouragement.
If the improvement is still, however, not up to the required standards, the employee should be
advised of this and encouraged to achieve higher levels.
If there is no improvement this should be fed back to the employee.
Prepare for the follow up meeting in the same way as you prepared for the original
counselling meeting.
Holding a Counseling Follow up Meeting
Advise the employee of all the information gathered during the monitoring period, linking
performance levels with required standards.
If performance standards are being met, then advise the employee thereof, praising him/her
for achieving the level. Set a further follow up counselling meeting and continue monitoring.
Carry on with this process until the employee is consistently achieving standards. Thereafter,
cease further follow up meetings.
If the performance standards have not been met, then advise the employee thereof. Advise
the employee that his/her inability to achieve required performance standards puts a question
mark against his/her suitability for the job.
Ask the employee if he/she has any further input/suggestions or, in fact, even representations
which he/she wishes to make to you considering his/her future with the organisation. Make a
note of such input, and, if necessary, give the employee the extra time to consider such
inputs/presentations.
Adjourn the meeting, setting a reasonable time as soon thereafter to continue with the
discussion.
If it becomes evident that there has been little or no improvement in performance, remind the
employee of the possible consequences i.e. termination of his/her services through an
incapacity hearing.
Note: Depending on the position or level, the time period allowed for improvement will vary,
e.g. an employee in a clerical position may be given up to 2 weeks where as an executive
may be given 12 weeks for improvement.

Page 114
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Phase 5 – Holding an Incapacity Hearing
The Incapacity Hearing is similar to the Disciplinary Hearing. The employee must be:


Notified in writing and the reason thereof.



Given adequate time to prepare, at least three (3) days.



Informed of his/her rights, especially with regard to an interpreter.

At the hearing an impartial chairperson chairs the meeting. Both the initiator and the
employee make representations to the chairperson. The chairperson will adjourn the hearing
for as long as is necessary to give final consideration to the matter.
The chairperson will reconvene the meeting and advise the employee of the outcome of the
hearing, which could be termination, transfer or demotion on the grounds of poor
performance/unsuitability. The termination of the contract would always be with notice pay.
The employee may appeal against the finding of the hearing, especially termination, via the
Appeal procedure.
What to do if it is Not a Performance Problem
There are, however, situations, after investigation, where the supervisor realises that the
employee is aware of the required standards and has previously performed to the required
standards. In this situation the supervisor will be dealing with negligence and he/she can only
address this by taking disciplinary action.
Poor Performance As A Result Of Ill Health or Injury
The supervisor will handle poor performance as a result of ill health or injury, in a similar
manner. However, consider:


Length of service



Nature of job



Nature of illness



Prospects for recovery



Time off the job

There is, however, a duty on the employer to:


Accommodate employees if practicably possible, if injured on duty, although do not
have to create a new position.



Ascertain if employee is capable of doing work assigned.



Ascertain whether duties can be adapted to suit employee.



Ascertain whether alternative work is available.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT

7.1

Introduction

The Company is committed to providing a work environment that is free of any form of unfair
discrimination or harassment. This includes any acts or threats that interfere with the
performance at work or in study of any individual or group on account of race, gender, sex,
pregnancy, marital status, family responsibility, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual
orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, political opinion, culture, language or
birth.
7.2

Objectives

The company will provide policy and procedures for resolving complaints of sexual
harassment to:




7.3

promote a safe secure work environment in which the dignity of all persons is
respected and which is free from sexual harassment;
provide an internal procedure for dealing with issues and complaints of sexual
harassment which may arise;
meet the requirements the Employment Equity Act and Labour Relations Act , 1995
Code of Good Practice on the Handling of Sexual Harassment cases
General

NRC is committed to maintaining an environment within the company that is free from sexual
harassment.
Sexual harassment is seen as unacceptable behaviour.
Sexual harassment is a serious issue, which undermines morale and can adversely affect the
ability of staff to achieve their full potential within the company.
The company is committed to taking action to deter sexual harassment, to increase
awareness that such behaviour is unacceptable and to ensure that complaints are dealt with
fairly and promptly.
7.4

Definitions

Sexual harassment is defined in our legislation as “unwanted conduct of a sexual nature”. The
distinguishing characteristics of sexual harassment are that it is conduct with a sexual
component, which is unwelcome, unsolicited and unreciprocated.
Sexual attention becomes sexual harassment if:




The behaviour is persisted in, although a single incident of harassment can constitute
sexual harassment, and or
The recipient has made it clear that the behaviour is considered offensive and or
The perpetrator should have known that the behaviour is regarded as unacceptable.

It is not only the intention of the alleged harasser that is the issue, but also the complainant‟s
reasonable perception and experience of the alleged harasser‟s behaviour.

Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

7.5

Forms of Sexual Harassment

Sexual harassment may include physical, verbal and non-verbal conduct, which includes, but
is not limited to:
Physical
Unwanted and deliberate physical contact;
Verbal






unwelcome verbal comments of a sexual nature;
subtle or explicit demands for, or offers of, sexual favours;
verbal sexual harassment such as unwelcome innuendos, suggestions and hints;
comments with sexual overtones; sex-related jokes or insults or unwelcome graphic
comments about a person‟s body made in his/her presence or directed to him/her;
unwelcome and inappropriate enquiries about a person‟s sex life; and unwelcome
whistling directed at a person or group of persons.

Non-verbal





gratuitous display of sexually explicit written or audio-visual materials;
transmission or display of offensive email, screen savers or pornographic computer
images;
offensive gestures or actions of a sexual nature including indecent exposure or
“flashing”;
persistent unwanted attention: following or stalking behaviour.

Sexual favouritism exists where a person who is in a position of authority favours those who
respond to his/her sexual advances, whilst other deserving employees who do not respond to
sexual advances are disadvantaged or denied opportunities for example in relation to
promotion, nominations for merit awards, training opportunities, etc.
Some forms of sexual conduct, which are considered innocuous by some people, may be
considered offensive by others. In addition, different social or cultural backgrounds may lead
persons to perceive the same conduct differently. All staff is expected to respect the
sensitivities of others especially where there may be variations in the interpretation of
acceptable behaviour and accordingly cultural differences may not be used as an excuse or
justification for sexual harassment.
Quid pro quo harassment, occurs where an employer, supervisor, member of management or
co-employee, undertakes or attempts to influence the process of employment, promotion,
training, discipline, dismissal, salary increment or other benefit of an employee or job
applicant in exchange for sexual favours. Accordingly, the company has concerns where
sexual harassment:




implicitly or explicitly imposes a condition on staff recruitment, selection, appraisal or
career progress;
interferes with work performance;
creates an intimidating or offensive working environment and undermines social
functioning.

Human Resources Policy

7.6

Responsibilities of all Staff

All staff has the responsibility for upholding the company‟s sexual harassment policy. Line
managers shall have a particular responsibility to ensure that areas within their jurisdiction are
free from sexual harassment. This includes:





7.7

ensuring that staff are aware of appropriate and acceptable standards of behaviour;
making known the company‟s policy, including the procedures for resolving
complaints;
taking early corrective action to deal with behaviour that may constitute sexual
harassment;
promoting awareness programs designed to prevent sexual harassment in the
company.
Procedures for Resolving Complaints

The company has instituted a set of procedures, which aim to ensure that:




complaints of sexual harassment are considered seriously and sympathetically and
are dealt with promptly and confidentially;
complainants are protected against victimisation or retaliation for lodging complaints;
the rights of both the complainant and the alleged harasser are respected.

Where possible and appropriate, complaints should be resolved at the lowest level with a
minimum of formal processes.
A person who believes she or he has experienced sexual harassment should attempt to
resolve the matter by stating an objection directly to the alleged harasser. If the person feels
unable to do this, or if this approach does not result in the cessation of the behaviour, the
person may choose to activate the company‟s internal procedure.
A victim of sexual assault has the right to press separate criminal and/or civil charges
against the alleged harasser and these rights are not limited by this policy.
Proceeding
Employees do not have to take formal proceedings if they do not wish to do so and it is
suggested that attempts be made to resolve the problem informally in the first instance. This
can be done by the employees concerned clearly explaining to the person engaging in the
unwanted conduct that the behaviour in question is not welcome, that it offends him or her, or
makes him or her uncomfortable, and that it interferes with his or her work.
NOTE The employee may at this stage ask for support or for the initial approach to be made
by the Human Resources Manager.
Should there be no resolution to the complainant‟s satisfaction, formal proceedings will be
instituted which will necessitate that the complaint be submitted, in writing, to the Human
Resources Manager. The alleged offender will in turn be invited to state his or her case, in
writing.
Complaints will be investigated within two (2) working days in as confidential a manner as
possible. Management will ensure that any victimisation, which may result from lodging such
a complaint, will be dealt with in the utmost severity. Likewise, management will not tolerate
false accusations.
Any employee found to be guilty of having harassed another employee would be subject to
appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Depending on
Page 118
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

the nature and consequences of the sexual harassment, disciplinary steps may include
redeployment, relocation or transfer, written warning, and dismissal. A harasser may further
be required to attend relevant counselling.
A non-employee who subjects an employee to sexual harassment in the workplace will be
informed of company Harassment Policy. Other action, deemed appropriate, may be taken
(e.g. Informing the harasser‟s employer of the unwanted conduct).
The complainant may withdraw the complaint at any stage. Should the complaint not be
resolved satisfactorily through internal procedures, either party may, within thirty days of the
dispute having arisen; refer the matter to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and
Arbitration (CCMA) for conciliation in terms of section 135 of the Labour Relations Act.
7.8

Confidentiality

At all stages the utmost care will be taken to ensure confidentiality.
Complainants and respondents will be advised at all stages of the internal procedure to
maintain confidentiality and to discuss the complaint only with those who have an official
responsibility for dealing with it.
The company will disclose to either party, such information as may be reasonably necessary
to enable the parties to prepare for any proceedings contained in this document.
Allegations of sexual harassment are potentially defamatory because they impact on the
reputation of the alleged harasser. However allegations made in good faith and through
appropriate channels pursuant to this policy and procedures are unlikely to be defamatory. In
particular:





It is not defamation for a person who thinks that they have been sexually harassed to
write and deliver a letter to the alleged harasser or speak privately to the alleged
harasser about the alleged harassment;
Statements made in the context of receiving counseling or legal advice are likely to
receive the protection of „legal privilege‟ and hence fall outside the scope of
defamation;
Allegations that are untrue, motivated by ill-will or malice, or inappropriately conveyed
to people who have no legitimate interest in knowing them are likely to breach
defamation laws;
Untrue or malicious counter allegations against the complainant are also likely to be
construed as defamation if they are conveyed to persons who have no legitimate
interest in the matter.

During the process, limited information (preferably non-identifying) may need to be given to a
third party for the purpose of working out a resolution, for example a head of Department or
Unit Manager. This may be done with the agreement of the complainant and respondent as
part of the process. Such limited information should only be provided on a strictly „need to
know‟ basis to those who have a genuine and official role in dealing with and resolving the
matter. The person who is provided with such information is required to preserve
confidentiality.
Information may also be disclosed where there is an imminent physical threat of danger to a
person.
Records of proceedings of formal cases will be kept in sealed, confidential files and then
disposed of in accordance with the approved disposal schedules utilised by the Human
Resources Department.

Malicious Complaints

If the complaint is found to be vexatious, action against the complainant may be taken under
the company‟s disciplinary procedures.

represented by a fellow employee.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

9.1

Guide to the grievance procedure:

A grievance is any dissatisfaction or sense of injustice, or unfairness felt by an employee in
connection with his/her work or employment situation that is brought to the attention of the
person(s) in charge of the employee, other than in terms of the Conditions of Service and
other than arising from disciplinary action.
This grievance procedure is intended to facilitate the effective handling of grievances that may
from time to time present themselves in the working environment. A grievance may be
resolved between parties at any of the five steps of the procedure.
The company accepts that it is in the mutual interest of the company and its employees that a
formal procedure exists to bring grievances to the attention of the management without fear of
discrimination or victimisation.
It is intended that grievances be resolved as expeditiously as possible and as close as
possible to their sources. It is incumbent upon supervisors and officials at all stages of the
procedure to indicate whether they are empowered to resolve the grievance or whether it
should be referred immediately to a stage where it can be resolved.

Page 122
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

The aim of the procedure is to deal with grievances in a systematic manner, by endeavouring
to establish all the facts. This will require a thorough investigation of the issues at stake.
The procedure also endeavours to standardise the measures for conveying individual and
collective grievances through the correct channels.
Experience has shown that a standardised approach to grievances generally improves
working relationships among staff at all levels.
Timing is extremely important. Grievances should be handled in accordance with times
indicated under each step.
Due to the multilingual nature of our employee complement, it is important that an interpreter
is involved where necessary. The interpreter‟s services may be arranged by the employee
involved in the grievance.
This grievance procedure applies to all employees, as defined.
9.2

Principles of the Grievance Procedure:

Responsibility
The responsibility to handle and resolve the grievance rests with line management. Human
Resources Department should advise both parties of their rights and responsibilities and be
impartial at all times.
Expectations
Management should not attempt to prescribe or restrict the nature of grievances. However,
the following do not fall under this procedure:


Appeal against disciplinary action, as there is provision for this in the disciplinary
procedure, unless such disciplinary action is informal then this procedure will apply.



Any issues which do not relate directly to the working environment or the
employer/employee relationship e.g. personal, social or family problems.

9.3

The Grievance Procedure

The procedure to be adopted is as follows:
Informal:
Depending on the nature of the grievance, employees should first try and follow the informal
procedure.
Your Manager should be notified of your grievance, and the grievance should be discussed
with him/her.

Page 123
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Should you feel that the matter has not been adequately settled, the formal procedure must
be followed.
Formal:
Step 1

filling in the Grievance Report Form. This form is available from the Human Resources
Department.
The Department Manager shall attempt to resolve the grievance within three working days (or
longer if agreed to by the employee) and shall record such attempt on the grievance report
form.
If the grievance is resolved, this is recorded on the form and both the Manager and employee
must sign the form. The form is then filed.
Step 2
If the grievance is not resolved at step 1, or the employee is unhappy with the outcome, the
form is then handed to the next level of authority. (Line Manager/Departmental Head).
The Line Manager/Departmental Head shall attempt to resolve the grievance within three
working days (or longer if agreed to by the employee) and shall record each attempt on the
grievance report form.
If the grievance is resolved, this is recorded on the form and both the Manager and employee
must sign the form. The form is then filed.
Step 3
If the grievance is not resolved at step 2, the General Manager, on receipt of the grievance
form, shall attend to the grievance within three working days (unless agreed to otherwise by
both parties).

RETRENCHMENT/REDUNDANCY

The company recognises the need to afford its employees maximum job security and
therefore endeavour to avoid retrenchment or redundancy of employees where it is practically
and reasonably possible. Retrenchment/Redundancy will be used as a last resort to ensure
the continued functioning of the company or any of its divisions/functions/units on a basis of
sound and responsible management of the business. It is recognised that the company may
terminate and employee‟s service for reasons relating to operational requirements of the
employer‟s business. The term “operational requirements” refers to economical,
technological, structural or similar reasons which may lead to redundancy or retrenchment.
10.1

Definition

Retrenchment may occur if the and when the business activity of the company decreases due
to a deterioration of the economic situation, resulting in organisational changes, whereby
certain positions in the company will be eliminated due to sufficient work not being available,
thereby necessitating a cut-back in the work place.
Redundancy shall mean the reduction of staff on a permanent basis due to the operation of
the company, or parts thereof, closing down or undergoing change, or because of the
following:


A relocation of facilities/Units



Technological or technical changes.



Atomisation.



Mechanisation.



Merges and takeovers.



Other events which the company deems to be of a serious nature, warranting
redundancy of employees.

The same rules, procedures and benefits shall be applicable for both retrenchment and
redundancy, subject to the provisions of 10.3 hereunder.
10.2

Objective

To create a formal retrenchment policy and procedure which takes into account the
company‟s responsibility, duty and right to balance manpower levels to the demands of the
market and changing technology, and which is substantially and procedurally fair to the
employees as well as the company.
10.3

Notification of contemplated retrenchment/redundancies

The first step in the retrenchment process is to inform the relevant trade unions of issues
arising within the Company, which may make it necessary to evaluate staffing levels.
10.4

Measures to avoid dismissals due to operational requirements

The company commits itself to consider wherever practically feasible the following
alternatives prior to the implementation of retrenchment and redundancy in an endeavour to
avoid such action:
Avoidance of Termination:
In consultations with employees and the relevant stakeholders or employee representatives
the, company will consider all possible and practical means for avoiding the proposed
termination(s) of service.

Page 127
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

While it may not be possible or practical to avoid retrenchments/redundancies, the following
will be considered prior to a decision to terminate:
















Reducing staff numbers through natural attrition.
Temporarily suspending recruitment.
Providing adequate in-service or external training to existing staff in order to equip
them for appointment/transfer to other suitable posts within the company.
An offer of internal transfer not necessarily at the same job/salary level.
Voluntary resignation with possibly full or reduced benefits.
The possibility of individuals working short time at correspondingly reduced salary
levels.
Extended unpaid leave or Temporary lay-offs.
Other proposals advanced by the appropriate representative bodies.
The abolition or limitation of new appointments affected according to skills required.
Early retirement.
The abolition or limitation of overtime except in categories providing emergency
services.
Short time.
No casual employees.
Dismissing temporary or contract employees, or non-renewal of their contracts.
Voluntary retrenchment.

The above is not exhaustive and other aspects may also be considered to avoid actual
retrenchment/redundancy, subject always too feasible practicality.
10.5

Procedure

10.5.1 Notice to relevant parties
After the above alternatives have been considered, and are seen as not viable, notification
should be sent out to any employees who may be affected and their trade union
representatives, informing them of the potential for retrenchments, the reasons therefore, and
inviting them to consult.
Non-unionised employees may nominate employee representatives to represent them at this
forum. NRC undertakes to give relevant parties (unions and affected non-unionised
employees) reasonable notice of their potential for retrenchment. At this stage, proposed
dates for consultation should be forwarded to the other parties.
10.5.2 Disclosure of information
The company will disclose all relevant information required by law, including, but not limited to
the following:










the reasons for the proposed dismissals;
the alternatives that the employer considered before proposing the dismissals, and
the reasons for rejecting each of those alternatives;
the number of employees likely to be affected and the job categories in which they
are employed;
the proposed method for selecting which employees to dismiss;
the time when, or the period during which, the dismissals are likely to take effect;
the severance pay proposed;
any assistance that the employer proposes to offer to the employees likely to be
dismissed;
the possibility of the future re-employment of the employees who are dismissed;
the number of employees employed by the employer; and
Page 128
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy



the number of employees that the employer has dismissed for reasons based on its
operational requirements in the preceding 12 months.

The company will not disclose of information that:





is legally privileged;
that the company cannot disclose without contravening a prohibition imposed on the
employer by any law or order of any court;
that is confidential and, if disclosed, may cause substantial harm to an employee or
the company; or
that is private personal information relating to an employee, unless that employee
consents to the disclosure of that information.

10.5.3 Consultation
Consultation will take place in good faith, and with the intention of finding alternatives to
retrenchment where viable, reasonable and practical. Any decisions taken will be deemed to
be in the best interests of the Institution and its employees. The company and the other
consulting party/parties will endeavor to engage in a meaningful joint consensus-seeking
process and attempt to reach consensus on appropriate measures:







to avoid the dismissals;
to minimize the number of dismissals;
to change the timing of the dismissals;
to mitigate the adverse effects of the dismissals;
the method for selecting the employees to be dismissed; and
the severance pay for dismissed employees.

The company will allow the other consulting party an opportunity during consultation to make
representations about any matter dealt with above as well as any other matter relating to the
proposed dismissals.
The company will consider and respond to the representations made by the other consulting
party and, in the event that the company does not agree with them, the company will sate the
reasons for disagreeing. The company will respond in writing to any written representations
made by the other consulting party/parties.
An agenda will be set up for each consultation session to facilitate discussions and to keep
the parties focused. It may also be more practical to split the topics up into different sessions,
again to enable the discussion to remain focused.
At each meeting, dates for subsequent meetings should be scheduled and full minutes should
be taken.
NOTE: Any employee unreasonably refusing an offer of alternative employment
offered by NRC prior to retrenchment may not qualify for the severance package.
10.5.4 Selection
The company will endeavor to select the employees to be dismissed according to the
following selection criteria:



that have been agreed to by the consulting parties; or
if no criteria have been agreed, criteria that are fair and objective.‟‟.

Page 129
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

10.5.5 Confirmation of Retrenchment/Non Retrenchment and Counseling
Once the consulting process is concluded, certain decisions will have been taken by the
Company. These decisions will be:







Whether reduction in staff is in fact necessary.
If it is necessary, what form will the reduction take – i.e. will current employees be
trained to fill suitable vacancies where possible, will they be retrenched; will eligible
employees be placed on early retirement or disability retirement?
How many employees will be affected and how these employees will be selected.
When retirements / retrenchments will take place.
What the severance package will be.
Notification will now be sent to all the “potentially effected” employees as mentioned
in point 3 informing them as to whether or not they are in fact going to be retrenched,
and the outcome of the consultation.

Unions and or nominated employee representatives will be provided with a list of employees
the company plans to retrench at least 4 weeks prior to the proposed retrenchment date.
Employees selected for retrenchment will be notified at least 4 weeks in advance of their
scheduled date of retrenchment.
The employees who opt for early retirement or who will be retrenched will be encouraged to
go for counseling (which will be provided by the company). This counseling will aim at
helping employees adapt to their changed circumstances, and will include advice on certain
financial aspects such as investment options for the retrenchment package.
10.5.6 Severance Pay
Those employees who will be retrenched must receive a severance package. Retrenched
employees will be paid separation benefits equivalent to those they would ordinarily have
received in the case of resignation, as well as a severance package.
The severance
package will be discussed and finalised through consultation, but will be a minimum of 1
weeks salary for every completed years of continuous service as a permanent employee, as
per the BCEA and the Code of Good Practice. This package will be made up of the following:





Notice Pay (this may be worked or not – depending on the needs of the Company.
Notice will be 1 month or 2 weeks depending on length of service).
Leave Pay (any outstanding annual leave balance)
Severance Pay (Minimum of 1 weeks salary for every completed years service)
Retirement Fund Withdrawal (as per the rules of the Pension/Provident Fund)

Any severance pay paid to an employee, shall be over and above all monies contractually
due to such an employee.
“Continuous Service” includes time spent working at other companies in the group (were the
employee has been transferred without any break in service). This further refers to unbroken
service within the group or company.
An employee who unreasonable refuses to accept the company‟s offer of alternative
employment with the company or any other company in not entitled to any severance pay.
The employee will also be provided with a certificate of service.

INDUSTRIAL ACTION

12.1

INTRODUCTION

The company recognises the embodiment in the constitution of South Africa of the right of
employees to strike, and the entrenchment of the right to strike in the Labour Relations Act of
1995. The company also recognises its ' recourse to lock-out. The company parties confirm
their commitment to sound Industrial Relations and as such their resolve to resort to Industrial
Action only as an extreme method to be utilised in accordance with the rules set out
hereunder.
The objectives of this policy are to:


Ensure that patient‟s care is not compromised.



Arrive at a settlement acceptable to both the company and the striking employees in
the shortest possible time.



Attempt to contain the Industrial action as much as possible so that there is minimum
disruption.



Restore order and workflow.



Prevent injury to persons and damage to property



Diffuse management/employee tensions

12.2

POLICY STATEMENT

Industrial Action
The company belief that to avoid confusion and deal with industrial action in a professional
and controlled manner, it is important to:



spell out the responsibilities and authority of designated persons; and
spell out the various aspects and factors that have to be taken into consideration in
managing industrial action.

The company belief that industrial action by both the employees and the company should be
a "measure of last resort", and that the preferred approach to dispute resolution should be
negotiation, followed, in need, by other dispute resolution mechanisms such as conciliation,
mediation and, where appropriate, arbitration.
12.3

Definitions

Strikes
The Labour Relations Act defines a strike as: "the partial or complete concerted refusal to
work, or the retardation or obstruction of work, by persons who are or have been employed by
the same employer or by different employers, for the purpose of remedying a grievance or
resolving a dispute of any matter of mutual interest between employer and employee, and
every reference to "work" in this definition includes overtime work, whether it is voluntary or
compulsory".

Page 133
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Lock-out
Lock-out is defined in the Act as: "the exclusion by an employer of employees from the
employer's workplace for the purpose of compelling the employees to accept a demand in
respect of any matter of mutual interest between employer and employee, whether or not the
employer breaches those employees' contracts of employment in the course of or for the
purpose of that exclusion".
Secondary Strikes
The Labour Relations Act defines a secondary strike as: "a strike, or conduct in contemplation
or furtherance of a strike, that is in support of a strike by other employees against their
employer but does not include a strike in pursuit of a demand that has been referred to a
council if the striking employees, employed within the registered scope of that council, have a
material interest in that demand".
Conciliation
Conciliation involves attempts by the parties to a dispute to settle their differences prior to
industrial action. Conciliation is an extension of the negotiation process and is an integral part
of the dispute-settlement procedure. The aim of the conciliation process is to allow the parties
to settle the dispute between themselves without the direct intervention of external agents.
Mediation
Mediation involves the active intervention of a third party or parties for the purpose of
achieving settlement of a dispute between the parties. The role of the mediator is to negotiate,
advise, act as intermediary and suggest possible solutions to both parties. A mediator has no
decision-making power and cannot impose a settlement on either party.
Arbitration
Arbitration involves third party adjudication in a dispute. The arbitrator actively intervenes in
the dispute and makes a decision on the terms of settlement of the dispute. The arbitrator's
decision is final and binding on the parties concerned.
Dispute of Interest
A dispute of interest involves a dispute in which a party has a distinct interest but no clear
right, such as the allocation of an interest related resource, i.e., improved wages and
conditions of employment. Disputes of interest are most often resolved through mediation or,
ultimately, a trial of strength such as strike or lock-out action aimed at inducing the other party
to moderate its position to achieve agreement.
Dispute of Right
A dispute of right involves a dispute in which established or existing rights of either party are
interfered with or ignored. Such rights may accrue through a contract of employment, legally
determined conditions of employment, and procedures, i.e., industrial legislation, and
unilateral changes to accepted or customary practices. Disputes of rights, therefore, are
suitable for third party adjudication.

Page 134
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

12.4

Limitations to the right to strike

No employee may take part in a strike, or in any conduct in contemplation or furtherance of a
strike, if the employee is bound by a collective agreement that prohibits a strike in respect of
the issue in dispute. Employees may also not take protected strike action where they are
bound by a collective agreement that requires the issue in dispute to be referred to arbitration,
or where the dispute is one that the employee or union has the right to refer to arbitration or to
the Labour Court in terms of the Act if that person is engaged in an essential service or a
maintenance service.
Employees may not take part in a secondary strike, unless the strike that is to be supported
complies with the provisions of the Act, and unless the employer of the employees taking part
in the secondary strike or, where appropriate, the employers' organisation of which that
employer is a member, has received written notice of the proposed secondary strike at least
seven days prior to its commencement. Employees may not take part in a secondary strike
unless the nature and extent of the secondary strike is reasonable in relation to the possible
direct or indirect effect that the secondary strike may have on the business of the primary
employer.
The company as a secondary employer may apply to the Labour Court for an interdict to
prohibit or limit a secondary strike that is not reasonable in relation to the possible direct or
indirect effect that the secondary strike may have on the business of the primary employer.
12.5

Protected Strikes

In order for a strike to be protected, the strike must take place after all dispute settlement
procedures detailed in the Labour Relations Act, or in any bargaining council or
recognition/collective agreement which may exist between the parties, have been exhausted.
Should employees fail to follow the relevant dispute settlement procedures, the strike will not
be protected, and the company can seek certain remedies through the Act. These remedies
include the company applying to the Labour Court for an interdict in order to restrain the union
and its members, and applying to the Labour Court to award the payment of just and
equitable compensation in respect of the strike. Should employees not follow the required
procedures in exercising their right to strike, this may constitute a fair reason for dismissal.
The company will not remunerate an employee for services that the employee does not
render during a protected strike. Therefore the “no work no pay” rule will apply.
12.6

Unprotected Strikes

Unprotected strikes occur in the absence of, or prior to, the exhausting of agreed dispute
settlement procedures, or those contemplated in the Labour Relations Act.
12.7

Recourse to Lock out

The Labour Relations Act of 1995 gives every employer resource to lock-out provided certain
requirements are met. For a lock-out to be protected the issue in dispute must have been
referred to the CCMA and a certificate stating that the dispute remains unresolved has been
issued. Employers will also have recourse to lock-out if a period of 30 days has elapsed since
the receipt of the referral by the CCMA, or after any extension of that period agreed to
between the parties to the dispute. However, these provisions need not be adhered to should
the lock-out be in accordance with an applicable collective agreement, or if the employer
locks out the employees in response to their taking part in a strike which fails to conform to
the provisions of the Act.
Page 135
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

12.7.1 Lock-outs in compliance with the LRA
A lock-out which is in compliance with the LRA can be described as 'protected' with the effect
that the company will not commit a delict or breach of contract by conducting such lock-out, or
taking part in any conduct in contemplation or furtherance of a lock-out. The term 'protected'
also implies that the various procedural requirements have been complied with.
The company is not obliged to remunerate an employee for services which the employee is
unable to provide during a protected lock-out.
12.9

PROCEDURE

12.9.1 Strike rules
See ANNEXURE 5O: STRIKE RULES.
12.2.2 Handling the strike
Prior to the actual Strike
Establish a Strike Handling Committee
Certain key roles should be fulfilled during a strike. Coordination between different managers
during a strike is of supreme importance. The designated roles and method of coordinating
the roles should be detailed.
A strike handling committee should comprise of the following members:


Team Leader: This person will lead the strike handling committee. All involved in
handling the strike must be clear as to who this person is and where he can be
located at all times.



A Communicator: This person will be responsible to communicate with
representatives of the striking employees. It is advisable to separate the roles of
team leader and communicator, both from a logistical and reserve point-of-view.



A Press Liaison Officer: he/she should be responsible for setting up and
maintaining constant accurate communication with the press.



A Security Co-ordinator: This person should co-ordinate the security in and outside
the company.



An Internal Communication Co-ordinator: Often management is not directly
involved in strike handling, and non-striking employees are ignored during a strike.
Regular formal communication should be maintained with both management and
non-striking employees – therefore someone should be given this specific
responsibility.



A Recorder of Events: This person must be appointed to maintain the strike diary so
that there is an accurate record of events each day.

Establish a Strike Co-ordination Office
The CEO‟s office should serve as the strike co-ordination office.

Page 136
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Communications
It will be important to establish a clear channel of communication prior to and during the
Industrial action. A register of key personnel and services from both within and outside may
be drawn up.
This register should include contact addresses, telephone and fax numbers where applicable.
The following contact persons, organisations and services should be included in the register:


All members of the strike handling committee



The officials of the Union



Shop stewards



Human Resources Manager



Press/Media contacts



South African Police

8.3

During Industrial Action

During the Industrial action each Department will have certain tasks and responsibilities:


Employees should try to ignore striking employees, stay calm and be prepared to
help in other departments in the company, if necessary. Employees may also be
required to work overtime in the event of a strike. During the strike no staff member
must give anybody any information concerning the strike.



Each Departmental Manager should keep a diary of events and inform the Strike
Handling committee of any occurrences.



All acts of sabotage or damage caused must immediately be reported to the Strike
Handling committee.



Brief staff about the daily situation and instruct them what reaction is expected of
them.



No employee may be dismissed for refusing to do the work of a striking employee,
unless the situation is one of an emergency.

HIV/AIDS

Until an official policy has been adopted the Code of Good practice will be utilised as a
guideline when dealing with HIV/Aids issues.

13.1

CODE OF GOOD
EMPLOYMENT

PRACTICE

ON

KEY

ASPECTS

OF

HIV/AIDS

AND

INTRODUCTION
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) are serious public health problems which have socio economic, employment and
human rights implications.
it is recognised that the HIV/AIDS epidemic will affect every workplace, with prolonged staff
illness, absenteeism, and death impacting on productivity, employee benefits, occupational
health and safety, production costs and workplace morale.
HIV knows no social, gender, age or racial boundaries, but it is accepted that socio-economic
circumstances do influence disease patterns. HIV thrives in an environment of poverty, rapid
urbanisation, violence and destabilisation. Transmission is exacerbated by disparities in
resources and patterns of migration from rural to urban areas. Women, particularly are more
vulnerable to infection in cultures and economic circumstances where they have little control
over their lives.
Furthermore HIV/AIDS is still a disease surrounded by ignorance, prejudice, discrimination
and stigma. In the workplace unfair discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS
has been perpetuated through practices such as pre-employment HIV testing, dismissals for
being HIV positive and the denial of employee benefits.
One of the most effective ways of reducing and managing the impact of HIV/AIDS in the
workplace is through the implementation of an HIV/AIDS policy and programme. Addressing
aspects of HIV/AIDS in the workplace will enable employers, trade unions and government to
actively contribute towards local, national and international efforts to prevent and control
HIV/AIDS. In light of this, the Code has been developed as a guide to employers, trade
unions and employees.
Furthermore the Code seeks to assist with the attainment of the broader goals of:






eliminating unfair discrimination in the workplace based on HIV status;
promoting a non-discriminatory workplace in which people living with HIV or AIDS are
able to be open about their HIV status without fear of stigma or rejection;
promoting appropriate and effective ways of managing HIV in the workplace;
creating a balance between the rights and responsibilities of all parties; and
giving effect to the regional obligations of the Republic as a member of the Southern
African Development Community.

OBJECTIVES
The Code‟s primary objective is to set out guidelines for employers and trade unions to
implement so as to ensure individuals with HIV infection are not unfairly discriminated against
in the workplace. This includes provisions regarding:
Page 138
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy







creating a non-discriminatory work environment;
dealing with HIV testing, confidentiality and disclosure;
providing equitable employee benefits;
dealing with dismissals; and
managing grievance procedures.

The Code‟s secondary objective is to provide guidelines for employers, employees and trade
unions on how to manage HIV/AIDS within the workplace. Since the HIV/AIDS epidemic
impacts upon the workplace and individuals at a number of different levels, it requires a
holistic response which takes all of these factors into account. The Code therefore includes
principles, which are dealt with in more detail under the statutes listed in item 5.1., on the
following:






creating a safe working environment for all employers and employees;
developing procedures to manage occupational incidents and claims for
compensation;
introducing measures to prevent the spread of HIV;
developing strategies to assess and reduce the impact of the epidemic upon the
workplace; and
supporting those individuals who are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS so that they
may continue to work productively for as long as possible.

In addition, the Code promotes the establishment of mechanisms to foster co-operation at the
following levels :



between employers, employees and trade unions in the workplace; and
between the workplace and other stakeholders at a sectoral, local, provincial and
national level.

POLICY PRINCIPLES
3.1. The promotion of equality and non-discrimination between individuals with HIV infection
and those without, and between HIV/AIDS and other comparable health/medical conditions.
3.2. The creation of a supportive environment so that HIV infected employees is able to
continue working under normal conditions in their current employment for as long as they are
medically fit to do so.
3.3. The protection of human rights and dignity of people living with HIV or AIDS is essential
to the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS.
3.4. HIV/AIDS impacts disproportionately on women and this should be taken into account in
the development of workplace policies and programmes.
3.5 Consultation, inclusivity and encouraging full participation of all stakeholders are key
principles which should underpin every HIV/AIDS policy and programme.
4. APPLICATION AND SCOPE
All employers and employees, and their respective organisations are encouraged to use this
Code to develop, implement and refine their HIV/AIDS policies and programmes to suit the
needs of their workplaces.

Page 139
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

For the purposes of this code, the term "workplace" should be interpreted more broadly than
the definition given in the Labour Relations Act, Act 66 of 1995, Section 213, to include the
working environment of, amongst others, persons not necessarily in an employer-employee
relationship, those working in the informal sector and the self-employed.
This Code however does not impose any legal obligation in addition to those in the
Employment Equity Act and Labour Relations Act, or in any other legislation referred to in the
Code. Failure to observe it does not, by itself, render an employer liable in any proceedings,
except where the Code refers to obligations set out in law.
The Code should be read in conjunction with other codes of good practice that may be issued
by the Minister of Labour.
LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The Code should be read in conjunction with the Constitution of South Africa Act, No. 108 of
1996, and all relevant Legislation which includes the following:









Employment Equity Act, No. 55 of 1998;
Labour Relations Act, No. 66 of 1995;
Occupational Health and Safety Act, No. 85 of 1993;
Mine Health and Safety Act, No. 29 of 1996;
Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, No. 130 of 1993;
Basic Conditions of Employment Act, No. 75 of 1997; and
Medical Schemes Act, No. 131 of 1998.
Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, No. 4 of 2000.

The contents of this code should be taken into account when developing, implementing or
reviewing any workplace policies or programmes in terms of the statutes listed above.
The following are selected, relevant sections contained in certain of the above-mentioned
legislation. These should be read in conjunction with other legislative provisions.
The Code is issued in terms of Section 54(1)(a) of the Employment Equity Act, No 55 of 1998
and is based on the principle that no person may be unfairly discriminated against on the
basis of their HIV status. In order to assist employers and employees to apply this principle
consistently in the workplace, the Code makes reference to other pieces of legislation.
Section 6(1) of the Employment Equity Act provides that no person may unfairly discriminate
against an employee, or an applicant for employment, in any employment policy or practice,
on the basis of his or her HIV status. In any legal proceedings in which it is alleged that any
employer has discriminated unfairly, the employer must prove that any discrimination or
differentiation was fair.
No employee, or applicant for employment, may be required by their employer to undergo an
HIV test in order to ascertain their HIV status. HIV testing by or on behalf of an employer may
only take place where the Labour Court has declared such testing to be justifiable in
accordance with Section 7(2) of the Employment Equity Act.
In accordance with Section 187(1)(f) of the Labour Relations Act, No. 66 of 1995, an
employee with HIV/AIDS may not be dismissed simply because he or she is HIV positive or
has AIDS. However where there are valid reasons related to their capacity to continue
working and fair procedures have been followed, their services may be terminated in
accordance with Section 188(1)(a)(i).
Page 140
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

In terms of Section 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, No. 85 of 1993; an
employer is obliged to provide, as far as is reasonably practicable, a safe workplace. This
may include ensuring that the risk of occupational exposure to HIV is minimised.
Section 2(1) and Section 5(1) of the Mine Health and Safety Act, No. 29 of 1996 provides that
an employer is required to create, as far as is reasonably practicable, a safe workplace. This
may include ensuring that the risk of occupational exposure to HIV is minimised.
An employee who is infected with HIV as a result of an occupational exposure to infected
blood or bodily fluids, may apply for benefits in terms of Section 22(1) of the Compensation
for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, No. 130 of 1993.
In accordance with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, No. 75 of 1997, every employer
is obliged to ensure that all employees receive certain basic standards of employment,
including a minimum number of days sick leave [Section 22(2)].
In accordance with Section 24(2)(e) of the Medical Schemes Act, No 131 of 1998, a
registered medical aid scheme may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against its
members on the basis of their "state of health". Further in terms of s 67(1)(9) regulations may
be drafted stipulating that all schemes must offer a minimum level of benefits to their
members.
In accordance with both the common law and Section 14 of the Constitution of South Africa
Act, No. 108 of 1996, all persons with HIV or AIDS have a right to privacy, including privacy
concerning their HIV or AIDS status. Accordingly there is no general legal duty on an
employee to disclose his or her HIV status to their employer or to other employees.
PROMOTING A NON-DISCRIMINATORY WORK ENVIRONMENT
No person with HIV or AIDS shall be unfairly discriminated against within the employment
relationship or within any employment policies or practices, including with regard to:














recruitment procedures, advertising and selection criteria;
appointments, and the appointment process, including job placement;
job classification or grading;
remuneration, employment benefits and terms and conditions of employment;
employee assistance programmes;
job assignments;
the workplace and facilities;
occupational health and safety;
training and development;
performance evaluation systems;
promotion, transfer and demotion;
disciplinary measures short of dismissal; and
termination of services.

To promote a non-discriminatory work environment based on the principle of equality,
employers and trade unions should adopt appropriate measures to ensure that employees
with HIV and AIDS are not unfairly discriminated against and are protected from victimisation
through positive measures such as:


preventing unfair discrimination and stigmatisation of people living with HIV or AIDS
through the development of HIV/AIDS policies and programmes for the workplace;
Page 141
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy






awareness, education and training on the rights of all persons with regard to HIV and
AIDS;
mechanisms to promote acceptance and openness around HIV/AIDS in the
workplace;
providing support for all employees infected or affected by HIV and AIDS; and
grievance procedures and disciplinary measures to deal with HIV-related complaints
in the workplace.

HIV TESTING, CONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCLOSURE
HIV Testing
No employer may require an employee, or an applicant for employment, to undertake an HIV
test in order to ascertain that employee‟s HIV status. As provided for in the Employment
Equity Act, employers may approach the Labour Court to obtain authorisation for testing.
Whether s 7(2) of the Employment Equity Act prevents an employer-provided health service
supplying a test to an employee who requests a test, depends on whether the Labour Courts
would accept that an employee can knowingly agree to waive the protection in the section.
This issue has not yet been decided by the courts.
In implementing the sections below, it is recommended that parties take note of the position
set out in item 7.1.2.
Authorised testing
Employers must approach the Labour Court for authorisation in, amongst others, the following
circumstances:






during an application for employment;
as a condition of employment;
during procedures related to termination of employment;
as an eligibility requirement for training or staff development programmes; and
as an access requirement to obtain employee benefits.

Permissable testing
An employer may provide testing to an employee who has requested a test in the following
circumstances:





As part of a health care service provided in the workplace;
In the event of an occupational accident carrying a risk of exposure to blood or other
body fluids;
For the purposes of applying for compensation following an occupational accident
involving a risk of exposure to blood or other body fluids.
Furthermore, such testing may only take place within the following defined conditions:





At the initiative of an employee;
Within a health care worker and employee-patient relationship;
With informed consent and pre- and post-test counselling, as defined by the
Department of Health‟s National Policy on Testing for HIV; and
With strict procedures relating to confidentiality of an employee‟s HIV status
as described in clause 7.2 of this Code.
Page 142
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

All testing, including both authorised and permissible testing, should be conducted in
accordance with the Department of Health‟s National Policy on Testing for HIV issued in
terms of the National Policy for Health Act, No. 116 of 1990.
Informed consent means that the individual has been provided with information, understands
it and based on this has agreed to undertake the HIV test. It implies that the individual
understands what the test is, why it is necessary, the benefits, risks, alternatives and any
possible social implications of the outcome.
Anonymous, unlinked surveillance or epidemiological HIV testing in the workplace may occur
provided it is undertaken in accordance with ethical and legal principles regarding such
research. Where such research is done, the information obtained may not be used to unfairly
discriminate against individuals or groups of persons. Testing will not be considered
anonymous if there is a reasonable possibility that a person‟s HIV status can be deduced
from the results.
Confidentiality and Disclosure
All persons with HIV or AIDS have the legal right to privacy. An employee is therefore not
legally required to disclose his or her HIV status to their employer or to other employees.
Where an employee chooses to voluntarily disclose his or her HIV status to the employer or to
other employees, this information may not be disclosed to others without the employee‟s
express written consent. Where written consent is not possible, steps must be taken to
confirm that the employee wishes to disclose his or her status.
Mechanisms should be created to encourage openness, acceptance and support for those
employers and employees who voluntarily disclose their HIV status within the workplace,
including:




encouraging persons openly living with HIV or AIDS to conduct or participate in
education, prevention and awareness programmes;
encouraging the development of support groups for employees living with HIV or
AIDS; and
ensuring that persons who are open about their HIV or AIDS status are not unfairly
discriminated against or stigmatised.

PROMOTING A SAFE WORKPLACE
An employer is obliged to provide and maintain, as far as is reasonably practicable, a
workplace that is safe and without risk to the health of its employees.
The risk of HIV transmission in the workplace is minimal. However occupational accidents
involving bodily fluids may occur, particularly in the health care professions. Every workplace
should ensure that it complies with the provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act,
including the Regulations on Hazardous Biological Agents, and the Mine Health and Safety
Act, and that its policy deals with, amongst others :




the risk, if any, of occupational transmission within the particular workplace;
appropriate training, awareness, education on the use of universal infection control
measures so as to identify, deal with and reduce the risk of HIV transmission in the
workplace;
providing appropriate equipment and materials to protect employees from the risk of
exposure to HIV;
Page 143
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy






the steps that must be taken following an occupational accident including the
appropriate management of occupational exposure to HIV and other blood borne
pathogens, including access to post-exposure prophylaxis;
the procedures to be followed in applying for compensation for occupational infection;
the reporting of all occupational accidents; and
adequate monitoring of occupational exposure to HIV to ensure that the requirements
of possible compensation claims are being met.

COMPENSATION FOR OCCUPATIONALLY ACQUIRED HIV
An employee may be compensated if he or she becomes infected with HIV as a result of an
occupational accident, in terms of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases
Act.
Employers should take reasonable steps to assist employees with the application for benefits
including:



providing information to affected employees on the procedures that will need to be
followed in order to qualify for a compensation claim; and
assisting with the collection of information which will assist with proving that the
employees were occupationally exposed to HIV infected blood.

Occupational exposure should be dealt with in terms of the Compensation for Occupational
Injuries and Diseases Act. Employers should ensure that they comply with the provisions of
this Act and any procedure or guideline issued in terms thereof.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Employees with HIV or AIDS may not be unfairly discriminated against in the allocation of
employee benefits.
Employees who become ill with AIDS should be treated like any other employee with a
comparable life threatening illness with regard to access to employee benefits.
Information from benefit schemes on the medical status of an employee should be kept
confidential and should not be used to unfairly discriminate.
Where an employer offers a medical scheme as part of the employee benefit package it must
ensure that this scheme does not unfairly discriminate, directly or indirectly, against any
person on the basis of his or her HIV status.
DISMISSAL
Employees with HIV/AIDS may not be dismissed solely on the basis of their HIV/AIDS status.
Where an employee has become too ill to perform their current work, an employer is obliged
to follow accepted guidelines regarding dismissal for incapacity before terminating an
employee‟s services, as set out in the Code of Good Practice on Dismissal contained in
Schedule 8 of the Labour Relations Act.
The employer should ensure that as far as possible, the employee‟s right to confidentiality
regarding his or her HIV status is maintained during any incapacity proceedings. An employee

Page 144
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

cannot be compelled to undergo an HIV test or to disclose his or her HIV status as part of
such proceedings unless the Labour Court authorised such a test.
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
Employers should ensure that the rights of employees with regard to HIV/AIDS, and the
remedies available to them in the event of a breach of such rights, become integrated into
existing grievance procedures.
Employers should create an awareness and understanding of the grievance procedures and
how employees can utilise them.
Employers should develop special measures to ensure the confidentiality of the complainant
during such proceedings, including ensuring that such proceedings are held in private.
MANAGEMENT OF HIV IN THE WORKPLACE
The effective management of HIV/AIDS in the workplace requires an integrated strategy that
includes, amongst others, the following elements:



An understanding and assessment of the impact of HIV/AIDS on the workplace; and
Long and short term measures to deal with and reduce this impact, including:

An HIV/AIDS Policy for the workplace

HIV/AIDS Programmes, which would incorporate:

Ongoing sustained prevention of the spread of HIV among employees
and their communities;

Management of employees with HIV so that they are able to work
productively for as long as possible; and

Strategies to deal with the direct and indirect costs of HIV/AIDS in the
workplace.

ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF HIV/AIDS ON THE WORKPLACE
Employers and trade unions should develop appropriate strategies to understand, assess and
respond to the impact of HIV/AIDS in their particular workplace and sector. This should be
done in cooperation with sectoral, local, provincial and national initiatives by government, civil
society and non-governmental organisations.
Broadly, impact assessments should include:



Risk profiles; and
Assessment of the direct and indirect costs of HIV/AIDS;

Risk profiles may include an assessment of the following:






The vulnerability of individual employees or categories of employees to HIV infection;
The nature and operations of the organisation and how these may increase
susceptibility to HIV infection (e.g. migrancy or hostel dwellings);
A profile of the communities from which the organisation draws its employees;
A profile of the communities surrounding the organisation‟s place of operation; and
An assessment of the impact of HIV/AIDS upon their target markets and client base.

The assessments should also consider the impact that the HIV/AIDS epidemic may have on:
Page 145
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy




Direct costs such as costs to employee benefits, medical costs and increased costs
related to staff turnover such as training and recruitment costs and the costs of
implementing an HIV/AIDS programme;
Indirect costs such as costs incurred as a result of increased absenteeism, employee
morbidity, loss of productivity, a general decline in workplace morale and possible
workplace disruption;

The cost effectiveness of any HIV/AIDS interventions should also be measured as part of an
impact assessment
MEASURES TO DEAL WITH HIV/AIDS WITHIN THE WORKPLACE
A Workplace HIV/AIDS Policy
Every workplace should develop an HIV/AIDS policy, in order to ensure that employees
affected by HIV/AIDS are not unfairly discriminated against in employment policies and
practices. This policy should cover:










the organisation‟s position on HIV/AIDS;
an outline of the HIV/AIDS programme;
details on employment policies (e.g. position regarding HIV testing, employee
benefits, performance management and procedures to be followed to determine
medical incapacity and dismissal);
express standards of behaviour expected of employers and employees and
appropriate measures to deal with deviations from these standards;
grievance procedures in line with item 12 of this Code;
set out the means of communication within the organisation on HIV/AIDS issues;
details of employee assistance available to persons affected by HIV/AIDS;
details of implementation and coordination responsibilities; and
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.

All policies should be developed in consultation with key stakeholders within the workplace
including trade unions, employee representatives, occupational health staff and the human
resources department.
The policy should reflect the nature and needs of the particular workplace.
Policy development and implementation is a dynamic process, so the workplace policy should
be:




communicated to all concerned;
routinely reviewed in light of epidemiological and scientific information; and
monitored for its successful implementation and evaluated for its effectiveness.

Developing Workplace HIV/AIDS Programmes
It is recommended that every workplace works towards developing and implementing a
workplace HIV/AIDS programme aimed at preventing new infections, providing care and
support for employees who are infected or affected, and managing the impact of the epidemic
in the organisation.
The nature and extent of a workplace programme should be guided by the needs and
capacity of each individual workplace. However, it is recommended that every workplace
Page 146
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

programme should attempt to address the following in cooperation with the sectoral, local,
provincial and national initiatives:













hold regular HIV/AIDS awareness programmes;
encourage voluntary testing;
conduct education and training on HIV/AIDS;
promote condom distribution and use;
encourage health seeking behaviour for STD‟s;
enforce the use of universal infection control measures;
create an environment that is conducive to openness, disclosure and acceptance
amongst all staff;
endeavour to establish a wellness programme for employees affected by HIV/AIDS;
provide access to counselling and other forms of social support for people affected by
HIV/AIDS;
maximise the performance of affected employees through reasonable
accommodation, such as investigations into alternative sick leave allocation;
develop strategies to address direct and indirect costs associated with HIV/AIDS in
the workplace, as outlined under item 14.4
regularly monitor, evaluate and review the programme.

Employers should take all reasonable steps to assist employees with referrals to appropriate
health, welfare and psycho-social facilities within the community, if such services are not
provided at the workplace
INFORMATION AND EDUCATION
The Department of Labour should ensure that copies of this code are available and
accessible.
Employers and employer organisations should include the Code in their orientation, education
and training programmes of employees.
Trade unions should include the Code in their education and training programmes of shop
stewards and employees.
GLOSSARY
Affected employee: an employee who is affected in any way by HIV/AIDS e.g. if they have a
partner or a family member who is HIV positive.
AIDS: AIDS is the acronym for "acquired immune deficiency syndrome". AIDS is the clinical
definition given to the onset of certain life-threatening infections in persons whose immune
systems have ceased to function properly as a result of infection with HIV.
Epidemiological: The study of disease patterns, causes, distribution and mechanisms of
control in society.
HIV: HIV is the acronym for "human immune deficiency virus". HIV is a virus which attacks
and may ultimately destroy the body‟s natural immune system.
HIV testing: taking a medical test to determine a person‟s HIV status. This may include written
or verbal questions inquiring about previous HIV tests; questions related to the assessment of
„risk behaviour‟ (for example questions regarding sexual practices, the number of sexual
Page 147
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

partners or sexual orientation); and any other indirect methods designed to ascertain an
employee‟s or job applicant‟s HIV status.
HIV positive: having tested positive for HIV infection.
Infected employee: an employee who has tested positive for HIV or who has been diagnosed
as having HIV/AIDS.
Informed consent: a process of obtaining consent from a patient which ensures that the
person fully understands the nature and implications of the test before giving his or her
agreement to it.
Policy: a document setting out an organisation‟s position on a particular issue.
Pre and post test counselling: a process of counselling which facilitates an understanding of
the nature and purpose of the HIV test. It examines what advantages and disadvantages the
test holds for the person and the influence the result, positive or negative, will have on them.
Reasonable Accommodation: means any modification or adjustment to a job or to the
workplace that is reasonably practicable and will enable a person living with HIV or AIDS to
have access to or participate or advance in employment.
STDs: acronym for "sexually transmitted diseases". These are infections passed from one
person to another during sexual intercourse, including syphilis, gonorrhea and HIV.
Surveillance Testing: This is anonymous, unlinked testing which is done in order to determine
the incidence and prevalence of disease within a particular community or group to provide
information to control, prevent and manage the disease.

ANNEXURE 5J
CODE OF GOOD PRACTICE: DISMISSAL
1 Introduction
(1) This code of good practice deals with some of the key aspects of dismissals for reasons
related to conduct and capacity. It is intentionally general. Each case is unique, and
departures from the norms established by this Code may be justified in proper circumstances.
For example, the number of employees employed in an establishment may warrant a different
approach.
(2) This Act emphasises the primacy of collective agreements. This Code is not intended as a
substitute for disciplinary codes and procedures where these are the subject of collective
agreements, or the outcome of joint decision-making by an employer and a workplace forum.
(3) The key principle in this Code is that employers and employees should treat one another
with mutual respect. A premium is placed on both employment justice and the efficient
operation of business. While employees should be protected from arbitrary action, employers
are entitled to satisfactory conduct and work performance from their employees.
2 Fair reasons for dismissal
(1) A dismissal is unfair if it is not effected for a fair reason and in accordance with a fair
procedure, even if it complies with any notice period in a contract of employment or in
legislation governing employment. Whether or not a dismissal is for a fair reason is
determined by the facts of the case, and the appropriateness of dismissal as a penalty.
Whether or not the procedure is fair is determined by referring to the guidelines set out below.
(2) This Act recognises three grounds on which a termination of employment might be
legitimate. These are: the conduct of the employee, the capacity of the employee, and the
operational requirements of the employer's business.
(3) This Act provides that a dismissal is automatically unfair if the reason for the dismissal is
one that amounts to an infringement of the fundamental rights of employees and trade unions,
or if the reason is one of those listed in section 187. The reasons include participation in a
lawful strike, intended or actual pregnancy and acts of discrimination.
(4) In cases where the dismissal is not automatically unfair, the employer must show that the
reason for dismissal is a reason related to the employee's conduct or capacity, or is based on
the operational requirements of the business. If the employer fails to do that, or fails to prove
that the dismissal was effected in accordance with a fair procedure, the dismissal is unfair.
3 Misconduct
Disciplinary procedures prior to dismissal
(1) All employers should adopt disciplinary rules that establish the standard of conduct
required of their employees. The form and content of disciplinary rules will obviously vary
according to the size and nature of the employer's business. In general, a larger business will
require a more formal approach to discipline. An employer's rules must create certainty and
consistency in the application of discipline. This requires that the standards of conduct are
clear and made available to employees in a manner that is easily understood. Some rules or

Page 151
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

standards maybe so well established and known that it is not necessary to communicate
them.
(2) The courts have endorsed the concept of corrective or progressive discipline. This
approach regards the purpose of discipline as a means for employees to know and
understand what standards are required of them. Efforts should be made to correct
employees' behaviour through a system of graduated disciplinary measures such as
counselling and warnings.
(3) Formal procedures do not have to be invoked every time a rule is broken or a standard is
not met. Informal advice and correction is the best and most effective way for an employer to
deal with minor violations of work discipline. Repeated misconduct will warrant warnings,
which themselves may be graded according to degrees of severity. More serious
infringements or repeated misconduct may call for a final warning, or other action short of
dismissal. Dismissal should be reserved for cases of serious misconduct or repeated
offences.
Dismissals for misconduct
(4) Generally, it is not appropriate to dismiss an employee for a first offence, except if the
misconduct is serious and of such gravity that it makes a continued employment relationship
intolerable. Examples of serious misconduct, subject to the rule that each case should be
judged on its merits, are gross dishonesty or willful damage to the property of the employer,
willful endangering of the safety of others, physical assault on the employer, a fellow
employee, client or customer and gross insubordination. Whatever the merits of the case for
dismissal might be, a dismissal will not be fair if it does not meet the requirements of section
188.
(5) When deciding whether or not to impose the penalty of dismissal, the employer should in
addition to the gravity of the misconduct consider factors such as the employee's
circumstances (including length of service, previous disciplinary record and personal
circumstances), the nature of the job and the circumstances of the infringement itself.
(6) The employer should apply the penalty of dismissal consistently with the way in which it
has been applied to the same and other employees in the past, and consistently as between
two or more employees who participate in the misconduct under consideration.
4 Fair procedure
(1) Normally, the employer should conduct an investigation to determine whether there are
grounds for dismissal. This does not need to be a formal enquiry. The employer should notify
the employee of the allegations using a form and language that the employee can reasonably
understand. The employee should be allowed the opportunity to state a case in response to
the allegations. The employee should be entitled to a reasonable time to prepare the
response and to the assistance of a trade union representative or fellow employee. After the
enquiry, the employer should communicate the decision taken, and preferably furnish the
employee with written notification of that decision.
(2) Discipline against a trade union representative or an employee who is an office-bearer or
official of a trade union should not be instituted without first informing and consulting the trade
union.

Page 152
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

(3) If the employee is dismissed, the employee should be given the reason for dismissal and
reminded of any rights to refer the matter to a council with jurisdiction or to the Commission or
to any dispute resolution procedures established in terms of a collective agreement.
(4) In exceptional circumstances, if the employer cannot reasonably be expected to comply
with these guidelines, the employer may dispense with pre-dismissal procedures.
5 Disciplinary records
Employers should keep records for each employee specifying the nature of any disciplinary
transgressions, the actions taken by the employer and the reasons for the actions.
6 Dismissals and industrial action
(1) Participation in a strike that does not comply with the provisions of Chapter IV is
misconduct. However, like any other act of misconduct, it does not always deserve dismissal.
The substantive fairness of dismissal in these circumstances must be determined in the light
of the facts of the case, including(a) the seriousness of the contravention of this Act;
(b) attempts made to comply with this Act; and
(c) whether or not the strike was in response to unjustified conduct by the employer.
(2) Prior to dismissal the employer should, at the earliest opportunity, contact a trade union
official to discuss the course of action it intends to adopt. The employer should issue an
ultimatum in clear and unambiguous terms that should state what is required of the
employees and what sanction will be imposed if they do not comply with the ultimatum. The
employees should be allowed sufficient time to reflect on the ultimatum and respond to it,
either by complying with it or rejecting it. If the employer cannot reasonably be expected to
extend these steps to the employees in question, the employer may dispense with them.
7 Guidelines in cases of dismissal for misconduct
Any person who is determining whether a dismissal for misconduct is unfair should consider(a) whether or not the employee contravened a rule or standard regulating conduct in, or of
relevance to, the workplace; and
(b) if a rule or standard was contravened, whether or not(i) the rule was a valid or reasonable rule or standard;
(ii) the employee was aware, or could reasonably be expected to have been aware, of the rule
or standard;
(iii) the rule or standard has been consistently applied by the employer; and
(iv) dismissal was an appropriate sanction for the contravention of the rule or standard.

Page 153
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

8 Incapacity: Poor work performance
(1) A newly hired employee may be placed on probation for a period that is reasonable given
the circumstances of the job. The period should be determined by the nature of the job, and
the time it takes to determine the employee's suitability for continued employment. When
appropriate, an employer should give an employee whatever evaluation, instruction, training,
guidance or counselling the employee requires to render satisfactory service. Dismissal
during the probationary period should be preceded by an opportunity for the employee to
state a case in response and to be assisted by a trade union representative or fellow
employee.
(2) After probation, an employee should not be dismissed for unsatisfactory performance
unless the employer has(a) given the employee appropriate evaluation, instruction, training, guidance or counselling;
and
(b) after a reasonable period of time for improvement, the employee continues to perform
unsatisfactorily.
(3) The procedure leading to dismissal should include an investigation to establish the
reasons for the unsatisfactory performance and the employer should consider other ways,
short of dismissal, to remedy the matter.
(4) In the process, the employee should have the right to be heard and to be assisted by a
trade union representative or a fellow employee.
9 Guidelines in cases of dismissal for poor work performance
Any person determining whether a dismissal for poor work performance is unfair should
consider(a) whether or not the employee failed to meet a performance standard; and
(b) if the employee did not meet a required performance standard whether or not(i) the employee was aware, or could reasonably be expected to have been aware, of the
required performance standard;
(ii) the employee was given a fair opportunity to meet the required performance standard; and
(iii) dismissal was an appropriate sanction for not meeting the required performance standard.
10 Incapacity: Ill health or injury
(1) Incapacity on the grounds of ill health or injury may be temporary or permanent. If an
employee is temporarily unable to work in these circumstances, the employer should
investigate the extent of the incapacity or the injury. If the employee is likely to be absent for a
time that is unreasonably long in the circumstances, the employer should investigate all the
possible alternatives short of dismissal. When alternatives are considered, relevant factors
might include the nature of the job, the period of absence, the seriousness of the illness or
injury and the possibility of securing a temporary replacement for the ill or injured employee.
In cases of permanent incapacity, the employer should ascertain the possibility of securing
Page 154
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

alternative employment, or adapting the duties or work circumstances of the employee to
accommodate the employee's disability.
(2) In the process of the investigation referred to in subsection (1) the employee should be
allowed the opportunity to state a case in response and to be assisted by a trade union
representative or fellow employee.
(3) The degree of incapacity is relevant to the fairness of any dismissal. The cause of the
incapacity may also be relevant. In the case of certain kinds of incapacity, for example
alcoholism or drug abuse, counselling and rehabilitation may be appropriate steps for an
employer to consider.
(4) Particular consideration should be given to employees who are injured at work or who are
incapacitated by work-related illness. The courts have indicated that the duty on the employer
to accommodate the incapacity of the employee is more onerous in these circumstances.
11 Guidelines in cases of dismissal arising from ill health or injury
Any person determining whether a dismissal arising from ill health or injury is unfair should
consider(a) whether or not the employee is capable of performing the work; and
(b) if the employee is not capable(i) the extent to which the employee is able to perform the work;
(ii) the extent to which the employee's work circumstances might be adapted to accommodate
disability, or, where this is not possible, the extent to which the employee's duties might be
adapted; and
(iii) the availability of any suitable alternative work.

Notice is hereby given under Section 54 of the Employment Equity Act, 1998, that the Minister
of Labour, having been advised by the Commission for Employment Equity, has issued a
Code of Good Practice on the preparation, implementation and monitoring of an Employment
Equity Plan, as set out in this schedule.

1. OBJECTIVE
The objective of this code is to provide guidelines of good practice, in terms of the
requirements of the Employment Equity Act, 1998 (Act No 55 of 1998) (hereafter referred to
as "the Act"), for the preparation and implementation of an employment equity plan
(hereafter referred to as "the plan").
2. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
2.1 This code is issued in terms of Section 54 of the Employment Equity Act, No. 55 of 1998
and relates to Section 20.
2.2 This code does not impose any legal obligations in addition to those in the Act and the
failure to observe it does not, by itself, render a designated employer liable in any
proceedings, except where the code refers to obligations that are required by the Act
2.3 When interpreting the Act, any relevant code of good practice must be taken into account.
1

3. SCOPE
3.1 This code is relevant to all employers that are regarded as designated employers in the
2
Act.
3.2 Designated employers and the employees of designated employers should apply the
guidelines set out in this code to develop their employment equity plans, taking into account
the specific circumstances of their own organisations.

Page 156
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

3.3 This code may be read in conjunction with other codes of good practice that may be
issued by the Minister of Labour.
4. PURPOSE AND RATIONALE FOR THE PLAN
4.1 The plan reflects a designated employer‟s employment equity implementation program.
4.2 The plan represents the critical link between the current workforce profile and possible
barriers in employment policies and procedures, and the implementation of remedial steps to
ultimately result in employment equity in the workplace.
5. STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN
5.1 The plan may be a separate document or a component of a broader document such as a
business plan.
5.2 In terms of the manner in which it is set out, the plan may closely follow the sections of the
Act and the relevant items of the Code, or may be organised differently, as long as the
statutory requirements in Section 20 of the Act are reflected in the plan.
5.3 The plan should be accessible and structured in such a way that it is easy to understand.
6. PROCESS FOR CONSTRUCTING A PLAN
6.1 The development of a plan should be undertaken as an inclusive process that will result in
a documented plan.
6.2 The process of developing a plan has three sequential phases: planning, development,
and implementation and monitoring.
6.3 The planning phase of the process should include –








assignment of responsibility and accountability to one or more senior managers;
a communication, awareness and training programme;
consultation with relevant stakeholders;
an analysis of existing employment policies, procedures, and practices;
an analysis of the existing workforce profile;
an analysis of relevant demographic information such as that contained in form EEA
8, and
an appropriate benchmarking exercise, such as comparing the organisation‟s
workforce profile with those of other organisations within the same sector, or the
development of other meaningful comparisons.

6.4 In the development phase, in consultation with the identified role players, should include –







objectives set;
corrective measures formulated;
time frames established;
the plan drawn up;
resources identified and allocated for the implementation of the plan, and
the plan communicated.

Page 157
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

6.5 Implementation and monitoring is an ongoing process and should continue to include
components of the earlier phases, such as consultation, communication, awareness and
training. This phase should include –





implementation
monitoring and evaluating progress;
reviewing the plan, and
reporting on progress.

7. PLANNING PHASE
7.1 Assignment of senior manager

3

7.1.1 The planning phase should commence with the assignment of one or more senior
managers who should have the responsibility for the development, implementation and
monitoring of the plan. They should –



be permanent employees, and
report directly to the Chief Executive Officer.

7.1.2 The assignment of one or more senior managers implies that –




the employer should also provide the assigned managers with the necessary
authority and means, such as an appropriate budget, to perform their allocated
functions;
the employer is not relieved of any duty imposed by this Act or any other law, and
the employer should take reasonable steps to ensure that these managers perform
their allocated functions. This could be done through the incorporation of key
employment equity outcomes in performance contracts of the responsible managers
as well as line managers throughout the organisation.

7.2 Communication, Awareness and Consultation

4

7.2.1 All employees should be made aware and informed of –






the content and application of the Act as preparation for their participation and
consultation;
employment equity and anti-discrimination issues;
the proposed process to be followed by the employer;
the advantages to employees of participation in the process, and
the need for the involvement of all stakeholders in order to promote positive
outcomes.

7.2.2 Employers are required to consult with regard to conducting an analysis, the preparation
and implementation of the plan, and the submission of employment equity reports to the
Department of Labour.
7.2.3 To ensure the successful implementation of a plan, employers should make every effort
to include employee representatives in all aspects of the plan, especially the planning and
development phases.

Page 158
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

7.2.3 Managers should be informed of their obligations in terms of the Act, and training should
be provided to them where particular skills do not exist. Examples of required training could
include diversity management, coaching and mentoring programmes.
7.2.4 The communication of an employment equity strategy should focus on positive
outcomes, such as the better utilisation of all of the employer‟s human resources and the
creation of a diverse and more productive workforce.
5

7.2.5 Communication should also include employees from non-designated groups and focus
on the contribution that can be made by them.
7.2.6 Consultation with employees should commence as early as possible in the process.
7.2.7 A consultative forum should be established or an existing forum utilised. The forum
should include employee representatives reflecting the interests of employees from both
designated and non-designated groups and across all occupational categories and levels of
the workforce. Representative trade unions, where these exist, or representatives nominated
by such trade unions must be included in the consultation process.
7.2.8 The employer should be represented by one or more members of senior management.
7.2.9 Consultation would include –





the opportunity to meet and report back to employees and management;
reasonable opportunity for employee representatives to meet with the employer;
the request, receipt and consideration of relevant information, and
adequate time allowed for each of these steps.

7.2.10 To ensure an informed and constructive consultation process, structured and regular
meetings of the consultative forum or forums should be held.
7.2.11 The disclosure of relevant information by designated employers is vital for the
successful implementation of the plan. Such information could include –









the particular business environment and circumstances of the employer;
information relating to the relevant economic sector or industry;
relevant local, regional, and national demographic information relating to the
economically active population;
the anticipated growth or reduction of the employer‟s workforce;
the turnover of employees in the employer‟s workforce;
the internal and external availability for appointment or promotion of suitably qualified
people from the designated groups;
the degree of representation of designated employees in each occupational category
and level in the employer‟s workforce, and
employment policies and practices of the employer.

7.2.12 All parties should, in all good faith, keep an open mind throughout the process and
seriously consider proposals put forward.
7.2.13 Where a representative body or trade union refuses to take part in the consultation
process, the employer should record the circumstances, in writing, including those steps that
the employer has taken to communicate and initiate the consultation process. A copy of this
document should be provided to the representative body or trade union concerned.

7.3 Conducting an analysis

6

The purpose of the analysis is –
a.

to assess all employment policies, practices, procedures, and the working
environment so as to –



identify any barriers that may contribute to the under-representation or underutilisation of employees from the designated groups;
identify any barriers or factors that may contribute to the lack of affirmation of diversity
in the workplace;
identify other employment conditions that may adversely affect designated groups;
identify practices or factors that positively promote employment equity and diversity in
the workplace; and





b.

to determine the extent of under-representation of employees from the designated
groups in the different occupational categories and levels of the employer‟s
workforce.

While the first type of analysis is of a more qualitative and legal nature, the second is mainly a
statistical and data processing exercise.
7.3.1 Review of employment policies, practices, procedures, and working environment
A review of all employment policies, practices, procedures, and of the working environment
should be undertaken in order to identify any barriers that may be responsible for the underrepresentation or under-utilisation of employees from designated groups.
a.

The review should include a critical examination of all established policies, practices,
procedures and working environment. These would include –



employment policy or practices, such as recruitment, selection, pre-employment
testing, and induction that could be biased, inappropriate, or unaffirming;
practices related to succession and experience planning, and related promotions and
transfers to establish whether designated groups are excluded or adversely impacted;
utilisation and job assignments to establish whether designated groups are able to
meaningfully participate and contribute;
current training and development methodologies and strategies, including access to
training for designated groups;
remuneration structures and practices such as equal remuneration for work of equal
value;
employee benefits related to retirement, risk, and medical aid to establish whether
designated groups have equal access;
disciplinary practices that may have a disproportionately adverse effect on designated
groups and that may not be justified;
working conditions that may not accommodate cultural or religious differences, such
as the use of traditional healers and observance of religious holidays;
the number and nature of dismissals, voluntary terminations and retrenchments of
employees from designated groups that may indicate internal or external equityrelated factors contributing to such terminations;
corporate culture, which may be characterised by exclusionary social and other
practices;
practices relating to the management of HIV/AIDS in the workplace, to ensure that
people living with HIV/AIDS are not discriminated against, and



any other practices or conditions that are tabled arising out of the consultative
process.

b.
c.

All practices should be assessed in terms of cross-cultural and gender fairness.
The review should take into account more subtle or indirect forms of discrimination
and stereo-typing which could result in certain groups of people not being employed
in particular jobs, or which could preclude people from being promoted. Examples
7
would include pregnancy, family responsibility , exclusionary social practices, sexual
harassment, and religious or cultural beliefs and practices.

7.3.2 Workforce profile
a.

b.

c.

d.

e.

f.

The first step in conducting an analysis of the workforce profile is to establish which
employees are members of designated groups. This information should be obtained
from employees themselves, either from a declaration as provided for in Regulation
2(1) or from existing and dependable sources. An example of an existing and
dependable source would be an employer‟s database that contains the information
required on employment application forms. If such existing records are utilised for this
purpose, each employee should have the opportunity to verify or request changes to
this information.
An analysis of the workforce profile should provide a comparison of designated
groups by occupational categories and levels to relevant demographic data. Form
EEA 8 contains some demographic data for this purpose, but there are many other
sources of information that could be utilised and might be more relevant.
In addition to the demographics, both the availability of suitably qualified people from
designated groups in the relevant recruitment area, as well as the internal skills
profile of designated employees, should be taken into account. The „relevant
recruitment area‟ is that geographic area from which the employer would reasonably
be expected to draw or recruit employees.
Recruitment areas may vary depending upon the level of responsibility and the
degree of specialisation of the occupation. Usually, the higher the degree of
responsibility or specialisation required for the job, the broader the recruitment area.
The standard occupational classification as defined in form EEA 10 should form the
basis for determining occupational categories. Occupational levels could be
determined by any of the professional job grading systems (Paterson, Peromnes,
Hay, etc.) or their equivalents as detailed in form EEA 9. In the absence of a formal
job grading system, designated employers may use equivalent occupational levels as
the basis for the workforce analysis.
Sections B and C of the Employment Equity Report as defined by form EEA 2 should
guide employers in establishing information requirements to develop a plan, and
provide the basis for developing a workforce profile.

8. DEVELOPING THE PLAN
8.1 Duration of the plan

8

The duration of the plan should be for a period that will allow the employer to make
reasonable progress towards achieving employment equity. This period should be no shorter
than one year and no longer than five years, as specified in the Act.
8.2 Broad objectives of the plan
The broad objectives of the plan should be specified and a timetable developed for the
fulfillment of each objective. These objectives should -

Page 161
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy





take into account the output of the planning phase;
the particular circumstances of the employer, and
be aligned with and included in the broader business strategy of the employer.

8.3 Affirmative action measures

9

8.3.1 Affirmative action measures, to address the barriers identified during the analysis,
should be developed to improve the under-representation of designated group members.
Such measures relate to, but are not limited to the following:














Appointment of members from designated groups: This would include
transparent recruitment strategies such as appropriate and unbiased selection criteria
and selection panels, and targeted advertising.
Increasing the pool of available candidates: Community investment and bridging
programmes can increase the number of potential candidates.
Training and development of people from designated groups: These measures
include access to training by members of designated groups, structured training and
development programmes like learnerships and internships; on the job mentoring and
coaching, and accelerated training for new recruits. Where required, diversity training
should be provided to responsible managers as well as training in coaching and
mentoring skills.
Promotion of people from designated groups: This could form part of structured
succession and experience planning and would include appropriate and accelerated
training.
Retention of people from designated groups: Retention strategies would include
the promotion of a more diverse organisational culture; an interactive communication
and feedback strategy; and ongoing labour turnover analysis.
10
Reasonable accommodation
for people from designated groups: These
measures include providing an enabling environment for disabled workers and
workers with family responsibilities so that they may participate fully and, in so doing,
improve productivity. Examples of reasonable accommodation are accessible working
areas, modifications to buildings and facilities, and flexible working hours where these
can be accommodated.
Steps to ensure that members of designated groups are appointed in such
positions that they are able to meaningfully participate in corporate decisionmaking processes: A conscious effort should be made to avoid all forms of
tokenism. Candidates must be appointed with commensurate degrees of authority.
Steps to ensure that the corporate culture of the past is transformed in a way
that affirms diversity in the workplace and harnesses the potential of all
employees: Such steps could include programmes for all staff, including
management, contextualising employment equity and sensitising employees with
regard to the grounds of discrimination such as race, diversity, gender, disability, and
religious accommodation.
Any other measures arising out of the consultative process :

8.3.2 All corrective measures to eliminate any barriers identified during the analysis should be
specified in the plan.
8.3.3 The employer is under no obligation to introduce an absolute barrier relating to people
who are not from designated groups, for example having a policy of not considering white
males at all for promotion or excluding them from applying for vacant positions.

Page 162
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

8.4 Numerical goals

11

8.4.1 Numerical goals should be developed for the appointment and promotion of people from
designated groups. The purpose of these goals would be to increase the representation of
people from designated groups in each occupational category and level in the employer‟s
workforce, where under-representation has been identified and to make the workforce
reflective of the relevant demographics as provided for in form EEA 8.
8.4.2 In developing the numerical goals, the following factors should be taken into
consideration –










The degree of under-representation of employees from designated groups in each
occupational category and level in the employer‟s workforce;
present and planned vacancies;
the provincial and national economically active population as presented in form EEA
8;
the pool of suitably qualified persons from designated groups, from which the
employer may be reasonably expected to draw for recruitment purposes;
present and anticipated economic and financial factors relevant to the industry in
which the employer operates;
economic and financial circumstances of the employer;
the anticipated growth or reduction in the employer‟s workforce during the time period
for the goals;
the expected turnover of employees in the employer‟s workforce during the time
period for the goals, and
labour turnover trends and underlying reasons, specifically for employees from
designated groups.

8.5 Consensus
In setting objectives and developing corrective measures, parties to the consultative
processes should attempt to reach consensus on what would constitute reasonable progress
over the duration of the plan.
8.6 Resources
Resources, including budgets, should be appropriately allocated in order to implement the
agreed components of the plan.
8.7 Assignment of responsibility
Responsibility for implementation and monitoring of the plan, as assigned during the planning
phase, should be confirmed and noted.
8.8 Dispute Resolution
8.8.1 Internal procedures for resolving any dispute about the interpretation and
implementation of the plan should be agreed and specified.
8.8.2 The use of existing dispute resolution procedures should be encouraged provided that
they are appropriate, and if necessary adapted to the needs of employment equity.

Page 163
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

8.8.3 Alternatively, a mechanism with appropriate representation from employer and
employees may be established in order to address and resolve such disputes.
8.9 Communication
8.9.1 The plan should be appropriately and comprehensively communicated to employees.
This communication mechanism should indicate the parties responsible for the
implementation of the plan and the agreed dispute resolution procedures. Information about
the plan should be easily accessible to all levels of employees.
9. MONITORING AND EVALUATING THE PLAN

9.1 Records should be kept to effectively monitor and evaluate the plan.
9.2 Mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the plan should be agreed
and include benchmarks that would permit assessment of reasonable progress.
9.3 The plan should be evaluated at regular intervals to ensure that reasonable progress is
made. This evaluation should be integrated into mechanisms that the employer normally
utilises to monitor its operations.
9.4 The consultative forum(s) should continue to meet on a regular basis, and should receive
progress reports. Progress should be recorded and communicated to employees. Such
meetings should take place at reasonable intervals to ensure feedback and inform the
ongoing implementation process.
9.5 The plan should be reviewed and revised, as necessary, through consultation.
9.6 Reporting

12

9.6.1 Larger employers, with 150 or more employees, will be required to submit first reports
by 1 June 2000 and thereafter annually on the first working day of October, starting in 2001.
9.6.2 Smaller employers, with fewer than 150 employees, will be required to submit their first
reports by 1 December 2000 and thereafter every second year, on the first working day of
October, starting in 2002.
9.6.3 The reporting format for employers is contained in the Employment Equity Report as
defined in form EEA2.
9.6.4 Designated employers whose operations extend across different geographical areas,
functional units, workplaces or industry sectors may elect to submit either a consolidated or a
separate report for each of these. This decision should be made by employers after
consultation with the relevant stakeholders.

BALANCED SCORECARD

2.1

Objectives

The aim of this policy is:


Create a basic understanding of the Balanced Scorecard and how it relates to the
Company‟s Vision, and Strategy



Create a framework of reference that will ensure some sort of standardisation in the
designing, implementation and application of the Balanced Scorecard



Ensure that all Managers know how to design and score a Balanced Scorecard

2.2

Definitions

2.1.1

Performance Management

It is an approach to achieve a shared vision of the purpose and aims of the organisation,
helping each employee to understand and recognise his or her contribution to the mission and
thus manage and enhance the performance of the organisation.
2.1.2

Strategy

Game plan developed by management for achieving its long-term objectives.

2.3

Introduction

In today‟s competitive environment the company that adopts the best to change and seize the
opportunities associated with change will be successful. In any organisation the level of
competency and commitment of its Human Resources will determine its success in these
strategic re-alignment prices.
Companies are also realising that not only financial but also operational measures will
determine the success of a company.
Managers want a balanced presentation of both financial and operational measures. After a
long research project Robert Kaplan and David Nortan devised a “Balanced Scorecard” – a
set of measures that gives top management a fast but comprehensive view of the business.
The Balanced Scorecard includes a financial measure that tells the results of actions already
taken and is complemented with operational measures that are the drivers of future financial
performance. Think of the Balanced Scorecard as the dials and indicators in an aeroplane
cockpit. For the complex task of navigating and flying an aeroplane, pilots need detailed
information about many aspects of the flight. They need information on fuel, air speed,
altitude, bearing, destination, and other indicators that summarise the current and predicted
environment. Reliance on one instrument can be fatal. Similarly, the complexity of managing
and organisation today requires that managers be able to view performance in several areas
simultaneously.
The Balanced Scorecard forces Managers to focus on the handful of measures that are most
critical for success.

Page 168
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

2.4

What Is The Balanced Scorecard?

Once the organisation strategy is set, it must be translated into specific goals, departmental
and individual objectives and finally to performance standards which emphasise not only
results but also those behaviours identified as required to achieve results.
Management systems can then allow the strategy to become operational, translating overall
strategy into goals, then into day-to-day behaviours and results, which can be measured and
rewarded.
The Balanced Scorecard is then one such tool to translate NRC‟s vision and strategy into a
set of objectives and measures, which can then be measured and rewarded.
The Balanced Scorecard could be described as a setting consisting of financial, customer,
internal processes and learning perspectives describing the current strategy of the
organisation and to achieve it in the future. A set of measurements, which will reveal how an
organisation is doing.
Balanced scorecards were developed by American management consultants Robert Kaplan
and David Norton. Their aim was to produce a more balanced system of measuring business
success than simply using short-term financial gains. They believe that no single Measure
can provide a good indication of Business achievement. Their system uses a balance
selection of objective measurements to address four basic issues:


The financial perspective – or how the company appear to shareholders?



The customer perspective – how should we appear to our customers? (How do we
become our customers most value supplier?)



The internal perspective – what business processes must we excel at?



The learning and growth perspective – who will we sustain our ability to change and
improve? (How can we continue to improve and create value, particularly in regard
to employee capabilities and motivation?)

Targets and results for these four perspectives would typically be presented to senior
managers on a single sheet of paper, providing them with a quick but more comprehensive
and balanced view than any one yardstick would allow.
The concept is then extended to measure performance at all levels of the organisation.
Scorecards are cascaded down with each level building its own card from the most
appropriate from the more senior scorecard.

The Balanced Scorecard can then also be described as:


A device for balancing concern about financial performance with a concern for other
aspects of performance



A balanced model that focuses on internal and external indicators as well as the
related performance drivers and outcome measures which describe the cause-andeffect relationship behind the strategy



A strategy management system for achieving long-term goals



An integrated approach for translating strategy into action



A state-of-the-art system to assess performance from four perspectives

Page 169
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy



Together with the performance review structure, considered a true tool that tells
management much more about what to expect of the future and in addition, virtually
assures stretch goals.

2.5

Strategic Management System

It is essential that you understand that this is not a one-off exercise. To succeed with the
Balanced Scorecard it must become the centrepiece of a new, integrated management
system, which aligns all your operational activities to corporate strategic objectives.
The scorecard must reflect and drive your organisation strategy. It is therefore important to
choose meaningful and achievable measures to drive your strategy.
The company‟s vision and strategy should be communicated to staff in such a manner that
they understand it. They should know what is expected of them (what action is required) to
implement and achieve the organisation‟s strategy.
To achieve all of this
Head Office must communicate their strategy to Regional Management. Regional strategies
must reflect Head Office themes as their output but have unique strategies to drive these
results.
Each Unit will then have to define their own strategy, which needs to be translated from the
Regional Strategy.
In the unit/department each employee‟s goals and performance standards needs to be
defined. These goals and performance standards should be linked with the unit/department
and Regional strategy. In other words, achievement of individual goals should in return result
in the Unit and Region being able to meet its goals.
2.6

Steps To Design Your Own Balanced Scorecard:

Step 1:
You need to know and understand the Regional strategy.
Step 2:
Define your Unit/Department‟s strategy. It must be aligned with the Regional strategy.
Step 3:
Identifies each individual employee‟s role and responsibilities in achieving that strategy.
Step 4:
Define role and responsibilities of each Employee in terms of:


Objectives:
What, how good and when something must be done and be achieved.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

3.1

INTRODUCTION

To flourish in the global environment the company should become a place where the talent of
our company is identified, nurtured and unleashed.
To attempt to realize the above we have develop a new performance management process
that will consist out of regular monthly reviews, focus on inputs/outputs and development and
where two way communication is the key and a supportive and flexible process is promoted.
The latter is an attempt to move away from a system that was based on so-called “form
system” of appraisal to a process of review.
The aim of the process will be to develop the talent of the organization and to determine the
strengths and improvement areas for each employee in the company. We will aim to
consistently and accurately evaluate performance in order to develop the skills that will allow
the organization to prosper.
3.2

IMPORTANCE TO EMPLOYEES

The new performance process has been developed in consultation with employees
representing each of the occupational groups present in National Renal Care. The new
process will enable employees:

-

to know what they are being held accountable for at the beginning of the review
period,
to track their own performance throughout the year, and
to strengthen and build new skills.

3.3

IMPORTANCE TO NRC

-

Having the above system in place will enable National Renal Care to:
-

create a climate for development,
first look at strengths, then at areas for development,
explore job satisfaction and career direction, and
assist with personal development planning.

Create a climate for development, not evaluation: Managers must see themselves as a coach
and developer of employees, and let them know that you there for their growth, not just to
evaluate them. Managers must be prepared to listen to their concerns, and let them see they
are willing to understand them. To give employee space to talk about what really motivates
them.
Look first at strengths, then areas for development: Be specific in terms of behaviour in
pointing out their particular strengths. Show them in what way this is of value to the company
and to the team, and the implications for their growth in the company. Communicate problem
or weak areas as areas for development, or as growth challenges, not as difficult obstacles.
Again, be specific in terms of behaviour, rather than talking vaguely about problems.
Explore job satisfaction and career direction: Are your employees strengths matched with the
job or team role that they are in? Might their particular strengths be used in another role?
What is their level of job satisfaction at present? Be asking yourself not just “How is this
person doing in this job?”, but also “Where need they to be headed in order to maximize their
potential?”
Page 173
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Assist with personal development planning: Assist them in drawing up specific goals, by when
they are to be completed, and how they are going to be done. A plan such as this which has
been jointly worked on is very useful for keeping the development process on track. Goals
need to be realistic, attainable and simply stated.
3.4

THE PERFORMANCE CYCLE

The performance management process is an ongoing cycle of activities, not a once a year
event. The performance cycle includes the following three phases:
-

Planning Phase.
Tracking Phase.
Reviewing Phase.

During the planning phase the employee works together with his/her manager to create a
performance plan that includes:
-

The results (Key Performance Areas) the employee need to achieve during the review
period.
The duties and standards.

The type of discussion that takes place during the planning phase is a reaching agreement
discussion because the manager and employee reach agreement on the plan. At this stage
the employee can also create a development plan that lists actions to be taken to build skills,
knowledge and behaviours.
The tracking phase is necessary to track accomplishments during the review period. Tracking
keeps the plan alive. Employees are responsible to take charge of tracking their own
progress, using sources of data identified during the planning phase. Managers should
provide continuous feedback and coaching to assist the employee to succeed. Co-workers
can also provide feedback regarding the employee‟s strengths and opportunities or
improvement.

Monthly discussions between the manager and employee will enable the employee to receive
monthly input regarding performance and opportunities for improvement. These meetings can
also provide opportunities to correct problems that arise and allows the parties to adjust the
original plan.
Performance will be reviewed six monthly. The review will be a summary of all the one-on-one
discussions that took place up to the date of the formal review and will include all new data
that have been collected since the last discussion. The purpose of the formal reviews will be
to measure the employees‟ actual results over the review period against planned results and
to develop an action plan to improve performance and to develop the employee.

3.4.1

Planning Phase

Management in consultation with employees are responsible for setting goals and
expectations so employees can channel their efforts toward achieving organizational
objectives. Getting employees involved in the planning process helps employees understand
Page 175
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

the goals of their unit and how their responsibilities contribute to the achievement of the
company‟s mission.
Managers are responsible for ensuring that employees know what their jobs are and how to
do them. They are also responsible for clearly communicating their expectations to
employees and basing evaluations on predetermined standards. The manager‟s duty is to
ensure that every performance review is completed in a timely and fair manner.
Planning activities should be done at the start of the review period. The planning phase will
give you a solid basis on which to review performance during the upcoming year. When
planning is complete, both manager and employee will have a written copy of the
Performance Review Form detailing the job duties/goals with accompanying standards.
3.4.1.1 Elements of Planning
-

Confirm or identify Key Performance Areas (KPAs).
Confirm or identify specific duties on which the employee will be evaluated.
Confirm or develop standards for duties and Company Values.
Identify knowledge skills and or behaviours to be developed, if appropriate, for each
KPA/duty.
Identify management support to be provided to assist in the accomplishment of each
duty.
Discuss the performance review ratings with employees.
Reach agreement.

The planning phase of the Performance Review Process works best when employees
contribute to the standard-setting process. It is essential that both manager and employee are
clear about what the employee will focus on during the review period.
3.4.1.2 Prepare for the Planning Meeting


For the Manager

To prepare for the planning meeting, review the Performance Review Policy and the
Performance Review Form. You could also schedule the Performance Review Overview class
offered by Human Resources for your work group.
Ask your Manager if there are any new goals for your area so you can include them in your
planning.
Review each employee‟s Job. Review KPAs duties and standards. Also, think about which
KPAs and duties are most important for each employee.


For the Employee

To prepare for the planning meeting, review the Performance Review Policy and the
Performance Review Form. You may attend the Performance Review Overview workshop if
you wish.
It is a good idea to review your performance from the previous year. Think about the following
questions:
-

What did the unit/department accomplish over the past year? How did I contribute?
Did I perform my duties to the best of my abilities?
Page 176
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

-

What were my most significant achievements?
What problems or obstacles did I encounter?
Did I take the initiative to solve them?
How can those problems be avoided this year?
What would I like to accomplish in the coming year?
You should also think about what plans you have for yourself. Do you want to increase
the scope of your responsibility? Take additional training? Learn new skills?

Review your KPAs and think about which KPAs you consider most important.
For planning to be successful, employee and manager need to share ideas, discuss options,
and decide on appropriate KPAs, duties and standards.
3.4.1.3 Conduct the Planning Meeting


Review Organizational Goals

A good first step is to review the department or company‟s goals and discuss how they
contribute to the overall mission of the company. Then, look at the department goals and how
the employee‟s job responsibilities contribute to their achievement. Every job is important.
Employees appreciate understanding how their job fits into the bigger picture and relates to
other jobs.


Confirm/Identify KPAs

Before the employee can set his/her goals or objectives it is important that the employee need
to understand how his/her work supports the goals of the organization. The employee‟s KPAs
provide this link. The KPAs are the reasons the employee‟s job exists in the company.
Criteria for KPAs:
-

Should reflect the organizations vision and objectives.
Number between five and seven.
Be described in a few words.
Be within the employee‟s influence.
Be similar to similar jobs.
Do not change unless the job changes.

3.4.1.4 Confirm/Identify Employee Duties
Next, identify the specific duties you would like to see the employee accomplish during the
review period. Ask the employee to identify the duties s/he would like to accomplish and use
that as a basis for discussion. Relate the employee‟s ideas to unit and departmental
requirements. When you have agreed upon the duties, confirm the duties as per Section 1,
Goals and Duties, in the shaded area of the Performance Review Form. If there are any
changes please communicate with the Regional Manager and Human Resources
Department.
3.4.1.5 Confirm/Identify Standards
For every duty, and behaviour illustrating a company Value, there must be a clear standard of
performance so you can evaluate each employee's performance more objectively. Only the
duty statement will be recorded in the Duties sections of the Performance Review Form
(Section 1.). The standard is separate from the duty statement and will be written on the
Page 177
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

SMART Standard Worksheet and appended to the Performance Review Form. For the
company Values, the standards are written on a separate sheet.
A standard tells you what a good job looks like. A standard tells you how well a job is being
done by defining the results of activity, the quality of the work, the amount of work to be done,
and when the work is to be done. Since you will be evaluating the employee‟s performance,
the standard should reflect your judgment of what constitutes a “good job.” Think about what
the employee needs to do to “meet your expectations” and write the standard for that
situation. Standards should be written high enough so that reaching them is not automatic,
but not so high that employees cannot hope to reach them.
Standards are typically based on the job and not the person, so the same standards can be
applied to all persons performing the same job. However, there are times when it is
appropriate to develop different standards for different persons performing the same or similar
jobs. Standards must be developed at the beginning of the review period and be clearly
communicated to the employee.
3.4.1.6 Competencies
Criteria for competencies:
-

Must support the organizational values.
Must be related to the objectives
Must be observable.
Must be understandable.

The organization can translate the organizational values into competencies that people can
focus on in their performance plans. This brings the values alive making them more than just
words, but rather a set of behaviours, setting an expectation for how people will work with one
another. The latter behaviours begin to define the kind of culture the organization desires.
Competencies identifies the behaviours that makes the organization and the individual
successful its gives employees a better idea of which key actions to demonstrate. It is
important that competencies should be observable to ensure that the employee knows exactly
how well the competency has been demonstrated via feedback. Everyone needs a common
understanding of what is required of a particular competency. Each competency has clearly
defined pre-determined key actions that need to be demonstrated.
During this phase the employee must identify tracking sources that will give him/her
information regarding progress.
Development planning and continuous learning can be described as a three-stage process.
Most of us already use this process. Every time someone intentionally learns something new
they:
-

-

Assess their current skills and knowledge, by identifying both strengths and
developmental needs. Sources of assessment can include an discussion with the
manager, performance review, feedback from others, own self assessment etc.
Acquire the skills and knowledge they need through a variety of means, including but not
limited to formal training, reading a book etc.
Apply the new skills and knowledge to the job.

The areas for improvement (skills to be developed) can be added in the beginning of the
review process by completing a development plan. This takes place during the reaching
agreement discussion. During the reaching of agreement discussion the employees should
Page 178
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

take the lead as it is the employee‟s plan. The performance review form must be used as a
guide to discuss and agree on each part of the form. Action steps agreed upon must be
included in the development plan.
3.5 Tracking phase
Every employee is responsible to keep track of his/her performance during the review period.
Progress can be monitored by feedback from others and self reporting. Employees are not
used to monitor their own performance. Monitoring one‟s own performance may at first seem
strange and even cumbersome. With practice employees will find that it takes little effort to
write down and file a note on a compliment that he/she received from a customer or to
organize the data from tracking sources. By keeping track of performance the employee will
have the necessary supporting data/information during the formal reviews.
During the tracking phase of the performance cycle the employee is collecting important data
regarding his/er performance. Progress will be checked and recorded monthly during the
One-on-One informal discussions. During these discussions the manager and employee can
check progress and whether the employee‟s performance is still on track. During the planning
phase the employee should have identified tracking sources. The following are some tracking
sources:
-

Reports.
Surveys.
Calendars.
Lists.
Printouts.

These sources monitor the employee‟s results. The following sources can be utilized to track
competencies:
-

Self reports.
Written and verbal feedback from supervisors/managers, and customers.
A calendar of interactions.
Developmental activities.

Tracking should not be based on opinion or feelings, but always be based on facts. The
STAR concept can be used by the employee to capture a complete picture of behaviour. The
STAR concept (Situation/Task, Action, and Result) is a good method to capture a complete
picture of behaviours in a situation. STARs make feedback reliable.

ST

Page 179
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

STAR example:
Situation/Task - Describe the situation or task you faced – Part of my job is to update the
inventory database for my unit. When we lost our main storage facility as the hospital needed
the space for doctor‟s rooms, we had to reconsider how much stock we safely can keep on
hand.
Action - Describe what you did – When I realized that our storage capacity for dialysers and
plasma filters has been reduced by two thirds, I contacted our service provider and found out
how much it would cost if we purchased the same quantity of stock from them, but had it
delivered in smaller quantities weekly instead of monthly.
Result - Describe the results – The extra money that we spend on the weekly deliveries was
far less than what we would have spend leasing an extra storage space. Even when we had
to do a plasma exchange and we had to courier the filter via overnight service, our cost were
still far less than when we kept an a month‟s inventory on hand. The Financial Manager
figured that my plan saves the company almost R20 000.00 per year.
Every manager must keep a “performance” file for each employee in the unit. The file is
confidential and only the employee and manager have access to the file. The purpose of the
file is to keep a “portfolio of evidence” of performance for each employee. This portfolio of
evidence can include the following:
3.5.1

Completed competency document.
Hardcopies of tasks completed i.e. typed minutes, reports printed etc.
STAR sheet.
Letters from customers and management.
One-on-One discussions.
Etc.
Giving Effective Feedback

Giving feedback in ways that encourage a positive relationship and improve performance is a
skill that can be learned. Like any skill, the more you do it, the more proficient you become.
Effective feedback is descriptive, not judgmental. It is focused on behaviour, not personal
characteristics or “attitude.” It is a collaborative effort intended to help the employee.
It is not helpful to tell an employee that work is “substandard,” “not very good,” “great” or any
subjective term that is not defined. It is more helpful to say, “You are doing an excellent job of
capturing the invoices, which are error-free or although your progress on reducing errors on
purchasing invoices is good, I need the turnaround time for payment of the suppliers reduced
to three days.
Here are some suggestions for giving feedback, both positive and corrective. You can use
these suggestions in formal counselling sessions or in day-to-day communications.
Good feedback is: Timely, Specific, Balanced and non-threatening, Focused on solving
problems.
When giving feedback it is important to:

Page 180
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Maintain the self esteem of the employee; Listen and respond with concern to problems or
concerns; Ask for help and encourage involvement in solving problems; Share your own
thoughts, feelings and rationale for decisions; Provide support without removing responsibility.
The STAR feedback Model is useful for counselling sessions to improve performance or
reinforce positive behaviour.
In the model, you:
–
–
–

Describe the Situation or Task
Describe the Action; what was done
Describe the Results

To use this model for redirecting/improving performance, add two additional steps:
–
–
3.5.2

Describe Alternative Action.
Describe possible or desired results.
Coaching

During the year, managers are responsible for coaching and mentoring employees to assist
them in reaching their goals and achieving optimal performance. Ongoing feedback and
coaching is used to communicate about and correct performance deficiencies, to reinforce
appropriate behaviour, to teach the employee new skills, to motivate high performance, and to
mentor employees so they understand their role in the organization.
Employees are responsible for communicating with managers about their progress, resources
needed, any problems that arise, and barriers to achieving goals.
Providing feedback to employees about their performance is an important responsibility for all
managers and an integral part of performance review. Managers who develop a coaching
relationship with their employees find that employees learn new skills faster and are more
productive. Coaching is the secret to motivating high performance.
In a coaching relationship, the manager:
-

Challenges and helps employees do their best.
Is committed to excellence.
Sincerely cares for the individuals in the group.
Exhibits leadership skills.
Is a catalyst that helps the group work together.

Performance coaching helps employees grow and develop in the organization. It is a method
of leading that helps motivate good employees and improve the effectiveness of those with
performance problems. A desirable outcome of coaching is when employees develop new
skills in order to do their jobs better. Another positive outcome is that they are more
comfortable using their own ingenuity to solve problems.
The key to effective coaching is to handle problem situations without causing resentment.
Since it does little good to criticize after the fact, when calling attention to an error, take a
problem-solving approach and ask, “What can we do to correct this?”

Page 181
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Giving positive encouragement when an employee does something well is a powerful tool to
both reward the employee and motivate even better performance. Reinforcing improvement
almost guarantees that further improvement will be forthcoming.
Coaching employees allows managers to:
-

Reinforce good performance.
Correct performance.
Teach new skills and procedures.
Mentor employees .

Reinforcing good performance creates positive change in the workplace. It helps employees
become more autonomous and sets the stage for creative problem solving. Since new
behaviours are seldom initiated without experimentation and risk taking, encouraging
employees with positive reinforcement increases the chances that they will take the risks to
come up with new solutions to problems.
Corrective feedback helps new employees learn their jobs and helps all employees improve
their performance. Identifying and planning to correct problems as they arise can prevent
larger problems from developing later. Discussing barriers to effective work performance and
job satisfaction opens the way to improving performance and enriching the job. Managers can
assist employees in generating alternatives and action plans for dealing with identified
problems.
Teaching new skills is an important function for managers, especially with new employees.
Coaching sessions can be used to discuss possible work process improvements, help
employees understand new policies and procedures, and improve personal and interpersonal
effectiveness.
Managers mentor employees so they understand their role in the organization and learn how
to realize their potential. Encouraging employees to stretch themselves and set development
goals is another goal of coaching.
Coaching has the following benefits:
-

Regular coaching will make your job as manager easier when employees build their
skills and independence.
It also increases productivity, the quality or work and the effectiveness of the work
group.
Employees' motivation and initiative is increased with effective coaching.
Creativity and innovation in problem solving increases.
Coaching can prevent problems from occurring.

When to coach:
Performance Coaching is a continuous and continual process of providing help to one's
employees by analyzing their performance and other job behaviours for the purpose of
increasing their job effectiveness. It is an integral part of performance review.
Coaching sessions are most effective when held frequently and regularly. Ideally the manager
assumes a day-to-day coaching role which helps develop a positive relationship between the
manager and the employee. Positive accomplishments can be recognized immediately and
problems handled before they escalate. Addressing problems immediately ensures that
employees do not learn ineffective ways of working, and reinforcing good performance as it
occurs motivates employees to excel.
Page 182
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

It is important, when coaching for improvement, to call the employee into your office or
another private setting for the discussion. It is not appropriate to correct or discipline an
employee where others can hear or see the conversation. If you are reinforcing positive
behaviour, however, doing it in a public setting may be inappropriate and unappreciated.
Both informal day-to-day coaching and regular coaching sessions are recommended. These
can be short update sessions to check on progress, give feedback, and address problems
that have arisen.
How to be a good coach:
A good coach is a catalyst for change, someone who sparks action in others. This is different
from the traditional view of the manager's role. A catalyst helps others understand
expectations of their work and live up to those expectations. A catalyst helps people believe
they can attain their goals. A catalyst does not proscribe a plan for improvement, but expects
employees to direct the improvement of their own performance.
A good coach: encourages others to uncover the main cause of the problem; urge others to
take actions leading to lasting improvement; fosters open dialogue; shares personal feelings
about the situation; motivates people by offering specific feedback in a supportive way; and
pledges support for the person or the group's plan. In a leadership role, a catalyst leader can
help effect positive change in the workplace.
There are five key principles for effective coaching.
i.

Maintain and Enhance Self Esteem

Your employees need to feel respected and have a self of self worth in order to be motivated,
confident, innovative and committed. Employees who feel valued are more willing to share
responsibility, confront challenges, and adapt well to change. Maintaining self esteem means
telling employees that you know they want to do a good job and pointing out their strengths. It
also means not saying anything to demean their abilities, competencies or integrity. It means
praising them for good performance. Useful responses empathic, supportive and exploratory.
Those that alienate, criticize or deliver orders are likely to be dysfunctional.
ii.

Listen Actively and Respond With Concern

Listening is a powerful way to build trust and improve communication. To listen actively
means to pay careful attention to what the employee is saying. The coaching session should
be held in a quiet place so you can concentrate without distractions. It is important to
comprehend the feelings and concerns the employee may be expressing, even if the
employee cannot express them verbally. You can demonstrate that you are actively listening
by being attentive and maintaining eye contact. You can show understanding and empathy by
paraphrasing or reflecting back what was expressed. When you respond with empathy,
employees know you understand how they're feeling and why they're feeling that way. This
encourages your employees to share their feelings and ideas with you.

iii.

Ask For Help and Encourage Involvement

Employees want to have a say in how they do their work. They want to be involved in
decisions that affect them. They want to provide their input to changes that they will be asked
to implement. Involvement increases the chance that innovative ideas and solutions will
Page 183
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

surface. It is a sign of strength for a supervisor to ask employees for their suggestions on how
to solve a problem or improve performance.
iv.

Share Thoughts, Feelings and Rationale

Employees want to know how you're feeling about them in relation to their performance. By
being open with them, you'll encourage them to trust you, to be open in return, and to accept
responsibility for improving. By sharing the rationale for your decisions, you will help them
understand how their work contributes to the goals of the department/unit and the university
as a whole.
v.

Provide Support Without Removing Responsibility

As a manager of others, you are in a special position to provide support to your employees.
This may include advising, mentoring, providing resources, reassigning duties, and clearing
organizational roadblocks.
In order to assist the manager we have included a coaching checklist as well as a coaching
discussion form (Annexure F).
3.5.3

One-on-One Discussion

The purpose of this informal process is to determine and discuss the current state of affairs
from an employee and manager‟s perspective. Therefore this process should serve as an
informal feedback session were the employee has an opportunity to provide his/her upward
feedback to his/her leader/manager. This process also provides leaders/managers with
information on how they operate as or are perceived as leaders/managers.
This process is not intended to replace the existing disciplinary and or grievance procedure or
any rights associated with these. Matters that fall within the ambit of these mechanisms
should be referred as such.
3.6 Reviewing Phase
The formal review is an opportunity for the employee and manager to summarize how the
employee‟s actual performance compared to the level agreed to in the performance plan, to
recognize the employees major strengths, to agree on ways to improve performance that falls
short of the required standards and to look for ways to help grow and develop the employee
in the coming review period.
During the formal review the communication is two way.

3.6.1

For The Employee

When the manager asks the employee for his/her self-assessment, the employee should use
the copy of the Performance Review Form completed earlier in the review period. It will
contain the KPAs, duties and standards that have been develop and agreed upon.
The employee must use the notes that have been kept during the year to evaluate his/her
performance against the agreed-upon KPAs, duties and standards and Company Values in
Sections 1 and 2 of the form. The employee should write his/her remarks in the Supporting
Comments section. Employees must make use of concrete examples to support evaluations.
Page 184
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

The employee must keep in mind that if his/her performance met the standards, the rating will
be Meets Expectations. Only if the employee did better than the specified standard should the
rating be Exceeds Expectations or Outstanding.
The employee must be prepared to cite special accomplishments or achievements. If the
employee has letters of commendation or other documentation from peers, customers or
others, copies should be included. It is important that the employee is honest about where
improvement is needed. Develop action steps for performance improvements.
The employee should prepare a development plan for him/herself, based on his/her strengths
and areas to develop. The employee should also consider what support he/she may need
from the manager in order to accomplish goals/perform duties.
The employee must give a copy of his/her self-assessment to the manager at least one week
before the scheduled Performance Review Discussion.
The employee can use the following questions to help him/her to organize data in preparation
for the review discussion with the manager. The employee should think about the
performance data collected using the tracking sources, the progress made and any areas for
improvement:
3.6.2

What major accomplishments have I achieved this year?
How well did I use my tracking sources to assess my performance? What can I do
differently for the next review period?
How well did I use my tracking sources to obtain my feedback on my performance?
What can I do differently for the next review period?
What can I do to continue to improve in my current role?
What are the biggest obstacles I face to improve performance?
How can my manager help me perform better?
For the Manager

If you have followed the process so far, by the time you write the performance review, you will
have the information to do an effective job. You will have clear standards for goals and duties
based on the employee‟s KPAs. You will have a supportable basis for making your
evaluations. You will have documented the employee‟s performance and given clear
feedback about the performance over the course of the review period. You will have provided
the employee with opportunities to improve performance when necessary so there will be no
surprises about performance problems. At the time of the written review, both you and the
employee will discuss the process and you will invite the employee‟s input. If you follow the
suggestions in the Performance Guide, you will find the process of performance review to be
constructive and satisfying.
To make the written portion of performance review effective, the manager should obtain as
much objective information as possible about the employee‟s performance during the review
period. It is a good idea to take notes during the year on both positive and corrective events
so you will have concrete examples of behaviour to use. Other sources of data about
employee performance include performance documentation such as attendance records,
letters of complaint or commendation, examples of poor or outstanding work, activity reports,
and your notes from observing and coaching sessions.
3.6.3

Schedule the Review Discussion

The first step in the annual written review is to set a time for the discussion and inform the
employee of the time and place. Choose a quiet, neutral place where you will not be
Page 185
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

interrupted during the discussion. Also remind the employee that a self-assessment, using the
Performance Review Form with the planning portions completed, must be turned in to you at
least one week prior to the discussion.
As a manager, when you prepare to write the performance review, it is important to review the
rating scales and be sure you understand the five ratings (see Definitions).
3.6.4

Prepare the Written Review

All managers will use the new Performance Review Form for planning and for review.
3.6.5

Collect and Review Data

As you prepare to write reviews for your direct reports, allow enough time to carefully evaluate
each employee‟s performance. Use the information in the employee‟s self-assessment and
Job Description, and go over the KPAs, duties, and standards. Collect any notes you made
during the year, copies of the Performance Feedback Worksheet if you used it to record notes
on performance, the results of coaching sessions, and any other data you have that bears on
performance.
3.6.6

Compare Performance to Standards

Using the Performance Review Form that you began at the start of the review period, begin to
develop your supporting comments for the Duties and Values in Sections 1 and 2. Here you
will write your description of how well the employee performed duties and demonstrated the
company‟s values based on the standards. For all functions, consider these questions:
-

How does the employee‟s level of performance compare with the agreed-upon
performance standards?
How was the level of performance confirmed? Did you observe it? Did the employee
report it? Are there independent measures or work products?
What were the consequences, results and impact of the performance?

Use specific examples gathered from your notes in your descriptions of results, describing
behaviour that did or did not meet the agreed-upon standards.
3.6.7

Rate Duty and Value

After you have written the description, rate each item as Outstanding (O), Exceeds
Expectations (E), Meets Expectations (M), Needs Improvement (I), or Unsatisfactory (U). An
explanation of each rating is found in Definitions.
Note: If the employee‟s performance fully achieved the specified standard, the rating is M.
It is important to note that accurately evaluating performance is the most visible indicator of
success within any performance management system/process. Honesty and objectivity are
essential to a successful reviewing performance discussion. Without them the review has no
value to the employee or the origination.
Most of the time, employees and managers intend to be honest and objective about a
performance review, but feeling, opinions, biases, and single, memorable events thwart their
good intentions.

Page 186
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Let‟s face it, we are not perfect, but if we use performance data and the suggestions for
minimizing errors, we have a good change of agreeing on ratings. The following can have a
influence on ratings:
i.

Leniency or Harshness

When raters see everything as “good” they are lenient raters. When they see everything as
“bad” they are harsh raters. Examine your ratings for an unjustifiable tendency toward
leniency or harshness.
ii.

Central Tendency

Central tendency describes what you do when you tend to put everyone in the middle. This
tendency, which produces ratings that do not distinguish between employees, damages
morale and makes decisions for pay for performance, promotions or training difficult to justify.

iii.

First Impression

Whether your first impression of the employee was positive or negative, this should not affect
the performance review, which is based on observable behaviour for the entire review period
as compared to specific standards of performance.
iv.

Recency Effects

When behaviour observed just prior to the review unduly affects the rating, this is a recency
effect. Ratings should be based on performance that occurred throughout the entire review
period. Keeping good records of performance helps to overcome this error.
v.

Personal Bias

When raters give a higher rating to employees with qualities similar to their own, and lower
ratings to employees with dissimilar qualities, this is a similarity error.
A contrast error occurs when managers rate others as less skilled in areas in which they
themselves are highly skilled. If, for example, a manager rates him or herself as being very
dependable and rates subordinates as being less dependable, this is a contrast error.
All these biases can be avoided by having clearly defined agreed-upon standards in place,
and regularly-collected documentation of observable performance covering the entire review
period.
In addition to rating errors, it is important to ask yourself some critical questions, such as, “Did
I expect too much?” and “Has my leadership contributed in any way to this deficiency?” “Did
the employee have the proper training to do the job?” “Did the employee understand my
instructions?”
3.6.8

The Performance Review Discussion

Give the employee sufficient notice of the time and place of the meeting. Allow at least one
hour for the discussion. Hold the review in a private place where you will not be interrupted.

Page 187
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Bring to the meeting the Performance Review Form you have completed, the employee‟s selfassessment, the Performance Feedback Worksheet, and any other relevant documentation,
such as the Job Description, work products, etc.
Open the discussion by stating the purpose of the meeting and summarizing the points you
will be covering.
The objectives for the discussion are to:
-

Review, discuss and confirm your understanding of the accomplishment of goals/duties
and University Values listed on the Performance Review Form;
Recognize strengths and achievements;
Confirm previously identified areas needing improvement and agree about how
improvement is to be accomplished;
Review the employee‟s career development goals;
Set new goals/standards for the next review period;
Agree upon the support you will provide the employee in the coming year.

Begin with Section 1, Duties, and review each one. Consider the employee‟s self-assessment
in conjunction with your assessment, and discuss areas of agreement and difference.
Consider whether anything raised in your discussion of the employee‟s self-assessment
sheds new light on your assessment, and be prepared to modify your review if appropriate. If
performance meets or exceeds the standards, recognize these accomplishments.
For example, you might write: “ Jan, your performance in word processing is Meets
Expectations. You word process letters and reports with an average of one error per page,
correct errors on the final document, follow standard format and meet deadlines.”
If performance needs improvement, identify specific areas for development and jointly
develop an action plan.
For example, “Jan, your performance in word processing needs improvement. You word
process letters and reports with an average of three errors per page and do not always
correct all errors on the final document; you do follow standard format, but you frequently
miss deadlines.”
Ask the employee why s/he is not meeting standards. You can offer your own input on
possible causes. The goal of this discussion is for both of you to understand the reasons why
the standards are not being achieved. Ask the employee for potential solutions, and
brainstorm together until you both can agree on specific, practical solutions.
Discuss previously identified areas for improvement. Ask the employee how s/he plans to
improve performance and introduce your own ideas for improvement planning. No problems
should be raised during the review that you have not discussed with the employee during the
review period. Remember to criticize the work, not the person. Be as specific as possible,
relating areas of improvement to the work standards.
Be open to employee questions and concerns. Listen carefully to be sure you understand the
issues, and avoid responding defensively. If you need more information, meet with the
employee again at a later date. Do not let yourself get caught up in a debate or argument.
When employees require corrective feedback, give it straight. When employees merit praise,
give it to them.
Attempt to resolve differences, misunderstandings and disagreements that surface during the
review. Be sure that both of you are satisfied that all important points have been covered.
Page 188
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

In Section 1, write what you will do to support the employee in improving performance and
developing skills.
Update standards for the next review period.
Finish the discussion by summarizing what was discussed and the results of the meeting.
Reinforce work that was well done. Close on a positive note.
Tips for giving employees performance feedback:
-

Address performance problems as an opportunity for professional development.
Listen actively to the other person's concern.
Remember and acknowledge that negative feedback is both hard to give and hard to
receive.
Identify and/or ask for specific behaviours or training needed to correct performance
difficulties.
Work together on one performance concern at a time. If there are multiple concerns,
schedule additional meetings.
Problem solve solutions together to identify a course of action acceptable to both
parties and then identify when you will meet again to evaluate outcomes.
Don't discount emotional responses that are bound to occur. Take a break to relieve
tensions if emotions become extreme and reschedule the meeting if necessary.
Work to communicate assertively rather than aggressively or submissively.

Finalize the Performance Review:
If, during the discussion, you decide to change any of the ratings, note the changes on the
draft form and inform the employee that you will provide a new copy of the form with the
changes in a few days. Schedule another meeting to go over the final version of the form.
The last task is to start planning for the coming year by deciding on the goals/duties for the
next review period. Note these on a new Performance Review Form and provide a copy to the
employee. You may do this in the Performance Review Discussion or schedule another
meeting at a later time for goal setting.
Important Note:
Any development goals identified at the Performance Review. Discussion or in coaching
sessions can be inserted into the planning portion of the Performance Review Form for the
coming year.
For example, if an employee needs improvement in producing reports, a development goal
might be, “Independently writes queries and produces reports from Access database within
24 hours of request.”
Prepare the final version of the Performance Review Form.
Obtain the employee‟s signature on the form to indicate that the discussion was held. Give
the employee time to write comments or append documentation to the form. If the employee
refuses to sign the form, allow him/her some time to digest the material and prepare any
additional documentation. If the employee disagrees with the review and you are not able to
resolve the disagreement, the employee could speak with your manager or with Human
Resources. If the employee has not signed the form after a reasonable time, note that
information on the form, and sign it yourself.
Page 189
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

Give the employee a copy of the completed form:
Send a copy of the form to the Human Resources Department.
Conduct appropriate follow-up sessions to discuss training, set goals and standards for the
next review period, or coach for improved performance.
3.6.9

Disagreements

An employee‟s signature does not indicate agreement with the review, but rather that s/he
has read and understood the contents of the form.
If a post-probationary employee disagrees with his/her written review, the employee has
several options.
The employee may:
-

Attach a written response to the performance review;
Ask for a reconsideration of the written review by the next level manager, or
Contact the Human Resources Department for assistance.

In the event of a disagreement about the written performance review, the manager should
discuss the disagreement with the employee and try to solve the problem.
If the employee chooses to prepare a written response, attach it to the Performance Review
Form and send it to the Human Resources Department along with the form.
If the employee wishes to speak with the next-level manager, that person will review the
performance review and discuss the points of disagreement with the employee.
3.6.10 Coaching for Improved Performance
i.

Describe the problem in a friendly manner

Open the discussion in a positive, non-threatening way. Outline the purpose of the meeting.
Be specific as you describe a performance problem. Point out the acceptable levels of
performance (from the performance standards for the position) and show the employee
exactly where output falls short. Refer to any data you have that will illustrate the problem.
The purpose of this discussion is to uncover the causes for the performance problem and
work toward solutions, not place blame. Focus on the problem, not the employee.
ii.

Ask for the employee‟s help in solving the problem

For employees who are not motivated to improve performance, telling them to do better has
little chance of producing a positive result. The best way to get commitment is to ask for help
in deciding what to do about the performance problem. When employees realize that you
value their opinion, you are more likely to get cooperation and commitment. You may also
learn about workplace issues that are barriers to good performance.
iii.

Discuss the causes of the problem

Remember that you are having this discussion to talk about performance, not the employee‟s
attitude or personality. Remain relaxed and friendly. Gather all the information you can about
Page 190
Version 1.1 April 2003

Human Resources Policy

the situation by asking open-ended questions that start with words such as “How,” “What,”
“Who,” and “When.” Since these questions are generally not threatening, the employee will be
encouraged to answer them and you will learn more about the source of the problem. This is
a good time to listen and respond with empathy, since the employee may express concern or
frustration over factors that feel uncomfortable. Let the employee do most of the talking and
listen intently.
iv.

Identify and write down possible solutions

After you have identified the likely causes of the problem, you will want to decide how to
correct it. Ask the employee for ideas and write them down. Keep this record in case the first
solution does not work as well as expected. The employee will be more committed to solving
the problem if s/he has provided input for a solution.
v.

Decide on specific actions each of you will take

Now you can decide exactly what will be done, by whom and by when, to correct the problem.
Assign responsibilities for specific actions and write them down.
vi.

Agree on a specific follow-up date

A follow-up meeting shows the employee that solving the problem is important and that you
want to know the results of the new action. At that meeting, you can discuss progress and
plan further action. End the interview on a friendly note.
If coaching and the use of other resources do not have the desired effect on an employee's
work performance, you can use the resources of the Human Resources Department or, you
can follow the guidelines discussed in the performance management policy. Human
Resources can provide guidance and assistance.
3.7

Creating value

Every employee wants to know that he/she is a valuable member to the organization. How
can we add the most value? By working harder? That is not always the answer. People
should not confuse efforts with results.
People add value by concentrating their energy on the things that benefit the organization the
most. This makes the organization and you successful. Before you can focus on what is
important you need to know the following:

3.8

NRC’s Vision:

Our vision is to be recognized as the premier total disease management organization in South
Africa. We aim to be the first choice service provider in Renal Care for all funders and patients
in the country and to provide optimal renal care to all our patients.
3.9

3.11

The financial perspective – or how the company appear to shareholders?

become our customers most value supplier?)
The internal perspective – what business processes must we excel at?
The learning and growth perspective – who will we sustain our ability to change and
improve? (How can we continue to improve and create value, particularly in regard to
employee capabilities and motivation?)
Values:

NRC‟s values:
We value:
-

above Vision, Mission and Values as this will enable all employees to direct all actions and
performance in line with the organizations Vision, Mission and Values. This will ensure that
we are doing the things that will help us to achieve the overall objectives of the organization.
This will also ensure that all our Actions are directed by the Vision, Mission and Values of the
organization as all employees will know what they need to be doing on order to achieve the
company‟s objectives and overall Vision.
What the company will do with the information obtained:
-

Determine annual increases and bonuses.
