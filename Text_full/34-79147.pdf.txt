D.

FACTS
i.

Failure to Conduct Audits and Reviews in Accordance with PCAOB
Standards

6.
The Hall Group, Hall, Helterbran, and Cisneros collectively failed to
conduct at least 16 annual audits and 35 quarterly reviews 5 in accordance with PCAOB
standards in at least three ways: (1) they repeatedly failed to prepare adequate audit
documentation in connection with audit and review engagements; (2) failed to conduct – or
failed to obtain – an engagement quality review (“EQR”) of audit and review engagements
by a qualified reviewer; and (3) on at least four engagements, The Hall Group and Hall
performed audit services while the firm’s independence was impaired. As a result, The
Hall Group falsely stated that it conducted its audits in accordance with PCAOB standards
in at least 16 annual audit reports for eight issuers. Additionally, Hall, after becoming CFO
of DynaResource, Inc., allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit services to DynaResource,
Inc. even though he knew he had a direct financial interest in and a business relationship
with the company’s external audit firm.
a. Failure to Adequately Prepare Required Audit Documentation
7.
PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3, Audit Documentation (“AS 3”), states
that “[a]udit documentation is the written record of the basis for the auditor’s conclusions
that provides the support for the auditor’s representations, whether those representations are
contained in the auditor’s report or otherwise.” (emphasis in original.) AS 3, ¶ 2.
Additionally, AS 3 states that:
The auditor must document the procedures performed, evidence obtained,
and conclusions reached with respect to relevant financial statement
assertions. Audit documentation must clearly demonstrate that the work
was in fact performed. This documentation requirement applies to the
work of all those who participate in the engagement as well as to the work
of specialists the auditor uses as evidential matter in evaluating relevant
financial statement assertions. Audit documentation must contain
sufficient information to enable an experienced auditor, having no
previous connection with the engagement:
a. To understand the nature, timing, extent, and results of the
procedures performed, evidence obtained, and conclusions
reached, and
b. To determine who performed the work and the date such work was
completed as well as the person who reviewed the work and the
date of such review. (emphasis added) AS 3, ¶ 6
8.
AS 3 states that an auditor must “identify all significant findings or issues in
an engagement completion document,” which includes either all information necessary to
5

See Appendix attached herewith.

4

understand the significant findings, issues or provides references to other audit
documentation. AS 3, ¶ 13 (emphasis in original.)
9.
The Hall Group utilized standardized forms and checklists while
documenting its audit work. For example, The Hall Group used a “Supervision, Review
and Approval Form” to document, in part, (1) who performed the partner review and the
engagement quality review, (2) the dates of such reviews, (3) the partner’s approval for
issuance of the report, and (4) the engagement quality reviewer’s concurring approval for
issuance of the report. The Hall Group also used a standardized “Engagement Completion
Document Form” to assist in summarizing all significant findings or issues.
10.
Hall and Helterbran failed to comply with AS 3 on multiple audits because
their workpapers contained blank or incomplete Supervision, Review, and Approval Forms
and blank or incomplete Engagement Completion Document Forms for at least five audit
and twenty review engagements over multiple periods.
11.
The existence of blank or incomplete Engagement Completion Document
Forms further evidences Hall’s and Helterbran’s failure to prepare documentation in
accordance with AS 3 requirements and does not allow an experienced auditor, having no
previous connection with the engagement, to determine who reviewed the work and the
date of such review.
b. Failure to Obtain Required Engagement Quality Reviews
12.
Auditing Standard No. 7, Engagement Quality Review (“AS 7”), requires an
auditor to obtain an EQR and concurring approval to issue the engagement report for each
audit and interim review engagement. 6 Additionally, AS 7 states, “[a]n engagement quality
reviewer from the firm that issues the engagement report (or communicates an engagement
conclusion, if no report is issued) must be a partner or another individual in an equivalent
position.” Among other things, an engagement quality reviewer must be competent, i.e.,
must possess the level of knowledge and competence related to accounting, auditing and
financial reporting required to serve as the engagement partner on the engagement under
review. Additionally, an engagement quality reviewer must have competence,
independence, integrity, and objectivity. To maintain objectivity, the engagement quality
reviewer should not make decisions on behalf of the engagement team or assume any of the
responsibilities of the engagement team. AS 7, ¶¶ 3-7. An audit firm may grant permission
to the client to use the firm’s audit report only after the engagement quality reviewer
provides concurring approval of issuance, AS 7, ¶ 13.
13.
The PCAOB defines the engagement partner as the member of the
engagement team with primary responsibility for the audit. Auditing Standard No. 10,
Supervision of the Audit Engagement, (“AS 10”), Appendix, A2. The engagement partner
remains responsible for the engagement and its performance, notwithstanding the
6

AS 7 is effective for audits and interim reviews for fiscal years beginning on or after
December 15, 2009.

5

involvement of the engagement quality reviewer. AS 7, ¶7. Accordingly, the engagement
partner is responsible for, among other things, compliance with PCAOB standards. AS 10,
¶3.
14.
Audit firms’ quality control policies and procedures should include
provisions that provide the firm with reasonable assurance that the engagement quality
reviewer has sufficient competence, among other things, to perform the EQR in accordance
with PCAOB standards. AS 7, ¶4. Policies and procedures should be established to
provide the firm with reasonable assurance that “those hired possess the appropriate
characteristics to enable them to perform competently” and “[w]ork is assigned to
personnel having the degree of technical training and proficiency required in the
circumstances.” PCAOB Quality Control Standard QC Section 40, The Personnel
Management Element of a Firm's System of Quality Control-Competencies Required by a
Practitioner-in-Charge of an Attest Engagement, ¶ 02.
15.
Hall and The Hall Group failed to establish these required policies and
procedures. Moreover, on multiple occasions, Hall and Helterbran also failed to comply
with AS 7 by either failing to obtain any EQR or instructing an unqualified person,
including Cisneros, to perform engagement quality reviews for multiple audit and review
engagements from 2010 through 2013. For at least two audit engagements, Hall
improperly acted as both the engagement partner and the EQR partner.
16.
Hall and Helterbran knowingly or at least recklessly directed or permitted
Cisneros to perform an EQR on multiple audits and reviews despite knowing she was not a
partner or someone in an equivalent position. 7 Cisneros knowingly or at least recklessly
provided the engagement quality reviewer’s concurring approval of issuance of the report
despite knowing that she was not a partner or someone in an equivalent position at The
Hall Group and not qualified to conduct an EQR. Indeed, Cisneros acknowledged to
Commission staff that she lacked the knowledge and competence in accounting, auditing,
and financial reporting required to serve as engagement partner for an engagement
conducted under PCAOB standards.
17.
Cisneros performed the engagement quality reviews for at least eight issuer
audit engagements for seven issuers and 15 reviews of six issuers’ interim financial
information, and signed Supervision, Review, and Approval Forms, as the engagement
quality reviewer. In each instance, Hall and Helterbran failed to determine whether
Cisneros prepared required documentation in connection with the EQRs she performed.
AS 7, ¶¶ 9-11 and ¶ 21.
18.
Hall failed to comply with AS 7 even after confirming to the PCAOB that
he would do so. In connection the PCAOB’s 2013 inspection of The Hall Group, Hall
7

Although AS 7 does not necessarily require that persons performing EQRs be licensed CPAs,
the standard states that the person “must be a partner or another individual in an equivalent
position.” Cisneros not being a CPA is relevant here because The Hall Group required anyone
holding the title of “Principal/Partner” must also be a licensed CPA in Texas.

6

confirmed in writing to the PCAOB inspection team that Cisneros performed the EQR for
two issuers’ fiscal year 2012 audits and the EQRs for the first, second, and third quarter
reviews for a third issuer. 8 Hall also told the inspection team during its fieldwork that
Cisneros was not a CPA. In August 2013, the PCAOB issued an inspection comment
stating that The Hall Group failed to comply with AS 7 and failed to ensure that EQRs
were performed by persons with sufficient qualifications. The inspection comment states
that Hall’s representations demonstrated that Cisneros did not meet the firm’s requirements
for a “Principal/Partner,” and, accordingly, she did not meet the AS 7 requirements for
serving as EQR. In an August 5, 2013 handwritten response to this inspection comment
form, Hall wrote, “[w]e agree with the issue noted above and are in the process for [sic]
negotiating with an outside firm (PCAOB registered) and will not issue any more reports
until this is in place and have that firm perform the appropriate review process.” (emphasis
added).
19.
Contrary to Hall’s representation, he knowingly disregarded the PCAOB
standards when he failed to obtain an EQR by a qualified reviewer for any of the firm’s
review and audit engagements for fiscal periods ended June 30 and September 30, 2013 –
engagements conducted after his written representation to the PCAOB. On at least one
2013 audit, Hall added a memo to the audit file stating, in part, “The Hall Group did not
have access to an Engagement Quality Reviewer for this audit” and “[t]herefore, Mr. Hall
acted as Eng. Quality Reviewer.” Hall then signed the supervision, review, and approval
checklist as both the engagement and EQR partner. Subsequently, for the first quarter
fiscal year 2014 review for this same client, Hall did not sign off as EQR but added a
memo to the file reiterating that “The Hall Group did not have access to an Engagement
Quality Reviewer” and concluded by stating “[w]e stand by our work.”
c. The Hall Group’s Independence Was Impaired
20.
Section 10A(j) of the Exchange Act, Audit Partner Rotation, states “it shall
be unlawful for a registered public accounting firm to provide audit services to an issuer if
the lead (or coordinating) audit partner (having primary responsibility for the audit) or the
partner responsible for reviewing the audit, has performed audit services for that issuer in
each of the previous five fiscal years of that issuer. The Commission’s independence rules
allow engagement and concurring partners to serve for five consecutive years, after which
they may not serve in either role for another period of five years. Rule 2-01(c)(6)(i)(A) of
Regulation S-X. Related PCAOB rules and standards require that a registered public
accounting firm and its associated persons be independent of the Firm’s issuer audit clients.
21.
Hall was The Hall Group’s sole partner prior to 2012 and therefore served
as the only engagement partner on each of The Hall Group’s engagements before 2012. In
a February 2012 response to the PCAOB addressing deficiencies noted in the PCAOB’s
2010 inspection, Hall acknowledged that he served as the lead engagement partner for one
issuer for five consecutive years and the firm’s review of the issuer’s first quarter of the
8

Freestone Resources, Inc. for fiscal year ended June 30, 2012; Seven Arts Entertainment for
fiscal year ended June 30, 2012; and DynaResource for quarters ended March 31, June 30, and
Sept. 30, 2012.

7

sixth year. Hall explained that it was the last quarter the firm was engaged as the issuer’s
auditor, and that to remediate, he (1) named Helterbran as a partner in February 2012; and
(2) developed a log to ensure that appropriate partner rotation occurs.
22.
After Helterbran’s departure in early July 2013, Hall was once again The
Hall Group’s sole partner. Hall attempted to address the partner rotation issue by offering
to promote one of his audit staff to a non-equity partner but the individual rejected the
offer. As a result, Hall knowingly or at least recklessly served as the lead engagement
partner for at least three of The Hall Group’s reviews for quarters ended June 30, 2013 and
September 30, 2013, even though he had already served as the lead engagement partner for
five consecutive years and, accordingly, The Hall Group lacked independence under the
Commission’s rules with respect to these issuers.
d. Reports on Audited Financial Statements
23.
Under AU § 508, Reports on Audited Financial Statements, an auditor may
only express an unqualified opinion on historical financial statements when he has formed
such an opinion on the basis of an audit performed in accordance with PCAOB standards.
AU § 508.07.
24.
Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X requires an accountant’s report to state
“whether the audit was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.”
And “references in Commission rules and staff guidance and in the federal securities laws
to GAAS or to specific standards under GAAS, as they relate to issuers, should be
understood to mean the standards of the PCAOB plus any applicable rules of the
Commission.” See SEC Release No. 34-49708 (May 14, 2004). Thus, an auditor violates
Regulation S-X Rule 2-02(b)(1) if it issues a report stating it has conducted its audit in
accordance with PCAOB standards when it has not.
25.
The Hall Group issued and Hall and Helterbran approved the issuance of, at
least 16 audit reports, including at least eight for which Cisneros provided concurring
approval of issuance. Each of the firm’s audit reports states that “The Hall Group CPAs”
conducted its audits in accordance with PCAOB standards. As stated above, these
statements were false. As a result, The Hall Group willfully violated, and Hall, Helterbran,
and Cisneros willfully aided and abetted The Hall Group’s violations of, Rule 2-02(b)(1).
ii.

Hall, as CFO, Allowed DynaResource to File its 2014 Forms 10-Q Without
Reviews by an Independent Public Accountant

26.
Rule 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X states, in part, “[p]rior to filing, interim
financial statements included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (17 CFR 249.308(a)) must
be reviewed by an independent public accountant using professional standards and
procedures for conducting such reviews.” Rules 2-01(c)(1) and 2-01(c)(3) of Regulation SX state, in part, that an accountant is not independent when the accounting firm has any
loan to or from, or certain business relationships with, an audit client’s officers.

8

27.
After selling certain of his firm’s assets to Thakkar CPA, Hall assisted
Thakkar CPA in soliciting audit engagements from each of The Hall Group’s audit clients,
including DynaResource. DynaResource engaged Thakkar CPA in January 2014. On
April 15, 2014, Thakkar CPA issued an audit report on DynaResource’s 2013 financial
statements, which it signed as “The Hall Group CPAs.” The same day, DynaResource
named Hall as its CFO. Thereafter, Hall functioned as Thakkar CPA’s primary contact on
audit-related issues. Thakkar CPA continued as DynaResource’s external auditor until it
resigned on March 5, 2015.
28.
DynaResource filed its first, second, and third quarter 2014 Forms 10-Q
with the Commission after the included financial statements were reviewed by Thakkar
CPA. Hall signed management letters of representation in connection with each of
Thakkar CPA’s reviews, and made certifications required under Rule 13a-14 of the
Exchange Act for each of DynaResource’s first, second, and third quarter 2014 Forms
10-Q.
29.
Hall allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit services to DynaResource even
though he knew that he was an officer of the company and that he had a direct financial
interest in and a business relationship with Thakkar, CPA. Specifically, the following
events impaired Thakkar CPA’s independence with respect to its reviews of interim
financial information DynaResource included in its Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission
in 2014:
•

Thakkar CPA delivered a note payable to David S. Hall, P.C., which remained
outstanding even after Hall became DynaResource’s CFO, as a result of the terms
of the asset purchase agreement, under which Thakkar paid Hall $450,000 in cash
and undertook a 5%, two-year promissory note for $313,516. The final purchase
price also was dependent upon the future success of Thakkar CPA as the purchase
price was to be adjusted up or down based upon actual collection during the three
years following the Closing Date. Additionally, the asset purchase agreement
included a provision under which Hall could earn fees for providing services to
Thakkar CPA after the Closing Date (although Hall did not earn any fees under
this provision).

•

Thakkar CPA unilaterally suspended payments on the promissory note to David
S. Hall, P.C. in May 2014 after determining that future collections were likely to
be less than the amounts expected at the Closing Date.

30.
Hall allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit services to DynaResource even
though he knew he had a direct financial interest in and a business relationship with the
company’s audit firm and, despite this knowledge, executed the certifications required
under Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act and allowed DynaResource to file its 2014 Forms
10-Q with the Commission.

money penalty in the amount of $25,000.00 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for
transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section
21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31
U.S.C. §3717.
E.

Payment must be made in one of the following ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the
Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire
instructions upon request;

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via
Pay.gov through the SEC website
at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169
F.
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter
identifying David S. Hall as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of
these proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to
David Peavler, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 801

G.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this
Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all
tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that
in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall
they benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the
amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty
Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset,
Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the
Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the
civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related

12

Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondents by or on
behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the
Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in
Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true
and admitted by David S. Hall, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment
interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Hall under this Order or any other judgment,
order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this
proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Hall of the federal securities laws or any
regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
