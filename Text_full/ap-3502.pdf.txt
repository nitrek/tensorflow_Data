ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 3502 / January 13, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16155

In the Matter of
ORDER REGARDING MOTION TO COMPEL
NICHOLAS ROWE

The hearing in this matter is scheduled to commence on February 1, 2016. Pending
before me are several prehearing motions, including Nicholas Rowe’s motion to compel certain
parties to produce subpoenaed information. In that motion, Rowe represents: “The only
documents received from any of the above named individuals are emails from Bruce Gabriel.
Nothing further has been provided.” In an omnibus opposition, counsel for the subpoena
recipients represents that his clients “produced all responsive documents . . . .” The opposition
provides no specifics about such production.
On the present papers, I am unable to make a determination. I therefore ORDER as
follows:
By January 15, 2016, the subpoena recipients and/or their counsel shall make a proffer by
way of declaration(s) itemizing the documents or categories of documents that each subpoena
recipient has provided to Rowe, and what steps each the subpoena recipient took to comply with
the documentary subpoenas.
By January 20, 2016, Rowe may submit a reply.
