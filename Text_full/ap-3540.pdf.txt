ORDER TO SHOW

POSTPONING HEARING

On January 11, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondents, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. A hearing is scheduled to commence on January 29, 2016.
On January 15, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration establishing that
Respondents were served with the OIP by January 14, 2016, in accordance with Commission
Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). Accordingly, Respondents’ answers
to the OIP were due by January 27, 2016, as service was effected by mail. See OIP at 3; 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). To date, no Respondent has filed an answer.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that Respondents SHOW CAUSE by February 8, 2016,
why the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failure to
file answers or otherwise defend this proceeding. If a Respondent fails to respond to this order,
it shall be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the registration of
its securities will be revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
Additionally, it is FURTHER ORDERED that the hearing scheduled to begin on January
29, 2016, is POSTPONED sine die, and a telephonic prehearing conference shall be held at
11:00 a.m. EST on February 29, 2016, if the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
