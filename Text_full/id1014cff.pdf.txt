INITIAL DECISION
May 27, 2016

Rebecca Israel for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
Robert Burton, pro se

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision bars Robert Burton from the securities industry. He was previously
convicted of securities fraud and other crimes and enjoined against violations of Massachusetts state
law related to investment related services.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding, pursuant to Section
203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), with an Order Instituting
Proceedings (OIP) on October 27, 2015. The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on United
States v. Burton, No. 13-cr-10292 (D. Mass.), appeal dismissed, No. 15-1578 (1st Cir. Sept. 14,
2015),1 in which Respondent Robert Burton was convicted of securities fraud and other crimes, as
well as on Commonwealth v. Pinnacle Financial Consulting, LLC, Civil Action No. 13-0812B
(Sup. Ct. Mass.), in which he was enjoined against violations of state law related to investment
related services. The Division of Enforcement filed a motion for summary disposition on February
5, 2016, pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 250(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a) (Rule 250(a)), in
accordance with leave granted. Robert Burton, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3500, 2016 SEC

In dismissing Burton’s appeal, the Court of Appeals stated, “Defendant is remitted to his
remedies, if any, under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.” Burton has a number of motions pending before the
U.S. District Court, including one styled Motion to Vacate under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. See United
States v. Burton, ECF Nos. 126, 130, 132, 137, 142, 143, 156-58, 162.

LEXIS 124 (A.L.J. Jan. 13, 2016). To date, Burton has not filed an opposition, which was due on
March 4, 2016. Id.
This Initial Decision is based on the pleadings and Burton’s Answer to the OIP. There is no
genuine issue with regard to any fact that is material to this proceeding. All material facts that
concern the activities for which Burton was convicted were decided against him in the criminal and
civil cases on which this proceeding is based. Any other facts in his filing have been taken as true,
pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). All arguments and proposed findings and conclusions that are
inconsistent with this decision were considered and rejected.
B. Allegations and Arguments of the Parties
The OIP alleges that Burton was convicted of securities fraud and other crimes in United
States v. Burton and enjoined against violations of state law related to investment related services in
Commonwealth v. Pinnacle Financial Consulting, LLC. The Division urges that he be barred from
the securities industry. At the January 12, 2016, prehearing conference, Burton opposed this,
disavowing his plea agreement in United States v. Burton. He also indicated concern that agreeing
to a settlement of this proceeding might adversely impact his efforts to overturn his conviction.
C. Procedural Issues
1. Official Notice
Official notice pursuant to Rule 323, 17 C.F.R. § 201.323, is taken of the Commission’s
public official records and of the docket reports and the courts’ orders in United States v. Burton
and Commonwealth v. Pinnacle Financial Consulting, LLC. Selected materials from the dockets in
those cases are attached to the Division’s Motion for Summary Disposition as Declaration Exhibits
A-F (Exs. A-F), and official notice pursuant to Rule 323 is taken of each of them.
2. Collateral Estoppel
It is well established that the Commission does not permit criminal convictions to be
collaterally attacked in its administrative proceedings. See Ira William Scott, Advisers Act Release
No. 1752, 1998 SEC LEXIS 1957, at *8-9 (Sept. 15, 1998); William F. Lincoln, Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 39629, 1998 SEC LEXIS 193, at *7-8 (Feb. 12, 1998). Nor does the
Commission permit a respondent to relitigate issues that were addressed in a previous civil
proceeding against the respondent, whether resolved by consent, by summary judgment, or after a
trial. See Jeffrey L. Gibson, Exchange Act Release No. 57266, 2008 SEC LEXIS 236, at *10 (Feb.
4, 2008) (injunction entered by consent), pet. denied, 561 F.3d 548 (6th Cir. 2009); John Francis
D’Acquisto, Advisers Act Release No. 1696, 1998 SEC LEXIS 91, at *1-2 & n.1, *7 (Jan. 21, 1998)
(injunction entered by summary judgment); James E. Franklin, Exchange Act Release No. 56649,
2007 SEC LEXIS 2420, at *11 & nn.13-14 (Oct. 12, 2007) (injunction entered after trial), pet.
denied, 285 F. App’x 761 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Demitrios Julius Shiva, Exchange Act Release No.
38389, 1997 SEC LEXIS 561, at *5-6 & nn.6-7 (Mar. 12, 1997); see also Marshall E. Melton,
Advisers Act Release No. 2151, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *2-10, *22-30 (July 25, 2003).
Nor does the pendency of an appeal preclude the Commission from action based on a
conviction. See Joseph P. Galluzzi, Exchange Act Release No. 46405, 2002 SEC LEXIS 3423, at
2

*10 n.21 (Aug. 23, 2002); Charles Phillip Elliott, Exchange Act Release No. 31202, 1992 SEC
LEXIS 2334, at *11 (Sept. 17, 1992). If Burton is successful in overturning his conviction, he can
request the Commission to vacate any sanctions ordered in this proceeding (or to dismiss the
proceeding, if it is still pending).2
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
Burton was convicted in United States v. Burton on December 23, 2014, of five counts of
securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and six counts of tax fraud in
violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1), (2); he was sentenced to 48 months of incarceration and a threeyear term of post-release supervision and ordered to pay $271,640 in restitution to the Internal
Revenue Service, $159,500 in restitution to victims, and a fine of $7,500.3 Ex. C. The securities
fraud conduct underlying United States v. Burton ended in June 2013. Ex. C at 1. At the time of
the offenses, Burton was acting as an investment adviser. Ex. B at 3.4
On March 25, 2015, in Commonwealth v. Pinnacle Financial Consulting, LLC, the court (1)
enjoined Burton and his company, Pinnacle, from advertising, marketing, soliciting fees in relation
to, and/or providing, in Massachusetts: loan modification services; bankruptcy petition services;
financial and investment advising services for compensation; and the unauthorized practice of law;
(2) ordered Burton and Pinnacle to pay restitution of $1,241,840.45, civil penalties of $665,000, and
the Commonwealth’s attorney’s fees of $55,425; and (3) ordered that Burton and Pinnacle be jointly
and severally liable for the money payments. Ex. E.

8, 2013) (dismissing follow-on administrative proceeding after court of appeals, while petition for
review was pending before Commission, reversed and remanded district court’s judgment that was
basis for OIP); Richard L. Goble, Exchange Act Release No. 68651, 2013 SEC LEXIS 129 (Jan. 14,
2013) (dismissing follow-on administrative proceeding after court of appeals, while petition for
review was pending before Commission, vacated injunction that was basis for OIP); Evelyn Litwok,

proceeding after court of appeals, while petition for review was pending before Commission,
reversed certain convictions and vacated and remanded other convictions, all of which were basis
for OIP); Kenneth E. Mahaffy, Jr., Exchange Act Release No. 68462, 2012 SEC LEXIS 4020 (Dec.
18, 2012) (vacating bar issued in follow-on administrative proceeding where court of appeals, after
Commission had issued bar order, vacated criminal conviction that was basis for proceeding).

Burton’s pretrial release was revoked while he was awaiting sentencing because he repeatedly
violated his conditions of release and lied to the Pretrial Services Officer. Ex. F.

In his Answer to the OIP, Burton denies acting as an investment adviser (while admitting that he
owned and operated a business that provided investment advising services to clients). Answer at ¶
A.1. However, in the Plea Agreement that Burton signed on August 19, 2014, he acknowledges “at
the time of the offenses, Defendant was acting as an investment adviser.” Ex. B at 3. “Investment
adviser” is defined in Advisers Act Section 202(11): “any person who, for compensation, engages
in the business of advising others, . . . as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling
securities.”

Burton participated in Commonwealth v. Pinnacle Financial Consulting, LLC, to a limited
extent, but the court entered a default against him. See Ex. D at ¶¶ 8, 15. Burton and Pinnacle were
subject to a preliminary injunction issued on March 13, 2013, and, on November 15, 2013, were
held in contempt for violating it on numerous occasions and assessed restitution of $30,466.36,
penalties of $170,000, and attorney’s fees and costs of $39,866. Ex. D at ¶¶ 3, 5. The court entered
a default against Pinnacle with Burton’s agreement and, subsequently, on June 23, 2014, against
Burton after he persistently failed to respond to discovery. Ex. D at ¶¶ 6, 7. On August 4, 2014, the
court denied Burton’s motion to reconsider the default because of his repeated violations of the
discovery rules and orders of the court. Ex. D at ¶ 8. Eventually, on January 9, 2015, after further
defiance of the court’s orders, the court ordered the Commonwealth’s requests for admissions to be
deemed admitted. Ex. D at ¶¶ 9-12.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Burton has been convicted within ten years of the commencement of this proceeding of a
felony that “arises out of the conduct of the business of a[n] . . . investment adviser” within the
meaning of Sections 203(e)(2)(A) and 203(f) of the Advisers Act. Additionally, his injunction is
within the meaning of Sections 203(e)(4) and 203(f) of the Advisers Act. Although unregistered,
Burton was acting as an investment adviser. It cannot be questioned that the Commission has
authority to bar persons from association with investment advisers, whether registered or
unregistered, or otherwise sanction them under Section 203 of the Advisers Act. Teicher v. SEC,
177 F.3d 1016, 1017-18 (D.C. Cir. 1999).
IV. SANCTION
As the Division requests, an industry bar will be ordered.
A. Sanction Considerations
The Commission determines sanctions pursuant to a public interest standard. See 15 U.S.C.
§ 80b-3(f). The Commission considers factors including:
the egregiousness of the defendant’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant’s assurances
against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his
conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant’s occupation will present opportunities
for future violations.
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334
n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981). The Commission also considers
the age of the violation and the degree of harm to investors and the marketplace resulting from the
violation. Marshall E. Melton, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *5. Additionally, the Commission
considers the extent to which the sanction will have a deterrent effect. Schield Mgmt. Co.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS 195, at *35 & n.46 (Jan. 31, 2006). The public
interest requires a severe sanction when a respondent’s past misconduct involves fraud because
opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly in the securities business. See Vladimir Boris
Bugarski, Exchange Act Release No. 66842, 2012 SEC LEXIS 1267, at *18 n.26 (Apr. 20, 2012);
4

Richard C. Spangler, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 12104, 1976 SEC LEXIS 2418, at *34 (Feb.
12, 1976).
B. Sanction
As described in the Findings of Fact, Burton’s conduct was egregious and recurrent, and
involved a high degree of scienter, as shown by his conviction for multiple counts of securities
fraud as well as tax fraud. His previous occupation, if he were allowed to continue it in the future,
would present opportunities for future violations. Absent a bar, he could re-enter the securities
industry. The violations are recent, having ended in 2013. There is an absence of recognition by
Burton of the wrongful nature of his conduct. His defiance of the court’s orders in Commonwealth
v. Pinnacle Financial Consulting, LLC, bodes ill for future compliance with legal requirements.
There is a reasonable foreseeable risk that, if he were allowed to resume his former business
activities, he would engage in similar criminal conduct. The degree of direct financial harm to
investors is quantified in the $159,500 in restitution he was ordered to pay in United States v.
Burton, and, as the Commission has often emphasized, the public interest determination extends
beyond consideration of the particular investors affected by a respondent’s conduct to the public-atlarge, the welfare of investors as a class, and standards of conduct in the securities business
generally. See Christopher A. Lowry, Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 2052, 2002 SEC
LEXIS 2346, at *20 (Aug. 30, 2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003); Arthur Lipper Corp.,
Exchange Act Release No. 11773, 1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at *52 (Oct. 24, 1975). A conviction
involving dishonesty requires a bar, and because of the Commission’s obligation to ensure honest
securities markets, an industry-wide bar is appropriate.
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(f), ROBERT BURTON IS BARRED from associating with any broker, dealer,
investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally
recognized statistical rating organization.
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of
the Initial Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have
twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such
motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The Initial Decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the Initial Decision shall not become final as to that party.
