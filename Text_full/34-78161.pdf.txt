BARCLAYS CAPITAL INC.; ORDER GRANTING ACCELERATED EFFECTIVENESS OF NOTICE
REGARDING CHANGE OF METHOD FOR COMPUTING DEDUCTIONS FOR MARKET AND
CREDIT RISK
Barclays Capital Inc. (“Barclays Capital”) is a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“Commission”). Subject to the terms and conditions of a Commission order
dated September 22, 2008, 1 Barclays Capital was permitted to compute deductions for market and credit
risk pursuant to Rule 15c3-1e (“Appendix E”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 2 Barclays
Capital has notified the Commission that it intends to cease computing deductions for market and credit
risk under Appendix E and will compute deductions for market and credit risk pursuant to paragraph
(c)(2) of Rule 15c3-1. Barclays Capital requested that this change become effective July 1, 2016.
As a condition for a broker or dealer to compute deductions for market and credit risk under
Appendix E, a broker or dealer agrees, among other things, that it will notify the Commission 45 days
before it ceases to compute such deductions under Appendix E. 3 The Commission may determine by
order that the notice become effective within a shorter or longer period of time if the broker-dealer
consents or if the Commission determines that a shorter or longer period is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors. 4 Barclays Capital has consented to a shorter period of
time.
