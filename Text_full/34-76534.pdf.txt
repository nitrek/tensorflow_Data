Respondents.

On March 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") issued
an Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 8A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to
Prime Capital Services, Inc. and Gilman Ciocia, Inc. (Securities Act Release No. 9113 (Mar. 16,
2010)) (the "Order''). The Commission found that from 1999 through early 2007, four
representatives associated with Prime Capital Services, Inc. (“PCS”) who were employed by
Gilman Ciocia, Inc. (“G&C”) induced senior citizen customers in south Florida into purchasing
variable annuities by means of material misrepresentations and omissions. The Commission
further found that PCS and several supervisors failed reasonably to supervise the four registered
representatives so as to detect and prevent their violations of the federal securities laws. PCS
was ordered to pay total of $144,262.58 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the
Commission, and G&C was ordered to pay total of $450,001 in disgorgement and civil penalties
to the Commission. A total of $602,753.96 was paid to the Commission.1 The Commission
created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for these

payments (the "Fair Fund"). The Fair Fund was held in a non-interest bearing account with the
United States Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”).
On September 23, 2010, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on
Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans (“Commission’s Rules”), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103 (Exchange
Act Rel. No. 62979 (September 23, 2010)). Subsequently, on February 1, 2011, the Commission
issued a Notice of Proposed Modified Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment
pursuant to the same rule (Exchange Act Rel. No. 63813 (February 1, 2011)). On March 14,
2011, the Commission issued an Order Approving Distribution Plan of a Fair Fund and
Appointing a Fund Administrator, whereby Robert J. Keyes, a Commission employee, was
appointed as Fund Administrator (Exchange Act Rel. No. 64081 (March 14, 2011)).
The Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) provided that monies from the Fair Fund would be
distributed to Eligible Investors who were harmed by the conduct of PCS and G&C. On May 8,
2012, the Commission issued an Order Approving and Ratifying Prior Disbursement of
$390,054.77 to eleven Eligible Investors who paid fees and charges associated with their variable
annuity investment and who were described in the Order and/or who testified about their
investment experience at an administrative hearing (Exchange Act Release No. 66947 (May 8,
2012)). On December 18, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Directing Disbursement of
Fair Fund Residual in the amount of $141,500 to seven Eligible Investors pursuant to Sections
21(d) and 21B(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All disbursements were accepted by
the Eligible Investors and no amounts were returned to the Fair Fund. In addition, the Fair Fund
paid $1,200 in District of Columbia taxes, and $19,829.36 in Tax Administrator fees and
expenses. A balance of $50,169.83 remains in the Fair Fund.
The Plan provides that the Fair Fund shall be eligible for termination after all of the
following have occurred: 1) the final accounting by the Fund Administrator has been submitted
and approved by the Commission; 2) all taxes, fees, and expenses have been paid; and 3) all
remaining funds or any residual funds have been received by the Commission. A final
accounting, which was submitted to the Commission for approval as required by Rule 1105(f) of
the Commission’s Rules, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105(f) and as set forth in the Plan, is now approved.
Staff has verified that all taxes, fees and expenses have been paid, and the Commission is in
possession of the remaining funds.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that:
A. The remaining Fair Fund balance of $50,169.83, and any funds returned to the Fair
Fund in the future, shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury;

B. The Fund Administrator, Robert J. Keyes, is discharged; and
C. The Fair Fund is terminated.
By the Commission.
