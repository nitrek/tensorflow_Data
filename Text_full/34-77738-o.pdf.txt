SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
April 29, 2016

In the Matter of
Pioneer Exploration, Inc.,
Premier Brands, Inc., and
Private Media Group, Inc.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Pioneer Exploration, Inc.
(CIK No. 1364123), a revoked Nevada corporation with its principal place of business
listed as Newport Beach, California, with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink
Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the ticker symbol
PIEX, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended May 31, 2013.
On August 19, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation
Finance to Pioneer Exploration requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations,
but it did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address
on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation ST, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Premier Brands, Inc. (CIK
No. 1502777), a Wyoming corporation with its principal place of business listed as
Bonita, California, with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol BRND,
because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended May 31, 2013. On
August 19, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to
Premier Brands, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and
Premier Brands, Inc. received the delinquency letter on August 22, 2015, but failed to
cure its delinquencies.
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Private Media Group, Inc.
(CIK No. 1068084), a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business listed as
Barcelona, Spain, with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol PRVT,
because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended June 30, 2013. On
August 18, 2015, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation
Finance to Private Media Group, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing
obligations, but it did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a
valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of
Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed companies.

2

Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed companies is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on April 29, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 12, 2016.
