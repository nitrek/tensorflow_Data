The Division of Enforcement represents that Respondent DiTommaso was served with the OIP
on or about September 19, 2016. However, the USPS website shows the OIP mailing, Tracking
Number 7013 2630 2621 6867, as “currently in transit to the destination.” This falls short of
establishing a service date in compliance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(i).
