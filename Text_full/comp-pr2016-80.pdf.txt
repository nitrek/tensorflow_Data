Defendants.

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), for its Complaint
against defendants Richard St. Julien (“St. Julien”), Jared Mitchell (“Mitchell”), Christopher F.
Castaldo (“Castaldo”), Louis F. Petrossi (“Petrossi”), Herschel C. (a/k/a Tres) Knippa

Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 2 of 29 PageID #: 2

(“Knippa”), Richard L. Brown (“Brown”), Gerald J. (a/k/a Gerry) Cocuzzo (“Cocuzzo”), Naveed
A. (a/k/a Nick) Khan (“Khan”), Maroof Miyana (“Miyana”), and Pranav V. Patel (“Patel” and,
together with Brown, Cocuzzo, Khan, and Miyana, the “Registered Representative Defendants”)
(collectively, the “Defendants”), alleges as follows:
SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS
1.

This case concerns three schemes to defraud investors in ForceField Energy, Inc.

(f/k/a SunSi Energies, Inc.) (referred to hereinafter as “ForceField”), a public issuer and
Commission registrant whose common stock was traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market
(“NASDAQ”) from October 15, 2013 to April 20, 2015.
2.

All three schemes were orchestrated by ForceField’s ex-Chairman, defendant St.

Julien, with the other defendants serving as his accomplices for one or more of the schemes.
3.

In the first scheme, which took place between approximately October 2014 and

April 2015, St. Julien hired defendant Mitchell, a purported “investor relations” professional, to
pay cash kickbacks to the Registered Representative Defendants in return for their
recommending and purchasing ForceField stock in their customers’ accounts. The Registered
Representative Defendants, all of whom were registered with the Commission and associated
with registered broker-dealers, did not disclose to their customers that they were being paid these
cash kickbacks.
4.

In the second scheme, which took place between approximately June 2012 and

January 2014, St. Julien paid kickbacks to defendant Castaldo—a former registered
representative who was found liable by a jury in 2009 for violating the federal securities laws—
for the latter’s successful solicitation of investors to buy ForceField stock in their personal
brokerage accounts. Castaldo lured investors into investing in ForceField by first touting the

2


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 3 of 29 PageID #: 3

company in an investment newsletter he sells to investors under the name of Wall Street Buy Sell
Hold, Inc. (“WSBSH”). Although St. Julien paid Castaldo to tout ForceField in the WSBSH
newsletter, Castaldo did not accurately disclose in the newsletter the amount of compensation he
was being paid.
5.

Castaldo then solicited the investors who subscribed to the WSBSH newsletter to

buy ForceField stock in their personal brokerage accounts. Castaldo advised these investors on
the merits of investing in ForceField, but he did not disclose to them that St. Julien was paying
him kickbacks of approximately 10% of the dollar amount of stock the investors bought.
6.

In the third scheme, which took place between approximately December 2009 and

April 2015, St. Julien paid defendants Knippa and Petrossi, neither of whom was registered as a
broker with the Commission, kickbacks in exchange for their successfully soliciting investments
in ForceField’s private placements of common stock and warrants. Knippa and Petrossi solicited
investors at, among other places, investment conferences they attended with St. Julien. Knippa
and Petrossi advised potential investors on the merits of investing in ForceField, but they failed
to disclose to these investors that St. Julien was paying them kickbacks of 10% or more of the
dollar amount of stock and warrants that investors purchased. Knippa went so far as to tout
ForceField on the Fox Business Network’s “Varney & Co.” show as a purported market
commentator without disclosing to the host or the viewers that he was ForceField’s purported
head of investor relations and was soliciting investors in exchange for kickbacks he expected to
receive from St. Julien.
7.

In each of the three schemes, St. Julien and the other Defendants tried to conceal

their illegal conduct by, among other things, having St. Julien pay most of the kickbacks through
an offshore nominee he controlled. Mitchell and some of the Registered Representative

3


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 4 of 29 PageID #: 4

Defendants also sought to conceal their illegal conduct by communicating with each other on
prepaid, disposable (i.e., “drop” or “burner”) phones. Finally, St. Julien, Mitchell, and some of
the Registered Representative Defendants sought to conceal their illegal conduct by
communicating with each other using an encrypted, content-expiring messaging app on their
cellphones.

FACTS

25.

Over time, St. Julien took steps to get investors to buy shares of ForceField stock

through three separate but illegal schemes. The common thread through each of those schemes
was St. Julien’s payment of hidden kickbacks to the other Defendants.
I.	

The First Scheme to Defraud Investors: St. Julien and Mitchell Pay the Registered
Representative Defendants Undisclosed Kickbacks.
26.

In or about October 2014, St. Julien hired Mitchell, a purported investor relations

professional, to, among other things, pay the Registered Representative Defendants cash
kickbacks to induce them to recommend ForceField stock to their customers and to then buy
ForceField stock in those customers’ accounts.
27.

St. Julien and Mitchell agreed that St. Julien would pay Mitchell a kickback of

approximately 10% of the dollar amount of ForceField stock that the Registered Representative
Defendants purchased in their customers’ accounts. St. Julien and Mitchell further agreed that
Mitchell would split the kickbacks with the Registered Representative Defendants, paying them
approximately half of what St. Julien wired to him.
28.

St. Julien usually wired the kickbacks from an AOHC bank account he controlled

to an account that Mitchell controlled. At other times, St. Julien caused third parties to wire the
kickbacks to an account that Mitchell controlled.
29.

Mitchell tried to hide his payment of the kickbacks to the Registered

Representative Defendants by paying them by cash in person. Mitchell would withdraw the
kickback payments from his account in cash, arrange to meet with the Registered Representative
Defendants in person, and then hand them the cash payments.

10 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 11 of 29 PageID #: 11

30.

Mitchell referred to himself as St. Julien’s “brown bag man”—that is, Mitchell

was responsible for paying the Registered Representative Defendants their kickback payments in
cash and in person.
31.

Mitchell and some of the Registered Representative Defendants also tried to

conceal their illegal scheme by communicating with each other on prepaid, disposable (i.e.,
“drop” or “burner”) phones. Beginning in approximately December 2014, St. Julien, Mitchell,
and some of the Registered Representative Defendants further tried to conceal their illegal
scheme by communicating with each other using an encrypted, “content-expiring” messaging
application (or app) on their cellphones. This messaging app encrypts all communications
locally on each user’s cellphone, and allows the user to auto-delete a message after the expiration
of the user’s choice of a set period of time lasting seconds up to one day.
32.

Mitchell paid each of the Registered Representative Defendants as follows:
	

Brown: Between October 2014 and April 2015, Mitchell paid Brown at
least $30,000 in cash in exchange for Brown recommending and buying
more than 256,000 shares of ForceField stock in approximately 25
customers’ accounts at a cost of more than $1,735,000. At the time of St.
Julien’s arrest, Mitchell owed Brown approximately an additional $55,000.

	

Cocuzzo: Between January and April 2015, Mitchell paid Cocuzzo at least
$18,500 in cash in exchange for Cocuzzo recommending and buying more
than 65,000 shares of ForceField stock in approximately 13 customers’
accounts at a cost of more than $485,000. At the time of St. Julien’s arrest,
Mitchell owed Cocuzzo approximately an additional $15,000.

	

Khan: Between January and April 2015, Mitchell paid Khan at least
$49,000 in cash in exchange for Khan recommending and buying more than
69,000 shares of ForceField stock in more than 40 customers’ accounts at a
cost of more than $531,000. At the time of St. Julien’s arrest, Mitchell
owed Khan additional money for some of these purchases.

	

Miyana: Between March and April 2015, Mitchell paid Miyana at least
$2,800 in cash in exchange for Miyana recommending and buying more
than 30,000 shares of ForceField stock in approximately 20 customers’

11 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 12 of 29 PageID #: 12

accounts at a cost of more than $250,000. At the time of St. Julien’s arrest,
Mitchell owed Miyana additional money for some of these purchases.
	

33.

Patel: Between March and April 2015, Mitchell paid Patel at least $2,144
in cash in exchange for Patel recommending and buying more than 8,100
shares of ForceField stock in 5 customers’ accounts at a cost of more than
$62,855.

The Registered Representative Defendants did not disclose to their customers that

St. Julien and Mitchell were paying them cash kickbacks to recommend and buy ForceField
stock in their customers’ accounts.
II.	

The Second Scheme to Defraud Investors: St. Julien Pays Castaldo to Tout
ForceField Stock and Pays Him Undisclosed Commissions to Solicit Investors to
Purchase ForceField Stock in Their Brokerage Accounts.
A.	

Castaldo Touted ForceField Stock in the WSBSH Newsletters Without
Accurately Disclosing the Amount of Compensation St. Julien Was Paying
Him.

34.

Castaldo sells subscriptions to two investment newsletters he publishes: STP and

WSBSH.
35.

The STP newsletter recommends investing in certain mid- and large-cap stocks

identified by Castaldo or those working for him. Castaldo boasts in marketing materials about
his ability to pick winning stocks in the STP newsletter.
36.

The WSBSH newsletter recommends investing in certain microcap and small-cap

issuers that have paid Castaldo to tout their companies in WSBSH.
37.

Castaldo maintains an office for STP and WSBSH in Glenwood Landing, New

York, where he employs a staff that “cold calls” potential investors around the country to buy
subscriptions to STP and WSBSH. Castaldo generally identifies potential investors in “lead
lists” he buys from third parties.

12 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 13 of 29 PageID #: 13

38.

As a rule, when soliciting investors to buy subscriptions to the WSBSH

newsletter, Castaldo and his employees would not tell the investors that the companies touted in
that newsletter are paying Castaldo to tout them.
39.

Beginning in approximately May 2011, St. Julien, through ForceField, paid

Castaldo to tout the company in the WSBSH newsletter.
40.

From May 2011 through October 2011, this arrangement was governed by

monthly “Consulting Agreements” entered into between ForceField and WSBSH.
41.

The Consulting Agreements stated, among other things, that WSBSH was “in the

business of assisting public companies in strategic business planning, and investor and public
relations services designed to make the investing public knowledgeable about the benefits of
stock ownership in [ForceField].”
42.

The Consulting Agreements further stated that ForceField would pay WSBSH a

flat monthly fee in cash and stock, which, over this six-month period, ranged from $7,500 to
$17,500 in cash and 10,000 to 17,500 shares of ForceField stock per month.
43.

After October 2011, Castaldo continued to tout ForceField in WSBSH’s

newsletters. Upon information and belief, Castaldo’s touts after October 2011 were made
without any written contract in place between ForceField and WSBSH.
44.

The WSBSH newsletters that touted ForceField included a lengthy, small-print

disclaimer at the end of each document, which stated, among other things, that WSBSH had been
“paid an advertising fee” comprised of cash and ForceField stock. Every disclaimer, however,
inaccurately understated the amount of compensation that WSBSH had been paid.
45.

For example, a WSBSH newsletter that Castaldo published in February 2013

included a disclaimer stating the following: “Wall Street Buy Hold [sic] Sell Inc[.] was paid an

13 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 14 of 29 PageID #: 14

advertising fee of seven thousand five hundred dollars and ten thousand shares of restricted stock
of [ForceField].” In reality, by February 2013, St. Julien had paid WSBSH, through ForceField,
AOHC, and other third parties, approximately $241,000, not $7,500.
B.	

St. Julien Paid Castaldo Kickbacks to Solicit Investors’ Purchases of
ForceField Stock in Their Personal Brokerage Accounts.

46.

From approximately June 2012 to January 2014, St. Julien paid Castaldo

kickbacks for successfully soliciting investors to buy ForceField stock in their personal
brokerage accounts. These kickbacks were not disclosed to the investors.
47.

Castaldo and his employees solicited the same individuals to whom they had sold

(or tried to sell) subscriptions to the WSBSH newsletter to buy ForceField stock in their personal
brokerage accounts. In their phone solicitations, Castaldo and his employees described
ForceField’s business, touted ForceField’s purported successes, and advised potential investors
generally on the merits of investing in ForceField.
48.

Castaldo and his employees frequently prescribed for prospective investors the

number of shares of ForceField stock they should buy and at what price.
49.

After an investor had bought ForceField stock in his personal brokerage account,

Castaldo and his employees asked the investor to confirm the number of shares he had bought
and at what price, and then recorded that information in writing.
50.

Castaldo then communicated to St. Julien, often by email, the names of the

investors who had told Castaldo they had bought ForceField stock and the numbers of shares
they had claimed to buy.
51.

St. Julien then reconciled that information against beneficial stock ownership

information he obtained from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.

14 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 15 of 29 PageID #: 15

52.

After St. Julien confirmed the amount of stock Castaldo’s investors had bought,

he wired from the AOHC account to a WSBSH account that Castaldo controlled a kickback of
approximately 10% or more of the total dollar amount of stock bought by Castaldo’s investors.
53.

From approximately June 2012 to January 2014, Castaldo and his employees

solicited more than $600,000 in open market purchases of ForceField stock from more than 40
investors.
54.

In return, St. Julien paid Castaldo more than $183,000 in kickbacks and other

payments for soliciting these investments. During this same time period, St. Julien also caused
approximately 86,000 shares of ForceField stock to be issued to or transferred to WSBSH for
Castaldo’s benefit, which Castaldo subsequently sold, earning additional proceeds of more than
$229,000.
55.

Castaldo and his employees did not disclose to the investors they solicited to buy

ForceField stock that Castaldo was being paid or expected to be paid these kickbacks from St.
Julien.
III.	

The Third Scheme to Defraud Investors: St. Julien Pays Petrossi and Knippa
Kickbacks to Solicit Investors in ForceField’s Private Placements.
A.	

ForceField’s Private Placements

56.

Between approximately September 2009 and April 2015, ForceField conducted

private placements of common stock, warrants, debentures, and promissory notes that raised
more than $19.7 million from investors around the country.
57.

ForceField never filed a registration statement with the Commission in connection

with any of these securities offerings.
58.

While neither Knippa nor Petrossi was registered with the Commission in any

capacity between September 2009 and April 2015, they both solicited investors to invest in
15 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 16 of 29 PageID #: 16

ForceField’s private placements of common stock and warrants at various points during this time
period.
59.

Knippa and Petrossi solicited investors in the private placements through various

means, including at domestic and international investment conferences they attended with St.
Julien on behalf of ForceField. At those conferences, Knippa and Petrossi, alone and together
with St. Julien, would talk to prospective investors about ForceField’s business, tout
ForceField’s purported successes, and advise investors generally on the merits of investing in
ForceField stock.
60.

Knippa and Petrossi would continue to communicate with potential investors they

met at these investment conferences by phone and email after the conferences had ended. As
part of these conversations, they would advise the potential investors on the merits of investing
in ForceField, send them subscription agreements to buy ForceField securities, and return signed
subscription agreements to St. Julien. St. Julien would receive the subscription agreements on
ForceField’s behalf, and then ask ForceField’s transfer agent over phone and by email to issue
and mail stock certificates to the investors’ addresses.
61.

Knippa and Petrossi would also solicit potential investors outside of the investor

conferences. They would solicit individuals with whom they had other business relationships, or
to whom they had been referred by third parties, and advise those potential investors in phone
calls and through email on the merits of investing in ForceField.
62.

Knippa and Petrossi also facilitated their investors’ purchases of ForceField

securities by providing them with subscription agreements and payment instructions.

B.	

St. Julien Paid Petrossi Kickbacks to Solicit Investors in ForceField’s Private
Placements.

63.

From late 2009 through 2013, Petrossi attended numerous investment conferences

with St. Julien and presented to attendees on the merits of investing in ForceField’s private
placements. Petrossi conferred with St. Julien and other ForceField officers about the investment
pitch he would make, and Petrossi made edits and suggested changes to the presentation
materials that ForceField gave to investors at the conferences.
64.

Petrossi would hold himself out to the attendees at these presentations as a

purportedly independent investment professional appearing on behalf of his “Wealth Research
Institute” business. In his presentations, he frequently recommended that investors allocate 10%
of their portfolios to “private equity” or “pre-IPO” companies, and then recommended investing
in ForceField’s private placements as such a “private equity” investment.
65.

During his presentations and conversations with individual investors at

conferences and afterward, Petrossi made numerous material, but incomplete, statements of fact
about ForceField when soliciting investments. These statements included assertions about how
much ForceField stock management owned, how management had voluntarily agreed to lock up
their holdings, the amount of debt ForceField carried, and how the company had begun
generating significant revenues. In some emails with potential investors, Petrossi characterized
investing in ForceField as an “outstanding investment opportunity.”
66.

Between September 2010 and December 2012, Petrossi emailed prospective

investors, stating, among other things:
	 That an analyst had targeted a $5 stock price for the company by December
2012.

17 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 18 of 29 PageID #: 18

	 “I just visited both [ForceField] manufacturing facilities in Shandong
Province in China. [ForceField] is rapidly moving forward and I was 100%
satisfied with the trip.”
	 “[ForceField] will move to [the] American Stock Exchange [by the] end of
first quarter 2011.”
	 “I have visited the [ForceField] plants which are expanding and new
acquisitions are in process. Richard St. Julien is moving [the company] to
NASDAQ. We are trading around $4 a share which means you doubled your
money.”
	 “[ForceField] is moving to NASDAQ from OTC soon and the stock should be
trading around $10 when it comes time to sell.”
67.

Petrossi also made material, but incomplete, statements to investors about his own

purported investments in ForceField. In June 2012, Petrossi told one investor that “I can not
[sic] be bought” and that he “only recommend[s] companies that [he] invests in.”
68.

St. Julien and Petrossi agreed that St. Julien would pay Petrossi kickbacks

equaling approximately 10% of the gross proceeds of money invested by investors who Petrossi
had solicited to invest in ForceField’s private placements. Between approximately December
2009 and December 2013, Petrossi solicited more than $4.5 million from more than 60 investors
in ForceField’s private placements. As a result, St. Julien paid Petrossi kickbacks in cash and
ForceField stock worth more than $438,000.
69.

St. Julien wired the kickbacks from the AOHC account or other third-party

accounts to accounts that Petrossi controlled, including accounts in his name, his wife’s name,
and in the name of Chadwicke, Inc., a nominee that Petrossi controlled.
70.

Despite making various material statements of fact to investors about ForceField,

Petrossi did not disclose to the investors he solicited that St. Julien was paying him kickbacks of
roughly 10% of the amount of money Petrossi raised from them.

18 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 19 of 29 PageID #: 19

71.

In addition, Petrossi’s investors generally believed that their entire investment

was going to fund the company. These investors would not have purchased shares in the private
placements if they had known Petrossi was getting a 10% kickback.
C.	

St. Julien Paid Knippa Kickbacks to Solicit Investors in ForceField’s Private
Placements.

72.

In June 2014, St. Julien and Knippa began discussing St. Julien hiring Knippa to

solicit investors in ForceField’s private placements. For example, on June 17, 2014, Knippa told
St. Julien in a text message, “Hire me and put me on the road.” St. Julien asked, in response,
“Can you pitch ForceField to investors and brokers[?]” Knippa responded, “I can pitch it as
good as anyone in the world. . . . I want to be on the road.”
73.

Thereafter, St. Julien offered Knippa a position as ForceField’s head of investor

relations. St. Julien and Knippa agreed that Knippa would not be paid a salary; rather, St. Julien
would pay Knippa kickbacks of approximately 10% of the amounts of money he raised from
investors in the private placements.
74.

Knippa then began soliciting investors—both at investment conferences and

elsewhere—in the private placements without disclosing his employment relationship with
ForceField. For example, on or about July 10-11, 2014, Knippa attended an investment
conference with St. Julien in Las Vegas, at which Knippa solicited investors in ForceField’s
private placements.
75.

Knippa made material, but incomplete, statements of fact to potential investors

when soliciting their investments in ForceField’s private placements. For example, Knippa made
material statements about ForceField to one investor in early 2015 about ForceField’s operations,
contracts the company had purportedly entered into with states or municipalities, and that he

19 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 20 of 29 PageID #: 20

personally knew St. Julien. Knippa told another investor in early 2015 that he knew St. Julien
and believed in him.
76.

Although Knippa made material statements about ForceField when soliciting

investments, Knippa did not disclose that he was working for ForceField, that St. Julien had
offered him a position as ForceField’s head of investor relations, or that St. Julien had begun
paying him kickbacks in exchange for successfully soliciting investments in ForceField’s private
placements.
77.

From approximately July 2014 to March 2015, Knippa solicited more than $1.19

million from more than 10 investors in ForceField’s private placements. St. Julien wired Knippa
kickbacks equaling between 10 and 15% of the amounts of money Knippa had raised from
investors he solicited in the private placements. St. Julien wired those payments from the AOHC
account to accounts in Knippa’s name and the name of an entity he controlled, Kenai Capital
Management.
78.

Despite making various material statements of fact to investors about ForceField

when soliciting investments, Knippa did not disclose to the investors he solicited that St. Julien
was paying him kickbacks equaling 10% or more of the amounts of money Knippa raised.
79.

Knippa’s investors generally believed that their entire investment was going to

fund the company. These investors would not have purchased shares in the private placements if
they had known Knippa was getting a 10% to 15% kickback.
D.	

Knippa Touted ForceField on the Fox Business Network and the Business
News Network.

80.

On July 15, 2014, during a trip to New York with St. Julien to meet with

investment bankers regarding ForceField, Knippa appeared on Fox Business News’s “Varney &
Co.” show as a purported market commentator. The show airs each weekday from 9:00 a.m. to
20 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 21 of 29 PageID #: 21

12:00 p.m., Eastern Time. During his appearance, the show’s host, Stuart Varney, asked Knippa
for a stock pick. The following dialogue then took place between the two men:
Knippa: “I like to do my homework on individual companies. I
like ForceField Energy. . . . They’re very involved in . . .
converting to LED lighting for company[ies]. The business model
is good. I know the CEO. I’ve met him personally.”
Varney: “You own it? You own it?”
Knippa: “You bet I do. I put my money where my mouth is. I’m
a fund manager.”
Knippa: “The business model is very simple, and it’s making
money. This isn’t a development kind of thing.”
81.

Although Knippa made material statements about ForceField during this

appearance, Knippa did not disclose that he was working for ForceField, that St. Julien had
offered him a position as ForceField’s head of investor relations, that St. Julien and he had
agreed that St. Julien would pay him kickbacks for soliciting investments in ForceField’s private
placements, or that he had already begun soliciting investors at an investment conference just
days before in Las Vegas.
82.

On July 15, 2014, ForceField’s trading volume increased more than fourfold from

the day before, trading approximately 104,000 shares.
83.

On or about August 20, 2014, Knippa appeared on the Business News Network,

and again recommended investing in ForceField. The host and Knippa said the following:
Host: “Okay, Tres Knippa is owner of Kenai Capital Management.
He’s joining me through this show as guest co-host. Kind of
unusual for you to have a specific company on your radar because
you’re looking more at, sort of, trades of broader things,
21 


Case 1:16-cv-02193 Document 1 Filed 05/03/16 Page 22 of 29 PageID #: 22

commodities and so on, but ForceField Energy, a company that
you’re looking at.”
Knippa: “Nasdaq symbol FNRG is ForceField Energy. I like the
company because their business plan is very very simple. An LED
lightbulb uses half to 85% less energy than the normal
incandescent light. ForceField Energy will go to a company—
they’ve already done this; I’ll give you an example of a current
client of theirs, the Beverly Hills Hotel. . . . And then what they do
is, is they share in the cost savings. . . . ForceField Energy shares
in that cost savings for five years.”
84.

Knippa went on to tout ForceField, citing the company’s purported business

model and future growth. Knippa again failed to disclose that he was working for ForceField,
was soliciting investors to invest in ForceField’s private placements, and by that time had
already been paid two kickbacks by St. Julien through AOHC—one wire on or about July 31,
2014, of $8,000 and a second wire on or about August 13, 2014, of $10,000.
