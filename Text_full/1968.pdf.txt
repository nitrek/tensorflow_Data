to the Commission, having become a partner of the firm in 1963. During this period he was engaged in the general practice of law, specializing in corporate finance and securities work. Commissioner
Smith was active in bar association work, having served as a member,
secretary and then Chairman (1963-66) of the Committee on Aeronautics of The Association of the Bar of the City of New York and
during 1962-64 as a member of the Committee on State Legislation
of the New York State Bar Association. He is also a member of the
American Bar Association. In 1961-62 he acted as counsel to a Commission of Inquiry into labor questions in the thoroughbred racing
industry, appointed by the Governor of the State of New York. He
was president of the University of Pennsylvania Law Alumni Association of N ew York City during 1965-67 and serves as a member of
the Board of Managers of the Alumni Society of the University of
Pennsylvania Law School. He took office as a member of the Commission on May 1,1967, for the term expiring June 5,1967, and was
reappointed to a 5-year term ending June 5, 1972.

FOREWORD
The Securities and Exchange Commission is a relatively small
agency which occupies a central role in a vital, delicate, and rapidly
changing aspect of the national economy-the financing of American
industry and the provision of necessary safeguards to the millions
of investors who, directly or indirectly, entrust their savings to the
securities markets.
Our securities markets are growing and changing at an unprecedented rate. There are now more than 24 million direct stockholders;
a substantial portion of the share volume in the trading markets is
the result of transactions by large financial institutions which manage
the pooled savings of mutual fund holders, pension fund beneficiaries
and life insurance policy holders. These indirect investors are estimated to number in excess of one hundred million. This growth of
institutional investment has created some strain on the securities markets and raises important policy questions which require resolution.
The combination of broad individual participation and increasing
institutional activity has brought about unprecedented volumes of
trading. The average daily dollar value of securities traded on all markets is over $825 million and the average daily exchange volume of
trading is over 22 million shares. Thus the markets and the regulatorsFederal, State, and self regulators-are
confronted not only with the
problems of adjusting to what has sometimes been described as the
"institutionalization of the markets"; they are also and at the same
time confronted with, and almost overwhelmed by, the sheer volume
of activity.
There are a number of aspects of institutionalization that deserve
comment.
First, institutionalization of investment, in our present economy,
contemplates that public savings will flow, in an accelerated fashion,
into pooled and professionally managed accounts with emphasis on
equity rather than debt holdings. Investment decisions, under such
circumstances, tend to become more homogenous, largely because they
reflect the decisions of a relatively few sophisticated managers. Such
a development would require sophisticated and new market techniques
to absorb potential investment imbalances in the equity markets.
Second, increased participation by institutions in the trading markets, both in absolute and relative terms, affects the allocation of public
savings as between the securities markets and other channels of investXVII

327-506--68----2

FOREWORD

ment such as mortgages, other traditional forms of saving and land,
and in view of the increasing institutional interest in stocks, as between
the bond and equity markets.
Third, institutionalization contemplates that financial managers will
compete with the classic securities brokers in merchandising a financial product with potential for capital appreciation. Banks, insurance
companies and other companies have already begun to form financial
conglomerates for the purpose of offering traditional and novel vehicles for public participation in the equity markets. The distributing
and merchandising processes of enterprises with business techniques
developed outside the traditional securities brokerage business, can be
expected to lead to new merchandising methods in the distribution of
new equity oriented products to the public.
Fourth, institutional investors are staffed by professional investment managers. They avidly seek out and analyze all available information with respect to companies in which they may have or contemplate an investment interest. More intelligent investment decisions
may result, but it also becomes more difficult, particularly in view of
the financial power of these institutions, for the individual investor
to gain equivalent access to relevant information for his investment
decisions.
Fifth, in the past, the significant institutional investors-mutual
funds, bank trust departments, pension funds and others-tended
to be,
on the whole, conservative, investing for the long term. The last few
years, however, have seen the emergence of what has sometimes been
called the "cult of performance" in which attention has been focused on
those who showed the greatest gains in the previous year or even the
previous 6 months, with the result that more and more of these institutions, and particularly certain mutual funds, have actively and avowedly become short-term traders who act not only with speed but in volume, again throwing a strain on the mechanisms of the market.
Sixth, institutionalization
of markets reflects a growing concentration of economic and financial power.
The growth of institutional and individual participation in the
equities markets referred to is a reflection of an affluent society which
has seen tremendous economic growth. It is also a result of an inflationary tendency in the postwar years. These have led the public to
seek greater participation in that growth and some protection from
inflation directly or indirectly through investment in equities rather
than concentrating on fixed-income securities and other forms of savings. In sum, the stock markets, both on the exchanges and in over-thecounter markets, have become a more important part of the national
economy than they ever have been before.
The Commission has made and is continuing to make major efforts

FOREWORD

XIX

to cope with the increased responsibilities these developments have
thrown upon it.
Commencing in 1961 and ending in 1963, the Commission, pursuant
to Congressional direction, made what is known as the "Special Study
of the Securities Markets," the most exhaustive analysis of all phases
of these markets since the Congressional investigations of the Thirties
which led to the enactment of the securities laws. The explosive growth
of mutual funds received attention in The "Wharton School Study of
Mutual Funds, initiated by the Commission in 1958 and completed in
1962, and in the Commission's own report of the Public Policy Implications of Investment Company Growth, sent to Congress in 1966.
Many of the Special Study's recommendations have been implemented, most notably through the Securities Acts Amendments of
1964, which extended the significant investor protections of the Securities Exchange Act to major segments of the over-the-counter market and provided procedures, both for upgrading training methods and
requirements and raising standards of those engaged in the securities
business. It also provided a more effective disciplinary scheme.
The Commission is presently engaged in the first thorough inquiry it
has made into the rules, policies, practices and procedures of the exchanges respecting the commission rate structure. This inquiry is
bringing together the knowledge and experience of many individuals
and firms and will add substantially to the foundation provided by
prior studies made by the Commission and by industry. Automation
is on the threshold of revolutionizing the system of quotations for
unlisted securities.
The Commission's work has also been aided by the use of a computer
which makes possible the assembly and analysis of more comprehensive
data than was possible before. It will also provide far more data concerning the operations of investment companies. Within the relatively
near future much more will be known about the economics of the securities business. This information will be of great value not only for
the Commission and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities,
but also for those actively engaged in the industry itself.
In many areas we have not passed beyond mere identification of
some of the changes in the markets, which both cause and result from
the developments mentioned. The Commission expects that the "insti.
tutional study," concerning which more will be said later in this report,
will provide the vehicle for development of the relevant facts and the
identification of trends and possible problem areas. Upon its completion, the Commission would submit a report to the Congress.
In summary, recent years have witnessed dramatic and significant
changes of the securities markets which will put additional strains
on the Commission and self-regulatory organizations in their efforts to

xx

FOREWORD

fulfill the three principal mandates of the Congress: full and fair
disclosure, maintenance of fair and orderly securities markets, and the
detection and prevention of fraud. With respect to the latter mandate
the securities markets have always been a fertile :field for the unscrupulous. Constant vigilance and vigorous enforcement is necessary
to rid the markets of those whose activities cast discredit upon all,
and provide a form of competition which is unfair to the great majority
who wish to conduct their business on the highest possible plane.
Despite these developments and emerging problems, the regulatory
scheme in the United States is considered to be one of the most effective
in the world. It is being studied and drawn upon in many foreign
countries, most notably and most recently in Canada and in France.
There remains, however, room for improvement. The Commission has
directed studies of certain areas of its operations to determine whether
improvements can be achieved. Thus, the disclosure requirements under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are under intense study to determine the extent to which they can be made simpler, more effective and
more economical to administer. The task grows more difficult as technology advances, patterns of corporate growth and :financing become
increasingly more complex and the number of publicly held businesses
increases. These developments make more urgent the Commission's need
for sufficient manpower and other resources to fulfill adequately its
responsibilities under the statutes entrusted to its administration.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Structure and Level of Commission Rates

The setting of commission rates for exchange transactions is perhaps the most important area in which exchanges have been permitted
to establish rules of practice governing their membership. Under Section 19 (b) of the Exchange Act, the Commission is responsible, however, for determining the reasonableness of commission rates set by
the exchanges, and it may after notice and opportunity for hearing
order an adjustment of such rates. In May 1968, the Commission, after
considerable study and discussion with various elements of the industry, for the first time took the initiative with respect to the adjustment of commission rates. In simultaneous actions, it directed the New
York Stock Exchange to adopt an interim rate structure incorporating
a volume discount or, in the alternative, to eliminate fixed rates of
commission for large transactions, and initiated public hearings to
consider fully what long-term changes are required in the rate structure and related matters.
Since formation of the New York Stock Exchange in 1792, the
commission rate schedule has been adjusted on several occasions, most
recently in 1959. Each change had been on the initiative of the Exchange and primarily involved an increase in the level of rates. These
increases were justified by the Exchange on the ground that increased
costs were not sufficiently offset by increases in trading volume. Since
the New York Stock Exchange commission schedule has served as the
model for all other exchanges, each increase or adjustment in level
and structure of the New York Stock Exchange's rates brought with it
a concurrent adjustment in the rates of the other exchanges.
It should be recalled that until the past several years, the exchanges
were essentially markets for the relatively small transactions of
thousands of individual investors and for smaller institutional transactions. As indicated in the Foreword, the mix of transactions on the
exchange markets has been changing so that now a substantial percentage of trading is that of institutions effecting large transactions.
Until the recent interim changes, rates of commission were computed exclusively on the amount of money involved in each round-lot
transaction, a round lot usually being 100 shares. There was no discount based on the size or volume of a transaction or on the amount
!I.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of business done by an institutional or other investor over a period of
time. Accordingly, the commission for a 10,000-share transaction was
100 times that for a 100-share transaction.'
Beginning in July 1968, the Commission conducted an extensive
public investigatory hearing to determine whether any changes should
be made in the rules, policies, practices and procedures of registered
national securities exchanges respecting commission rate schedules and
related matters. The hearing has been evidentiary in nature and constitutes a broad-range factual inquiry into such matters as: (1) commission rate levels for nonmembers and for members (including intramember rates); (2) the services for which commission rates pay and
the costs allocated thereto; (3) give-ups and reciprocal practices among
different categories of members and nonmembers; (4) membership
for financial institutions on exchanges; (5) economic access to exchange markets by nonmember broker-dealers; (6) competition among
exchanges and other markets; and (7) access of exchange members to
the third market. Interested persons were invited to come forward with
evidentiary facts for inclusion in the record and, in the discretion of
the hearing officer, to testify in the proceeding.
Pending the development of long-term solutions to the various problems under consideration in the public hearings, the Commission in
September 1968 accepted a proposal of the N ew York Stock Exchange
providing for an interim reduction in minimum commissions on larger
trades. Also under this proposal, the customer-directed "give-up"
would be prohibited and minimum intramember rates reduced. Estimates furnished the Commission indicate that these interim changes
will result in a total reduction of commission charges of $150 million
a year, or approximately 7 percent of last year's total charges. On a
daily basis, the reduced rate will result in savings of at least $600,000
of commissions each trading day," The American Stock Exchange approved similar interim changes, and the regional exchanges are
expected to make comparable rate adjustments.
1 IDstorically
there have been three ditrerent methods employed in computing
commission rates for exchange transactions. From 1792 to 1919, the base was a
fiat rate on par value; from 1919 to 1947 it was a sIlding scale per share charge
on share value; and since 1947 it has been a sliding scale based on round lot

value,
• In 1966, the New York Stock Exchange (and subsequently the other exchanges), at the request of the Commission, had modified the so-called odd-lot
differential appllcable to purchases or sales of less than a round lot (generally
100 shares). The modification involved an increase in the "break point" at which
a higher ditrerential becomes payable. As a result of this change, estimated
savings of more than $6 million were provided to investors in calendar year 1967
with respect to transactions executed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors

As noted previously, in recent years there has been accelerated
activity in all phases of the securities markets, the most noticeable
aspects of which are the surge in volume of securities traded and the
number of public investors, and the pervasive participation of institutional investors in the securities markets. The average daily volume of
securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange has increased, for
example, from less than 5 million shares in 1963 to over 12 million
shares through mid-1968. The value of stock traded on all registered
securities exchanges has increased from about $64 billion in 1963 to
$162 billion in 1967. It is estimated that the number of individual stockholders in United States industry has grown from 17 million in 1962
to approximately 24 million at the present time, despite the fact that
during this period individuals were net sellers (and institutions net
buyers) of corporate securities.
Millions of investors now participate in equity securities holdings
through their interests in investment companies, pension funds, and
other institutions. From 1957 to 1967, the total value of stock held by
the major financial institutions rose from $29112 billion to more than
$1311!zbillion," All indications are that the accelerated flow of savings
into equity-oriented institutions will continue. Recent projections of
private pension fund assets, for example, point to a doubling in this
segment alone within the next 10 years.
In addition to the sharp growth of institutional shareholdings, there
has been a dramatic increase in trading by institutions in the securities
markets. Turnover rates of investment companies and pension funds-perhaps the two most important institutional groups-are much higher
than they were only 10 years ago. Investment companies turned over on
the average almost 40 percent of their stock portfolios in 1967 compared with only a 14 percent rate in 1957. The average turnover rate
of private noninsured pension funds rose from less than 4 percent to
over 11 percent in the same period. Transactions by institutions have
been estimated to account for approximately 50 percent of present
nonmember volume on the NYSE.
The combination of rapid growth and increased trading by institutions has placed strains on the traditional market mechanisms which
were developed primarily to serve relatively small transactions by individual investors.
Another recent development is the increasingly active role which
institutional investors are assuming in relation to their portfolio com• These 1Ignres do not cover personal trust funds, common trust funds, foundations and college endowment funds as to which complete statistics are not

panies. Historically most institutions, especially mutual funds, even
where they were the largest single shareholders, chose not to exercise
their power over the management of portfolio companies. If they became disenchanted with management they were likely to liquidate
their holdings rather than seek to effect changes. Recently, however, the
Commission has noted instances where institutions have taken a more
active part in the management of portfolio companies and have played
an active role in acquisitions, proxy fights, etc.
In view of the recent developments, a better understanding is urgently needed both of the impact of institutional investors on the
securities markets and portfolio companies and of the ability of the
securities markets to adapt to institutional needs. Under a resolution
of Congress signed into law on July 29, 1968,' the Commission has been
authorized to undertake a comprehensive study of these matters. In
November 1968, the Commission announced the designation of Professor Donald E. Farrar to direct the study.
Mutual Fund Legislation

The 33rd Annual Report 5 outlined the background and substance
of the amendments to the Investment Company Act of 1940 which
the Commission had proposed in May 1967. These proposals and the
studies which preceded them were made pursuant to Section 14(b)
of that Act which authorizes the Commission, if it believes that "any
substantial further increase in the size of investment companies
creates any problem involving the protection of investors or the public
interest," to make a study and investigation and to report the results
and its recommendations to the Congress. The Commission's legislative proposals were designed principally to reduce sales loads imposed on the acquisition of fund shares where these loads are excessive, to eliminate the so-called "front-end load," and to provide a
means to test the fairness of management fees. They also dealt, however, with a number of other areas as to which the Commission believed legislative action was required.
The Commission's proposals represented 10 years of effort by and
on behalf of the Commission. In December 1966, the Commission
had submitted its report, entitled "Public Policy Implications of
Investment Company Growth," to the Congress. Two other reports
which analyzed various problems associated with the investment
company industry and its growth-the Wharton Report, commenced
in 1958 and submitted to Congress in August 1962, and the Report of
the Special Study of Securities Markets, published in 1963-1964-had
preceded the Commission's Report.

Hearings were conducted before the Senate Committee on Banking
and Currency during July and August 1967 and before the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives during October
1967 and March 1968. The Senate Committee reported a bill on
July 1, 1968, which was passed by the Senate on July 26, 1968.6 However, on September 10, 1968, the Subcommittee on Commerce and
Finance of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce
voted not to give further consideration to the bill.
In proposing mutual fund legislation, the Commission recognized
that most of the specific abuses aimed at in the Investment Company
Act of 1940have been substantially eliminated; however, the dramatic
growth of the industry and accompanying changes have created new
situations which were not anticipated in 1940. While many of the
changes proposed by the Commission were accepted or even welcomed
by the industry, the industry took exception to the principal recommendations of the Commission. The Senate Bill modified those recommendations as follows:
In the area of sales charges, the Commission proposed that a 5 percent
ceiling be placed on the charge for mutual fund sales subject to a
power in the Commission to approve appropriate higher ceilings. The
bill as passed by the Senate gave authority to the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc., a self-regulatory organization of brokers
and dealers, to fix reasonable sales charges, subject to Commission
oversight.
The Commission had recommended the abolition of the front-end
load in contractual plans, under which as much as 50 percent of the
payments made by the investor during the first year may be deducted
for sales charges, so as to require that the sales load be spread equally
over all payments during the life of the plan. The Senate, however,
arrived at a formula whereby the load would not exceed 20 percent
in anyone year nor average more than 16 percent over the first 4
years.
Finally, the Commission had recommended that the Act provide
expressly that compensation received by investment advisers shall be
"reasonable" and that there be opportunity for judicial enforcement of
this standard. The Commission was of the view that because of the
fiduciary relationship existing between an investment company and
its manager the compensation received by the manager should be
reasonable and that the Federal courts would provide an appropriate
forum in which the reasonableness of the management fee could be
tested.

The bill as passed by the Senate provided that a determination by
the directors with respect to compensation of or payments to certain
affiliated persons was to be given "substantial weight" and shareholder
approval was to be given such weight as was deemed appropriate in
the circumstances. The Senate version also provided that any compensation or payments received by the investment adviser shall be presumed reasonable if approved or ratified by a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the company and a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the company. The presumption
could be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The Senate
bill also included a provision permitting a shareholders' suit to enforce
the standard of reasonableness in the Federal courts if the Commission
refused or failed to bring such suit within 6 months after request by a
shareholder.
The Commission believes that its legislative proposals were responsive to the problems which it had found to exist, and it is hoped that
legislation along the lines of those proposals will in the near future
receive favorable consideration by the Congress.
The Texas Gulf Sulphur and Merrill Lynch Decisions

Shortly after the end of the fiscal year, a landmark decision relating
to the issues of insiders' securities transactions based on undisclosed
inside information and of corporate publicity was handed down by
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, sitting en bane, in S.E.O.
v. Te3KUJ Gulf Sulphur
00/ The Commission had filed its complaint in
this case in 1965, charging violations of Section 10 (b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 under that Act through stock
purchases by insiders and through misleading corporate publicity.
Briefly, it was alleged that certain insiders had purchased shares of
Texas Gulf stock or calls thereon on the basis of material inside information concerning the results of exploratory drilling for base metals
by Texas Gulf near Timmins, Ontario; had passed this information to
others and advised them to purchase Texas Gulf stock or calls; and
had accepted stock options from Texas Gulf without disclosing material information to the board of directors. It was also alleged that
the company issued a deceptive press release. Previous annual reports 8
have discussed the institution of this action and the opinion of the
district court 9 dismissing the complaint against the corporation and
10 individual defendants but finding violations by 2 other individual
defendants. On August 13, 1968, the court of appeals handed down
its decision affirming unanimously the decision below insofar as it had

been favorable to the Commission and reversing (7-2 on most issues)
that decision in every major respect in which it had been unfavorable to
the Commission.
The court unanimously held that a corporate insider in possession
of important inside information about his corporation may not trade
in the corporation's stock without disclosing that information, even
though his transactions are not face-to-face 'but on a national securities exchange. This duty was unanimously held to apply to employees
of the corporation, as well as to its top officers. The court also held
unanimously that insiders may not pass such inside information to
others for their use in securities transactions; the majority included
recommendations on the basis of important inside information within
this prohibition.
The court also held that there is a similar duty of disclosure to
those responsible for the granting of stock options to company officials
as additional compensation. If important information is not known
to the directors of the company who grant the options but is known
to the recipients, it must be disclosed to the directors. In this case the
majority required such disclosure before acceptance of the options
but suggested that disclosure before exercise of the options might
be sufficient in some situations. The Commission had conceded on appeal that the duty of disclosure is limited to members of top management in this context, and the majority therefore did not decide whether
any other corporate personnel were subject to a similar duty.
Since the duty of disclosure and the prohibition against tips apply
only to material inside information, it was necessary for the court to
define these two terms. In applying the traditional standard of materiality-whether
a reasonable investor would attach importance to the
information in making his investment decision-the
majority held
that the interests of all persons in the securities markets, speculative
investors and conservative investors alike, must be considered. When
the particular information consists of indications of a possible future
event, the court called for a balancing of the indicated probability
that the event would occur and its likely importance as measured
against all of the corporation's activities. On this issue the majority
held that a major facton in determining the materiality of any particular information is the importance attached to it 'by those who knew
about it, as indicated by the pattern of their own securities transactions.
Inside information is that which is not already available to the
public. In determining what is necessary to make previously undisclosed information sufficiently available for insiders to trade, the court
unanimously held that the mere giving of the information to reporters
is not enough. Trading prior to the appearance of the information on
the Dow Jones broad tape was held to be a violation. The majority

8

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

stated that in some cases even this degree of disclosure might not be
sufficient, although it suggested that further clarification by Commission rule would be appropriate.
The court held that a corporate press release likely to affect the
market for its securities is subject to Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5,
irrespective of the absence of any securities transactions by the corporation or its insiders and irrespective of the absence of any motive to
affect the market for their benefit. Those provisions are violated if
the release is materially deceptive in the light of the facts existing at
the time of the release, unless the corporation had exercised due diligence in ascertaining the facts and had accurately stated what it knew.
The majority held that in determining whether a corporate press release is deceptive the proper test is whether a reasonable investor exercising due care would have been misled by it.
The court remanded the case to the trial court for further findings
with respect to the press release in question and for a determination
of the remedies to which the Commission is entitled.
In a recent decision also dealing with the improper use of inside
information, the Commission, pursuant to an offer of settlement, imposed sanctions on the broker-dealer firm of Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith, Inc. and certain persons associated with it for violations of anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws or failure to
exercise proper supervision to avoid such violations. 10
The violations involved the disclosure in June 1966 to certain of the
firm's institutional and other large customers of nonpublic information reflecting a "significant deterioration" in the earnings of Douglas
Aircraft Co., Inc., and the resulting sales or short sales by such customers of more than 190,000 shares of Douglas stock prior to public
disclosure of the information and without any disclosure being made to
the purchasers. While this adverse information was being disclosed to
various large customers, the firm did not reveal it to other customers
for whom it effected purchases of Douglas stock during the period in
question. The respondents consented to the findings of violations and
to the imposition of sanctions, but without admitting the allegations
of the order for proceedings.
Citing the Commission's 1961 decision in Oady, Roberts &: 00.,11 and
the Teeas Gulf Suiphu» decision, the Commission observed that the
principles in those decisions "prohibited the disclosure [of the downturn in Douglas' earnings] by registrant to favored customers who
might sell their holdings or sell short before appropriate public disclosure and thereby take advantage of the current market price before
the expectable decline in such price upon public dissemination of the

Exchange Act Release No. 8459 (November 25,1968).

information. And, aggravating the inherent unfairness of the disclosure to certain customers was the fact that, at the same time, registrant was effecting purchases of the stock for other customers to
whom the adverse information was not available."
According to the Commission's decision, "The information Douglas
entrusted to registrant was of such importance that it could be expected
to affect the judgment of investors whether to buy, sell, or hold Douglas
stock. If generaIIy known, such information could be expected to affect
materially the market price of the stock. The advance disclosure of
such information to a select group who could utilize it for their own
benefit, and to the detriment of public investors to whom the information was not known, constituted an act, practice, or course of business
which operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon such
investors. "
Upon the basis of these findings pursuant to the settlement offer,
the Commission ordered that Merrill Lynch's New York Institutional
Sales Office and its West Coast Underwriting Office be suspended for
21 and 15 days, respectively. Ten individual respondents were censured; in addition, one was dissociated from Merrill Lynch for 60 days
and six others for~1 days.
In determining to accept the offer of settlement, the Commission
considered the fact that none of the respondents had previously been
the subject of disciplinary action as well as Merrill Lynch's undertaking to adopt, implement and ensure compliance with, revised procedures to provide more effective protection against disclosure of confidential information, including but not limited to the procedures set
forth in a Statement of Policy which was incorporated in the offer of
settlement. The Commission stated that as a matter of policy, it did
not, "and indeed cannot, determine in advance that the Statement of
Policy will prove adequate in all circumstances that may arise," and it
stressed the need for "stringent measures" to avoid future violations.
The decision observed that "obviously the prompt public dissemination of material information would ,be an effective preventive," and
noted registrant's undertaking to use its best efforts to secure the public
release of any material information given to its Underwriting
Division.
The Takeover Bid

am

On July 29, 1968, President Johnson signed the "Takeover Bid
BiII," 12 which is designed to close gaps in the full disclosure provisions
of the securities laws.
In recent years, acquiring control of publicly held corporations
through cash tender offers and purchases of blocks of securities, as op12

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

posed to proxy contests, has gained favor. When control is sought
through the proxy contest, the Exchange Act and its proxy rules require disclosure to be made to shareholders concerning the identity of
the participants in the contest, their associates, the shareholdings of
these persons, and other relevant information. This information is
subject to statutory sanctions and must also be filed with the Commission. Similarly, when control is sought through a stock-for-stock
exchange, the offering must be registered under the Securities Act of
1933, and shareholders must be given a prospectus setting forth all
material facts. Until July 1968, however, there were no comparable disclosure requirements which applied to a cash tender offer or stock
acquisitions which may cause a change in control.
The takeover bid bill was designed to put cash tender offers and
other block acquisitions on the same footing as proxy contests for
control. It was not intended either to encourage or discourage such
offers or acquisitions, nor was it intended to give an advantage either
to management or the outside group.
The bill, which amended Sections 13 and 14 of the Exchange Act,
grants the Commission rulemaking authority to require disclosure of
pertinent information concerning stock acquisitions or proposed
acquisitions in three contexts: (1) the making of a cash tender offer
which, if successful, would result in the person or group making the
offer owning more than 10 percent of any class of equity security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Act or issued by a closed-end investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940; (2) acquisitions by any person or group of any such class of
equity security which would result in the ownership by such person
or group of more than 10 percent of any such class of security; and
(3) the purchase by a corporation of its outstanding equity securities.
The bill also provides that if a majority of the directors are to be
replaced in connection with an acquisition or tender offer, shareholders
must be provided with information comparable to that required by the
proxy rules in connection with an election of directors.v The bill also
authorizes the Commission to adopt rules with respect to solicitations
or recommendations to accept or reject tender offers and provides for
certain protections for persons who have tendered shares.
On July 30, 1968, the day after the bill became law, the Commission
adopted temporary rules and regulations to make its provisions
operative," and on August 30, 1968, certain amendments to these rules
were adopted." These temporary rules represent an important step
in the development of regulations to accomplish the full purpose of

the legislation. On August 30, 1968, the Commission also published
notice of the proposed adoption of a new rule 10b-13 and invited
comments thereon." New section 14(d) (7) of the Exchange Act
provides, in substance, that where the terms of a tender offer are varied
before its expiration by increasing the consideration offered to securityholders, all securities purchased pursuant to the tender offer must be
purchased at the higher price, whether or not they were tendered
before the increase was announced. Proposed Rule 10b-13 would
extend this principle of affording equal treatment to all securityholders who sell their securities to a person making a tender offer
during the period of such offer, whether or not the sales are made
pursuant to the tender offer.
When the Senate Banking and Currency Committee was considering the legislation, it referred to an abuse which had occurred in connection with tender offers, known as "short tendering," but expressed
the view that the Commission had adequate power to deal with the
problem under the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act. "Short
tendering" grew out of the fact that in connection with a tender offer
or a request or invitation for tenders of a particular security, it is
customarily provided that the security need not be deposited if a bank
or a member firm of a national securities exchange guarantees delivery.
Abuses in this practice arose in situations in which tenders were to be
accepted on a pro rata basis. It was learned that some brokers tendered
a greater number of units than were owned by them or by the customers on whose behalf the tender was made, with the result that a
disproportionately large number of their securities was accepted. To
deal with this practice, the Commission in :May 1968 adopted Rule
10b-4 which, in substance, prohibits a person from tendering any
security for his own account unless he owns the security and from
tendering or guaranteeing tender of a security on behalf of another
person unless the security is in his possession or he has reason to believe
that the other person owns the tendered security."
Exp~tingofRe~kationS~temenb

The Commission recently adopted new procedures in an effort to
cope with the problems resulting from the enormous increase in the
number of registration statements filed under the Securities Act of
1933.Inthe 1968 fiscal year, 2,473 registration statements were filed for
processing by the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance, as
compared to 1,543 in 1967. For the first quarter of fiscal 1969, 840
registration statements were filed as compared to 507 for the like
period in 1968. There has also been a substantial increase in the
number of registration statements filed by issuers which never before

COMMISSION

have been subjected to the registration process. Further, the number
of definitive proxy statements filed with the Commission has increased
from 2,661 in fiscal year 1964 to 5,244 in fiscal 1968. The backlog of
registration statements to be processed by the staff of the Division
of Corporation Finance has reached unprecedented proportions
because of the enormous increase in the number of filings, accompanied
at the same time by a reduction of personnel in the Division due to
budgetary cuts.
Accordingly, in November 1968 the Commission adopted an
expedited review procedure that is designed to reduce the backlog
without sacrificing the statutory standards of disclosure. Under this
procedure, a Division officermakes a cursory review of every registration statement as it is filed. Based on this review he determines (1)
that the statement is so deficient that it does not warrant further
review; (2) that only a cursory review will be made and that, upon
receipt of certain supplemental information, the staff will recommend
clearance; or (3) that the filing should be subject to the regular review
process.
With respect to categories (1) and (2), counsel for the company is
advised that the statutory burden of full disclosure is on the issuer, its
affiliates, the underwriter and experts, that as a matter of law this
burden cannot be shifted to the staff, and that the current work load is
such that the staff cannot undertake additional review and comment.
Disclosure Study

Throughout its history, the Commission has reviewed its practices,
procedures, and forms in the disclosure field in an effort to improve
disclosures and, at the same time, eliminate unnecessary requirements
where possible.
Inlate 1967 the Commission decided to supplement its usual review
of special problems in the disclosure field with a broad internal study
of the disclosure process." Among the factors which seemed to make
such a study appropriate were the following:
(1) the need for an overall review of the actual workings of the
disclosure provisions of the Securities Act of 1933;
(2) the substantial expansion in the number of issuers subject to
the continuing disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Aot
of 1934 as a result of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964. Because
of this expanded coverage, the potential effectiveness of the Exchange
Act as a disclosure tool is far greater than it used to 'be;
(3) the dramatio increase in the number of investors, many of them
new to the securities markets;
(4) the marked trend toward a professionalization of security
analysis; and
a See Securities Act Release No. 4885 (Nov. 29, 1967).

(5) technological developments which make it possible to put the
information in the Commission's files into the hands of the financial
community more cheaply and more expeditiously than was previously
the case.
Since the end of 1967, a group drawn from the Commission's
operating divisions and directed by Commissioner Francis :M:. Wheat
has been delving into almost every aspect of disclosure under the
Federal securities statutes. The Study Group has met and worked
closely with many in the financial community, in industry, in the legal
and accounting professions, and in academic life who are interested in,
knowledgeable about, or affected by the disclosure provisions of the
securities laws.
After the Study Group completes its examination of the field, it will
report to the full Commission. The Commission will then evaluate
the report and take such administrative action as it considers advisable. The Commission and the members of the Study Group hope
that the work of the group and of those outside the Commission who
have collaborated with it will in due time make for noteworthy improvements in the disclosure process, in investor protection, and in the
efficiency of the capital markets,
Additional Financial

Disclosure by Diversified

Companies

The increase in business acquisitions and mergers in recent years
has caused the Commission to consider the need for more detailed
reporting on the disparate operations of registrants which are broadly diversified and to study the problems involved in any extension of
the requirements in this area of financial reporting. Staff surveys
have indicated that there has been an increase in voluntary disclosures
by diversified companies in recent annual reports to stockholders.
During the 1968 fiscal year important studies by professional organizations and by individuals on the topic of financial reporting by diversified companies were completed. The Commission had authorized the
Chief Accountant to serve on an Advisory Committee, representing
various sectors of the accounting, financial and industrial communities, in connection with the comprehensive study and survey conducted
under the sponsorship of the Financial Executives Institute.
The studies and surveys indicated that an extension of the Commission's requirements was feasible. As a result, the staff undertook
to develop amendments of the rules to elicit additional information
from all companies affected which will be meaningful to investors but
not unduly burdensome to the registrants. In September 1968, a proposal to revise the disclosure requirements under three Securities Act
registration forms was issued for public comment,"

Under the proposed revisions registrants would be required to
state, for each of the 5 fiscal years preceding the filing of a registration statement, the approximate amount or percentage of sales or operating revenues and contribution to net income attributable to each
class of related or similar products or services, which contributed 10
percent or more to total sales and operating revenues, or to income
before income taxes and extraordinary items of income or expense,
during either of the last 2 fiscal years. If the contribution to net income cannot practicably be stated, the contribution most closely approaching net income or loss is to be indicated. The approximate
amount of assets employed in each such segment of the business is
to be reported, to the extent practicable. Comparable data on revenues
and earnings received from foreign sources, other than Canada, and
from government procurement or any single customer are also to be
reported.
Broker-Dealer Financial Reports

The Commission's staff and industry representatives have had extensive discussions during the past 2 years as to the best way to obtain
improved financial information concerning the securities industry and,
at the same time, avoid unnecessary burdens on broker-dealers, On the
basis of these discussions and after careful review of comments received on a proposed rule, the Commission on June 28,1968, adopted
Rule 1'7a-1O under the Securities Exchange Act, which requires exchange members and broker-dealers to file annual income and expense reports with the Commission or with a registered self-regulatory
organization which will transmit the reports to the Commission,"
The rule will become effective on January 1, 1969, and the first reports, which will be due in 19'70, will cover the calendar year 1969.
The form accompanying the rule contains three major parts, each
requiring income and expense data and information on the firm's
capital funds and financial condition. Broker-dealers are required
to complete only that part of the form which is appropriate to the
size and type of their business. Part I is a summary form; Part IT
requires more complete information; and Part TIl requires detailed
information. Many broker-dealers, including firms whose gross securities income was less than $20,000 during the calendar year, will
not have to complete any part of the form but will file only the introductory page of the form, showing their gross securities income and
certain nonfinancial information about their business.
A. major purpose of requiring the information is to provide comprehensive financial data on a continuing basis so that current information will be available to the Commission and to the self-regulatory

agencies to assist them in meeting their respective responsibilities. It
is anticipated that the Commission and the self-regulatory agencies
will publish this information from time to time on an aggregate basis.
As discussed above, the securities markets and the securities industry are presently experiencing a period of rapid change. The interests of the industry as well as the public interest require that governmental regulation and industry self-regulation adjust to the pace
of such change and be aware of the effects of this change on the various types of firms engaged in the securities business. It is also necessary that the securities industry remain healthy and profitable and
continue to assist the growth of our national economy. To meet these
needs, continuing and informed analysis of the operations of the markets and of persons and organizations serving the markets is required.
In the past, occasional useful studies have been authorized, but of
necessity these studies have been limited and prone to obsolescence.
The present informational needs of the Commission and the selfregulatory agencies demand a continuing flow of reliable and current
data concerning the operations of and changes in the industry.
Automation of Over-the-Counter Quotations

In 1966 the Board of Governors of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) appointed a special Automation
Committee to investigate the feasibility of automated quotations in
the over-the-counter market. During the 1968 fiscal year, an independent management consulting firm, under the direction of the Automation Committee, conducted a study of the economic feasibility of such
a system. The findings of the consultant and detailed specifications
concerning a proposed NASD automated quotations system known as
"NASDAQ" were submitted to several private firms. Following consideration of cost, design, and operation proposals received from these
firms, the Automation Committee selected the firm which, in its opinion,
could best supply and operate the physical equipment for the system
under the direction and supervision of the NASD.
NASDAQ involves the use of electronic data processing equipment in combination with communications facilities in a three-level
system designed to meet the quotations needs of registered representatives, customers, order desks, and professional traders in the overthe-counter markets. Level I would provide a current representative
interdealer bid and ask price for any security registered in the system
for the information of registered representatives and customers of
retail firms. Level II would be designed for use by firm trading departments and would supply upon request a list of marketmakers,
together with their respective current bid and ask prices for each security registered in the system. Level ill will also be for use by trad-

16

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ing departments, but will differ from Level II chiefly by providing input facilities allowing authorized marketmakers to enter, change
or update bid and ask prices. It is contemplated that NASDAQ will
be operational in 1970.
"Back Office" Problems

During fiscal year 1968, the volume of transactions in the securities
markets increased to a rate virtually double that which had been
anticipated by the securities industry. This unforeseen level of volume
has placed tremendous strains on the back offices of broker-dealers and
related clearance and transfer facilities. The result in many cases has
been delays and errors in the execution and settlement of transactions.
The existence of substantial numbers of transactions which remain
unsettled over considerable periods of time presents financial risks to
brokerage firms and their customers.
The Commission has stressed the responsibility of individual firms
and the self-regulatory agencies to deal with these problems and has
encouraged them to take all necessary measures. Various steps have
been taken. Among other things, trading hours on the securities markets have been curtailed to give back office staffs more time to process
backlogs. Numerous rule changes have been adopted by the exchanges
and the NASD. In addition, the self-regulatory agencies have been
examining broker-dealer firms both to identify individual problems
and to evaluate industry-wide conditions and have placed restrictions
on the activities of a number of firms.
The Commission has also taken direct action in the enforcement and
regulatory areas. The Commission staff has inspected over 300 brokerdealer firms in order to ascertain the current status of their books and
records and back office operations. Where violations have been found,
appropriate enforcement action has been taken including the institution of proceedings and the imposition of restrictions,"
The Commission has also issued statements cautioning brokers and
dealers that they must comply with applicable requirements regarding maintenance of current books and records, financial responsibility
and prompt delivery of securities and settlement of transactions." In
this connection the Commission stated that a dealer who sells a security
to a customer or a broker who buys a security for a customer violates
the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws if he has reason to
believe that he will not be able to deliver the security to the customer
promptly. The Commission also warned broker-dealers that it is a

violation of applicable anti-fraud provisions for a broker-dealer ,to
accept or execute any order for the purchase or sale of a security or to
induce or attempt to induce such purchase or sale, if he does not have
the personnel and facilities to enable him to promptly execute and
consummate all of his securities transactions. It cautioned brokerdealers with back office problems to limit their activities so as to eliminate these problems.
The Commission presently has two proposed rule changes under
consideration. The first would amend the Commission's net capital
rule by imposing a graduated percentage deduction from market value
of securities in the "failed to deliver" accounts of broker-dealers,"
This would provide an additional margin of safety for this category
of receivables. The second change would make it unlawful for an issuer with publicly traded securities to fail to provide appropriate
facilities for the prompt transfer of certificates."
The measures taken to date to cope with back office problems have
been essentially of an emergency and short-term character. Long-term
measures to improve the capacity of the industry to handle the increasing volume of transactions are being formulated by the selfregulatory agencies and the industry with the encouragement of the
Commission .

PARTll
FULL DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE
ISSUERS OF SECURITIES
One basic purpose of the Federal securities laws administered by
the Commission, in particular the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is to provide disclosure of financial and
other information about publicly held companies and those companies
seeking to raise capital through the public offering of their securities,
so as to enable public investors to evaluate the securities of these companies on an informed and realistic basis. To this end, the Securities
Act requires a company proposing to offer its securities to the public
to file a registration statement with the Commission disclosing prescribed categories of financial and other information and further requires that in the offer and sale of the securities investors be furnished
a prospectus containing the most significant information set forth in
the registration statement. The Securities Exchange Act, which deals
in large part with trading in securities already outstanding, requires
companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange
and other companies in whose securities, traded over-the-counter, there
is a substantial public interest to register those securities with the Commission and to file annual and other periodic reports which are designed to keep the information in the Exchange Act registration
statement current. That Act also requires disclosure of material information to holders of registered securities whose proxies are solicited for the election of directors or the approval of corporate action,
and requires "insiders" of companies whose equity securities are registered to report their holdings of and transactions in all equity securities of the company with which they are affiliated.
The scope of disclosure was further extended by the recently enacted
"take-over-bid" legislation
which, as implemented by Commission
rules, affords disclosure to investors in connection with purchases of
substantial blocks of stock of publicly held corporations either through
cash tender offers or private or open market purchases and in connection with repurchases by corporations of their own stock,"

A. DISCLOSURE IN CONNECTION WITH PUBLIC OFFERINGS

Disclosure under the Securities Act with respect to securities to be
offered for public sale, either by an issuing company or a person in a
control relationship to such company, is obtained through a two-step
process: (1) by requiring the issuer to file with the Commission a
registration statement containing certain required financial and other
information; and (2) by requiring that a prospectus which is a part
of the registration statement and contains the more significant data set
forth in that statement, be furnished to investors so as to enable them
to evaluate the securities and make an informed investment decision.
The registration statement is available for public inspection as soon
as it is filed. Although the securities may be offered for sale upon filing
of the statement under prescribed limitations, actual sales may not
be made until the statement has become effective. The Commission
has no authority to pass on the merits of the securities to be offered or
the fairness of the terms of distribution. In fact, the Act makes it
unlawful to represent to investors that the Commission has approved
or otherwise passed on the merits of registered securities.
Type of Information

Included in Registration

Statement

Generally speaking, a registration statement relating to securities
issued by a corporation or other private issuer must contain the information specified in Schedule A of the Act, while a statement relating
to securities issued by a foreign government must include the information specified in Schedule B. The Act empowers the Commission to classify issues, issuers and prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to increase, or in certain instances vary or
diminish, the particular items of information required to be disclosed
as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors. To facilitate the registration of securities by
different types of issuing companies, the Commission has prepared
special registration forms which vary in their disclosure requirements
so as to provide maximum disclosure of the essential facts pertinent
in a given type of case while at the same time reducing the burden and
expense of compliance with the law.
In general, the registration statement of an issuer other than a
foreign government must disclose such matters as the names of persons who participate in the management or control of the issuer's
business; the security holdings and remuneration of such persons; the
general character of the business, its capital structure, past history and
earnings; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made
within 2 years or intended to be made; the interest of directors, officers
and principal stockholders in material transactions with the issuer;
pending legal proceedings; and the purposes to which the proceeds

20

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the offering are to be applied, and must include financial statements
certified by an independent accountant. The registration statement of a
foreign government must contain information concerning the purposes for which the proceeds of the offering are to be used, the natural
and industrial resources of the issuer, its revenues, obligations and
expenses, the underwriting and distribution of the securities being
registered, and other material matters, but need not contain certified
financial statements.
Adoption of Short Form lor Registration of Securities 01 Certain Issuers

Effective December 31, 1967, the Commission adopted a new short
form for registration, designated Form 8-7.3 The form is for the registration of securities to be offered for cash by issuers which meet the
following requirements, among others: they must have a class of securities either listed on an exchange or registered under Section 12(g)
of the Exchange Act, must have complied with the reporting and proxy
requirements of that Act for at least 5 years and must have long records
of earnings and stability of management and business. The form represents a closer integration of the requirements of the Securities Act and
the Securities Exchange Act. During the fiscal year, 81 registration
statements were filed on Form 8-7.
Form 8-7 is in the nature of an experiment. The Commission will
carefully watch and review its operation in conjunction with the reporting and proxy requirements to determine whether the omission of
information in the prospectus, particularly with respect to the identity,
remuneration and other perquisites received by management and their
interest in transactions with the issuer, carries out the statutory objectives of providing investors with sufficient information to enable them
to make an informed judgment about the securities offered. Should experience indicate that such action is necessary or desirable, the Commission may amend or rescind Form S-7, or change the conditions for
its use so as to limit or expand the types of issuers to which the form is
available.
The Commission also amended paragraph (a) of Rule 174 under
the Securities Act so that securities registered on Form 8-7 will be
exempt from the prospectus delivery requirements of the Act. Under
this amendment a dealer is not required to deliver a prospectus to his
customer if he is no longer acting as an underwriter of the offering or
is not engaged in a transaction involving his participation in the
offering.
Proposed Guides lor Preparation

During the 1968 fiscal year the Commission issued a release containing
the existing guides, suggested modifications of those guides and proposed additional guides, and requested interested parties to comment
thereon prior to publication of the guides in definitive form,"
The published guides and those proposed for publication represent
policies and practices presently followed by the Commission's Division
of Corporation Finance. They are not rules of the Commission and
were not published as bearing the Commission's official approval, although some may later be incorporated in rules or forms after appropriate publication and opportunity for comment. The guides do not
purport to furnish complete criteria for the preparation of registration statements.
The staff is in the process of preparing guides describing the practices and policies followed by the Commission's Division of Corporate
Regulation in the examination and processing of registration statements .filed by management investment companies on Form N8B-l
under the Investment Company Act. It is expected that these guides
will be published for comment in the near future and that they will
be the first in a series of guides which will ultimately include Forms
S-4, S-5 and S-6 under the 1933 Act.
Amendments to Rules Relating to Disclosure Detrimental

to National Defense

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted certain amendments
to Rule 171 under the Securities Act, Rule 0-6 under the Securities
Exchange Act and Rule 105 under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 relating to the disclosure of documents or information detrimental to the national defense or foreign policy." The amendments bring those rules into harmony with the recently adopted Public
Information Act and specify the procedure to be followed by registrants with respect to classified material.
Adoption of Rules Relating to Industrial

Revenue Bonds

During the fiscal year, the Commission invited public comments on a
proposed Rule 131 under the Securities Act and a proposed Rule 3b-5
under the Securities Exhange Act relating to industrial revenue
bonds,' and shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the rules were
adopted."
Industrial revenue bonds generally are instruments issued in the
name of a government or its instrumentality to finance the acquisition
of a revenue producing facility which is leased to a private company.
Usually the facility has been specially constructed for that company.

22

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Principal and interest on the bonds are payable from the proceeds of
the lease, and the bonds are not backed by the taxing power and general
credit of the governmental body in whose name they are issued. Thus,
the typical industrial revenue bond financing plan represents a financing by a private company. Accordingly, investors should be given information concerning the business, prior experience, fiscal responsibilities and earnings of the company that has leased the facility, as well
as the terms and conditions of the lease arrangement, in order to assess
the worth of such investment. The municipality or other governmental
unit usually has no significant obligation under the bond, except to the
extent of applying lease payments received from the private company
to the payment of principal and interest. The investor cannot look to
the municipality for interest payments or repayment of the principal;
he can look only to the possibility of success or failure of the private
company. In these circumstances, the investor is offered an interest in
an obligation of the private company which is a "security" within the
meaning of the securities acts and should have the benefit of the disclosures required by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act when applicable.
Accordingly, the new rules identify the interest in the obligation
of the private company as a separate security issued by such company and, absent an exemption, such securities are subject to the
registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities
Act and the various provisions of the Exchange Act. The rules do not
operate to terminate the exemption for governmental and municipal
bonds provided in the securities acts but only relate to that part of
the obligation of the bonds as to which the real obligor is a business
enterprise. The rules specifically exclude bonds isssued in connection
with a public project or facility owned and operated by or on behalf
of and under the control of a governmental unit.
The new rules apply to industrial revenue bonds sold after December 31, 1968.9
Joint Release Relating to Real Estate Syndications

During the fiscal year, the Commission and the securities authorities
of Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia issued a joint
release for the guidance of the industry and the bar respecting statutory requirements with respect to real estate syndioations.w This
action was responsive to the fact that newspaper advertisements by
various persons, corporations, partnerships, trusts and unincorporated
organizations had offered for sale interests in real estate syndications,
usually in the form of limited partnership interests or interests in
joint or profit sharing ventures, which had not been registered with
the appropriate regulatory bodies. Such offers and subsequent sales

had been prevalent especially in the District of Columbia, Maryland
and Virginia. These transactions raised important questions under
the registration requirements and anti-fraud provisions of the Federal
securities laws and the laws of these States and of the District of
Columbia. The release emphasized that the interests in question were
securities under Federal law and under the laws of these three jurisdictions and it outlined the requirements of the relevant statutory
provisions.
Amendment of Rule Relating to Contents of Prospectus Used Mter Nine Months

Rule 427 under the Securities Act permits the omission from any
prospectus used more than 9 months after the effecti ve date of the
registration statement of any information previously required to be
contained in the prospectus insofar as later information covering the
same subjects, as of a date not more than 16 months prior to the use
of the prospectus, is contained therein. Where securities have been
registered on Form S-l but at the time of filing a prospectus as a
part of a post-effective amendment the registrant would be entitled
to register the securities on another form, such as Form S-8 or S-9,
the Commission has permitted the prospectus to be prepared in accordance with the requirements of such other form. In order to make
this practice generally known to all registrants and to make it applicable to forms, other than Forms S-8 and 8-9, which may be adopted
from time to time, Rule 427 was amended during the fiscal year to
incorporate such practice.v
Adoption of Rule Relating to Registration by Certain Snccessor Issuers

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted Rule 414 under the
Securities Act relating to registration of securities by certain successor issuers," The new rule provides a means whereby an offering of
registered securities by a predecessor company may be continued by its
successor without repeating the full process of registration where the
purpose of the succession is merely to change the state of incorporation
of the registrant. The rule provides that the registration statement
of the predecessor shall be deemed to be the registration statement of
the successor where certain conditions are met, including the filing of
an amendment to the registration statement by the successor expressly
adopting the statement as its own for all purposes of the Act and the
Securities Exchange Act.

Rule 133 under the Securities Act provides that, solely for the purpose of the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Act, the submission to stockholders of a corporation, under certain circumstances,
of a proposed merger, consolidation, reclassification of securities or

transfer of assets does not constitute an offer to such stockholders of
the securities to be issued to them in the transaction. Where a transaction involves the transfer of assets to a corporation in consideration
of its own securities, the rule provides that the consideration may consist of any kind of securities, whether equity or debt securities. However, where the assets are to be transferred to a subsidiary of the issuer
of the securities involved in the transaction, the consideration previously could consist only of voting stock of such issuer. The rule was
amended during the year so that it will apply in cases where the assets
are to be transferred to a subsidiary of the issuer in consideration of
any securities of the issuer,"
Staff Examination of Registration Statements

Registration statements are examined by the Commission's staff for
compliance with the standards of adequate and accurate disclosure.
This examination is primarily the responsibility of the Division of
Corporation Finance. Statements filed by investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 are examined by
the Division of Corporate Regulation. If it appears that a statement
does not conform in material respects with the applicable requirements, the issuing company is usually notified by a letter of comment
and is afforded an opportunity to file correcting or clarifying amendments. The Commission also has the power, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to issue a "stop-order" suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement if it finds that material representations are misleading, inaccurate or incomplete. In certain instances,
such as where the deficiencies in a registration statement appear to
stem from careless disregard of applicable requirements or from a
deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead, a letter of comment is not
sent and the Commission either conducts an investigation to determine whether "stop-order" proceedings should be instituted or immediately institutes such proceedings. The exercise of the "stop-order"
power during fiscal year 1968 is discussed on page 30. As to the new
procedures adopted in November 1968 to expedite the processing of
registration statements, see pages 11-12.
Time Required To Complete Registration

The Commission's staff endeavors to complete its examination of
registration statements in as short a time as possible. The Act provides
that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th day
after it is filed (or on the 20th day after the filing of any amendment
thereto). Since most registration statements require one or more
amendments, they usually do not become effective until some time
after the original 20-day period. The period between filing and effective date is intended to afford investors an opportunity to become

familiar with the proposed offering through the dissemination of the
preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission can accelerate the
effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period, taking into account the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, the facility with which the facts about the
offering can be understood, the public interest and the protection of
investors. The note to Rule 460 under the Act lists some of the-more
common situations in which the Commission considers that the statute
generally requires it to deny acceleration.

Statistics Regarding Registration Statements Filed

During fiscal year 1968 the number of registration statements
filed as well as the dollar amounts of the offerings involved soared
to record levels. A total of 2,906 registration statements was filed for
offerings aggregating $54.0 billion. Compared with 1967 figures of
1,836 statements totalling $36.2 billion, this represented an increase
of 58.3 percent in the number of statements filed and 49.2 percent in
the dollar amount involved.
1< This figure excludes 285 amendments
filed by investment companies pursuant
to Section 24(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which provides for the
registration of additional securities through amendment to an effective registration statement rather than the filing of a new registration statement.

figures for the 1967 and 1966 fiscal years were 440, or 24 percent, and
422, or 24.8 percent, respectively.
From the effective date of the Securities Act to June 30, 1968, a
cunntlative total of 31,861 registration statements has been filed under
the Act by 13,398 different issuers covering proposed offerings of

Statistics Regarding Securities Registered

During the fiscal year 1968, a total of 2,417 registrations of securities in the amount of $54.1 billion became effective under the Securities Act of 1933.16 The number of statements and the dollar amount
of registrations were the largest on record and reflected the general
expansion in the economy during the period and the increased need
for funds by business. The chart on page 28 shows the number and
dollar amounts of registrations from 1935 to 1968.
The figures for 1968 include all registrations which became effective
including secondary distributions and securities registered for other
than cash sale, such as issues exchanged for other securities and securities reserved for conversion. Of the dollar amount of securities registered in 1968, 69 percent was for the account of the issuer for cash sale,
25 percent for the account of the issuer for other than cash sale, and 6
percent for the account of others.

Stop Order Proceedings

Section 8( d) of the Securities Act of 1933 gives the Commission the
power, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to issue a stop order
':suspending" the effectiveness of a registration statement which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. The effect of a stop order, which
may be issued even after the sale of securities has begun, is to bar
distribution of the securities so long as the order remains in effect.
Although losses which may have been suffered by investors before
issuance of the order are not restored to them by a stop order, the
Commission's decision and the evidence on which it is based may serve
to put them on notice of their rights and aid in their own recovery
suits. As provided by the Act, a stop order is lifted when the registration statement has been amended to correct the deficiencies.
As of the beginning of the fiscal year, four stop-order proceedings
were pending. During the year these proceedings were terminated, two
of them through the issuance of stop orders 16 and two by permitting
withdrawal of the registration statement, subject to certain conditions,
pursuant to offers of settlement accepted by the Commission." One
of the stop orders was later lifted upon the filing of an amendment
to the registration statement. During the fiscal year one new stop order
proceeding was instituted.

EXEMPTION FRO~I REGISTRATION OF SMALL ISSUES

The Commission is authorized under Section 3 (b) of the Securities
Act to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such terms
and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities from
registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the
registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securities is not
necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors by
reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the
public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limitation of $300,000
upon the size of the issues which may be exempted by the Commission
in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority, the Commission has adopted the following exemptive rules and regulations :
Rule 234 : Exemption of first lien notes.
Rule 235: Exemption of securities of cooperative housing corporations.
Rule 236: Exemption
of shares
offered in connection
with certain
transactions.
Regulation
.A: General exemption for U.S. and Canadian
issues up to

rights up to $100,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for assessable stock offered or sold to realize the amount of asessment thereon.

Under Section 3 (c) of the Securities Act, which was added by
Section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting
securities issued by a small business investment company under the
Small Business Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this authority,
the Commission has adopted Regulation E, which is described below.
Exemption from registration under Section 3 (b) or 3 (c) of the Act
does not carry any exemption from the provisions of the Act prohibiting fraudulent conduct in the offer or sale of securities and imposing
civil liability or criminal responsibilty for such conduct.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

Regulation A permits a company to obtain needed capital not in
excess of $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in anyone
year from a public offering of its securities without registration, provided specified conditions are met. These include the filing of a notification supplying basic information about the company with the
Regional Officeof the Commission in the region in which the company
has its principal place of business, and the filing and use in the offering
of an offering circular. However, an offering circular need not be filed
or used in connection with an offering not in excess of $50,000 by a
company with earnings in one of the last 2 years.
During the 1968fiscal year, 515 notifications were filed under Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $112,318,744,compared with 383
notifications covering proposed offerings of $74,761,963 in the 1967
fiscal year.

Reports of Sales.- Regulation A provides that within 30 days after
the end of each 6-month period following the date of the original
offering circular required by Rule 256, or the statement required by
Rule 257, the issuer or other person for whose account the securities
are offered must file a report of sales containing specified information.

ANNUAL REPORT

A final report must be filed upon completion or termination of the
offering.
During the fiscal year 1968, 724 reports of sales were filed reporting
aggregate sales of $40,366,326.
Suspension of Exemption.- The Commmission may suspend an exemption under Regulation A. where, in general, the exemption is
sought for securities for which the regulation provides no exemption or
where the offering is not made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation or with prescribed disclosure standards. Following the issuance of a temporary suspension order by the Commission, the respondents may request a hearing to determine whether the
temporary suspension should be vacated or made permanent. If no
hearing is requested within 30 days after the entry of the temporary
suspension order and none is ordered by the Commission on its own
motion, the temporary suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1968 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were issued
in five cases, which, added to the four cases pending at the beginning
of the fiscal year, resulted in a total of nine cases for disposition. Of
these, the temporary suspension order was vacated in one case and
became permanent in six cases: in three by lapse of time, in two by
withdrawal of the request for hearing, and in one on the basis of an
offer of settlement. Two cases were pending at the end of the fiscal
year.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1968,453 offering sheets and
451 amendments thereto were filed pursuant to Regulation B and were
examined by the Oil and Gas Section of the Commission's Division of
Corporation Finance. During the 1967 and 1966 fiscal years, 353 and
235 offering sheets, respectively, were filed. The following table indicates the nature and number of Commission orders issued in connection

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E

Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for securities of small business investment
companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940
which are licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958
or which have received the preliminary approval of the Small Business Administration
and have been notified by the Administration
that they may submit an application for such a license.
The regulation, which is substantially similar to the general exemption provided by Regulation A, requires the filing of a notification
with the Commission and, except in the case of offerings not in excess of
$50,000, the filing and use of an offering circular containing certain
specified information.
No notifica tions were filed under Regulation E during the 1968 fiscal
year.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

Regulation F provides an exemption for assessments levied upon
assessable stock and for delinquent assessment sales in amounts not
exceeding $300,000 in anyone year. It requires the filing of a simple
notification giving brief information with respect to the issuer, its
management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security issues. The regulation requires a company
to send to its stockholders, or otherwise publish, a statement of the purposes for which the proceeds of the assessment are proposed to be
used. Copies of any other sales literature used in connection with the
assessment must be filed. Like Regulation A, Regulation F provides
for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where the regulation
provides no exemption or where the offering is not made in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the regulation or in accordance with
prescribed disclosure standards.

THIRTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

During the 1968 fiscal year, 20 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of $835,274. These notifications were filed
in three of the nine regional offices of the Commission: Denver, San
Francisco and Seattle. Underwriters were not employed in any of the
Regulation F assessments. No Regulation F exemptions were suspended during the fiscal year.
Proposed Exemption for Securities of District of Columbia Local Development
Companies

The Commission has taken under consideration proposed Rule 237
under the Securities Act which if adopted would exempt securities
issued by local development companies incorporated by and doing
business in the District of Columbia from the registration requirements of the Act.IS The proposed rule defines the term "local development company" as a D.C. corporation with the authority to promote
and assist the growth and development of small business concerns
within the District. The purpose of the proposed rule is to allow local
development companies interested in urban renewal projects in the
District to offer securities in a manner which will encourage community
participation in such projects. The exemption would be limited to
offerings not exceeding $300,000, and would be available only for
securities of those companies which have received a loan commitment
under Section 502 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The
exemption would not apply to securities offered pursuant to an underwriting agreement, under a contract in which a discount or commission is offered as compensation, or for which an employee of the local
development company is paid compensation in addition to his regular
salary. An offering circular containing specified information must be
used in the offering and must be filed with the Commission prior to its
use. The proceeds of the sale of the securities must be kept in escrow
until the Small Business Administration approves the disbursal of
funds under its loan commitment. The proposed rule would not exempt
any person who offers or sells the securities of a local development company from the anti-fraud provisions of the Act.
B. CONTINUING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
Registration

of Securities on Exchanges

Unless a security is registered on a national securities exchange
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or is exempt from registration, it is unlawful for a member of such exchange or any broker
or dealer to effect any transaction in the security on the exchange. In
general, the Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a State or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions
or agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and
11

36

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

regulations exempting such other securities as the Commission may
find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for
the protection of investors. Under this authority the Commission has
exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by
property or leasehold interests, certain warrants and, on a temporary
basis, certain securities issued in substitution for or in addition to
listed securities.
Pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, an issuer may register a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission
and the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information concerning the issuer and its affairs. Information must be
furnished regarding the issuer's business, its capital structure, the
terms of its securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs,
the remuneration paid to its officers and directors, and the allotment
of options, bonuses and profit-sharing plans. Financial statements
certified by an independent accountant must be filed as part of the
application.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit
and securities of foreign governments.
Statistics regarding securities traded on exchanges may be found
in Part III of this report, as well as in certain of the appendix tables,
Registration of Over-the-Counter Securities

Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act requires a company with total
assets exceeding one million dollars and a class of equity securities
held of record by 500 or more persons to register those securities with
the Commission, unless one of the exemptions set forth in that section
is available." Upon registration, the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and insider reporting and trading provisions contained in Sections 13, 14 and 16 of the Act become applicable. During the fiscal year,
422 registration statements were filed under Section 12(g). This makes
a total, from the enactment of Section 12(g) in 1964, through June 30,
1968, of 3,168 registration statements filed. Eight of these statements
were withdrawn before they had become effective upon determination
that they were not required to be filed under the Act. A total of 95
registrations have been terminated pursuant to Section 12(g) (4) because the number of shareholders was reduced to less than 300. An
additional 195 issuers which had registered securities have gone out of
10 Section 12(g) contains various exemptive provisions with respect to certain
types of securities. Of partleular significance are the provisions relating to
securities issued by Insurance companies and securities of foreign issuers. See

existence as a result of mergers, consolidations and the like, with the
result that for practical purposes these registrations must also be considered to have been terminated.
Of the 422 registration statements filed under Section 12(g) in
fiscal year 1968, 235 were filed by issuers already subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Act.20 The latter figure
includes 20 registration statements filed by issuers with another security registered on a national securities exchange, and 215 filed by
issuers subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) because
they had registered securities under the Securities Act. These latter
companies, however, had not been subject to the proxy solicitation and
insider reporting and trading provisions of Sections 14 and 16 of the
Exchange Act. The remaining 187 issuers which filed registration
statements had not been subject to any of the disclosure or insider
trading provisions and became subject to them through registration.
Exemptions From Registration

Section 12(h) of the Act authorizes the Commission, either by rules
and regulations or by order upon application of an interested person,
to grant a complete or partial exemption from the provisions of Sections 12(g), 13,14, 15(d), or 16 if the Commission finds that because
of the number of public investors, the amount of trading interest in
the securities, the nature and extent of the activities of the issuer, the
income or assets of the issuer, or otherwise, the exemption is not inconsistent with the public interest or the protection of investors.
During the fiscal year, 9 applications for complete or partial exemptions were filed and 12 applications filed during prior years were still
pending. Of these 21 applications, 1 was granted, 2 were withdrawn,
the proceeding with respect to 1 was concluded by acceptance of a
settlement agreement by the Commission and 17 were pending at the
end of the year. The one exemption was granted because the applicant
had merged into an issuer registered under Section 12 of the Act. The
settlement agreement provided for the filing of a registration statement within a specified period, thereby subjecting the applicant to the
reporting, proxy and stockholder information and insider trading
provisions of the Act. Under the agreement the applicant, which owns
a major league baseball club, would not be required to file semi-annual
reports of earnings unless the Commission so directs.
In a decision announced shortly after the end of the fiscal year, the
Commission denied an application by The National Dollar Stores,
Ltd. for a conditional exemption from registration, but granted
exemptions from the reporting requirements and from certain requirements as to the financial statements to be filed with a registration

statement," National operates a chain of department stores. Its assets
in January 1967 exceeded $12 million and its 10,000 shares of outstanding common stock, sold initially in 1928 and 1929 to members of the
Chinese community in the San Francisco area, were held by 599 shareholders, mostly in small amounts except for a 50 percent interest
owned by the founder's family. The shares have been traded infrequently and such transactions as have taken place have not involved
brokers. Under a practice in effect for many years, stockholders wishing to sell shares have contacted the company which has :found a buyer,
generally among company employees.
The Commission concluded that, while an exemption from the
registration requirements would not be appropriate, in view of the
limited trading interest in the stock it would not be inconsistent with
the public interest or the protection of investors to exempt National
from the periodic reporting requirements, subject to certain conditions.
Under this disposition, the company will be required to comply with
the requirements as to proxy solicitations and its insiders will be
subject to the insider reporting and trading provisions of the Act. The
conditions specified include requirements that National deliver its
most recent proxy statement and annual report to any prospective
purchaser of its stock when it acts as intermediary and that it inform
the Commission annually of all sales of its stock and advise it promptly
of any material change in the facts recited in the Commission's opinion. The Commission expressly reserved jurisdiction to reconsider the
exemption in the event of such a change or of a change in its rules
relating to disclosures by Section 12(g) companies.
Pel'iodic Reports

Section 13 of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) to file periodic reports keeping current the information contained in the application for registration or registration statement. These periodic reports include annual,
semi-annual, and current reports. The principal annual report form
is Form 10-K, which is designed to give current information regarding the matters covered in the original filing. Semi-annual reports
required to be filed on Form 9-K are devoted chiefly to furnishing
mid-year financial data. Current reports on Form 8-K are required
to be filed for each month in which any of certain specified events of
immediate interest to investors has occurred. A report on this form
deals with matters such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination of important legal proceedings and important changes in the
issuer's securities. Section 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, generally speakn

Proxy Solicitations

Scope and Nature of Proxy Regulation.-Regulation
14A under
the Exchange Act, implementing Section 14(a) of that Act, governs
the manner in which proxies or other authorizations may be solicited
from the holders of securities registered under Section 12 of that Act,
whether for the election of directors, approval of other corporate
action, or some other purpose." Itrequires that in any such SOlicitation,
whether by the management or minority groups, disclosure must be
made of all material facts concerning the matters on which such holders
are asked to vote, and they must be afforded an opportunity to vote
"yes" or "no" on each matter. The regulation also provides, among
other things, that where the management is soliciting proxies, any
security holder desiring to communicate with other security holders
for a proper purpose may require the management to furnish him with
a list of all security holders or to mail his communication to security
holders for him. A security holder may also, subject to certain limitations, require the management to include in its proxy material any
appropriate proposal which he wants to submit to a vote of security
holders. Any security holder or group of security holders may at any

time make an independent proxy solicitation upon compliance with
the proxy rules, whether or not the management is making a solicitation. Certain additional provisions of the regulation apply where a
contest for control of the management of an issuer or representation
on the board is involved.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to correct the deficiencies in the preparation of the definitive proxy material to be
furnished to security holders.
Under Section 14(c) of the Act, issuers of securities registered under
Section 12 must, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by
the Commission, transmit information comparable to proxy material
to security holders from whom proxies are not solicited with respect to
a stockholders' meeting. Regulation 14C implements this provision by
setting forth the requirements for "information statements."
Adoption of Amendments to Proxy and Information Rules

During the 1967 fiscal year, the Commission invited public comments with respect to proposed amendments to its proxy rules
(Regulation 14A) under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and its
information statement rules (Regulation 14C) under Section 14(c).
Certain of the proposed amendments were adopted during that year,
but at the request of persons who desired further time to study the
proposals, the Commission extended the period within which comments could be submitted." Following receipt and consideration of a
number of helpful comments, a series of other amendments were
adopted during fiscal year 1968.24
The principal changes include the following: Rule 14a-8, which
provides that any security holder may, subject to certain prescribed
limitations, require management to include in its proxy material any
appropriate proposal which he desires to submit to a vote of security
holders, was amended with respect to the minimum period preceding
the proxy solicitation within which a security holder must submit
his proposal to management to require its inclusion in the proxy
material. The rule was further amended to permit the omission from
such material of the proponent's name and address. Schedule 14A,
which specifies the information that must be set forth in proxy material, was amended so as to require, among other things, more complete

disclosure concerning options to purchase securities from the issuer or
its subsidiaries held by officers and directors and disclosure of transactions between certain employee plans provided by the issuer, or its
parents or subsidiaries, and certain insiders, and to clarify the situations where information concerning the interest of certain insiders in
transactions with the issuer or a subsidiary may be omitted because it
is not material. 25
Schedule 14B, which specifies the information to be filed in connection with election contests, was amended to require more complete
disclosure by each participant in the contest of his transactions in the
issuer's securities during the preceding 2 years.
The remaining changes were intended to clarify the existing rules
and the items and instructions of Schedules 14A and 140 or to codify
existing administrative practice.
Statistics Relating to Proxy and Information

Statements

During the 1968 fiscal year, 5,244 proxy statements in definitive
form were filed, 5,224 by management and 20 by nonmanagement
groups or individual stockholders. In addition, 110 information statements were filed. The proxy and information statements related to
4,705 companies, some 519 of which had a second solicitation during
the year, generally for a special meeting not involving the election of
directors.
There were 4,473 solicitations of proxies for the election of directors,
751 for special meetings not involving the election of directors, and
28 for assents and authorizations.

Stockholders' Proposals.---During the 1968 fiscal year, 162 proposals submitted by 34 stockholders were included in the proxy statements of 115 companies under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A.
Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security
holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or by-laws
to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors, preemptive rights, limitations on the grant of stock options to and their
exercise by key employees and management groups, the sending of a
post-meeting report to all stockholders, and limitations on charitable
contributions.
A total of 92 additional proposals submitted by 34 stockholders was

Insiders' Security Holdings and Transactions

Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act and corresponding provisions in Section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and Section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 are
designed to provide other stockholders and investors generally with
information as to insiders' securities transactions and holdings, and to
prevent the unfair use of confidential information by insiders to profit
from short-term trading in a company's securities.
Ownership Reports.-Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
every person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than
10 percent of any class of equity security which is registered under
Section 12(b) for exchange listing or under Section 12(g) for overthe-counter trading, or who is a director or an officer of the issuer of
any such security, to file statements with the Commission disclosing
the amount of all equity securities of the issuer of which he is the
beneficial owner and changes in such ownership. Copies of such
statements must also be filed with exchanges on which securities are
listed. Similar provisions applicable to insiders of registered public.
utility holding companies and registered closed-end investment companies are contained in Section 17(a) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act and Section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act.
During the fiscal year, 93,823 ownership reports (14,893 initial
statements of ownership on Form 3 and 78,930 statements of changes in
ownership on Form 4) were filed with the Commission. This is an increase of 8,540 over the 85,283 reports (13,494 initial statements and
71,789 statements of changes) filed during the 1967 fiscal year.
All ownership reports are made available for public inspection as
soon as they are filed at the Commission's office in Washington and at
the exchanges where copies are filed. In addition, the information contained in reports filed with the Commission is summarized and published in the monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions and
Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing Office to
more than 24,000 subscribers.
Amendment of Rule Relating to Determination
of 10 percent
Ownership.-Rule
16a-2 under the Exchange Act deals with the determination of when a person is the beneficial owner of more than 10
percent of a class of equity securities for purposes of the ownership
reporting requirements of Section 16(a). During the fiscal year, the
Commission amended the rule to provide that a person shall be deemed
to be the beneficial owner of securities which he has the right to acquire through the exercise of presently exercisable options, warrants
or rights or through the conversion of presently convertible securities.
Securities subject to such options, warrants, rights or conversion privileges held by such person are deemed outstanding for the purpose of

44

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

computing the percentage of the class owned by him but are not deemed
outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of the class
owned by any other person."
The amended rule does not purport to determine whether transactions in options, warrants, rights or convertible securities may give
rise to liabilities under Section 16(b) of the Act. That question is one
for determination by the courts independently of Rule 16a-2.
Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits.-In order to prevent
insiders from making unfair use of information which they may have
obtained by reason of their relationship with a company, Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act, Section 17(b) of the Holding Company Act,
and Section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act provide for the
recovery by or on behalf of the issuer of any profit realized by insiders
(in the categories listed above) from certain purchases and sales, or
sales and purchases, of securities of the company within any period
of less than 6 months. The Commission at times participates as
amious curiae in actions to recover such profits when it deems it important to present its views regarding the interpretation of the statutory provisions or of the exemptive rules adopted by the Commission
thereunder.
Changes in Rules Exempting Transactions From Short-Swing
Trading Provisions.- The Commission is authorized to exempt from
the operation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act any transaction
not comprehended within the purpose of that Section. Rule 16b-7
exempts from the operation of Section 16(b) certain acquisitions and
dispositions of securities pursuant to mergers or consolidations. During the fiscal year Rule 16b-7 was amended to make explicit its intended scope." The rule provides that the exemption shall not be available to a person if he has made certain short-term purchases and sales
other than those involved in the merger or consolidation. The amendments specify that the exemption is not defeated by short ...term transactions which are exempted under any other rule adopted under Section 16(b) and that as to transactions not so exempted, the exemption
provided by Rule 16b-7 will be unavailable only to the extent of such
transactions,
The Commission also adopted Rule 16b-ll which exempts from the
operation of Section 16(b) the sale of certain short ...term subscription
rights distributed for no consideration by an issuer to a class of its
security holders pro rata in the course of an offering to such security
holders of additional securities of such issuer.28

Act Registration

or Report-

Section 15(c) (4) of the Exchange Act, which was a part of the 196-:1:
amendments of that Act, empowers the Commission to find, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person subject to the
provisions of Section 12, 13, or 15(d) of the Act or the rules thereunder has failed to comply with these requirements in any material
respect. It authorizes the Commission to publish its findings and issue
an order requiring compliance on such terms and conditions and within
such time as it may specify. Section 15(c) (4) thus provides an administrative forum, comparable to that provided by Section 19(a) (2) for
proceedings to delist an exchange-traded security, for the resolution
of accounting and other technical questions arising from the disclosure
provisions of the Exchange Act and a means for apprising investors
of materially false or misleading filings.
In the most notable proceeding to date under Section 15(c) (4), involving Orescent Oorporatioa and Pakco Oompanies, Inc., whose securities were registered under Sections 12(b) and 12(g) of the Exchange
Act, respectively, the Commission found "repeated and flagrant violations" of the reporting requirements." In its conclusions, the Commission stated:
"The reports filed with us by Crescent and Pakco were marked by numerous,
serious and substantial deficiencies which ...
reflected a studied pattern of
corporate indirection, camouflage and concealment, particularly relating to
transactions in which Colasurdo [the controlling person of the two companies]

"Adequate reporting to stockholders is a matter of vital importance and is
a subject of major concern to this Commission. This case points up the significance of the reporting requirements. A company such as Crescent, whose
securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, not only has a statutory
obligation to file certain reports with us and the Exchange, but also has voluntarily assumed certain commitments to the Exchange to keep the Exchange and
the public informed of material events. Of particular significance to public
stockholders are changes in control and membership in the board of directors
and transactions in which persons in a position to exercise control or direction
of corporate affairs have an interest. Where, as here, a majority of directors
resigns within 11 days of a transfer of controlling blocks of stock, it is most
important to the public stockholders that they obtain at the least prompt
information with respect to the changes that have taken place. Indeed, to be
fully effective, detailed information as to such changes should be given to stockholders before they are actually consummated, so that stockholders will be
aware that a material alteration in the managerial structure of their company
is about to take place and they will be alerted to the possible impact of the
changes on their investment interests and be in a better position to take steps
to protect those interests. Such disclosure would among other things make
more difficult the concealment of transactions for the benefit of a controilling
person of the type that occurred in the present case." [Footnote omttted.l ..
Summary Suspension of Trading

Section 19(a) (4) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission
summarily to suspend trading in a security listed on a national securities exchange for up to 10 days if in its opinion the public interest
so requires. As a counterpart to this provision, Congress in 1964
enacted Section 15(c) (5) of the Exchange Act which authorizes the
Commission summarily to suspend over-the-counter trading in any
nonexempt security for up to 10 days if it believes that such action
is required in the public interest and :for the protection of investors.
During the 1968 fiscal year, the Commission temporarily suspended
trading in 39 securities, compared to 22 in fiscal 1967 and 16 in fiscal
1966. In 7 instances exchange-listed securities were involved and the
Commission acted under both Section 19(a) (4) and Section 15(c)
.. Id. p. 12. Prior to issuance of its opinion, the Commission had accepted
offers of settlement submitted by the two companies providing for discontinuance
of the proceedings on the basis of the filing of corrective reports, the mailing
of corrective current report material to their stockholders and an undertaking
to mail copies of the Commission's opinion to such stockholders if deemed
appropriate by the Commission. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8144
(August 14, 1967). In its opinion, the Commission concluded that copies thereof
should be sent to the stockholders.

(5) .31 In each of these cases, the exchange on which the securities were
listed had previously suspended trading.
In most instances the Commission ordered suspension of trading
because adequate information concerning the company was not available or the Commission learned of information not generally known
to the securities community and investors which indicated the existence
of substantial questions concerning the financial condition or business
operations of the companies involved or concerning the purchase or
sale of the securities of such companies. For example, suspensions
were ordered pending clarification and adequate public dissemination
of information concerning: undisclosed transactions in the stock of
the company by its officers, directors and controlling persons; 32 matters disclosed in preliminary proxy material filed with the Commission
which, under Commission rules, would not become public until examined by the Commission's staff and thereafter distributed by the company to its shareholders; 33 and the possibility of irregularities in an
offering which, among other things, raised questions as to whether a
claimed intrastate exemption from the registration provisions of the
Securities Act was in fad available. 34 In other instances, no current
information was available and there were substantial increases in the
market price of stocks which appeared to have no reasonable basis."
In two instances actions taken by state authorities formed the basis
for Commission uct.ion.P''
In five cases, the Commission instituted enforcement action subsequent to the trading suspensions where violations of law were uncovered." For example, in a case involving Fastline, Inc., the Commission
suspended over-the-counter trading in the company's common stock
as a result of information obtained in a staff investigation indicating
a lack of current, accurate information about Fastline's financial status
or operations. It appeared from the investigation that Fastline had
no offices,tangible assets, business operations, employees or any income
whatsoever, and that the only officerof the company was a "provisional
president." Although it appeared that Fastline had 1,207,324shares
outstanding, no books and records or accurate current stock transfer
records could be found. Upon complaint filed by the Commission in

the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Fastline
and certain individuals were enjoined from further offers and sales of
Fastlins's common stock in violation of the registration provisions of
the Securities Act of 1933. The suspension of trading was then terminated by the Commission.
In another case, involving North American Research and Development Corporation, the Commission suspended trading in the company's common stock when it appeared that there was a complete
lack of financial and other information with respect to the company,
and that control persons and insiders had failed to disclose their trading in the stock. Subsequently, the Commission filed a complaint in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking
to enjoin 43 defendants, including 6 broker-dealers, an investment
adviser, and other corporations and individuals in addition to North
American and its control persons and insiders, from further violations of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities
laws.38 Upon issuance of an order of preliminary injunction against
the company and 13 other defendants," the Commission terminated
the trading suspension. The appeals of some of the defendants are
presently pending. TIm Commission has instituted administrative
enforcement action against other defendants involved in the case.
C. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

MATIERS

The several Acts administered by the Commission reflect a recognition by Congress that dependable financial statements of a company
are indispensable to an informed investment decision regarding its
securities. The value of such statements is directly dependent on the
soundness of the judgment exercised in applying accounting principles and practices in their preparation, and on the adequacy and
reliability of the work done by public accountants who certify the
statements. A major objective of the Commission has been to improve
accounting and auditing standards and to assist in the establishment
and maintenance of high standards of professional conduct by certifying accountants. The primary responsibility for this program rests
with the Chief Accountant of the Commission.
Pursuant to the Commission's broad rulemaking power regarding
the preparation and presentation of financial information, it has
adopted a basic accounting regulation (Regulation S-X) which,
tog-ether with opinions on accounting principles published as "Ac.. Litig-ation

counting Series Releases," governs the form and content of financial
statements filed under the statutes administered by the Commission,
The Commission has also formulated TIlleswith respect to accounting
for and auditing of brokers and dealers and has prescribed uniform
systems of accounts for companies subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The accounting rules and the opinions of
the Commission and its decisions in particular cases have contributed
to clarification and wider acceptance of the accounting principles and
practices and auditing standards developed by the profession and
generally followed in the preparation of financial statements.
In the large area of financial reporting not covered by its rules,
the Commission's principal means of protecting investors from inadequate or improper financial reporting is by requiring a certificate of
an independent public accountant, based on an audit performed in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, which expresses an opinion as to whether the financial statements are presented
fairly in conformity with accounting principles and practices which
are recognized as sound and which have attained general acceptance.
The requirement of the opinion of an independent accountant is designed to secure for the benefit of public investors the detached objectivity of a knowledgeable person not connected with the management.
In order to keep abreast of changes and new developments in financial and economic conditions and in recognition of the need for a
continuous exchange of views and information between the Commission's staff and outside accountants regarding appropriate accounting and auditing policies, procedures and practices for the protection of
investors, the staff maintains continuing contact with individual accountants, other government agencies, and various professional organizations. These include the American Accounting Association, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the American
Petroleum Institute, the Financial Analysts Federation, the Financial
Executives Institute, and the National Association of Railroad and
Utilities Commissioners.
The Work of the Accounting Principles Board

In furtherance of the policy of cooperation between professional
organizations and the Commission, the Accounting Principles Board
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants met with
the Commission during the year to discuss its program for the improvement of accounting standards and practices through the issuance of
accounting opinions. The Board sponsors research studies of problem
areas in accounting to provide background information and factual
data which may be used in the formulation of its opinions. Drafts of

50

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

these studies and opinions are referred to the Commission's accounting
staff for review and comment prior to publication. A major opinion
issued during the year, entitled "Accounting for Income Taxes," provides for a more uniform application of tax allocation than has prevailed in the past. The Board also issued a statement on "Disclosure of
Supplemental Financial Information By Diversified Companies" in
which such companies were urged to disclose this type of information
voluntarily. (For the Commission's recent proposals in this area, see
pp. 13-14, 8ulyra.)
The Board has indicated that many major problem areas in accounting are under study with a view to the issuance of opinions in the
future. Among these are convertible debt and warrants, earnings per
share, intercorporate investments, materiality, research and development costs, price-level changes, goodwill and business combinations,
equity accounting, regulated industries, extractive industries, and
diversified companies.
Relations With the Accounting Profession and the Public

As part of the Commission's effort to maintain a continuing exchange of views with the accounting profession, the Chairman, other
Commissioners, the Chief Accountant and other members of the accounting staff accept speaking engagements and participate in panel
discussions at professional society meetings. In this way the Commission can indicate problem areas in accounting as to which it believes
the profession can aid in developing solutions. As an example, the
Chairman has spoken extensively on the need for more detailed reporting by diversified companies and for a study of the problems
involved. He has also urged companies to effect improvements on a voluntary basis. More recently he has urged the profession to restudy the
accounting principles applicable to business acquisitions or combinations in order to prevent abuses arising from inadequate restrictions
on the choice between the alternatives of purchase or pooling-of-interests accounting to be accorded such transactions. The Chief Accountant also accepts engagements to explain the work of the Commission
at colleges and universities throughout the country.
Because of its many foreign registrants and the vast and increasing foreign operations of American companies, the Commission has an
interest in the improvement of accounting and auditing principles and
procedures on an international basis. To promote such improvement the
Chief Accountant corresponds with foreign accountants, interviews
many who visit this country, and, on occasion, participates in international accounting conferences. In September 1967, he presented a report before the Ninth International Congress of Accountants in Paris,
France, on the topic "The International Harmonization of Accounting Principles." En route to this conference he participated in an

THIRTY-FOURTH

ANNUAL REPORT

51

International Congress on Accounting Education in London, England.
In October 1967 he participated in a panel discussion on the "conglomerate" problem at the 36th International Conference of the Financial Executives Institute in Montreal, Canada.
Other Current Developments

The Chief Accountant's Officeis currently engaged in revising the
accounting rules in Regulation S-X, the first general revision since
1950, in order to make changes, additions or eliminations that have
become necessary as a result of changing conditions over the years.
The revisions will be published for public comment in accordance with
established procedures.
During the fiscal year the Chief Accountant's Office considered a
question pertaining to the independence of accountants under Rule
2-01 (b) of Regulation S-X which has occurred frequently in recent
years as a result of the increasing international and multi-country
operations of United States corporations. The question arises in a
situation where a parent company requires auditing services for divisions or subsidiaries in countries where its independent accountants do
not practice and another accounting firm may be engaged to examine
the financial statements for such operations, which would be deemed
to be a nonmaterial segment of the international business. Heretofore
Rule 2-01 (b) has been construed to preclude all the partners of such
other accounting firm or of its affiliates from owning any securities of
the parent company or the subsidiary under audit if that accounting
firm is to be considered independent as to the parent company or such
subsidiary. In an interpretative release issued after the end of the
fiscal year,40 the Commission stated that, insofar as ownership of
securities by partners is concerned, the accounting firm performing
the audit of the subsidiary in these circumstances would be held to be
not independent only if securities of the parent company or the subsidiary are owned by any of the partners of that accounting firm or of
its affiliated firms who are located in the officewhich makes the examination or who are otherwise engaged in such examination.
The adoption by the Commission on October 3, 1967, of a revision
of Form X-17A-5 41 (the annual report of financial condition required
to be filed by brokers and dealers) reflects recognition of changing
conditions and practices in the securities industry and emphasizes the
importance of the independent accountant's review of both the financial statement and the effectiveness of the accounting system and procedures for safeguarding securities.

52

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

28, 1968,42 requires that

broker-dealers file comprehensive annual
financial reports reflecting their financial condition as of the end of the
year and the results of operations for the period. The background
and nature of this new rule are discussed elsewhere in this report.t"
The Chief Accountant and his staff cooperated with the Corrunission's Division of Trading and Markets in the preparation of a proposal for a rule prohibiting an issuer whose stock is publicly offered
or traded from misrepresenting the results of its operations by distributing stock dividends or their equivalent to shareholders unless the
issuer has earned surplus sufficient to cover the fair value of the shares
distributed.v The rule would not affect traditional stock splits involving the distribution of at least an additional share for each share
outstanding.
Pro rata stock distributions to stockholders in amounts which are
relatively small in relation to the number of shares outstanding are
a means of conveying the impression that a distribution is being made
out of the earned surplus of the company without the drain on current
assets that would result from the distribution of a cash dividend. Instances have recently come to the attention of the Commission in which
such distributions were utilized by companies having little or no earned
surplus, thus creating a misleading impression concerning the results
of operations of the company.
The proposed rule would prohibit any pro rata stock distribution
to stockholders which is designated as a stock dividend or is made in
amounts of less than 25 percent of the number of shares of the same
class outstanding prior to the distribution, unless the issuer has earned
surplus in an amount at least equal to the fair value of the shares so
distributed and has transferred such amount from earned surplus to
permanent capitalization. In the case of a pro rata distribution in
amounts ranging between 25 percent and 100 percent of the number
of shares outstanding, the requirement with respect to the existence
and transfer of the requisite amount of earned surplus would be applicable if the distribution is part of a recurring program.
These provisions would in substance codify long-standing views of
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as well as the
stan dards of the New York and American Stock Exchanges.
The proposed rule provides that the Corrunission may exempt any
activity otherwise prohibited by the rule, if it finds that the proposed
activity would not constitute a manipulative or deceptive device or
contrivance within the purposes of the rule. It is contemplated that

this exemptive provision will be narrowly construed and will be applied
by the Commission only in cases involving unusual circumstances.
Uesignation of Accountunts From Practice Before the Commission

On the basis of information furnished to the Commission during
the fiscal year, the Commission had reason to believe that in connection
with the preparation and submission of broker-dealers' financial statements pursuant to Rule 17a-5 under the Exchange ~\.ct two accountants may have failed to adhere to generally accepted auditing standards and the Commission's minimum audit requirements and that one
of them was in fact not independent.
The accountants tendered their resignations in which they agreed
not to appear or practice before the Commission in the future. The
Commission determined that in view of the resignations no proceedings pursuant to Rule 2 (e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice were
necessary and entered orders accepting the resignations."
D. CIVIL LITIGATION INVOLVING DISCLOSUUE MATTEUS

Summarized below are two significant civil court cases pending during the fiscal year which relate to disclosure matters. In one of these
cases the Commission participated as amicus curiae j the other case, in
which the Commission did not participate, is included because of its
significant impact upon the effectiveness of the statutory disclosure
provisions administered by the Commission. Civil court cases which
relate to other phases of the Commission's work, and in which the Commission participated either as a party or as amicus curiae during the
fiscal year, are discussed in Parts IV-VII of this report."
Escott v, BarOhris Oonstructioti Corp:" was an action brought
under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 by purchasers of BarChris securities who alleged that the company's registration statement
with respect to the securities was false and misleading. The defendants,
in addition to the corporation, included the company's directors and
officers who had signed the registration statement, the underwriters
and the auditors.
Each of the defendants, except the corporation itself, asserted as an
affirmative defense his due diligence in attempting to ascertain the
truth about the company. All of these defenses were rejected on
various grounds. With respect to two principal officers and directors
of the company, the court found that their limited education and
lack of financial expertise did not excuse their signing of a false

registration statement. The court found that one "outside" director,
who had only recently joined the board and had no actual knowledge
of the company's nffuirs, had a duty to make further inquiry before
he signed a registration statement since a prudent man would not
perform such an important act on the basis of sketchy information.
The court criticized the work of one director who was also counsel to
the issuer and did a "scissors and paste-pot job" in preparing the registration statement; the court stated that "as the director most directly
concerned with writing the registration statement and assuring its
accuracy, more was required of him in the way of reasonable investigation than could fairly be expected of a director who had no connection with this work," and added that an attorney is required to check
statements of his client which are easily verifiable. Similar negligence
was found on the part of the managing underwriter and its counsel,
who made some inquiry but relied in large part on statements by the
issuer. The other members of the underwriting group who made no
independent inquiry but relied on the manager were also found liable.
Finally, the court found that the accountants failed to meet their
obligation to make a reasonable investigation and did not even comply
with their own auditing standards.
In Sttnray DX Oil 00. v. Helmerioh di Payne, Inc./8 decided shortly
after the close of the fiscal year, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit agreed with the position taken by the Commission as amicus
curiae that it is improper to set forth in proxy soliciting material
numerical estimates of unproved oil reserves. The court quoted with
approval the view expressed by the Commission that
"It is altogether probable that investors unfamiliar with the technical aspects of the oil and gas business ... would ignore or misconstrue the technical but extremely significant difference between
'proved' and 'probable' oil reserves ... and would attribute to any
numerical estimates of probable reserves a degree of certainty
which is not warranted."
E. CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING DISCLOSURE VIOLATIONS

During the year convictions were obtained or indictments returned
in several cases referred by the Commission to the Department of
-Iustioe for criminal prosecution which involved noncompliance with
the Securities Act registration provisions, or the responsibility of
accountants who audit the financial statements of public corporations.

In a significant case litigated during the fiscal year, a well-known
financier, Louis Wolfson, and his business associate, Elkin B. Gerbert,
were convicted of conspiracy to violate and substantive violations of
the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.50 The
indictment alleged that the defendants conspired to sell and sold to
the public without registration a substantial block of stock owned by
the defendants and members of the .Wolfson family in Continental
Enterprises, Inc., a company controlled by 1Volfson which had accumulated a deficit of some $900,000 in its 8 years of existence. Wolfson was sentenced to 1 year imprisonment and fined $100,000, Gerbert
to 6 months imprisonment and fined $50,000. The convictions have
been appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Wolfson and Gerbert were again convicted during the year in an
unrelated case involving a Commission investigation into purchases
and sales of stock of Merritt, Chapman & Scott Corporation. In this
case, Wolfson (chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of Merritt, Chapman), Gerbert (a director of the corporation), Marshall G. Staub (president of Merritt, Chapman) and
Joseph Kosow (a Boston financier) were convicted on charges, among
others, of conspiring to obstruct justice in the investigation of Merritt,
Chapman.": Wolfson and Gerbert were also found guilty of committing perjury during the investigation, and 1Volfson and Staub
were convicted of issuing and filing with the Commission false annual
reports for Merritt, Chapman. A fifth defendant in the case, Alexander
Rittmaster, who had been a close financial consultant to Wolfson for
many years, pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count and testified as a
key government witness at the trial. In essence, the case involved the
execution and concealment from public shareholders of a scheme
whereby Kosow had entered into a clandestine agreement to buy
up a substantial block of Merritt, Chapman shares in nominee names
in the open market, from 1961 to 1964, with the assurance that the
corporation would thereafter repurchase the shares at a substantial
profit to him.
Another significant development during the fiscal year was the conviction of Lowell M. Birrell, who had been a fugitive from justice in
Brazil for several years until he returned to this country to face trial
in one of several pending cases in which indictments were outstanding against him. Birrell was found guilty in t he Southern District of
New York on charges of conspiring to sell unregistered stock of American Leduc Petroleum, Ltd., a defunct oil corporation, and to defraud
the purchasers of these securities as well as on substantive charges of
violating Section 5 of the Securities Act.52

SECURITIES

AND EXCHAL~GE COMMISSION

Several criminal prosecutions during the past fiscal year involved
the question of the criminal responsibility of certified public accountants who audit the financial statements of public corporations. For
instance, two partners and an audit manager of a large firm of certified public accountants were convicted of conspiring to prepare and
disseminate a false and misleading annual report to stockholders of
Continental Vending Machine Corporation and to file a false 10-I\:
report for that company with the Commission and the American Stock
Exchange, for the year ended September 30, 1962, and of mail fraud
by participating in a scheme to prepare a false and misleading annual
report to stockholders." The convictions are being appealed. The president and chairman of the board of Continental Vending had been
indicted on similar charges, but he pleaded guilty prior to trial and
testified as a government witness. The case centered around a scheme
whereby substantial sums were transferred over a period of years from
Continental Vending to another company also controlled by the president and board chairman and thence to the latter. At September 30,
1962, approximately $3.5 million had not been repaid to Continental.
The accountants certified the financial statements as of that date which
did not disclose the nature of the transfer of these funds or the fact
that they could not be repaid.
Another certified public accountant was named in an indictment
which is presently awaiting trial,54 in which it is charged that the
president of VTR, Incorporated, a company whose stock is listed on
the American Stock Exchange, his brother (a former director of
VTR and presently a director of three Florida financial institutions)
and their brother-in-law (a former employee of VTR and presently
president of one of the Florida financial institutions) had misappropriated approximately $1 million from VTR and had concealed the
misappropriations by making sham repayments to VTR at the end of
each year through check kites perpetrated through two financial institutions controlled by the defendants. The ostensible repayments were
immediately withdrawn from VTR in early January of each year.
The misappropriations and sham repayments were not disclosed in
VTR's financial statements, certified by the defendant accountant, and
filed with the Commission and the American Stock Exchange as part
of VTR's annual reports and proxy materials.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 securities issued, or guaranteed as to
both principal and interest, by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is required to file with the
Commission such annual and other reports with respect to such securiies as the Commission determines to be appropriate in view of the
special character of the Bank and its operations, and necessary in the
public interest or for the protection of investors. Pursuant to this
authority, the Commission has adopted rules requiring the Bank to
file quarterly reports and also to file copies of each annual report of the
Bank to its board of governors. The Bank is also required to file reports with the Commission in advance of any distribution in the
United States of its primary obligations. The Commission, acting in
consultation with the National Advisory Council on International
Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized to suspend the exemption at any time as to any or all securities issued or guaranteed by the
Bank during the period of such suspension. The following summary
of the Bank's activities reflects information obtained from the Bank.
The Bank reported a net income of $169.1 million for the fiscal year
ending J nne 30, 1968, before providing for a loss of $23.2 million
arising from currency devaluation during the year. This compared
with net earnings of $170 million in the fiscal year 1967.
The Executive Directors have allocated $75 million from the year's
net income as a grant to the Bank's affiliate, the International Development Association. The remaining portion of the year's earnings,
$94.1 million, will be transferred to the Bank's Supplemental Reserve.
After allowance for devaluation losses, this Reserve will amount to
$963 million. Total reserves, including the Special Reserve, will
amount to $1,254 million.
During the year, the Bank made 44 loans in 31 countries totaling
$847 million, compared with a total of $877 million last year (which
included a $100 million line of credit to the International Finance
Corporation). The loans were made in Argentina (2 loans), Brazil
(2), Ceylon, Republic of China (3), Colombia (3), Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Ethiopia, Gabon, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, India,
Iran (2), Israel, Ivory Coast, Korea, Malagasy Republic, Malaysia,
Mexico (3), Nicaragua (2), Pakistan, Papua and New Guinea, Peru,
Singapore (2), Spain, Sudan, Tanzania, Thailand (2), Tunisia and
Yugoslavia (2). This brought the total number of loans to 552 (including IFC) in 85 countries and territories and raised the gross total
of commitments to $11,518 million. By June 30, as a result of cancellations, exchange adjustments, repayments and sales of loans, the portion
of loans signed still retained by the Bank had been reduced to $7,57G
million.
During the year the Bank sold or agreed to sell $107 million principal amounts of loans, compared with sales of $69 million last year.

58

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

On June 30, the total of such sales was $2,143 million, of which all except $69 million had been made without the Bank's guarantee.
On June 30, the outstanding funded debt of the Bank was $3,289.6
million, reflecting a net increase of $214.3 million in the past year.
During the year the funded debt was increased through the public sale
of Can$15 million (US$13.9 million) of Canadian dollar bonds,
$300 million of US dollar bonds of which $159.4 million were sold
under delayed delivery arrangements, SwF75 million (US$17.5 million) of Swiss franc bonds, DM120 million (US$30 million) of

delivery arrangements. The debt was decreased through the retirement
of bonds and notes of $406.4 million, DM159.5 million (US$39.9
million) and SwF50 million (US$11.6 million), by purchase and
sinking fund transactions amounting to $55.9 million, and by $6
million as a result of the revaluation of outstanding pounds sterling
stock.
During the year The Gambia became a member of the Bank and the
following four countries increased their subscriptions to the Bank's
capital: Korea, Peru, Philippines and Viet-Nam. Thus on June 30,
1968, there were 107 member countries and the subscribed capital of
the Bank amounted to $22,941.9million.
Inter-American Development Bank

The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
United States to participate in the Inter-American Development Bank,
provides an exemption for certain securities which may be issued or
guaranteed by the Bank similar to that provided for securities of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted Regulation IA, which
requires the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same
information, documents and reports as are required from the International Bank for Reconstruotion and Development. The Bank is also
required to file a report with the Commission prior to the sale of any
of its primary obligations to the public in the United States. The following summary of the Bank's activities reflects information submitted
by the Bank to the Commission.
During the year ended June 30, 1968, the Bank made 17 loans
totaling the equivalent of $113,450,000 from its ordinary capital resources, bringing the net total of loan commitments outstanding, after
cancellations, to 157, aggregating $923,999,000. During the year, the
Bank sold or agreed to sell $8,913,059 in participations in the afore-

said loans, all of such participations being without the guarantee of
the Bank. The loans from the Bank's ordinary capital resources were
made in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru,
Uruguay and Venezuela. One regional loan was extended.
During the year the Bank also made 35 loans totaling the equivalent
of $291,285,000from its Fund for Special Operations, bringing the
gross total of loan commitments outstanding to 177, aggregating $1,045,551,000.The Bank made no loans during the year from the Social
Progress Trust Fund, which it administers under an Agreement with
the United States, leaving the gross total of loan commitments outstanding from that Fund at 117, aggregating $500,987,000.
On June 30, 1968,the outstanding funded debt of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank was the equivalent of $507,429,000,reflecting
a net increase in the past year of the equivalent of $64,535,000.During
the year the funded debt was increased through a public bond issue in
Belgium in the amount of BF300,000,000 (US$6 million), a public
offering in the United States of $60 million of bonds, the private
placement in Latin America of an issue of $43 million of short-term
dollar bonds, and the drawing under a loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of Japan of the equivalent of $6,735,000in Japanese yen. The funded debt was decreased through the retirement of
$45 million of short-term dollar bonds, adjustment by $1,200,000 in
US$ equivalent of English Sterling Stock through Pound Sterling
devaluation and US$5 million through Sinking Fund purchases.
The subscribed ordinary capital of the Bank on June 30, H)68,was
the equivalent of $1,778,830,000of which $1,395,180,000represented
callable capital.
Asian Development Bank

The Asian Development Bank Act adopted in March 1966authorizes
United States participation in the Asian Development Bank and
provides an exemption for certain securities which may be issued or
guaranteed by the Bank similar to the exemption accorded the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the InterAmerican Development Bank. Acting pursuant to this authority, the
Commission, during the fiscal year, adopted Regulation AD which
requires the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same
information, documents and reports as are required from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the InterAmerican Development Bank." The Bank is also required to file a
report with the Commission prior to the sale of any of its primary
obligations to the public in the United States.
As of June 30, 1968,the Bank had 32 members which had subscribed
to $970 million of capital stock, $615 million by 1D regional members

and $355 million by 13 nonregional members, including $200 million
by the United States. One-half of each member's subscription is
paid-in capital, and the other half is callable capital to provide backing for future borrowings by the Bank. As of June 30, 1968,the Bank
had not made any offering of bonds.
The Bank made its first loan from ordinary capital in January
1968, the equivalent of $5 million to the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand to finance foreign exchange components of the Corporation's loans in the private sector. The Bank loaned $2 million
equivalent to Ceylon in July 1968 for tea factory modernization; $6.8
million equivalent to Korea in September 1968 for the Seoul-Inchon
Expressway Project; and $7.2 million equivalent to Malaysia in September 1968 for the Penang Water Supply Project. During the year
ending June 30, 1968, the Bank extended technical assistance to Indonesia in the field of food production and distribution, to the Korean
Agriculture and Fishery Development Corporation, to the Philippines
in the field of water management, and to Viet-Nam in the field of
development finance.
G. TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939

This Act requires that bonds, debentures, notes, and similar debt
securities offered for public sale, except as specifically exempted, be
issued under an indenture which meets the requirements of the Act and
has been duly qualified with the Commission.
The provisions of the Act are closely integrated with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant to the Securities
Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture subject to the
Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective unless the
indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act designed to
safeguard the rights and interests of the purchasers. Moreover, specified information about the trustee and the indenture must be included
in the registration statement.
The Act was passed after studies by the Commission had revealed
the frequency with which trust indentures failed to provide minimum
protections for security holders and absolved so-called trustees from
minimum obligations in the discharge of their trusts. It requires that
the indenture trustee be free of conflicting interests which might interfere with the faithful exercise of its duties in behalf of the purchasers
of the securities. It requires also that the trustee be a corporation with
minimum combined capital and surplus; imposes high standards of
conduct and responsibility on the trustee; precludes preferential collection of certain claims owing to the trustee by the issuer in the event
of default; provides for the issuer's supplying evidence to the trustee
of compliance with indenture terms and conditions such as those re-

lating to the release or substitution of mortgaged property, issuance
of new securities or satisfaction of the indenture; and provides for
reports and notices by the trustee to security holders. Other provisions
of the Act prohibit impairment of the security holders' right to sue
individually for principal and interest except under certain circumstances, and require the maintenance of a list of security holders which
may be used by them to communicate with each other regarding their
rights.

REGULATION OF SECURITIES MARKETS
In addition to the disclosure provisions discussed in Part II of
this report, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gives the Commission important responsibilities over the securities markets and persons engaged in the securities business. Among other things, it requires
securities exchanges to register with the Commission, vests them with
important self-regulatory responsibilities subject to Commission
supervision, and authorizes the Commission to change or supplement
the rules of the exchanges where required in the public interest. The
Act requires the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers
doing business in the over-the-counter markets, provides for the registration of associations of brokers or dealers and supervised selfregulation by such associations, and contains provisions designed to
prevent fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices on
the exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets.
Developments and actions during the Ul68 fiscal year in these areas,
as well as statistical information concerning the securities markets,
are discussed in this and the next part of the report. Certain developments of particular significance, however, including those rela:ting
to the structure and level of commission rates on the exchanges, are
discussed in Part I.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES
Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

The Securities Exchange Act requires an exchange to be registered
with the Commission as a national securities exchange unless the
Commission exempts it from registration because of the limited volume of transactions effected. As of June 30, 1968, the following 13
stock exchanges were registered:
American Stock Exchange
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board of Trade
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange
National Stock Exchange

New York Stock Exchange
Pacific Coast Stock Exchange
Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington
Stock Exchange
Pittsburgh Stock Exchange
Salt Lake Stock Exchange
Spokane Stock Exchange

During fiscal year 1968, an order of the Commission terminating
the registration of the San Francisco Mining Exchange became
effective.'

Review of Exchange Rules and Procedures

Rule 17a-8 under the Exchange Act provides that each national
securities exchange must file with the Commission a report of any
proposed amendment to or other change in its rules and practices not
less than 3 weeks (or such shorter period as the Commission may
authorize) before taking any action to effectuate the change. These
proposals are submitted for review and comment to the Commission's
Branch of Regulation and Inspections of the Division of Trading and
Markets. The Division also reviews, on a continuing basis, the existing
rules, regulations, procedures, forms and practices of all national
securities exchanges in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the application and enforcement by the exchanges of their own rules; to
determine the adequacy of the rules of the exchanges, and of related
statutory provisions and rules administered by the Commission, in
light of changing market conditions; and to anticipate and define
problem areas so that members of the Commission's staff can meet with
representatives of the exchanges to work out salutary procedures
within the framework of cooperative regulation,"
Revisions in Exchange Member Trading Rules

In December 1967, the New York Stock Exchange upon the recommendation of the Commission adopted new provisions in its Floor
Trading Plan in order to clarify certain aspects of on-floor and offfloor trading, and to further restrict registered traders. Two of these
measures are designed to prevent an off-floor member from taking advantage of any news which he may receive prior to its dissemination
to the public. They deal with the manner in which members trading
from off the floor must transmit their orders to the floor, and provide
for a two-minute waiting period before off-floor members may trade
in a stock in which a block transaction has occurred. The New York
Stock Exchange Revised Rules also provide that a member who is not
a registered trader and who initiates off-floor orders after having been
on the floor that day must file a report of all such off-floortransactions.
The floor trading rules were amended further to restrict congregating
by registered traders when they are liquidating positions. The rule formerly applied only when registered traders were establishing or increasing positions.

SECURITIES

A~D EXCHANGE

COl\1MISSION

Acting on recommendations of the Commission, the American Stock
Exchange, in February 1968,published. a "Commentary" to its existing
rule on excessive dealing to restrict off-floor trading by members for
their own account. This "Commentary" stated that "The Exchange
expects that all trading by members and member organizations will
have a constructive effect on the market by adding to its orderliness
and liquidity." In addition, it outlined in specific terms what types of
off-floor activity would be viewed as excessive.
In January 1968, the American Stock Exchange Floor Trading
Plan was amended to correct an oversight in the original plan which
had exempted. registered traders and other members from the floor
trading rules in any transactions made by them to assist in difficult
market situations upon the request or approval of a floor official. This
exemption was revised to apply only to members who are not registered
traders, which was the intent when the Commission approved the
original Floor Trading Plan.
Revisions in Listing and DeIisling Standards

The various exchanges have rules and practices, generally referred
to as listing and delisting standards, governing admissions to and removals from their lists. During the past year both the New York and
American Stock Exchanges adopted more stringent standards. The
New York Stock Exchange raised its minimum standards for listing
as follows: net tangible assets from $10 million to $14 million; net
income before Federal income tax in the latest year from $2 million to
$2.5 million; number of stockholders of round lots from 1,700to 1,800;
number of shares publicly held from 700,000 to 800,000; and market
value of publicly held shares from $12 million to $14 million. The
criteria for continued listing were raised as follows: total number of
stockholders from 800 to 1,000; number of stockholders of round lots
from 700 to 900; number of shares publicly held from 300,000 to
400,000; market value of publicly held shares from $2.5 million to $4.0
million; net tangible assets from $5 million to $7 million; and average
net earnings for the last 3 years from $400,000to $600,000.4,
The American Stock Exchange raised its listing criteria as follows:
net tangible assets from $1 million to $3 million; earnings from
$150,000 for the last year ($100,000 average for last 3 years) to
$300,000 ($500,000 before taxes), plus a reasonable prospect of sustaining this level of earnings; number of shares publicly held from 250,000
to 300,000; market value of shares publicly held from $1,250,000 to
$2 million; total number of stockholders from 750 to 900; and total
number of stockholders of round lots from 500to 600.
• Net earnings are part of a combined criterion with either market value of
outstanding shares or net tangible assets of less than $7 million.

THIRTY-FOURTH

65

ANNUAL REPORT

The delisting standards of the American Stock Exchange were also
raised. One new standard provides that a company which has sustained
losses in each of the 2 most recent years must have net tangible assets
of at least $1 million and a company which has sustained losses in three
of the 4: most recent years must have net tangible assets of $3 million.
The previous requirement was that a company must have earnings in
at least one of the last 3 years. In addition, the number of shares
which must be publicly held was raised from 100,000 to 150,000; market
value of shares publicly held from $500,000 to $750,000; total number
of shareholders from 300 to 4:50; and number of round lot shareholders from 200 to 300. Under a new provision, the Exchange will
consider removing from its list a stock which has been selling for a
substantial period of time at a low price (generally below $5 per
share) if the issuer does not effect a reverse split of such shares within
a reasonable time after being notified by the Exchange that it deems
such action appropriate.
Dclisting of Securities From Exchanges

Under Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act and the Commission's Rule 12d2-2 thereunder, securities may be withdrawn or
stricken from listing and registration, upon application by an issuer
or an exchange, in accordance with the rules of the exchange and upon
such terms as the Commission may impose for the protection of investors. During the fiscal year ended .June 30, 1968, the Commission
granted applications by exchanges and issuers to remove 56 stock
issues, representing 53 issuers, and 4: bond issues from listing and registration. Since three stocks were each delisted by two exchanges, the
total of stock removals was 59, as follows:

The three applications by issuers which were granted during the
year resulted in the removal of one security each from the American,
Detroit and Pacific Coast Stock Exchanges.
The applications by exchanges are generally based upon one or more
of the following grounds: the number of shares of the issue in public
hands or the number of shareholders is insufficient; the market value

66

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of outstanding shares or the trading volume on the exchange is too
low; the issuer has failed to meet the exchange's requirements as to
earnings or financial condition; the issuer has failed to file required
reports with the exchange; or the issuer has ceased operations or is in
the process of liquidation.
Infiscal year 1968, the Commission issued several decisions granting
delisting applications by exchanges which were opposed by the issuers
of the securities. A particularly significant decision was rendered in
the case of American. Eleotronics, Inc.5 This case involved a delisting
policy of the American Stock Exchange that securities will be considered for delisting where the issuer's financial condition and/or operating results do not appear to warrant continued listing, and a specific
criterion adopted in furtherance of that general policy that delisting
will be considered if the issuer has not operated at a net profit in at
least one of the last 3 fiscal years. American Electronics had sustained
losses in 6 of its last 7 years but had a small net profit in one of the 3
years immediately prior to the deli sting application. It contended that
the more specific delisting "criteria" rather than the more general
"policies" should govern, and that a contrary position would permit
the Exchange to act arbitrarily and would raise antitrust questions.
The Commission rejected these arguments. It held that the exchange
may proceed on the basis of its stated policy to consider delisting
where an issuer's financial condition and/or operating results do not
warrant continued listing, and is not precluded from doing so because
of its adoption of more specific criteria in furtherance of the stated
policy. The Commission also stated:
"We cannot agree with the issuer's claim that rejection of its position would
permit the Exchange to delist in a discriminatory and unfair manner and
would render the Exchange's rules deficient under the Act and its actions
questionable under the antitrust laws. Such a rejection does not imply that the
Exchange has an unfettered discretion. The dellsting policies and procedures
of an exchange must be reasonably designed to carry out the purposes of the
Act and fairly administered, and particular delisting actions must be reasonably within the framework of the published policies. Indeed, exchange delisting
programs meeting these standards are, in our opinion, 'necessary to make the
Securities Exchange Act work.' The right of review of delisting applications by
us and, on appeal, by the courts affords an adequate safeguard against any
arbitrary or otherwise improper action. We believe the Exchange has complied
with the applicable standards in this case." [Footnotes omitted.]

TEITRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL

REPORT

The Commission further held that the issuer's stated expectations
of profitable operation in the current year and projected improvement
of its capital and working capital positions did not warrant postponement of delisting and it denied the issuer's requests for rehearing by
the exchange or a hearing by the Commission.
Inspections of Exchanges

Pursuant to the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act, the Commission actively oversees the discharge by the national securities exchanges of their self-regulatory responsibilities. As part of the program, the Branch of Regulation and Inspections in the Division of
Trading and Markets conducts regular inspections of various phases
of exchange activity. During the past fiscal year, the Branch conducted
inspections of the New York, Midwest, Boston, Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington, Pittsburgh and National Stock Exchanges. This
inspection program provides a means of ensuring exchange compliance
with regulatory responsibilities and enables the Commission to recommend improvements and refinements designed to increase the effectiveness of self-regulation.
In cases where it appears that revisions in internal policies are desirable in order to improve an exchange's performance, the Commission's staff communicates its views to the particular exchange and discusses the matters with exchange personnel to arrive at appropriate
sohrtions,
STATISTICS RELATING TO SECURITIES TRADED ON EXCHANGES
Number of Issuers and Securities

As of June 30, 1968, 4,831 stock and bond issues, representing 2,773
issuers, were admitted to trading on securities exchanges in the United
States. Of these, 4,628 securities issues (3,094 stock issues and 1,534
bond issues), representing 2,634 issuers, were listed and registered on
national securities exchanges, the balance consisting primarily of securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges and securities listed on
exempted exchanges. The listed and registered issues included 1,747
stock issues and 1,369 bond issues, representing 1,486 issuers, listed
and registered on the New York Stock Exchange. Thus, with reference
to listed and registered securities, 56.4 percent of the issuers, 56.5 percent of the stock issues and 89.2 percent of the bond issues were on the
New York Stock Exchange. Table 4 in the Appendix to this report
contains comprehensive statistics as to the number of securities issues
admitted to exchange trading and the number of issuers involved.
During the 1968 fiscal year, 241 issuers listed and registered securities on a national securities exchange for the first time, while the registration of all securities of 213 issuers was terminated. A total of 650
applications for registration of securities on exchanges was filed.

The aggregate value of shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange relative to the total share values on all exchanges eased during
1967, marking the first relative decline since 1961. The percentage of
the total share value accounted for by American Stock Exchange
stocks, on the other hand, rose for the first time since 1961 as prices
of stocks on that exchange experienced a relatively larger gain during the year than did New York Stock Exchange listed issues. The
percentage for stocks traded exclusively on other exchanges continued
to decline.

The ratio of share volume on the New York Stock Exchange to the
total on all exchanges showed a sharp drop in 1967, while the American Stock Exchange ratio rose to 28 percent, from 23 percent in 1966.
The American Stock Exchange percentage of share and dollar volume
has risen steadily since 1963, while the percentage of the New York
Stock Exchange has decreased. The regional exchange percentage of
both share and dollar volume declined slightly in 1967. In the first 6
months of 1968, the New York Stock Exchange share volume ratio
declined slightly further but its dollar volume ratio experienced a
steeper decline, as the American Stock Exchange dollar volume ratio
increased to 18 percent from 14 percent in 1967. Stocks, rights and
warrants are included in the following presentation. Annual data in
more detail are shown in Appendix Table 7 in this Annual Report.

Block Distributions Reported By Exchanges

The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities considered too large for the auction market on the floor of an exchange is
to resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the close of
exchange trading. There were 143 secondary distributions in 1967 COll1pared to 126 the preceding year. Nevertheless, the dollar value of the
shares sold in this manner declined 24 percent to $1,154.5 million. During the first 6 months of 1968, there were 74 secondary distributions
with a total value of $712.4million.
Special Offering Plans were adopted by many of the exchanges in
194:2,and Exchange Distribution Plans in 1953, in an effort to keep as
much trading as possible on their floors. Since 1962 there have been no
special offerings. Exchange distributions continued to decline from
the record of 72 in 19G3to 51 in 1967. However, the value of the 1967
exchange distributions was $125.4 million compared to $107.5 million
in 1963.

the fiscal year, from 10i3 to 97. The American Stock Exchange accounted for the entire decline except for one stock on the Honolulu
Stock Exchange. During the calendar year 1967, the reported volume
of trading on the exchanges in stocks with only unlisted trading privileges increased to about 38,065,577 shares, or about 0.85 percent of
the total share volume on all exchanges, from about 23,985,000shares,
or about 0.75 percent of share volume during calendar year 1966.
About 96 percent of the 1967 volume was on the American Stock
Exchange, while three other exchanges contributed the remaining 4
percent. The share volume in these stocks on the American Stock
Exchange represented 2.8 percent of the total share volume on that
exchange.
Unlisted trading privileges on exchanges in stocks listed and registered on other exchanges numbered 1,892 as of June 30, 1968. The
volume of trading in these stocks for the calendar year 1967 was
reported at about 148,841,743shares. About 86.4percent of this volume
was on regional exchanges in stocks listed on the New York or American Stock Exchanges. The remaining 13.6 percent was in stocks listed
on regional exchanges with the primary market on the American Stock
Exchange which had the unlisted trading. While the 148,841,743
shares amounted to only 9.8 percent of the total share volume on all
exchanges, they constituted major portions of the share volume of most
regional exchanges, as reflected in the following approximate percentages: Cincinnati 75.7 percent; Boston 92.5 percent; Detroit 73.4 percent; Philadelplua-Baltimore-Washington
81.6 percent; Pittsburgh
65.7 percent; Midwest 28.9 percent; and Pacific Coast 27.7 percent,"
Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, filed pursuant to Rule 12f-1 under Section
12(f) (1) (B) of the Securities Exchange Act, were granted by the

OVER-TIlE-COUNTER
TRADING IN COMMON STOCKS
NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES

TRADED

ON

In accordance with Rule 17a-9, since January 1965 brokers and
dealers who make markets in common stocks traded on national
securities exchanges (sometimes referred to as the ''third market")
have been reporting their trading over the counter and on exchanges
in the common stocks in which they make markets. They also report
certain off-board trading in other common stocks traded on exchanges.
Broker-dealers who are not market makers report their large third
market transactions. The reporting system is designed to reflect all
sales to persons other than broker-dealers, i.e., to individuals and
institutions. Since the beginning of 1967, reports have been required
only for common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
About 98 percent of over-the-counter volume in listed common stocks
is in New York Stock Exchange issues.
During the calendar year 1967, total over-the-counter sales of common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to
85.1 million shares valued at $4,152 million. This latter figure was the
equivalent of 3.3 percent of the dollar volume on the New York Stock
Exchange in common and preferred stocks. Third market volume in
1967 increased about 45 percent over the preceding year, an increase
which was proportionately larger than the increase in Exchange
volume,
In the first half of 1968, third market volume continued to increase
at a greater rate than Exchange volume. As a result, over-the-counter
dollar volume in New York Stock Exchange common stocks rose to
3.7 percent of the dollar volume in common and preferred issues on the
Exchange.

STATISTICAL STUDIES

The regular statistical activities of the Commission and its participation in the overall Government statistical program under the direction of the Office of Statistical Standards, Bureau of the Budget,
were continued during fiscal year 1968 in the Commission's Office of
Policy Research. The statistical series described below are published
in the Commission's monthly Statistical Bulletin. In addition, current figures and analyses of the data are published quarterly on new
securities offerings, individuals' saving, stock transactions of financial
institutions, financial position of corporations, and plant and equipment expenditures.
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly statistics are compiled on the number and volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type of security, and
use of proceeds. Summary statistics for the years 1935-68 are given in
Appendix Table 1 and detailed statistics for the fiscal year 1968 appear in Appendix Table 2.
New Securities Offerings

Monthly and quarterly data are compiled covering all new corporate and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United
States. The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also
issues privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration under the Securities Act, such as intrastate offerings and offerings
of railroad securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually offered for cash sale, and only issued offered for the account of
Issuers.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting, from the amount of
estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale of
securities, the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations to
investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements and
net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations
and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals' Saving

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of savings
and the form in which they occurred, such as investment in securities,
expansion of bank deposits, increases in insurance and pension reserves, etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the
personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce, derived
in connection with its national income series, is published annually by

76

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the Department of Commerce as well as in the Securities and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Private Noninsured Pension Funds

An annual survey is published of private pension funds other than
those administered by insurance companies, showing the flow of money
into these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested
and the principal items of income and expenditures. Quarterly data
on assets of these funds are published in the Statistical Bulletin.
Stock Transactions of Financial Institutions

A statistical series containing data on stock trading of four principal
types of financial institutions is published quarterly. Information on
purchases and sales of common stock by private noninsured pension
funds and nonlife insurance companies has been collected on a quarterly basis by the Commission since 1964; these data are combined with
similar statistics prepared for mutual funds by the Investment Company Institute and for life insurance companies by the Institute of
Life Insurance.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on the working capital position of all U.S. corporations,
excluding banks, insurance companies, investment companies and
savings and loan associations, shows the principal components of current assets and liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis
of the sources and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, compiles a quarterly financial report of all U.S. manufacturing concerns.
This report gives complete balance sheet data and an abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry and size of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant and
equipment expenditures of all U.S. business, exclusive of agriculture.
After the close of each quarter, data are released on actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next
two quarters. In addition, a survey is made at the beginning of each
year of the plans for business expansion during that year.
Directory of Registered Companies

The Commission annually publishes a list of companies required to
file annual reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.In addition to an alphabetical listing, there is a listing of companies by industry group classified according to The Standard Industrial Classification Manual.

TEITRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL

Stock Market Data

The Commission regularly compiles statistics on the market value and
volume of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges, roundlot stock transactions on the New York and American Stock Exchanges
for account of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock transactions on
the New York and American Stock Exchanges, odd-lot transactions
in 100 selected stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and block distributions of exchange stocks. Since January 1965,the Commission has
been compiling statistics on volume of over-the-counter trading in
common stocks listed on national securities exchanges (the so-called
"third market") based on reports filed under Rule 17a-9 of the Securities Exchange Act.
Data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the New York and American Stock Exchanges are released weekly. The other stock market
data mentioned above, as well as these weekly series, are published
regularly in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin.
Cost of Flotation of Security Issues

In calendar year 1967 the Commission began a study of the cost
of flotation of registered equity issues offered by issuing corporations
as well as selling shareholders for the years 1963-65.
Costs of flotation measure the initial costs of marketing securities,
i.e., the costs entailed in transmitting funds from the investor to the
issuing corporation. These costs are measured as the difference between
the price paid by the investor (gross proceeds) and the net amount
available to the issuer. They include compensation paid to underwriters, securities dealers, finders or agents, fees for lawyers and accountants, printing and engraving costs, Federal and State fees and other
expenses connected with the issuance of securities. The current study
covers initial costs of flotation only and does not attempt to measure
or compare the net cost of raising capital. Consequently, insofar as
possible, costs riot pertinent to the initial flotation, such as advertising
charges for redemption notices or trustees' charges for continuing
services, are excluded from the study. Moreover, this study only
attempts to cover cash compensation; noncash compensation such as
options-an important cost in the distribution of some smaller, more
speculative securities-is omitted because of problems of valuation.
Costs of flotation studies have been prepared by the Commission at
various times with the last study covering the years 1951, 1953 and
1955. The current study, however, will be broader in coverage and
more comprehensive in its analysis. For example, the study will cover
all types of securities which represent ownership interests in a business or which are convertible into or represent a call on such securities.
Costs will be analyzed for each type of equity securities to show
327-506--68----7

78

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

differences or similarities between limited partnership interests and
common stock as well as for preferred stocks and convertible bonds.
Moreover, the study will cover issues offered through securities
dealers-either
as an offering to the general public or to stockholders-as well as those sold directly by the issuer. Also, the current
study incorporates into the analyses factors influencing costs not
covered in past studies. Among these factors are the market place for
outstanding securities of the issuer and the offering price of the issues
in the case of common stocks.

of interstate commerce in the conduct of an
over-the-counter securities business to register with the Commission.
Similarly, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which establishes a
pattern of regulation comparable to that established by the Exchange
Act with respect to brokers and dealers, requires the registration of
investment advisers, with certain exceptions.
As of June 30,1968,4,397 broker-dealers and 2,007 investment advisers were registered. Both these figures reflect substantial increases
during the year. The increase of 275 in investment adviser registrations is particularly striking.

During the fiscal year, the Commission amended both Form BD
(broker-dealer application for registration) and Form ADV (investment adviser application for registration) and Rules 15b3-1 under
the Exchange Act and 204-1 under the Advisers Act,' effective September 1, 1968. The amendments were designed, among other things,
to provide additional information to assist the Commission in performing its regulatory functions. In this connection, the revised forms
will elicit detailed information concerning the direct or indirect control by the applicant or registrant of any other organization engaged
in the securities or investment advisory business, the nature of any
other business conducted by it and financing to be provided by persons
other than the named principals. The additional information required
will assist not only the Commission and State regulatory authorities,
but also members of the public who examine the forms. Additionally,
the amendments were designed to achieve substantial uniformity between Forms BD and ADV and the forms used by many of the State
regulatory authorities for registration of brokers and dealers and investment advisers. State regulatory bodies of 32 States have either
adopted or are considering the adoption of forms which would result
in the acceptance of applications and amendments on revised Forms
BD and ADV as meeting State requirements if supplemented by any
additional information required by State law or regulation. A third'
purpose of the amendments was to modernize procedures to conform
with technological advances in the maintenance of records and retrieval of information. Broker-dealers and investment advisers who
are already registered will have to file a complete revised form, no
later than December 31, 1968.
The Commission also amended Rule 203-2 under the Investment
Advisers Act and adopted a new form, Form ADV -
W, to be used by
investment advisers seeking to withdraw from registration with the

Commission." Form ADV-W requires specified information concerning, among other things, the arrangements made with respect to winding up the affairs of the business, including arrangements made for
paying or delivering any funds or securities owed to clients and refunds on uncompleted investment advisory contracts. The information furnished will enable the Commission to determine whether the
business is being terminated in compliance with applicable requirements and whether an investigation or administrative proceedings are
necessary. The amended rule provides for a 60-day waiting period
between the filing of Form ADV-vV and the effective date of the
registrant's withdrawal, unless acceleration is granted or proceedings
are instituted by the Commission. The 30-day period previously provided by the rule was too short to permit the necessary determinations
to be made.
The Commission participated during the fiscal year as amicus curiae
in Eastside Ohurch of Ohrist v, National Plan, Inc.,3 a case dealing
with the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act. The decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
in this case was generally in accord with the views expressed in the
Commission's amicus brief. The court held that a company which was
engaged in the business of directing bond sales programs for churches,
and which purchased many church bonds for its own account as a part
of its regular business and sold some of them, was both a broker and a
dealer within the meaning of the Act. The court further held that
transactions in which this company purchased bonds from certain
churches in violation of the statutory provision which prohibits an
unregistered broker-dealer from effecting securities transactions could
be voided by the selling churches. In rejecting the company's contention that the churches must establish that any harm which they suffered
was caused by the company's failure to register, the court stated that
"it is sufficient to show merely that the prohibited transactions occurred and that [the sellers] were in" the "class of persons whose interest the Act was designed to protect." The court added:
"The requirement that brokers and dealers register is of the utmost importance in effecting the purposes of the Act, It is through the registration
requirement that some discipline may be exercised over those who may
engage in the securities business and by which necessary standards may be
established with respect to training, experience, and records."

The court held that the churches could recover from the company
with respect to transactions in which the company purchased bonds
from a certain individual who was acting as the churches' agent in
'Investment Advisers .Act Release No. 213 (November 13, 1967).
3391 F. 2d 357 (CA. 5, 1968), certiorari denied, 37 U.S. L.W. 3151 (U.S. Oct. 21,
1968).

effecting the transactions. Recovery was not permitted, however, with
respect to bonds which that individual purchased outright from the
churches and then resold to the company. In denying recovery in the
latter situation, the court stated: "This is on the theory that the church
would be a stranger to the transaction."
Capital Requirements with Respect to Broker-Dealers.c-Rule
15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, commonly known as the net capital
rule, imposes minimum net capital requirements on brokers and
dealers. In addition, it limits the amount of indebtedness which may
be incurred by a broker-dealer in relation to its capital, by providing
that the "aggregrate indebtedness" of a broker-dealer may not exceed
20 times the amount of its "net capital" as computed under the rule.
During the fiscal year, the Commission amended the net capital rule
with regard to the prescribed deduction to be made from the market
value of convertible debt securities in the computation of the "net
capital" of a broker or dealer subject to the rule.'
Inthe Report of the Special Study of the Securities Markets, it was
pointed out with respect to convertible debt securities that, when "the
price of the underlying stock is below the conversion price, it is probable that there is a greater tendency for the bonds to sell as debt securities," and, conversely, that when the market value of the securities
exceeds their face value, they tend to be treated in the market as stock,"
It is also common knowledge that, at certain market levels, convertible
debt securities attain a hybrid quality and are treated in the market as
part stock and part debt.
Despite these characteristics, prior to the recent amendment the
deduction of 30 percent of market value, which is applied to common
stock in computing net capital, was also applied to convertible debt
securities. By contrast, the deductions applicable to straight debt securities are computed on a sliding scale from 5 percent to 30 percent
of market value, the applicable percentage depending on the difference between face value and market value when the market price is
between 70 and 100. If the market price is 70 or below, the deduction
is a straight 30 percent.
Under the amendment, a convertible debt security which is not in
default and which has a fixed maturity date and rate of interest is
given the same deduction as a straight debt security when its market
value is below 90 percent of face value. If the market price is between
90 and 115, the convertible debt security is treated as a hybrid security
to which a 30 percent deduction is applied with the proviso that the
value of the security for net capital computation purposes shall in no
event be less than 80 percent of the face value. At a market price of

REPORT

83

115 and above, the percentage deduction for such a security becomes
a straight 30 percent, the same deduction as applies under the rule
to common stock.
Financial Reports of Broker-Dealers-s-Rule l'7a-5 under the Exchange Act requires registered broker-dealers to file annual reports
of financial condition with the Commission. These reports must be
certified by a certified public accountant or public accountant who is
in fact independent, with certain limited exemptions applicable to
situations where certification does not appear necessary for customer
protection. During the fiscal year 4,039 reports were filed with the
Commission.
These reports enable the Commission and the public to determine
the financial position of broker-dealers. They provide one means by
which the staff of the Commission can determine whether a brokerdealer is in compliance with the net capital rule. Failure to file required reports may result in the institution of administrative proceedings to determine whether the public interest requires remedial
action against the registrant.
During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted a general revision
of Form X-17A-5, the annual report of financial condition," The
revisions of the form and related audit requirements reflect changing
conditions and practices in the securities industry and are based on
the experience gained from examination of reports filed with the
Commission over the years. Among other things, the audit requirements were expanded to require the independent accountant to comment on any material inadequacies in the broker-dealer's accounting
system, internal account control or procedures for the safekeeping
of securities and to report any corrective action taken or proposed.
Rule 17a-5 was amended to provide that the accountant's comments,
if bound separately, would be deemed confidential.
The adoption of new Rule 17a-l0, providing for annual brokerdealer reports of income and expenses, is discussed in a prior section
of this report.'
Regulation of Broker-Dealers Who Are Not Members of Registered Securities
Association

During the fiscal year, the Commission continued to be active in its
regulatory activities with respect to "nonmember" brokers and dealers
(i.e., those who are not members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) ) which are designed to provide regulation
comparable to that imposed by the NASD on its membership. This
regulatory program is known as the SECO program. During the year
the number of nonmember broker-dealers increased from 462 to 495,

One of the requirements applicable to nonmember broker-dealers is
that each associated person engaged in specified securities activities
pass a general securities examination prescribed by the Commission or
an examination deemed by the Commision to be a satisfactory alternative. Such alternative examinations include, thus far, those given by
certain of the national securities exchanges, the NASD, the NAIC
(in connection with variable annuities), and many States. During the
fiscal year, 1,644 associated persons qualified by passing the Commission's examination, and approximately 4,356 others qualified by passing an alternative examination.
During the year, the Commission amended Rule 15b9-1 and adopted
Rule 15b9-2 to provide a permanent fee structure for nonmember
hroker-deulers." Prior to its amendment Rule 15b9-1 covered both
initial and annual fees. Now, 15b9-1 deals with initial fees while

85

15b9-2 deals with annual fees which include a base fee applicable to
all broker-dealers, a fee for associated persons and a fee for each office
maintained by the broker-dealer. For purposes of simplification, the
new rules prescribe the fee structure and the actual fees will be set
each year in the applicable forms required to be filed.
Under the inspection program for nonmember broker-dealers 98 inspections were conducted during the year. In addition to matters
normally covered in broker-dealer inspections, these inspections were
designed to determine compliance "with SECO rules and to obtain
information which will prove helpful in the further development of
the SECO program.
During the fiscal year, continuing efforts were made to cooperate
with State authorities in coordinating regulatory activities involving
nonmember broker-dealers. Certain State examinations were reviewed
and determined to be satisfactory alternatives to the Commission's
general securities examination. Other cooperative efforts included the
initial preparation of a new form which would combine Form SECO-2
and a uniform State form for applications of associated persons. The
new form is expected to be recommended for adoption in the next
fiscal year.
Also during the year, the Commission improved the processing and
utilization of applications by associated persons with the adoption of
a system for placing the information contained in Forms SECO-2
on the Commission's computer.
On July 27, 1967, Rules 15bl0-l through 15bl0-7 under Section
15(b) (10) were adopted by the Commission, effective October 2,
1967.9 The new rules, discussed in detail in the previous annual reo
port," established standards of general business conduct, suitability
of recommendations and supervision of associated persons, regulate
discretionary accounts and impose record keeping requirements. At the
present time, the Commission's staff is engaged in drafting additional
rules under Section 15(b) (10) concerning advertising and sales literature of nonmember broker-dealers.
During the fiscal year the Commission issued its first decision concerning a violation of the rules covering nonmember broker-dealers.
The case, Associated Securities, Inc.,ll resulted in the revocation of
the registration of the broker-dealer. In addition to violations of the
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the
Commission found that the registrant, aided and abetted by its officers, had willfully violated Sections 15(b) (8) and 15(b) (9) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 15b8-1, 15b8-2 and 15b9-1 thereunder by
permitting associated persons to engage in securities activities when

Forms SECO-2 had not been filed with respect to them and the required filing fees had not been paid, and by filing a false and misleading Form SECO-4-67 which understated the number of persons associated with the registrant and the fees to be paid with respect to
them.
Detection of Improper

Practices

Public Complaints.- The Commission has various sources of information concerning possible violations of the Federal securities laws.
A primary source is complaints by members of the general public
concerning the activities of certain persons in securities transactions.
During fiscal 1968 the Commission received some 3,400 complaints
from investors and others relating to broker-dealers and investment
advisers. The Commission's staff gives careful consideration to such
complaints and, if violations are indicated, an investigation may be
commenced. Other outside sources of information include the stock
exchanges, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., brokerage firms, State and Canadian securities authorities, better business
bureaus, and various law enforcement agencies.
Inspections.- The program of surprise inspections of brokerdealers and investment advisers by the Commission's staff is another
important device for the detection of improper practices. During fiscal 1968, 514 broker-dealer inspections and 165 investment adviser
inspections were carried out. These inspections produced indications
of various types of infractions, as shown below:

Section of Securities Violations.-A
Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission as a part of its enforcement
program to provide a further means of detecting and preventing fraud
in securities transactions. This Section maintains files which contain
information concerning persons who have been charged with, or found
in violation of, various Federal and State securities statutes, as well
as considerable information concerning Canadian violators. These files
play a valuable role in the Commission's enforcement program and
provide a clearinghouse for other enforcement agencies. The information in the files is kept current through the cooperation of various governmental and nongovernmental agencies.
During the fiscal year, the Section received 3,366 "securities violations" letters either providing or requesting information and dispatched 1,899 communications to cooperating agencies. Among other
matters, information was received from several States and Canada
respecting 106 criminal actions, 39 injunctive actions, 142 actions in
the nature of cease and desist orders and 140 other administrative
orders, such as denials, suspensions and revocations of registrations of
issuers, broker-dealers and salesmen. Information with respect to 4,574
persons or firms was added to the files, including information regarding 1,847 persons and .firms not previously identified. As of the end of
the 1968 fiscal year, the files contained information concerning 77,323
persons and firms.
Use of Computer for Name Searches.- The use of the Commission's
computer for "name searches" in the enforcement program has resulted
in a substantial increase in the amount of information available and
the speed with which it can be obtained. The names of suspected securities law violators are checked against the more than 1 million entries
presently stored in the computer. Upon request, the Commission also
performs "name searches" on prospective securities salesmen and
others whose names are submitted by the exchanges, the NASD and the
State securities commissions. If the subject checked has been named
in formal filings with the Commission, has been a party to a proceeding, or has been involved in an investigation, such information, together with pertinent dates, relationships and cross references, is available immediately on a printout. Formerly a time-consuming manual
search of indices and files was required.
Investigations

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically authorizes it to conduct investigations to determine whether violations
of the Federal securities laws have occurred.

88

SECURITIES

A.."N"D
EXCHANGE

COl'.iM!SSION

The nine regional officesof the Commission are chiefly responsible
for the conduct of investigations. In addition, the Officeof Enforcement of the Division of Trading and Markets at the Commission's
headquarters office conducts investigations dealing with matters of
particular interest or urgency, either independently or with the assistance of the regional offices.The Office of Enforcement also exercises
general supervision over and coordinates the investigative activities
of the regional offices and recommends appropriate action to the
Commission.
It is the Commission's general policy to conduct its investigations
on a confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary to effective law enforcement and to protect persons against whom unfounded or unconfirmed charges might be made. The Commission investigates many
complaints where no violation is ultimately found to have occurred.
To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily result in
hardship or embarrassment to many interested persons and might
affect the market for the securities involved, resulting in injury to
investors with no countervailing public benefits. Moreover, members
of the public would tend to be reluctant to furnish information concerning violations if they thought their personal affairs would be made
public. Another advantage of confidential investigations is that persons suspected of violations are not made aware that their activities
are under surveillance, since such awareness might result in frustration or obstruction of the investigation. Accordingly, the Commission
does not generally divulge the results of a nonpublic investigation
unless it is made a matter of public record in proceedings brought
before the Commission or in the courts.
When it appears that a serious violation of the Federal securities
laws has occurred or is occurring, a full investigation is conducted.
Under certain circumstances it becomes necessary for the Commission
to issue a formal order of investigation which designates members of
its staff as officers to issue subpoenas, take testimony under oath and
require the production of documents. During the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1968,the Commission issued 166 such formal orders.
The following table reflects in summarized form the investigative
activities of the Commission during fiscal 1968:

Imposition of Sanctions

Where enforcement action appears appropriate, the Commission
may proceed in one of several ways, although the use of one procedure
may not necessarily preclude the use of another with respect to the
same conduct. The Commission may: (1) institute administrative
proceedings, (2) institute civil proceedings in the appropriate U.S.
district court to enjoin further violations of law, or (3) refer the case
to the Department of Justice or appropriate local enforcement authorities for criminal prosecution.
Administrative Proceedings.-Under
the Securities Exchange Act,
as amended in 1964,the Commission has available to it a wide range of
administrative sanctions which it may impose against brokers and
dealers and persons associated with them. The Commission may deny
a broker-dealer's application for registration. 'With respect to a brokerdealer already registered, it may impose sanctions ranging from censure through suspension of registration to revocation of registration.
It may also suspend or terminate a broker-dealer's membership in a
stock exchange or registered securities association. Associated persons
of broker-dealers may be censured, or suspended or barred from association with any broker-dealer. Under the Investment Advisers Act,
the Commission may impose comparable sanctions against investment
advisers, but has no authority to take direct disciplinary action against
persons associated with investment advisers.
The Commission may impose a sanction only if, after notice and
opportunity for hearing, it finds that (1) the respondents committed
willful violations of the securities acts or are subject to certain disqualifications, such as convictions or injunctions relating to specified
types of misconduct, and (2) a particular sanction is in the public
interest.

pending during fiscal 1968 with respect to brokers and dealers and

Formal administrative proceedings under the statutes administered
by the Commission generally culminate in the issuance of an opinion
and order. Where hearings are held, the hearing officer who presides
normally makes an initial decision following the hearings, unless such
decision is waived by the parties. Under an amended procedure which
went into effect in April 1966, the initial decision includes an appropriate order. If Commission review is not sought, and if the case is not
called up for review on the Commission's own initiative, the initial
decision becomes the final decision of the Commission.
In those instances where it prepares its own decision upon review
or waiver of an initial decision, the Commission or the individual
Commissioner to whom a case may be assigned for the preparation of
an opinion is generally assisted by the Office of Opinions and Review.
This Office is directly responsible to the Commission and is completely
independent of the operating divisions of the Commission, consistent
with the principle of separation of functions embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act. Where the parties to a proceeding waive their
right to such separation, the operating division which participated
in the proceeding may assist in the drafting of the Commission's
decision.
The Commission's opinions are publicly released and are distributed
to the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, they are printed and published periodically by the Government
Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and Exchange
Commission Decisions and Reports."
A few of the more significant decisions of the Commission in administrative proceedings with respect to broker-dealers and investment
advisers are summarized in the following paragraphs: 12
In Walston &: 00., bW.,13 involving the sale by the respondent brokerdealer of tax-exempt bonds of a special assessment district, the Commission found, on the basis of offers of settlement accompanied by a

stipulation of facts, that the respondent failed to disclose to customers that the district was formed for the benefit of a promoter of a
speculative real estate development and consisted of one tract of undeveloped land owned by the promoter, that the promoter had no prior
experience in selling real estate and had no financial ability to service
the bonds, and that the service of the bonds depended entirely on the
sale of lots, In finding that the firm and the manager of a division of
its municipal bond department had willfully violated the anti-fraud
provisions of the securities laws, the Commission stated that" [i]t is incumbent on firms participating in an offering and on dealers recommending municipal bonds to their customers as 'good municipal
bonds' to make diligent inquiry, investigation and disclosure as to
material facts relating to the issuer of the securities and bearing upon
the ability of the issuer to service such bonds." In view of the facts,
among others, that the firm had been active in efforts to salvage the
rights of bondholders, repurchased bonds from customers and instituted procedures to provide greater control over the handling of bond
offerings, the Commission accepted offers of settlement providing for
censure of the firm and the manager, suspension of the activities of
the firm's municipal bond department for 30 days, and suspension of
the manager from association with a broker or dealer for 6 months.
The Commission reemphasized the importance of a broker's fiduciary
obligation to secure the best price for its customers in Thomson. & M 0Kinnon,14 a decision involving "interpositioning," i.e., the interposing
of a second broker-dealer between the customer and the best available
market. On the basis of facts stipulated in connection with an offer
of settlement, the Commission found that the firm engaged in a systematic practice over a prolonged period of interposing several other
broker-dealers between itself and the market makers in certain over-thecounter securities. The firm engaged in this practice primarily to reciprocate for listed business referred to it by the interposed brokerdealers and to reward them for furnishing certain services. The Commission also found that the firm and the partner in charge of the overthe-counter stock department failed to exercise reasonable supervision
to prevent the violations. In view of certain mitigating factors, including the fact that the NASD had sanctioned the respondents for
part of the same misconduct and that improved internal procedures
had been adopted, the Commission accepted the offer of settlement and
ordered the suspension of the firm's over-the-counter stock department
for 7 days and suspended the partner from association with any
broker-dealer for 35 days.

things, that the firm had authorized, if not encouraged, the solicitation of orders for a speculative stock on the basis of unconfirmed and
extravagant reports or rumors, and had instructed sales personnel
to transmit such reports to persons who in the salesmen's judgment
could afford to lose money or would not complain if they did, in a
situation where losses were or could reasonably be anticipated. The
Commission stated:
"Since broker-dealers and their associated persons hold themselves out as
professionals in the securities business, a report disseminated by them in connection with recommending a security, notwithstanding the fact that customers
are advised that the report is unconfirmed, gains in authority and credibility.
Under these circumstances, the use of such reports as part of a sales pitch was
contrary to the basic obligation of a broker-dealer to deal fairly with the
investing public." [Footnotes omitted.]

As in the past, a number of cases decided during the year dealt
with campaigns by broker-dealers to sell highly speculative securities
by means of a concerted high pressure sales effort including the use
of false and misleading representations and predictions, and without
regard to the financial needs and objectives of their customers. Among
these cases were Oent'wry Securities Oompany 16 and Billings Associates, Inc;" In each case the Commission revoked the broker-dealer
registrations of the firms and barred various individuals who, as
principals or salesmen, participated in the fraudulent schemes, from
being associated with a broker or dealer.
Among court decisions affirming Commission orders in broker-dealer
and investment adviser proceedings were the following:
In Hansen v, S.E.0.,18 the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit held that in a proceeding to determine whether an
application for registration as a securities broker should be denied, the
Commission did not commit error in admitting into evidence the record
of a prior administrative proceeding involving the same transactions.
In the prior proceeding Hansen had declined an opportunity to participate as a party; and in the later proceeding he was given an opportunity to, and did, cross-examine the witnesses whose testimony
was contained in the record of the prior proceeding.

of the issues argued in the court of appeals was whether the proper
standard of proof in an administrative broker-dealer proceeding is
the preponderance of the evidence, as the Commission had held, rather
than the more rigorous standards used in criminal and certain types
of civil cases. Although the court issued no opinion, its affirmance of
the Commission's order necessarily decided this issue in favor of the
preponderance standard applied by the Commission.
In Lawrence v. S.E.O.r decided shortly after the close of the fiscal
year, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in affirming a Commission order based upon a finding of violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, held
that the use of interstate facilities to clear a check used as payment in
a fraudulent transaction was sufficient to establish Federal jurisdiction even though all meetings and negotiations regarding that transaction took place within a single State. The court also ruled that a
written commitment to deliver securities in the :future is itself a security within the meaning of both Acts.
In M arketlinee, Inc. v. S.E.O.,22 the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit affirmed an order of the Commission revoking Marketlines'
registration as an investment adviser. The Commission's order had been
based in part upon Marketlines' publication and distribution of false
and misleading advertisements of its market letters. The court stated
that "the Commission could properly conclude that the entire content
and tone of the advertisements was designed to whet the appetite of the
unsophisticated." In rejecting Marketlines' contention that the Commission had erred in evaluating the advertisements in terms of their
impact on unsophisticated investors, the court stated that "the Commission's duty to protect the gullible is apparent" and that "it is not
improper to judge advertisements by their impact on the segment
of the public at which they are aimed."
Civil Proceedings.- Each of the several statutes administered by
the Commission authorizes the Commission to seek injunctions in the
Federal district courts against continuing or threatened violations of
those statutes or the Commission's rules thereunder. Injunctive actions
frequently are directed against broker-dealers and persons associated
with them, and in such cases the complaint may allege noncompliance
with various regulatory provisions such as the net capital and books
and records requirements, as well as violations which may be committed by any person such as securities sales or purchases in violation
of the anti-fraud or registration provisions of the securities acts.23

CriminalProsecution.- The statutes administered by the Commission provide that the Commission may transmit evidence of violations
of any provisions of these statutes to the Attorney General, who in turn
may institute criminal proceedings. Where an investigation by the
Commission's staff indicates that criminal prosecution is warranted, a
detailed report is prepared. After careful review the Office of Criminal Reference and Special Proceedings and the General Counsel's
Office,the report and the General Counsel's recommendations are considered by the Commission, and if the Commission believes criminal
proceedings are warranted the case is referred to the Attorney General and to the appropriate U.S. Attorney. Commission employees
familiar with the case generally assist the U.S. Attorney in the presentation of the facts to the grand jury, the preparation of legal memoranda for use in the trial, the conduct of the trial, and the preparation
of briefs on appeal.
.
During the past fiscal year 40 cases were referred to the Department
of Justice for prosecution. As a result of these and prior referrals, 42
indictments were returned against 123 defendants, including 24
broker-dealers and broker-dealer principals and 15 broker-dealer
employees. Convictions were obtained against 84 defendants in 34
cases, including 6 broker-dealers and broker-dealer principals and
15 broker-dealer employees. Convictions were affirmed in 5 cases, and
appeals were still pending in 9 other criminal cases at the close of the
period.w
Among the many important criminal prosecutions initiated during
the year were the following: an indictment of four persons for violating the short sale provisions of Section 10(a) and Rule 10a-1 of the
Exchange Act in connection with alleged illegal short sales of GeorgiaPacific Corporation stock over the New York Stock Exchange; 25 an
indictment of a registered representative and two back-officeemployees
in Texas branch officesof a New York Stock Exchange member firm,
charging the misappropriation of customers' funds and securities and
the unauthorized execution of securities and commodities transactions
for the purpose of obtaining funds to finance their personal speculative
securities and commodities trading accounts; 26 an indictment of a

history of the Federal securities laws, criminal violations of Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, relating to the extension and

a Florida attorney for wilfully evading compliance with a Commission
investigatory subpoena;"
In United States v. Ligld/9 the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit affirmed the convictions of several defendants of conspiracy
to violate the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and
the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes in the sale of securities of two
companies through two brokers. One ground of appeal was that the
trial court erred in denying the defense motion to suppress certain
books and records of a broker which had been voluntarily turned over
to the Commission during a civil injunction proceeding and were later
delivered by the Commission's staff to the U.S. Attorney. In rejecting
the contention that use of the books and records in the criminal proceeding was illegal because there was no consent to their delivery to
the prosecution, the court noted that the documents seized were "public
records" required by law to be kept and made available to the Commission and stated that

,,* * * once records have been voluntarily turned over to a government
agent, the government is not guilty of fraud or deceit in failing to apprise
the subject of a change in the character of the investigation, for he is made
aware of the risks attendant upon a voluntary disclosure by the warning
inherent in the request."
The court further observed that even assuming, arguendo, that the
Commission violated its agreement to return the documents and not
make them available to anyone else, the Fourth Amendment would not
bar their admission into evidence in the absence of a showing that
they were originally obtained through fraud and deceit.
Supervision of Activities of National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

Section 15A of the Exchange Act provides for registration with
the Commission of national securities associations and establishes
standards and requirements for such associations. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) is the only association
registered under the Act. The Act contemplates that such associations
will serve as a medium for self-regulation by over-the-counter brokers
and dealers, subject to general supervision by the Commission. Their
rules must be designed to protect investors and the public interest, to
promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to meet other
statutory rquirements. The Commission is authorized to review disciplinary actions takQll by them, to disapprove changes in their rules,
and to alter or supplement their rules relating to specified matters.
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of national securities associations, Congress provided an incentive to
membership by permitting such associations to adopt rules which

preclude a member from dealing with a nonmember broker or dealer
except on the same terms and conditions as the member affords the
general public. The NASD has adopted such rules. As a result, membership is necessary to profitable participation in underwritings since
members may grant price concessions, discounts and similar allowances
only to other members.
During the fiscal year, the NASD's membership increased by 111
to a total of 3,770 members by the end of the year. This increase was
the net result of 344 admissions to and 233 terminations of membership. At the same time, the number of branch officesincreased by 662
to a total of 5,945 as a result of the opening of 1,169 new officesand
the closing of 507 others. During the year the number of registered
representatives and principals, categories which together include all
partners, officers, traders, salesmen and other persons employed by
or affiliated with member firms in capacities which involve doing business directly with the public, increased by 18,358 to an all-time high
of 108,883 as of June 30, 1968. This increase, which was the net
result of 26,268 initial registrations, 13,466 re-registrations and 21,376
terminations of registrations, was attributable in part to an increase
in the number of insurance companies entering the securities business
for the purpose of offering shares of mutual funds and/or interests
in variable annuities to the investing public, and in part to the increase in activity in the securities markets generally.
During this period the NASD administered 64,457 qualification
examinations of which approximately 38,880 were for NASD qualification and the balance for other agencies, including major exchanges,
the Commission 80 and various States.
NASD Disciplinary Actions.- The Commission receives from the
NASD copies of its decisions in all disciplinary actions against members and registered representatives. In general, such actions are based
on allegations that the respondents violated specified provisions of
the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice. Where violations are found the
NASD may impose one or more sanctions upon a member, including
expulsion, suspension, fine or censure. If the violator is an individual
associated with a member, his registration as a representative may be
suspended or revoked, he may be suspended or barred from being
associated with any member, and he may be fined and/or censured.
Under Section 15A(b) (4) of the Exchange Act and the NASD's bylaws, no broker-dealer may be admitted to or continued in NASD
membership without Commission approval if he has been suspended
or expelled from membership in the NASD or a national securities
exchange; he is barred or suspended from association with a broker

been found to be a cause of certain sanctions imposed upon a brokerdealer by the Commission, the NASD or an exchange; or he has
associated with him any person subject to one of the above disqualifications.
During the past fiscal year the NASD reported to the Commission
its final disposition of disciplinary complaints against 80 member firms
and 82 individuals associated with them. With respect to 15 members
and 12 associated persons, complaints were dismissed because the alleged violations had not been established," In the remaining cases,
violations were found and penalties were imposed on 65 members and
70 registered representatives or other individuals. The maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was imposed against 9 members,
and 5 members were suspended from membership for periods ranging
from 5 days to 1 year. In many of these cases, substantial fines were also
imposed. In another 47 cases, members were fined amounts ranging
from $100 to $5,000. In 4 cases, the only sanction imposed was censure,
although censure was usually a secondary penalty where a more severe
penalty was also imposed.
Various penalties were also imposed on associated individuals found
in violation of NASD rules. The registrations of 27 registered representatives were revoked, and 9 representatives had their registrations
suspended for periods ranging from 5 days to 1 year. Fines in various
amounts were also imposed against many revoked or suspended representatives. In addition, 33 other representatives were censured and/or
fined amounts ranging from $250 to $4,000. One individual was barred
from association with any NASD member.
Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Action.-Section
15A
(g) of the Exchange Aot provides that disciplinary actions by the
NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion or
on the timely application of any aggrieved person. This section also
provides that upon application for or institution of review by the
Commission the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD is
automatically stayed pending Commission review, unless the Commission otherwise orders after notice and opportunity for hearing. Section
15A (h) of the Act defines the scope of the Commission's review. If the
:n The majority of the cases where allegations against members were dismissed
involved misuse of customers' and/or firm securities or funds by a representative
under such circumstances that, according to the NASD, the member could not
have known of or prevented the impropriety. The Securities Acts Amendments of
1964 authorized registered securities associations to take disciplinary action directly against individuals associated with members. The NASD has amended its
rules to provide for such action. In the fiscal year there were 16 cases in which the
sole respondents were individuals associated with members.

TEaRTY-FOURTH ~AL

Commission finds that the disciplined party committed tlJ.eacts found
by the NASD and thereby violated the rules specified in the determination, and that such conduct was inconsistent with just and equitable
principles of trade, the Commission must sustain the NASD's action
unless it finds that the penalties imposed are excessive or oppressive, in
which case it must cancel or reduce them.
At the start of the fiscal year, seven NASD disciplinary decisions
were pending before the Commission on review. During the year six
additional cases were brought up for review. Six cases were disposed
of by the Commission. In two of these, the Commission sustained in
full the disciplinary action taken by the NASD. Itdismissed the review
proceedings in one case as moot, and permitted the withdrawal of one
application for review. With respect to the two remaining cases, in one
the Commission denied the application for review as being untimely
filed, and in the remaining case the NASD and the applicants filed a
stipulation discontinuing the review proceedings. Seven cases were
pending as of the end of the year.
Commission Review of NASD Action on Memhership.-As
previously noted, Section 15A(b) (4) of the Act and the by-laws of the
NASD provide that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate
in the public interest to approve or direct to the contrary, no broker or
dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership if he, or any
person associated with him, is under any of the several disabilities
specified in the statute or the NASD by-laws. A Commission order
approving or directing admission to or continuance in Association
membership, notwithstanding a disqualification under Section 15A(b)
(4) of the Act or under an effective Association rule adopted under
that Section or Section 15A(b) (3), is generally entered only after the
matter has been submitted initially to the Association by the member
or applicant for membership. The Association in its discretion may
then file an application with the Commission on behalf of the petitioner. If the Association refuses to sponsor such an application the
broker or dealer may apply directly to the Commission for an order
directing the Association to admit or continue him in membership.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, three applications for approval of
admission to or continuance in membership were pending. During
the year, 10 additional applications were filed, 8 applications were
approved, and 5 were pending at the year's end.

Iation thereunder. During the fiscal year, eight exchanges reported
approximately 100 separate actions, including impositions of fines in
33 cases ranging from $50 to $10,000, with total fines aggregating
$44,800; the suspension from membership of 11 individuals; and the
censure of 3 member firms. These exchanges also reported the imposition of various sanctions against 63 registered representatives and
employees of member firms. In addition, the American Stock Exchange
reported a large number of informal staff actions of a cautionary
nature.
MISREPRESENTATIONS IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF SECURITIES

Among the improper practices which constantly concern the Commission and its staff and which are the subject of frequent enforcement
action is the use of false or misleading representations in connection
with the sale or purchase of securities." The comments in the preceding
section regarding detection methods, investigations and sanctions are
in general equally applicable to this type of conduct. The Commission
also frequently participates as amicus curiae in litigation between private parties under the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws,
where it considers it important to present its views regarding the interpretation of those provisions. For the most part, this participation is
in the appellate courts.
During the course of the fiscal year, the Commission participated
either as a party or as amicus curiae in a number of cases involving
important issues under the anti-fraud provisions.
In the Supreme Court's first decision involving the scope of the term
"security" as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,the Court
in Tcherepnin v. [{night 33 reversed the decision of the court of
appeals 34 and held, in accordance with the views expressed by the
Commission as amicus curiae, that withdrawable capital shares issued
by a State-chartered savings and loan association are securities and,
consequently, that the district court had jurisdiction of an action
brought by holders of such shares based upon alleged violations of
the anti-fraud provisions in Section 10(b) of the Act and Rule 10b-5
thereunder. While recognizing that the legal form of withdrawable
shares is determined under State law, Federal law was held to "govern whether shares having such legal form constitute securities under
the Securities Exchange Act." The Court applied to its interpretation
of the Securities Exchange Act principles long established in cases

decided under the Securities Act and found the legislative history
of the Securities Act pertinent as well. Both statutes were said to
reflect an "expansive concept of security" which "embodies a flexible
rather than a static principle." As under the Securities Act, the Court
held that "instruments may be included within any of ... [the Securities Exchange Act's] definitions, as a matter of law, if on their face
they answer to the name or description." Thus, the withdrawable capital shares were found to have the "essential attributes of investment
contracts" and were alternatively held to be "stock," "transferable
share[s]" and "certificate[s] of interest or participation in any profit
sharing agreement." The Court expressly rejected the view of the court
of appeals that the words "an instrument commonly known as a 'security'" are a limitation on the other descriptive tenus contained in the
statutory definition of security. It also observed that the characteristics
of savings and loan shares-i-such as their issuance in unlimited
amounts, their nonnegotiable character and their lack of preemptive
rights, as well as the lack of a shareholder's right to inspect the corporate books and records-"serve only to distinguish among different
types of securities. They do not, standing alone, govern whether a
particular instrument is a security under the Federal securities laws."
Also rejected was the suggestion that fluctuation in value and trading
in securities markets are essential attributes of securities under the
Securities Exchange Act.
In another case involving the definition of security, Oontinental
Marketing Oorp. v, S.E.O.,35 the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that the combined activities of the various defendants in
selling live beaver in conjunction with contracts for the care, management, replacement and resale of the beaver constituted an investment
contract within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities
Exchange Act, even though the performance of the service contracts
was to be carried out by persons other than the person initially selling
the beaver. The defendants in this case had, at one time, carried out
through a single business entity their various selling and service activities, which were designed to build a "domestic beaver industry."
Subsequently, however, they had fragmented their activities and placed
them under numerous separate business entities so that some were
devoted exclusively to the selling activities while others provided the
various management services, including the ranching of the beaver. The
various entities acted together in conducting the overall business, and
only by acting together could the business continue.

are performed by the seller or by parties actually owned or controlled
by the seller, stated:
"The more critical factor is the nature of the investor's participation in
the enterprise. If it is one of providing capital with the hopes of a favorable
return then it begins to take on the appearance of an investment contract .... "

The court noted, in this regard, that in this case the "economic inducement" held out to the prospective investor was "the faith or hope
in the success of ... the domestic beaver industry ... as a whole, and
not the value of the animals alone."
Last year's annual report 36 discussed the amicus curiae brief filed
by the Commission in Pappas v. M088,37 a case in which a claim was
asserted under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-.5.
This case involved the sale of authorized but unissued shares of
common stock of a corporation to certain outsiders and to the defendant directors. These shares were issued at an allegedly inadequate
price. All of the directors, who approved the transaction with themselves, were fully aware of the facts; and shareholder approval was
not required under State law. Nevertheless, shareholder approval was
sought so that the stock could be listed on the American Stock Exchange, and allegedly false statements were made to the shareholders
in the process. The defendant directors owned a majority of the
shares of the corporation and voted them in favor of the transaction.
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in accordance with
the views of the Commission, held that the corporation may have been
the victim of a violation of Rule 10b-5 even though all of the directors
knew the true facts. In rejecting the defendants' argument that there
could be no deception and consequently no violation of Rule 10b-5
because of the directors' knowledge, the court stated that if deception
is required,
"it is fairly found by viewing this fraud as though the 'independent' stockholders were standing in the place of the defrauded corporate entity at the
time the original resolution authorizing the stock sales was passed ....
Certainly the deception of the independent stockholders is no less real
because, 'formalistically,' the corporate entity was the victim of the fraud.
The same is true of the fact that the fraud may go unredressed because
those in a position to sue lack actual knowledge of the fraud."

In H eit v. Weitzen and two related cases 38 the Commission filed a
brief, amicus c-uriae, in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit

and Rule 10b-5 is broad enough to be applicable to statements made
by a corporation whose securities are publicly held whenever those
statements are likely to affect the market for those securities, irrespective of whether the corporation or those responsible for the dissemination of the statement engage in securities transactions and
irrespective of the absence of any motive to affect the market. After
the close of the fiscal year a panel of that court decided this issue in
accordance with the Commission's position and the previous decision
of the court, sitting en bane, in S.E.O. v. Texas Gulf Sulphur 00.39
The court also agreed with the Commission that, if such a public statement by a corporation violates Rule 10b-5, a private right of action
for damages may be implied on behalf of injured investors; and it
quoted from the Commission's brief to the effect that this latter holding raised important questions of policy as to the extent of the monetary liabilities that could result, but that such questions could best
be decided after the trial of the case in the context of a complete
record rather than on a motion for summary judgment."
The Commission also participated as amicus curiae in several other
cases involving questions with respect to private remedies under the
Federal securities laws. One of these cases was Jordan Building Oorp,
v. Doyle, O'Oonnor &1 00.,41 decided by the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit after the close of the fiscal year. The court held, in
accordance with the views of the Commission, that an implied private
right of action in favor of a defrauded purchaser exists under Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, even though the conduct
complained of may also have given rise to an action based upon the
express remedy available to purchosers under Section 12(2) of the
Securities Act. The court similarly adopted the Commission's position that an action can be maintained against a broker-dealer under
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, even though the conduct complained of
may also have violated Section 15(c) (1) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 15cl-2, which expressly apply to broker-dealers.
The Commission, as amicus curiae in Hohmann v. Packard Instrument 00.,42 decided shortly after the close of the fiscal year, and in
Dolg.ow v. Ander80n,43 advocated a broad remedial construction of the
class-action provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, as
amended effective July 1, 1966,to permit private actions arising under

the Federal securities laws to be maintained on behalf of classes of
investors to the fullest possible extent. In both cases the Commission
noted that the practicality of private litigation under these statutesand its consequent effectiveness as an important supplement to the
Commission's enforcement efforts-often depends upon the ability of
a litigant with a small individual claim to seek and obtain relief on
behalf of a class of similarly-situated persons. The decision in each
case was consistent with the views expressed by the Commission.
The final case in this group relating to private remedies, Paul H.
Aschka» &: 00. v. Kamen. &: 00., involved the question of the liability
of a broker-dealer firm to persons injured by violations of the antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws committed by employees
of the firm acting within the scope of their employment. Following
the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in this
case, construing the "controlling-persons" provisions in Section 15 of
the Securities Act and Section 20 (a) of the Exchange Act as precluding a broker-dealer firm's liability for the frauds of its employees
unless the principals of the firm are personally at fault,44 a petition
for a writ of certiorari was filed in the Supreme Court. The Commission submitted a memorandum at the invitation of the Court, urging
that the writ be granted; and after it was granted," the Commission
filed a brief, amicus curiae, urging reversal of the court of appeals'
decision.
The Commission took the position that the "controlling-persons"
provisions were not designed to deal with customary employer-employee relationships and hence that those provisions, including the
requirements as to personal fault, do not govern or restrict the civil
liability of a broker-dealer firm for violations of the anti-fraud provisions committed by employees of the firm acting within the scope
of their employment. The Commission further urged that such civil
liability should not be governed by State law either; that instead it
should be determined as a matter of uniform Federal law in accordance with the underlying statutory purposes; and that the objectives
of the securities laws would best be advanced by holding broker-dealer
firms liable in damages as a matter of course to persons defrauded by
the firms' employees acting within the scope of their employment. Following the close of the fiscal year, the parties stipulated to a settlement
of the case, and the writ of certiorari was dismissed."

Al\'NUAL

REPORT

In S.E.O. v. National Securities, lne.,47 the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit held that the M:cCarran-Ferguson Act 48 precluded
the application of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act to
false and misleading statements made in soliciting stockholder consents to a merger of insurance companies approved by a state insurance commissioner." A petition by the Commission for a writ of
certiorari was granted by the Supreme Court on April 22, 1968. It
is the Commission's position that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the
purpose of which was to re-establish the power of the States to regulate and tax the "business of insurance," did not diminish or impair
the established applicability of the Federal securities laws to transactions in insurance company securities. The Commission contends
that such transactions are not part of the "business of insurance."
In W. J. Abbott &: 00. V. S.E.0.,50 the court held that a commodity
broker regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act by the Department of Agriculture must make its books and records, relating to
managed accounts in commodities and commodities futures, available
for inspection by the Commission pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum
issued in a Commission investigation into possible violations of the
Federal securities laws. The court concluded that the Commodity
Exchange Act and the regulations providing for inspection of the
books and records of commodity brokers by the Department of Agriculture do "not exclude any other agency, in this instance the S.E.C.,
from exercising investigative powers granted to it by Congress in
areas and activities specifically designated to such other agency by
statutory authority." Accordingly, a motion to quash the Commission's subpoena was denied and an application by the Commission
for enforcement of the subpoena was granted. On petition for
reconsideration the court also held that the Commission need not
produce evidence of possible violations before it is entitled to enforcement of an investigative subpoena.
S.E.O. v, Garcia,51 another case dealing with investigative subpoenas, involved a somewhat unusual situation. At the hearing in the
district court in this subpoena enforcement proceeding, the various respondents denied that they had possession of the subpoenaed corporate records or knowledge of their whereabouts, or they gave
no information as to their whereabouts. The respondents were the
corporation whose records were being sought, present and former
officials of the company, partners of the accounting firm which had

certified the company's financial statements and counsel to the company. Notwithstanding the denials, the court ordered all of the
respondents to produce the requested documents by a certain date or
appear before the court thereafter at a designated time to testify as
to why they had failed to produce them. After the entry of this order,
one of the respondents disclosed that subpoenaed documents had been
burned and buried on the property of another respondent. A search
warrant was then obtained from a United States commissioner, and
the burned and charred remains of certain of the documents were
unearthed. Thereafter the court heard testimony concerning the documents and directed that the record in the proceeding be referred to
the United States attorney to consider whether there was evidence of
criminal violations.
MANIPULATION

The Exchange Act and Commission rules under the Act prohibit
various kinds of manipulative activities. In order to enable the Commission to meet its responsibilities for the surveillance of the securities
markets, the market surveillance staff has devised a number of procedures to identify possible manipulative activities. A program has
been adopted with respect to surveillance over listed securities, in
which the staff's activities are closely coordinated with the stock
watching operations of the New York and American Stock Exchanges.
Within this framework, the staff reviews the daily and periodic stock
watch reports prepared by these exchanges and on the basis of its
analysis of the information developed by the exchanges and other
sources, determines matters of interest, possible violations of applicable law, and the appropriate action to be taken.
In addition, the market surveillance staff maintains a continuous
ticker tape watch of transactions on the New York and American
Stock Exchanges and the sales and quotations sheets of regional exchanges to observe any unusual or unexplained price variations or
market activity. The financial news ticker, leading newspapers and
various financial publications and statistical services are also closely
followed.
If any of these sources reveals possible violations, the market surveillance staff conducts a preliminary inquiry into the matter. These
inquiries, some of which are conducted with the cooperation of the
exchange concerned, generally begin with the identification of the
brokerage firms which were active in the security. The staff may communicate with partners, officers or registered representatives of the
firms, with customers, or with officials of the company in question to
determine the reasons for the activity or price change in the securities
involved and whether violations may have occurred.

TF.URTY-FOURTH ANNUAL

REPORT

107

The Commission has also developed an automated over-the-counter
surveillance program to provide more efficient and comprehensive
surveillance. The automated equipment is programmed to identify,
among other things, unlisted securities w hose price movement or dealer
interest varies beyond specified limits in a pre-established time
period. When a security is so identified, the automated system prints
out current and historic market information concerning it. This data,
combined with other available information, is collated and analyzed to
select those securities whose activity indicates the need for further
inquiry or referral to the Commission's enforcement staff.
In addition to the Commission's market surveillance activities, the
other detection methods previously discussed are also useful tools in
the detection of manipulation. Prior comments of a general nature
regarding investigations and the nature of sanctions available are
equally pertinent to manipulations.
Among Commission decisions during the year dealing with manipulative activities, the following are of particular interest:
In Atlantic Equities Oompany,52 the registrations of several brokerdealers were revoked, the application for registration of another was
denied and 15 individuals were found to be causes of the sanctions
against their respective firms. Despite staff warnings to the underwriter of a Regulation A. offering that a possible "hot issue" was involved and that the market might be manipulated, the underwriter and
the other respondents engaged in a scheme which insured that the
offering would be a "hot issue," involving the withholding of blocks of
stock and their subsequent distribution at artificially inflated prices
through misrepresentations.
In Oharles E. Salik,53 the Commission found, on the basis of a stipulation of facts entered into in connection with an offer of settlement,
that the portfolio manager for a registered investment adviser to a
mutual fund, in anticipation of selling certain of the fund's portfolio
securities, purchased the same securities for the fund in the open market immediately prior to the close of business. The following day,
these and the portfolio securities were sold at prices reflecting the
inflationary effect of the purchases. The Commission held that the
purchases constituted a manipulation and a fraud on those persons
who purchased at prices affected by the immediately preceding purchases. The president of the investment adviser who, like the portfolio
manager, was a member of the fund's investment committee, was found
to have failed to exercise reasonable supervision to prevent the violaGO Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8118 (July 11. 1967), afJ'd as to Howard

tions. On the basis of the offers of settlement, the Commission barred
both individuals from association with any broker-dealer, investment
adviser or investment company, subject to certain exceptions and conditions.
In a criminal case growing out of the financial collapse of the Westec
Corporation, a conglomerate enterprise, four indictments were returned against the two principal officersof Westec and several of their
relatives and business associates." The cases involved charges that
from 1963 until late 1966, when Westec was forced into bankruptcy,
the defendants manipulated the price of Westec stock on the American
Stock Exchange through massive open-market purchases, the dissemination of false and misleading statements and rumors, and the filing
and publication of false financial statements. It was charged that as
part of the scheme control was secretly obtained over a large block of
Westec stock, most of 'which was later sold by the two principal officers in unregistered distributions in order to finance acquisitions by
Westec.
One of the principal officerspleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy
to violate the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Act, and the anti-manipulative and annual report filing provisions of
the Exchange Act, and then testified as a key government witness
against the other, who was convicted of conspiracy to file false financial statements with the Commission and the American Stock Exchange, and of 12 counts of mail fraud. Another defendant pleaded
guilty to violations of the anti-manipulative provisions of the Exchange Act.
IMPROPER

USE OF INSIDE INFORMATION

Corporate insiders by virtue of their position may have knowledge
oi material facts which are unavailable to the general public and may
be able to use such knowledge to their advantage in transactions in the
company's securities. Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act was
designed to curb the misuse of inside formation. As previously noted,
that Section requires insiders to report their security holdings and
transactions and provides for the recovery by or on behalf of the
issuer of Short-swing trading profits realized by insiders. The Commission is not a party in suits under Section 16, but frequently participates as amicus curiae in those instances where significant interpretive
issues are involved.
In Blau v, Rayette-Faberge, Inc.,55 the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit held that counsel fees may be awarded to a stockholder's attorney solely for discovering and informing a corporation of a

claim for the recovery of short-swing profits under Section 16(b) or
the Exchange Act which the corporation then successfully pursues at
the stockholder's request. The court stated, however, that a fee should
not be awarded solely for such discovery and information unless "the
corporation has done nothing for a substantial period of time after the
suspect transactions and its inaction is likely to continue." The court
specifically noted that its decision was in accord with the position previously urged by the Commission as amicus curiae in Gilson v. Ohoctc
Full O'Nuts 00rp.56
The short-swing recovery provisions of Section 16(b) operate without regard to whether the insider in fact made use of inside information in the transactions involved. Under the anti-fraud provisions of
the securities laws, however, those who actually make improper use of
inside information in the purchase or sale of securities may be liable
for damages or subject to injunctive action, either at the instance of
injured private litigants or the Commission itself, or subject to disciplinary action in administrative proceedings instituted by the Commission. Two important recent decisions under the anti-fraud provisions dealing with improper use of inside information were those of
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, sitting en bane, in S.E.O.
v. Twas Gulf Sulphur 00. and of the Commission in the Merrill
Lynch case. Those decisions are summarized in Part I of this report
at pp. 6-9.
ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN SECURITIES

The unlawful offer and sale of Canadian securities in the United
States increased significantly during 1968. It would appear that this
increase is due at least in part to the intensified interest of unsophisticated investors in highly speculative securities. The Commission has
worked with the securities commissions of the Canadian provinces,
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and such quasi-official bodies as
the Toronto and Montreal Stock Exchanges and the Broker-Dealers'
Association of Ontario in efforts to curb these violations.
The Commission has provided assistance to the Canadian Govern.
ment, when requested, in connection with steps being taken to create a
Federal securities agency in Canada. It has also continued to work
closely with the Ontario Royal Commission on Atlantic Acceptance
Corporation Limited in its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the collapse, in June 1965, of Atlantic Acceptance, a large
Canadian finance company."

practically ceased, largely as a result of vigorous enforcement action
by the Commission, and the enactment in late 1965 of Bahamian legislation regulating the banking business in the Bahamas. There has been
a considerable increase, however, in the offer and sale to American
residents of unregistered securities of various Panamanian companies.
The Commission has been working with the Department of State and
other State and Federal agencies in an attempt to halt these activities. 58 The Commission is also continuing to assist the Internal Revenue
Service in investigations of evasions of the Interest Equalization Tax
on purchases by Americans of foreign securities from foreign sellers.
There have been increasing problems involving violation of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 by foreign investment advisers. To
date, the Commission has instituted one formal enforcement action in
this area; in this case it obtained an injunction against an unregistered
Canadian investment adviser." Further investigations are in progress
with a view to determining other appropriate enforcement action.
Since September 30, 1967, the names of six Canadian and one Bahamian companies have been deleted from the Commission's Foreign
Restricted List 60 in accordance with established procedures, while
the names of nine Canadian companies were added to the list. The
current list and supplements to it are issued to and published by the
press, and copies are mailed to all registered broker-dealers.

PART V
REGULATION

OF INVESTMENT

COMPANIES

In broad terms, an investment company is any arrangement by which
a group of persons invests funds in an entity that is itself engaged in
investing in securities, Investment companies are an important vehicle
for public participation in the securities markets. They enable small, as
well as large, investors to participate in a professionally managed and
diversified portfolio of securities.
The Investment Company Act of 1940 sets forth the Commission's
responsibilities in protecting persons who invest in investment companies. It provides a comprehensive framework of regulation which,
among other things, prohibits changes in the nature of an investment
company's business or its investment policies without shareholder approval, protects against loss or outright stealing or abuse of trust and
provides specific controls to eliminate or to mitigate inequitable capital
structures. The Act also requires that an investment company disclose
its financial condition and investment policies; requires management
contracts to be submitted to shareholders for approval; prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, or brokers from constituting more than
a minority of the investment company's board of directors; regulates
the means of custody of its assets; and provides specific controls designed to protect against investment companies entering into unfair
transactions with their affiliates.
In addition to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, an
investment company must comply with the Securities Aot of 1933 when
it makes an offering of its securities and i,t is subject to the applicable
provisions of the Securities Exchange Am of 1934, including those
relating to proxy and tender offer solicitations and insider trading and
reporting rules.
COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE ACf

As of June 30, 1968, there were 967 investment companies registered
under the Act. Of this total 862 were "active" 1 companies whose assets
had an aggregate market value of approximately $69.7 billion. Compared with corresponding totals at June 30, 1967, these figures represent an over-all increase of approximately $11.5 billion, or almost 20

are those which are not in the process of being liquidated

percent, in the market value of assets and an increase of 119, or almost
15 percent, in the number of active registered companies. The increase
in assets was the largest recorded by investment companies in any
single fiscal year since the passage of the Act and exceeds the total increase in investment company assets during the 15 years after its enactment. This increase is due partly to appreciation in assets of previously
registered companies and partly to the large increase in the number of
registered companies. The impact of this unprecedented growth on the
securities market is discussed at pages XVII-LX and 3-4 of this
report.

As the table shows, 17, or approximately 10 percent, of the newly
registered companies were variable annuity separate accounts of
insurance companies," Including these companies, there were 26 active
variable annuity separate accounts registered at June 30, 1968, consisting of 4 unit investment trusts and 22 management open-end investment companies. A significant part of the Commission's regulatory
effort with respect to variable annuities has been the dove-tailing of the
requirements of the Investment Company Act with the patterns and
procedures which have grown up in the insurance industry.
In the 33rd Annual Report of the Commission, at pages 107-108, we
discussed the capital leveraged investment companies in which half
of the capital is supplied by income shareholders and half by capital
shareholders. At present there are 9 active capital leveraged companies
in operation, including 1 open-end company. As of June 30,1968, they
had total assets of over $450 million. The shares of seven of these companies are traded on the New York Stock Exchange or the American
Stock Exchange and at J nne 28, 1968, their capital shares were selling
at discounts ranging from 17.8percent to 26.6percent of net asset value.
GROWTH OF INVESTMENT COMPANY ASSETS

The following table illustrates the striking growth of assets of investment companies over the years since the enactment of the investment Company Act:
• The applicability of the requirements of the Investment Company Act to variable annuity contracts was discussed in prior annual reports. Typically, a variable
annuity contract provides payments for life commencing on a selected annuity date
with the amounts of the annuity payments varying with the investment performance of equity securities which are set apart by the insurance company in a
separate account which is registered with the Commission as an investment
company. The separate accounts now registered are either open-end management
companies or unit investment trusts.

COMPANY FILINGS REVIEWED

As previously noted, investment companies offering their shares for
sale to the public must register them under the Securities Act of 1933.
The registration statements filed by such companies are reviewed for
compliance with that Act as well as the Investment Company Act.
Periodic and other reports must also be filed. Proxy soliciting material filed by investment companies is reviewed for compliance with the
Commission's proxy rules. The following table sets forth the nature and
volume of filings processed during the past fiscal year:

Revision or Annual and Quarterly Report Forms

During fiscal year 1968, the Commission adopted a revised annual
report, Form N-1R, and a revised quarterly report, captioned Form
N-1Q, for management investment companies. These forms are effective for fiscal years and for calendar quarters, respectively, ending
on and after December;31,1967.
The revision of Form N-1R prescribes attachments to the annual
reports to be used by registrants to supply data to the Commission in
It form readily adaptable for electronic data processing purposes. The
attachments will enable the Commission to retrieve and analyze pertinent financial data more efficiently by use of its computers. The
processing will also enable the Commission to screen on a continuing
basis the information furnished in the annual reports to ascertain the
areas and the companies in which problems exist.
The revised Form N-1Q includes a new item which requires management investment companies to report on a calendar quarterly basis
the number of shares (or other unit) or principal amount of securities
acquired for, or divested from, their portfolios during the reporting
quarter. These reports provide the public and the Commission with
valuable information about securities transactions of management investment companies, and they will materially aid the Commission
and others in conducting studies of these transactions and their impact
in the market place.
CONTROL OF IMPROPER PRACTICES
Inspection and Investigation Program

During the fiscal year, the Commission's staff conducted 102 investment company inspections pursuant to Section 31 (b) of the Investment
Company Act. Many of these inspections disclosed violations not only
of the Investment Company Act but also of other statutes administered by the Commission. 'While many of the violations uncovered during these examinations appear to have resulted from a lack of familiarity with the Investment Company Act and were soon corrected
when brought to management's attention, a number of the violations
were serious in nature. These included improper pricing practices, inadequate disclosure concerning the activities of the investment company and failure to observe established procedures for safekeeping
company assets or to maintain adequate fidelity bond coverage for
persons dealing with company assets. Inspections also uncovered a
number of instances in which self-dealing transactions had been effected by affiliated persons in violation of Section 17 of the Act.
The tremendous influx of money into the mutual fund industry and
the proliferation of new funds have resulted in serious accounting and
bookkeeping problems. In some cases funds have priced. shares inac-

curately because their books were not in condition to enable them to
compute accurately their net asset value. A sudden avalanche of money
into a fund may cause a breakdown of the bookkeeping system and
result in small investors either paying too much when they buy shares
or receiving too little when they redeem shares. In a recent inspection
the staff found that a new fund was so flooded with orders that its
books and records had become chaotic. As a result, no one was able to
determine the fund's assets, much less their value. The fund therefore suspended sales and hired a large staff of auditors to reconstruct
its accounts from inception.
Largely as an outgrowth of information obtained during inspections, 8 private investigations were commenced during the fiscal year
to develop facts concerning what appeared to be serious violations of
the statutes administered by the Commission.
Civil and Administrative Proceedings

During the 1968 fiscal year, the Commission instituted three civil
actions and one administrative proceeding involving investment companies. Two of the civil actions involved charges that companies were
operating as investment companies without having registered under
the Investment Company Act. Other proceedings previously instituted
were concluded or progressed toward conclusion.
Status Cases.-In S.E.O. v. Fifth Avenue Coach.Lines, Ino., 3 the
Commission, alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of
certain provisions of the Investment Company Act, charged that Fifth
Avenue had operated illegally as an unregistered investment company
and that certain affiliated persons had misappropriated almost $5 million of the company's assets. The Commission sought an injunction
against further violations of the Federal securities laws, the appointment of a trustee or receiver for the company, and certain other equitable relief.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, following a 6-week trial,
the court found that Fifth Avenue had operated as an unregistered
investment company since June 30, 1967, and should have registered
as such. Itenjoined three of the individual defendants, Victor Muscat,
Edward Krock and Roy M. Colm, from committing violations of the
securities laws, and appointed a trustee-receiver to conduct the company's affairs, register Fifth Avenue as an investment company, prosecute suits for monetary damages against certain individuals and
investigate and ascertain whether other actions can be maintained. In
so doing, the court found that the defendants Muscat, Krock and Cohn
had "conspired to use Fifth for their own purposes," that they had

evidenced a "marked propensity" to engage in "the sort of self-dealing
and dealing with affiliated companies which the . . . [Investment
Company Act] was designed to prevent" and that, while most of the
transactions charged did not involve fraud in the purchase or sale of
securities, they involved "overreaching" and "flagrant violations of
fiduciary duty." The opinion makes clear that the substantive provisions of the Investment Company Act, which by their terms only apply
in the case of a "registered" investment company, can be violated by
an affiliated person of an unregistered investment company which
should have been registered.
Similarly, in S.E.O. v.Tnsurance Investors Trust 00./ the company
was preliminarily enjoined from operating as an unregistered investment company and was placed in temporary receivership.
The 32nd Annual Report 5 discussed earlier stages of the litigation
in S.E.O. v. S <£ P National Oorporation, an injunctive action in which
the Commission alleged that S & P and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
were doing business as unregistered investment companies in violation of the Investment Company Act and that reports filed by S & P
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were false and misleading. During the current fiscal year the defendants consented to
the entry of final judgments enjoining future violations and appointing a permanent trustee-receiver of the companies to succeed a temporary trustee-receiver whose appointment had earlier been affirmed by
the court of appeals," These judgments were part of a Plan of Settlement and Reorganization approved by the court 7 which also provided
that the insider interests in S & P would be subordinated to the interests of outside public stockholders. In that connection the Plan
contained provisions for an offer which had been made by S & P to its
public stockholders to purchase their S & P shares at prices above the
market prices of the shares in recent years," The trustee-receiver was
discharged, and after return of the companies to the control of their
directors a Plan of Complete Liquidation and Dissolution was adopted
by the companies and with modifications was approved by the court,"
Transactions Involving Affiliated Persons.-In

Time Corporation ("General Time") by American Investors Fund,
Inc. ("Fund"), a registered open-end investment company, and Talley
Industries, Inc. ("Talley"), an "affiliated person" of the Fund," constituted a "joint arrangement" which violated Section 17(d) of the
Investment Company Act and Rule 17d-l thereunder," the Commission instituted suit in the District Court for the Southern District of
New York to prevent Talley and the Fund from benefiting from their
unlawful stock purchases and to enjoin them and the Fund's investment adviser from further violations.
Talley had begun buying stock of General Time in December 1967
with a view towards a merger of General Time with Talley. Three
days after its first purchase, the president of Talley asked the president of the Fund if he would consider purchasing General Time stock
for the Fund's investment portfolio. 'Within a few days, the Fund
began, through Talley's principal broker, to buy General Time stock
and, over a period of 1~ months, accumulated almost 10 percent of
General Time's outstanding shares. There was evidence that Talley
curtailed its acquisitions of General Time stock until the Fund had
concluded its purchases. Ultimately Talley acquired approximately
12 percent of General Time's outstanding stock.
The district court dismissed the Commission's complaint on the
ground that Talley and the Fund were not joint participants in a
transaction because each had acquired its stock in separate purchases
and had no interest in the shares held by the other. Shortly after the
end of the fiscal year the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
noting the need for a liberal construction of Section 17(d), reversed
and remanded the case to the district court. It held that when a registered investment company and an affiliated person engage in a plan to
achieve together a substantial stock position in another company they
can have effected a "transaction in which such registered company ...
is a joint or a joint and several participant" with the affiliate even
though there is no legally binding agreement between them. The court
also held that the Commission, in seeking to implement Section 17(d)
by the general requirement of advance application for approval found
in Rule 17d-J, had not exceeded the authority granted to it by
Congress.
The court of appeals noted that, although the case was not before it

vision of Section 43(a) of the Act making the Commission's findings
conclusive if supported by substantial evidence was not applicable by
its terms, the principle of that rule "applies none the less." The court
found that there was substantial evidence here to support those
findings.
On remand, the district court issued a final judgment of permanent
injunction enjoining Talley and the Fund from effecting any transactions with respect to the securities of General Time which would violate Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-l without having first obtained an
appropriate order from the Commission. The judgment, however,
among other things, permitted Talley and the Fund to vote their General Time shares (so long as they did not consult with regard thereto)
and contained provisions enjoining Talley from disposing of General
Time shares except on certain conditions designed to provide protection for the Fund. The judgment also provided that, if Talley should
decide to dispose of General Time shares in a manner other than particularized in the judgment, prior approval of the Commission and
thereafter of the court would have to be obtained. General Time appealed from this judgment; and the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit held that General Time had no standing to do so, ruling- that
the section and rule were not intended to protect a portfolio company
of an investment company." General Time has petitioned the Supreme
Court for a writ of certiorari.
The 33rd Annual Report discussed the district court's holding in
the case of SE.O. v. Sterling Precision Uorporation.": On appeal by
the Commission, the district court's grant of summary judgment in
favor of Sterling was affirmed on the ground that an issuer's redemption of securities owned by a registered investment company is not
a "purchase" within the meaning of the prohibition against transactions with affiliated persons contained in Section 17(a) (2) of the
Investment Company Act.15 Although it has been decided not to ask
the Supreme Court to review this decision, the Commission has announced that it still believes such transactions may be subject to Section 17(a) under appropriate circumstances and that it may raise the
issue again if such action appears necessary,"
Compensation of Management.-An
administrative action involving Insurance Securities Incorporated ("lSI"), investment adviser to
Insurance Securities Trust Fund ("Trust Fund"), was settled during

the performance of what it called "brokerage services." The Commission's staff took the position that many of these services should have
been performed under the advisory contract between lSI and the Trust
Fund and were covered by the compensation paid lSI as adviser. The
Commission accepted an offer of settlement providing that lSI would
only charge the Trust Fund actual costs of a:cting as broker. The settlement was retroactive to July 1, 1967, and also provided that lSI
would be billed no more than $350,000 per year for 1968, 1969 and
1970. For the year ended June 30, 1967, lSI had billed the fund over
$1.3 million and had made a profit of over $1 million.
While the Commission's formal investigation of lSI was in progress
but before the administrative proceeding described above had actually
been instituted, a representative and derivative shareholders' suit was
filed attacking the same "brokerage services" and also charging that
the management fees and sales loads charged were illegal and excessive.18 The district court requested the Commission's views on the fairness of a settlement that had been submitted to it by the parties subsequent to the termination of the administrative proceeding. Shortly
after the close of the fiscal year the court accepted the Commissions
views and disapproved the settlement of this private action on the
ground that it did not confer any significant benefit not already obtained by the Commission in the administrative proceeding. Appeals
have been taken from this decision.
Meaning of "Fundamental" Poliey.-In
Green v. Brown,t9 which
involved certain requirements of the Investment Company Act relating to investment policies, the Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae
in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Section 13(a) (3) of
the Act prohibits an investment company, in the absence of shareholder authorization, from deviating 'from any "fundamental" investment policy recited in its registration statement filed under the Act.
In this case an investment company had recited in its registration
statement that it would not invest more than 20 percent of its combined
capital and surplus in the securities of anyone issuer and that this 20
percent policy could not be changed without shareholder approval. The
plaintiff, a shareholder of the company, asserted that in two instances
the company's directors violated Section 13(a) (3) by causing the company, without prior shareholder approval, to make investments which
were in excess of the 20 percent limitation. After the institution of suit,
the company's shareholders ratified the challenged investments.
The district court held that Section 13(a) (3) had not been violated
because the company's registration statement had not used the word
"fundamental" in describing the 20 percent policy. The court also

122

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

stated that the ratification by the shareholders was a valid defense to
the suit.
The Commission, disagreeing with the decision of the district court,
urged on appeal that when an investment company declares in its
registration statement filed under the Act that a particular investment
policy may not be changed without shareholder approval, that policy
is a "fundamental" policy within the meaning of Section 13(a) (3) .
The Commission also urged that the challenged investments, both
of which consisted of loans, violated Section 21(a) of the Act which
prohibits a management investment company from making loans that
are not permitted by the investment policies recited in the company's
registration statement (Section 21(a) had not been considered by the
district court). In addition, the Commission took the position that
shareholder ratification cannot immunize investment company directors from liability resulting from their prior violations of the Act.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year the court of appeals, without
deciding any of these questions, remanded the case to the district court
for further consideration in light of, among other things, the issues
raised by the Commission. In so doing, the court stated that the district court had construed the Act "in a way that is at least questionable, without the benefit of the Commission's views," and that certain
considerations urged by the Commission were "weighty."
APPLICATIONS

FOR COMMISSION

ACTION

Under Section 6 (c) of the Act, the Commission, by rules and regulations, upon its own motion or by order upon application, may exempt
any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act if
and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the
purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Other
sections, such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(f), 17(b), ned), and 23(c), contain
specific provisions and standards pursuant to which the Commission
may grant exemptions from particular sections of the Act or may
approve certain types of transactions. Also, under certain provisions
of Sections 2, 3, and 8, the Commission may determine the status of
persons and companies under the Act. One of the principal activities
of the Commission in its regulation of investment companies is the
consideration of applications for orders under the above sections.
During the fiscal year, 257 applications were filed under these and
other sections of the Act, and 261 applications were disposed of. As
of the end of the year, 151 applications were pending. The following
table presents a breakdown, by sections involved, of the number of
applications filed and disposed of during the year and the number
pending at the beginning and close of the year.

Some of the more significant matters in which applications wem
considered are summarized below :
Transactions Involving A5liated Persons.-An exemption from
Section 17(a) was requested by Berkshire Industries, Inc. to permit
the merger into it of its 91 percent owned subsidiary, AmericanHawaiian Steamship Company, a registered investment company. The
merger plan as originally submitted provided that the public stockholders of American-Hawaiian would receive $275 cash in exch'angs
for each share of American-Hawaiian. Extensive testimony was taken
over a 5-month period as to the value of American-Hawaiian's assets
and stock to determine principally whether the price of $275 mas reasonable and fair. The merger plan was amended twice during the
progmss of the hearings to increase the price per share to be paid to
the minority stockholders to $375 and then to $575.
American-Hawaiian's principal asset consists,of an 11,600 acre tract
in Southern California being developed into a planned community o r
new city to be known a s Westlake which is projected to have over
70,000 residents. American-Hawaiian's assets also include a 1/2 interest
in t ~ v olarge New York City office buildings, a manufacturing subsidiaqr and portfolio securities.
One of the crucial issues a t the hearings involved the proper
appraisal techniques t o be used in valuing Westlake. The appraisals
of four qualified real estate experts ranged from approximately 43
nlillion dollars to a maximum of 130 million dollars. The parties
waived an initial decision by the hearing examiner and briefs were
submitted to the Commission.

C-ompany Inc., discussed in last year's annual report," was approved
by the Commission during the 1968fiscal year.21 The Commission found
the terms to be reasonable and fair and not to involve overreaching
on the part of any person concerned. Among the matters dealt with
in the Commission's opinion were the reliability of the market price
of a security as an indicator of the investment value of that security
when there have been substantial yearly purchases and sales of that
security by an affiliated person; the impact on the market price of a
security of a dividend that is a return of capital to shareholders of that
security; the treatment of recurring capital gains as an income stream;
factors affecting the quality of earnings and assets; the valuation of
operating companies; the valuation of the dollar obligations of several
Latin American countries; and the issuance of certificates of contingent interest.
Offer of Exchange.--8ections 11(a) and (c) of the Act require
prior Commission approval, irrespective of the basis of exchange, when
an offer of exchange of a security issued by an open-end company is
made for a security issued by a registered unit investment trust. In an
opinion issued after the close of the fiscal year, the Commission denied
approval to a proposed exchange offer under the principal terms of
which certificate holders of a "fixed trust" could have redeemed their
interests and had the proceeds applied to the acquisition of shares of
an affiliated open-end management investment company ("fund") at
net asset value without payment of a sales load." The portfolio of the
fixed trust was limited by the terms of the trust indenture to the shares
of 28 named companies without management discretion to vary its
composition, while the portfolio of the fund was flexible.
A trust certificate holder who accepted the proposed offer would have
incurred redemption charges and possible capital gains taxes, and his
fund interest, unlike his interest in the trust, would have been subject
to an annual advisory fee of approximately % of 1 percent of its value.
The fund and the sponsor of the trust argued that the proposed exchange would nevertheless be beneficial because the fund's portfolio
management could be obtained without payment of another sales load
and because of asserted disadvantages of continued investment in the
trust, arising out of the various "archaic, uneconomic and wasteful"
provisions contained in the trust indenture which, they claimed, together with the trust's assertedly inferior investment performance
made it unattractive to many of its investors.
The Commission, denying the application, cited testimony by the
fund's president that, although the trust had performed "relatively

poorly" in the last few years, investors in it had made money and were
basically pleased, and noted that, despite the fact that the trust indenture contained provisions permitting its amendment, no attempt had
been made to eliminate archaic features except as part of efforts to
convert the trust into a management company.
The Commission concluded that the submission of the proposed
offer to certificate holders of the trust would be inequitable since it
would require them to choose between retaining their interests in the
trust as presently constituted, without modifications of the trust indenture which applicants themselves had recognized to be desirable,
or transferring to a new investment vehicle with attendant costs and
continuing management fees. It indicated that if appropriate efforts
were first made to achieve curative changes and all or some of them
were effected, a trust investor then offered an exchange into fund shares
would be able to make an evaluation different from that entailed in
the present offer under which he would likely be influenced by
the presence of the archaic features of the trust. It therefore denied
approval of the offer but stated that such denial would not preclude
the submission to it of a new proposal which would overcome the
deficiencies it had found.
"Scholarship" Plam.-Issuers
of "Scholarship" plans registered
under the Investment Company Act requested exemptions to permit
such plans to be offered to investors. After the end of the fiscal year,
the Commission granted certain exemptions to The Trust Fund Sponsored by The Scholarship Club, Inc.23 In general, under the plan each
investor becomes a member of the Scholarship Club, agrees to open
a savings account in his own name in a Federally insured bank or
savings and loan association and to pay into it either a lump sum or
monthly deposits, and designates a child under 9 years old as the beneficiary of his plan. The investor further agrees that all earnings accruing to the account will vest in and be transferred to the fund
sponsored by the Scholarship Club to be invested by it and ultimately
distributed for the benefit of the student beneficiaries designated by
investors. The account's principal may be withdrawn by the investor
at any time; but such withdrawal will terminate his plan and result
in forfeiture by him of earnings on the account theretofore transferred
to the fund as well as the elimination of the investor's designated
beneficiary from any participation in the assets of the fund. Amounts
forfeited by investors are to be added to the distributions to be applied against the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year college expenses of those beneficiaries who meet the plan's qualifications. The staff opposed the
application for exemptions.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The exemption order issued by the Commission permits the fund to
operate with investors having one vote per plan owned and electing
a majority of the directors: permits the issuance of periodic payment
plans which will not be fully redeemable; permits a deduction of
amounts of sales load to be made oyer a 3-:rear period although amounts
deducted in the 3rd year differ proportionally from amounts deducted
in the first 2 years; and permits sales notwithstanding that by the
nature of the plans their net asset value may not be specifically determined. In granting these exemptions, the Commission stated that
it was not undertaking to determine whether the plan's proposed
operation is a good way for parents to provide for the college education of their children and it also made clear that it considered full,
adequate and informative disclosure in the plan's prospectus and
sales literature to be a critical requirement.
Merger of Two Exchange Funds into a Mutual Fund.-Two "exchange funds," one of which was the first such fund to register under
the Investment Company Act, were permitted to be merged into an
existing open-end fund whose shares are continuously offered to the
public." "Exchange funds" are open-end investment companies which
obtain their initial portfolio of securities in a tax-free exchange in
which investors transfer securities, usually with a substantial unrealized appreciation, for shares of stock of the fund."
Upon completion of their initial public offerings the cost-to-market
value of the portfolios of both exchange funds involved in this merger
was less than 15 percent. The Commission was concerned that any
subsequent investors who paid cash to acquire the shares of either fund
might be subjected to a large indirect tax liability. Thus it required,
as it did with all subsequently formed exchange funds, that they not
offer any of their shares to the public after the initial deposit of portfolio securities without prior Commission approval.
A merger into a fund which continuously offers its shares to the
public falls within this prohibition. Therefore, the funds filed applications for (1) exemptions pursuant to Section 6(c) to permit the
mutual fund to continue to sell its shares to the public and (2) for
orders pursuant to Sections 17 (b) and (d) and Rule 17d-1 to permit
the merger since the transaction involved affiliated persons. At the
time of the merger both exchange funds had eliminated most of the
appreciated securities from their portfolios through gradual turnover of securities and thus all three companies had about the same
amount of unrealized appreciation. The Commission, finding that

none of the investment companies would be treated less advantageously than any other and that the transaction was fair and reasonable
and involved no overreaching on the part of any person concerned,
approved the merger.
Restructuring of Certain SBIC's.-Under
Section 12(e) of the Investment Company Act, a registered investment company may utilize
up to 5 percent of the value of its assets to purchase or otherwise acquire
any securities issued by another investment company engaged in the
business, among others, of financing promotional enterprises or purchasing securities of issuers for which no ready market is in existence
provided that certain other conditions are met.
In order to provide a framework in which investment companies
can retain and operate a portion of their assets under the Small Business Administration program and at the same time free the major
portion of their assets to enable them to take advantage of investment
opportunities not contemplated under that program, the Commission
granted conditional exemptions so as to permit the restructuring of
two publicly owned small business investment companies." The companies, with the concurrence of the Small Business Administration,
created wholly owned subsidiaries to which they transferred their SBA
licenses and certain of their assets. The exemptions permit the parent
to invest in its SBIC subsidiary if the aggregate value of its existing
investment plus the cost of any additional investment does not exceed
25 percent of the value of the parent's total assets on a corporate basis.
The parent remains a registered closed-end investment company and
will be free to invest the major portion of its assets in investments of
a type ineligible under the Small Business Investment Company Act.
Its subsidiary SBIC which will also be registered as a closed-end investment company will invest in assets of a type eligible under the
SBIC Act and will retain the preferred tax treatment available to
SBIC's and the ability to borrow from the SBA.
Bank Commingled Accounts.- The 32nd Annual Report discussed the Commission's order granting certain exemptions with respect to the Commingled Investment Account to be operated by the
First National City Bank of New York as a collective investment
fund under regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency." The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") filed a petition to review this order in the Court of Appeals for the District of

panel of the court dismissed the petition on the ground that the NASD
had no standing to seek review of the Commission's order. A petition
for rehearing by the court en bane was granted, but the court subsequently vacated both the order granting rehearing and the judgment and opinions of November 1967 "in order to permit reconsideration by the assigned division." The case is awaiting decision. In another proceeding involving the same Commingled Account, Investment Oompany Institute v. Oamp,29in which the Commission has not
participated, the District Court for the District of Columbia has held
that the Banking Act of 1933 precludes banks from commingling managing agency accounts. First National City Bank is appealing that
decision.
Control Determinations.- The 32nd Annual Report 30 discussed the
Commission's opinion and order denying an application filed pursuant
to Section 2 (a) (9) of the Investment Company Act by a stockholder of
four investment companies for which Investors Diversified Services,
Inc. ("IDS") serves as investment adviser and principal underwriter.
The application had sought a Commission determination that certain
persons were in control of IDS and of a company which controlled
IDS. On petition for review of the Commission's order, the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit held 31 that it had jurisdiction, pursuant to the judicial renew provisions of the Act, to review a Commission determination under Section 2(a) (9) with respect to control.
Finding that the Commission's decision was supported by substantial
evidence, the court affirmed the Commission's order.
CHANGES IN RULES RELATING TO STATUS OF VARIOUS INVESTMENT
COMPANIES
Amendment of Rule 3c-2 To Permit Greater Participation by Investment Companies in the Securities of Unregistered Small Business Investment Companies

After the close of the fiscal year the Commission adopted an amendment to Rule 3c-2 to permit registered investment companies to own
more than 10 percent of any unregistered SBIC without requiring the
SBIC to register under the Act.32 Section 3(c) (1) excludes from the
definition of an investment company an issuer with less than 100 beneficial owners of securities if certain other criteria are satisfied. However, under that Section the stockholders of a company which owns
more than 10 percent of the issuer's securities would be included as
beneficial owners of the issuer's securities. Rule 3e-2 previously permitted companies with more than 100 shareholders, other than registered investment companies, to invest up to 5 percent of their assets

in unregistered SBIC's without requiring the registration of the
SBIC's. The amendment extends the exclusion provided by Rule 30-2
to ownership of more than 10 percent of an SBIC's securities by a registered investment company if, and so long as, the value of all securities of SBIC's owned by the registered investment company does not
exceed 5 percent of the value of its assets.
New Rule 6e-1 To Clarify Status of Foreign Subsidiaries

Rule 60-1 adopted by the Commission 33 provides an exemption from
the Investment Company Act for certain "finance" subsidiaries of United Stares corporations organized primarily for the purpose of financing the foreign operations of their parent companies through the sale
of debt securities to foreign investors. The finance subsidiaries were
designed, consistent with the requirements of the programs instituted
by the President in February 1965 and January 1968, to raise capital
abroad for the foreign operations of United States corporations in a
manner which would not adversely affect the balance of payments
position of the United States.
In order to clarify the status of a finance subsidiary under the Investment Company Act, it was necessary in the past for the company
and its parent to file a request for exemption from the Act in each case.
The result was that 50 such companies had filed applications and received exemptive orders from the Commission. The adoption of Rule
6c-1 provides an automatic exemption for companies which meet the
qualifications of the rule. So long as the terms of any underwriting
agreement prohibit offers and sales to members of the public who are
United States nationals or residents, transactions among United States
underwriters and dealers participating in an initial distribution will
not disqualify a subsidiary.
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
New Investment Companies With Unusual Investment Policies

During the fiscal year two "venture capital companies" registered
under the Investment Company Act. These closed-end companies intend to focus their investments in the securities of unseasoned or newly
organized corporations in technological and scientific fields. In this
manner they expect to offer an additional source of financing for companies offering innovative products and services and also to provide
the public with an opportunity to participate in these investments. The
venture capital companies hope to perform relatively independently
from the securities markets in general. A third company, which registered as an open-end company, will invest between 10 to 15 percent of
its assets in industries of developing countries that are related directly

to world food and population problems. Typical of such investments
would be securities of firms processing food, manufacturing fertilizer,
farm machinery and irrigation equipment, and firms engaged in land
development. The balance of the company's portfolio will be invested
in securities of domestic companies and will not be so limited.
Funds with Multiple

Advisers

During the fiscal year two open-end funds with multiple advisers
filed registration statements under the Act. At year's end, only one
such fund was offering its shares to the public; the registration statement of the other had not yet become effective. The assets of the fund
are allocated by the principal manager among a number of independent portfolio managers, each of "hom manages a segment. New
money received from the continuous offering of the fund's shares will
be allocated, on the basis of respective investment performances, among
those portfolio managers who have outperformed the Dow-Jones Industrial Average during the preceding four quarters. The fund manager may, subject to the approval of the fund's board of directors,
replace a portfolio manager whose performance is unsatisfactory.
The fees payable to each portfolio manager will range from % to ~

of 1 percent of the average value of the net assets of that portion of
the fund managed by such manager. Such fee rates are lower than the
present fee rates of other funds which are managed exclusively by the
portfolio managers. However, the total management :fee rate of the
multiple adviser fund may be higher than the customary rates paid
by more conventional funds because of the overriding management fee,
ranging from
to % of 1 percent of the average net asset value of
the fund, which the fund pays its principal manager.

PART VI
REGULATION OF PUBLIC.UTILITY HOLDING COMPANIES
Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,the Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding-company systems
engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail distribution
of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to natural gas pipeline companies and other nonutility companies which are subsidiary
companies of registered holding companies. There are three principal
areas of regulation under the Act. The first includes those provisions
of the Act which require the physical integration of public-utility
companies and functionally related properties of holding-company
systems and the simplification of intercorporate relationships and
financial structures of such systems. The second covers the financing
operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the
acquisition and disposition of securities and properties, and certain
accounting practices, servicing arrangements, and intercompany transactions. The third area of regulation includes the exemptive provisions
of the Act, provisions relating to the status under the Act of persons
and companies, and provisions regulating the right of persons affiliated
with a public-utility company to become affiliated with a second such
company through the acquisition of securities.

SECTION II MATfERS IN REGISTERED HOLDING-COMPANYSYSTEMS

In S.E.O. v. New England Electric System ("NEES"),3 the Supreme Court reversed the previously reported 4 decision of the Court
of Appeals for the First Circuit 5 and directed affirmance of the Commission's order requiring NEES to divest itself of its gas properties
and, thus, to limit its operations to a single integrated utility system
as required by Section 11(b). The Commission had rejected NEES'
assertion that the gas properties could not be independently operated
"without the loss of substantial economies" 6 and that it was therefore entitled to retain the additional system under Clause (A) of
Section l1(b) (1), but the court of appeals had found the Commission's analysis deficient.
In finding adequate basis in the record to support the Commission's
conclusions, the Supreme Court noted that the Commission had
"weighed NEES' estimated $1,100,000 losses in relative rather than
absolute terms, calculating the losses as a percentage of NEES' 1958
revenues, expenses, and income," and had then compared the estimated
loss ratios to those which had been shown in prior divestment cases.
The Court held: "It was well within the range of the Commission's
administrative discretion to use the loss ratios, as it did, 'as a guide
in adjudicating the pending case.' ... The Commission in its expert
judgment may so employ evaluative factors it considers relevant."
(Footnotes omitted.)
Similarly, the Court upheld both the Commission's consideration of
data concerning the operations of other gas companies in the same
geographic area and its determination, in light of such data, that
NEES had failed in its attempt "to sustain its burden of showing that
the separated gas system would wither into critical health .... " The
Court stated: "It cannot be a basis for finding error that the Commission found the attempt [by NEES] unpersuasive, given the gas system's size, and the prognosis of efficiencies comparable to those
achieved by the independents." (Footnotes omitted.)
The court also found support for the Commission's findings "that
the projected $1,100,000 loss of economies did not in fact take into
account any offsetting benefits" which might be expected to result from
'390 U.S. 207 (1968).
• 33d Annual Report, p. 121.
" 376 F. 2d 107 (1967).
• In an earlier opinion the court of appeals had disagreed with the Commission's interpretation of the phrase "loss of substantial economies" and had reversed the Commission's divestment order, see 346 F.2d 399 (1965), but the
Commission's view was sustained by the Supreme Court which at that time
remanded the case to the court of appeals for further consideration, 384 U.S. 176

competition between gas and electric companies serving the same areas
now under common holding-company management,'
As reported previously," on November 3, 1966, Penns oil Oompany,
a registered holding company, and United Gas Corporation; its gas
utility subsidiary, jointly filed a plan with the Commission pursuant
to Section 11(e) of the Act, which superseded an earlier plan. The
plan provided for the consolidation of Pennzoil and United to form
a single corporation through an exchange of common stock of Pennzoil and United for securities of the consolidated company. The proceedings on the plan were consolidated with proceedings instituted
by the Commission under Sections 11(b) (1) and 11(b) (2). On February 7, 1968, the Commission issued its Findings and Opinion disapproving the plan," It held that the proposed exchange was not fair
to the common stockholders of United and the plan did not satisfy the
requirements of Section 11(b) (1). Pursuant to Section 11(b) (1), the
Commission ordered Pennzoil to dispose of United's retail gas distribution facilities, holding that "the elimination of Pennzoil as a holding company upon effectuation of the plan would merely alter the
form of common control and ownership under these circumstances.
Neither in law nor as a matter of statutory discretion can we regard
such modal rearrangements as a permissible technique for avoiding the
provisions of Section 11(b) (1)."
Pennzoil and United amended the Section 11(e) plan, agreeing to
the disposition of the gas distribution properties by the consolidated
company and revising the terms of the exchange with respect to the
common stock of United, and, as thus amended, the plan was approved,
subject to a reservation of jurisdiction with respect to certain matters,"
The consolidation of Pennzoil and United became effective on April
1, 1968,and the Commission issued an order under Section 5(d) of the
Act terminating the registration of Pennzoil as a holding company
and reserving jurisdiction in respect of the disposition of the gas
distribution properties and the refinancing of the $214,975,000 of

unusual and exceptional circumstances" therein indicated. The approval contained the condition that, promptly after the consummation
of the exchange, steps be taken to have the only gas utility subsidiary
company of Peoples merged into Peoples Gas or become its direct subsidiary company. The Commission also granted Peoples Gas an exemption under Section 3 (a) (1) of the Act but required that it register
as a holding company in order to retire any unexchanged minority
stock of Peoples and thus comply with Section l1(b) (2) of the Act.22
In Brockton Taunton Gas Oompany v. S.E.O.,23 the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the previously reported 24 order
of the Commission granting an application by Eastern Gas and Fuel
Associates for permission to exercise an option to acquire 4.2 percent
of the outstanding common stock of Brockton Taunton Gas Company
and also to acquire additional shares by means of a cash tender offer.
At the time Eastern filed its application with the Commission it owned
4.9 percent of Brockton's common stock. Under Section 9(a) (2) of the
Holding Company Act, prior Commission approval was required before Eastern could acquire directly or indirectly 5 percent or more
of Brockton's voting securities. The option held by Eastern was to
purchase Brockton shares then owned by the so-called "Brocktaun
Trust." It had been alleged that the trust was merely a "straw trust"
created as an accommodation for Eastern and that Eastern had thereby
acquired more than 5 percent of Brockton's stock in violation of Section 9. The Commission, in its findings and opinion, assumed but did
not find that the Brocktaun trust arrangement constituted a violation
of Section 9(a) (2). The Commission concluded that the acquisition
would serve the public interest and tend towards the economical and
efficient development of an integrated public-utility system. The court
held that the Commission was entitled to give its approval in the
public interest despite the assumed violations.
Illinois Power Oompany, both an electric utility company and gas
utility company and also an exempt holding company, filed an application regarding a proposed offer to exchange 0.65 share of its common
stock for each outstanding share of common stock of Central Illinois
Public Service Company, a nonassociate electric utility company and
gas utility company and also an exempt holding company. A hearing
on the proposal was ordered by the Commission and \VUS in process
.. Peoples Gas Company registered as a holding company under the Act on
February 16, 1968, and filed a plan pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Act to eliminate the unexchanged minority stock. The plan was enforced by order of the
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, dated September 19. 1968,

at the close of the fiscal year." Certain preferred stockholders have
intervened in the proceeding.
American Electric Power Oornpany, Inc., a registered holding company, filed an application relating to a proposed offer by American to
exchange, through an invitation for tenders, shares of common stock
to be issued by it for the outstanding shares of common stock of Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company, a nonassociate electric
utility company," A hearing on American's application was in progress at the end of the fiscal year.
Shortly after the end of the fiscal year, there was filed, and the Commission noticed for hearing, a proposal by two registered holding companies, New England Electric System and E astern. Utilities Associates,
and a nonaffiliated electric utility company, Boston Edison Oompany,
to form a new holding-company system to be named Eastern Electric
Energy System which would register as a holding company. Boston
Edison Company and the present subsidiary companies of New England Electric System and Eastern Utilities Associates would be publicutility subsidiary companies of the system while the two latter companies would, in effect, be merged into the new holding company.
During the year, a hearing was held on an application filed by
Kaneb Pipe Line Oompany, a products pipeline carrier, pursuant to
Section 2(a) (7) of the Act, requesting the Commission to declare it
not to be a holding company notwithstanding its ownership of 19.48
percent of the voting securities of Kansas- Nebraska Natural Gas Company' Inc., a natural gas public-utility company." The management
of Kansas- Nebraska appeared in opposition and contended that the
security ownership and activities of Kaneb required, among other
things, a finding that Kaneb exercised such a controlling influence
over Kansas-Nebraska as to require Kaneb's registration under the
Act, Oral argument was held shortly after the end of the fiscal year,
and the matter awaits Commission determination.
Effective July 15, 1968, the Commission adopted a new rule under
the Act (Rule 51) which makes clear what advnnce steps a person
may take in making acquisitions which require prior Commission
approval pursuant to Section 9 (a) of the Act. 'Where acquisitions are
proposed to be made subject to later Commission approval, the new
rule, in general, permits only such preliminaries as will not substantially affect the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers
in the event the Commission should later find that a proposed transaction does not conform to the applicable statutory standards. The

COMMISSION

The table does not include securities issued and sold by subsidiaries
to their parent holding companies, short-term notes sold to banks, portfolio sales by any of the system companies, or securities issued for stock
or assets of nonaffiliated companies. Transactions of this nature also
require authorization by the Commission except, under Section 6 (b)
of the Act, the issuance of notes having a maturity of 9 months or less
where the aggregate amount does not exceed 5 percent of the principal
amount and par value of the other securities then outstanding. The
table also does not include the issuance and sale of $65 million principal
amount of debentures by Pennzoil United, Inc. which ceased to be a
registered holding company on April 1, 1968, subject to reservations
of jurisdiction over certain financing and other matters,"
Competitive Bidding

All of the 44 issues of securities sold for cash in fiscal 1968, as shown
in the preceding table, and the Pennzoil United debenture issue were
offered for competitive bidding pursuant to the requirement of Rule 50
under the Act.
During the period from May 7, 1941, the effective date of Rule 50,
to June 30,1968, a total of 1,014 issues of securities with an aggregate
value of $15,921 million were sold at competitive bidding under the
rule. These totals compare with 238 issues of securities with an aggregate value of $2,636 million which have been sold pursuant to orders
granting exceptions under paragraph (a) (5). Of the total amount of
securities sold pursuant to such orders, 133 issues with a total value of
$2,153 million were sold by the issuers and the balance of 105 issues aggregating $483 million were portfolio sales. Of the 133 issues sold by
the issuers, 71 were in amounts of from $1 to $5 million each, 3 debt
issues were in excess of $100 million each;" 2 stock issues totaling $36
million were issued in fiscal 1966 to holders of convertible debentures
and employee stock options, and the remaining 57 issues were III
amounts ranging between $5 million and $100 million.
POLICY AS TO REFUNDABILITY OF DEBT ISSUES

In accordance with its long-standing policy under the Act, the
Commission has continued to require that all debt securities and preferred stocks sold by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries be fully refundable at the option of the issuer upon reasonable notice and that any redemption premium be reasonable in amount.
Exceptions from this policy have been permitted only where clearly
warranted by the circumstances of a particular case. One such excepSee pp. 134-135, supra.

tion during fiscal 1968 was the issue and sale by Pennzoil United,
Inc. of $65 million principal amount of its present debentures due
1988 at competitive bidding on June 18, 1968. These debentures carry
a 5-year restriction against refunding at a lower interest cost.
The 33rd Annual Report, pages 126-27, contains a summary of the
results of an examination by the Commission's staff of all electric and
gas utility bond issues (including debentures) sold at competitive bidding between May 14, 1957, and June 30, 1967, by companies subject
to the Act as well as those not subject. This study was extended to include fiscal year 1968. During this period, 762 electric and gas utility
debt issues, aggregating $19,047.4 million principal amount, were offered at competitive bidding. These included 507 refundable issues
totaling $10,380 million, and 255 nonrefundable issues totaling $8,667.4 million. The latter issues were all nonrefundable for 5 years except two. Of the two exceptions, one was nonrefundable for 7 years
and the other for 10 years. The refundable issues thus represented
66.5 percent of the total number of issues and 54.5 percent of principal
amount.
During fiscal year 1968, 96 debt issues were offered, aggregating
$3,042 million principal amount. They consisted of 36 refundable issues totaling $882.5 million and 60 nonrefundable issues totaling $2,159.5 million, The number of refundable issues thus represented 37.5
percent of the number of issues and 29 percent of principal amount.
The weighted average number of bids for fiscal 1968 was 4.42 on
the refundable issues and 4.12 on the nonrefundable issues, while the
median number of bids was 4.5 on the refund ables and 4 on the nonrefundables," With respect to the success of the marketing of the debt
issues, an issue was considered to have been successfully marketed if
at least 95 percent of the issue was sold at the syndicate price prior to
termination of the syndicate. On this basis, during fiscal 1968, 44 percent of the refundable issues were successful, as against 58 percent of
the nonrefundable issues." In terms of principal amount for fiscal
1968, 44.5 percent of the refundable issues were successful as compared to 53.9 percent of the nonrefundable issues." Extension of the
comparison to include the aggregate principal amount of all issues
which were sold at the applicable syndicate prices up to the termina.. The weighted average number of bids received during the period from May
14, 1957, to June 30,1968, was 4.75 on the refundable issues and 4.24 on the nonrefundable issues. The median number of bids was 5 on the refundables and 4
on the nonrefundables .
.. For the period from May 14, 1957, to June 30, 1968, 61.5 percent of the refundable issues and 58.4 percent of the nonrefundable issues were successful

PART

vn

PARTICIPATION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS
The Commission's role under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the U.S.
district courts, differs from that under the various other statutes which
it administers. The Commission does not initiate Chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings, and it has no authority to determine
any of the issues in such proceedings. The Commission participates in
proceedings under Chapter X in order to provide independent, expert
assistance to the courts, the participants, and investors in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. It pays special attention
to the interests of public security holders who may not otherwise be
represented effectively.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
$3 million, Section 172of Chapter X requires the judge, before approving any plan of reorganization, to submit it to the Commission for
its examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed $3
million, the judge may, if he deems it advisable to do so, submit the
plan to the Commission before deciding whether to approve it. 'When
the Commission files a report, copies or a summary must be sent to
all security holders and creditors when they are asked to vote on the
plan. The Commission has no authority to veto or to require the adoption of a plan of reorganization.
The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate to
participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessive administrative burden, many of the cases involve only trade or bank creditors and few public investors. The Commission seeks to participate
principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public investor
interest is involved. However, the Commission may also participate
because an unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed, public
security holders are not represented adequately, the reorganization
proceedings are being conducted in violation of important provisions
of the Act, the facts indicate that the Commission can perform a useful
service, or the judge requests the Commission's participation.
For purposes of carrying out its functions under Chapter X, the
Commission has divided the country into five geographic areas. The
New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle regional officesof the
Commission each have responsibility for one of these areas. Each of
143

144

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

these officeshas lawyers, accountants and financial analysts who are
engaged actively in Chapter X cases in which the Commission has
field its appearance. Supervision and review of the regional offices'
Chapter X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate
Regulation of the Commission, which, through its Branch of Reorganization, also serves as a field office for the fifth area.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

In the fiscal year 1968,the Commission continued to maintain a high
level of activity under Chapter X. It entered its appearance in 22 new
proceedings involving companies with aggregate stated assets of approximately $140 million and aggregate indebtedness of approximately $120 million. These proceedings involved the rehabilitation of
corporations engaged in various businesses, including, among others,
hotel management, real estate development, gas and oil development,
residential construction, commercial and real estate financing, heavy
industrial machining, and a race track.
Including the new proceedings, the Commission was a party in a
total of 109 reorganization proceedings during the year. The stated
assets of the companies involved in these proceedings totalled approximately $860 million and their indebtedness totalled approximately
$730 million. The proceedings were scattered among district courts in
35 states and the District of Columbia as follows: 11 each in California and New York; 8 in Florida; 7 in Arizona; 6 in New Jersey;
5 each in Pennsylvania and ,:V ashington ; 4 each in Indiana, Michigan,
and Texas; 3 each in Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota and North Carolina; 2 each in Alabama, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii,
Kansas, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, South Dakota, and West Virginia;
and 1 each in Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Utah.
During the year, 17 proceedings were closed. As of the end of the
fiscal year the Commission was a party in 92 reorganization proceedings.
JURISDICTIONAL, PROCEDURAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS

In Chapter X proceedings in which it participates, the Commission
seeks to have the courts apply the procedural and substantive safeguards to which all parties are entitled. The Commission also attempts
to secure judicial uniformity in the construction of Chapter X and
the procedures thereunder.

pointed pending approval or dismissal of involuntary Chapter X
petitions filed by creditors. The order of appointment granted the
receiver, in effect, the full powers and duties of a Chapter X trustee,
including the power to investigate the acts and conduct of prior management. The Commission sought to have the authority of the receiver narrowed to include only duties normally vested in a temporary
receiver. The question became moot upon approval of the Chapter
X petitions and appointment of the receiver as the Chapter X trustee.
In Wac, Inc.,3 the Commission objected to the retention in office of
the Chapter X trustee, who had been the supervising partner in
charge of an audit of the debtor's books shortly before the filing of the
Chapter X petition. The accounting firm was a creditor of the estate
since its bill was unpaid, and accordingly the Commission considered
the partner disqualified as trustee under Section 158 (1). In addition,
since Chapter X requires an independent investigation of the debtor,
the Commission felt that the trustee may have compromised his independence by reason of the pre-Chapter X audit of the debtor and
hence was not "disinterested" under Section 158(4). The issues became moot when the trustee resigned.
In Oowmonwealth Financial Oorp.,'" the Commission moved to
vacate the order appointing co-counsel for the Chapter X trustees on
the ground that he was not "disinterested" under Section 158 (4). The
co-counsel was an aetorney who had represented a major creditor of the
debtor in other matters, and his father was Chairman of the Board of
Directors of that creditor and Chairman of a creditors' committee, The
motion of the Commission was denied, but within a few days co-counsel
resigned and the judge accepted his resignation.
InFederal Shoppi;ng Way, Inc., 5 the involuntary Chapter X petition
alleged, as an act of bankruptcy, the prior appointment of a receiver in
a civil suit filed by the Commission against the debtor involving alleged
fraud in the sale of securities under the Securities Act of 1933. The
Commission supported the position that this allegation satisfied Section
131(2).6 The matter was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
InParkwood, Inc.; 7 the court held," as urged by the Commission, that
the Chapter X petitions had been filed in good faith in that it was not
unreasonable to expect that a plan of reorganization could be effected.
The court noted that the announced position of creditors holding first

had no bearing on the question of good faith," The court pointed out
that the alternatives to reorganization-foreclosure
or forced sale-might substantially diminish an indicated equity in excess of $4 million above the claims of the holders of the first deeds of trust.
In Gladstone Mountain Mining Oompany,10 a dormant mining company with book assets of $3,200 and total liabilities of $1,000 consisting of accounting and legal fees filed a voluntary petition under Chapter X. The company sought to increase its capital stock from 1.5 million
to 5 million shares so that it could use the additional stock to acquire
speculative assets. The company's stock is listed on the Spokane Stock
Exchange and it has several hundred shareholders, but it had had
no income from operations for the past several years. The Commission
moved to dismiss the petition for lack of "good faith" under Section
146(3) because it appeared that the proceeding was instituted principally to capitalize a new speculation rather than to rehabilitate a
going-concern enterprise.
In Tower Oredit Oorporation,l1 as previously reported,'> the Commission supported, on appeal," the order of the district judge approving the Chapter X petition as having been filed in "good faith" under
Section 146(4), urging that the Chapter X proceeding would better
subserve the interests of creditors and stockholders than would the
pending State court receivership. The Commission pointed out the
many advantages of the Chapter X proceeding over a State court
receivership, such as the trustee's investigation into past management's
abuses; the greater ability of the Federal reorganization court to deal
exclusively with the assets of a multi-state business operation; the
reorganization standards to measure the feasibility of a reorganization
plan and its fairness to affected persons; and the requirement that the
judge be satisfied as to the qualifications of the persons who are to
constitute the new management of the reorganized company. After the
close of the fiscal year, the appeal was dismissed pursuant to a stipulation of the parties.

district court's denial of a motion made by a creditor and trust certificate holder to dismiss the Chapter X petition as to one of the five trusts
being reorganized in a consolidated proceeding on the ground, among
others, that venue was improper in the Federal court in Indiana. The
district judge had determined that, while the venue requirements of
Sections 128 and 129 of Chapter X had in fact not been met, he nevertheless had discretion under Section 32 of the Bankruptcy Act (authorizing the judge to transfer the proceeding if venue is improper) to
retain jurisdiction. On appeal, the Commission urged that the district
court (1) had no power to dismiss the Chapter X petition for improper
venue and (2) acted within its discretion and properly refused to
transfer the Chapter X proceeding to another district court. After the
close of the fiscal year, the court of appeals agreed with the Commission that, notwithstanding the district court's determination that venue
was improper, the district court lacked authority to dismiss the proceeding and did not abuse its discretion in refusing to transfer the
proceeding.
In Vinco Oorp.,IGthe court denied a motion to vacate the order which
3 years previously had approved the involuntary Chapter X petition.
The motion to vacate was based primarily on the ground that the
debtor had not been served with the subpoena and copy of the involuntary petition. In denying the motion, the court pointed out that
the debtor's attorney and the board chairman's personal attorney each
had been served with a copy of the petition, that the debtor had been
represented by an attorney at the hearing to consider its approval,
and that the debtor had participated in the Chapter X proceeding and
filed a proposed plan of reorganization. On appeal by the debtor to

set aside his order denying the motion and (2) to enter an order directing the referee that in any continued or adjourned session of the
hearings, the Commission must be allowed to propound questions to
witnesses on cross-examination and to offer evidence. The court of
appeals noted that, under Section 208 of Chapter X, the Commission
is ":1 party in interest, with the right to be heard on all matters arising
in such proceeding" and that a limitation such as the district court
sought to impose would hamper the Commission severely in its tasks
as advisor to the court and protector of the public interest.
In General United Oorporation, Inc.,20 the Commission, as reported
previously," moved to classify stockholders into position as creditors
because they had been defrauded in violation of Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The
district judge confirmed the holding of the referee in bankruptcy that
the Commission lacked standing to bring such a motion on behalf of
the stockholders, although the court's order acknowledged that a
charge of fraud seemed justified by the record, and that a class action
would be appropriate. The court interpreted Section 208 of Chapter X,
which defines the Commission's status as "a party in interest" in the
proceeding, as limiting the Commission to the role of an amicus curiae.
The Commission has filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with the
court of appeals," urging that the Commission has the requisite standing to file the motion and that the ruling of the court seriously impairs
the role of the Commission as a party to the Chapter X proceeding in
the interest of public security holders.
In Los Angeles Land and Investments, Ltd.,23 the court, in its
opinion classifying creditors pursuant to Section 197,24 found, as urged
by the Commission, that each person who had purchased from the
debtor an undivided interest in land, sold in violation of the real
estate laws of Hawaii and California and of the Securities Act of 1933,
should be classified as a general unsecured creditor to the extent of
the payments made plus interest for the purpose of participating in

by the referee." The referee, at the request of the trustee, had issued
an order requiring the secured creditor in possession of the properties
under his mortgage to turn over the properties to the trustee." The
court of appeals ordered, as urged by the Commission, that the matter
should be remanded to the district judge and that the turnover order,
as previously modified by the court of appeals, should stay in effect
pending the judge's consideration.
In Yale Eeprese System, In(;.,29 as previously reported," the court
of appeals had remanded the case to the district court to determine
whether, under equitable principles, a creditor secured by a substantial
number of truck trailers and bodies was entitled to reclamation, or,
in the alternative, to rental payments for the use of the trucks and
trailers during reorganization." On remand, the district court held
that reorganization of the debtor was a "reasonable possibility" and
that the secured creditor should not be permitted to reclaim its trailers
or receive rental payments because this would make successful reorganization impossible." The Commission concurred with the court's
ruling and supported its position in a second appeal taken by the
secured creditor.
In affirming the district court, the court of appeals 33 held that, in
view of the reasonable possibility of a successful reorganization
and "the fundamental purpose of reorganization proceedings to enable
the debtor to continue operations as well as to protect the rights of
creditors ... ," the lower court had not abused its discretion in denying claims for reclamation. Moreover, since equal treatment would
have to be afforded all secured creditors, the granting of rental payments could "nullify the reorganization as effectively as granting the
petition for reclamation." In response to the secured creditor's contention that equitable considerations compelled a favorable ruling in its
behalf because the vehicles in which it claimed a security interest were
depreciating, the court noted that ". . . . to such extent as Fruehauf
has been damaged by the use of its property pending the reorganization, it is entitled to equitable consideration in the reorganization
plan." The court of appeals further noted that the trustee had offered
to fix the value of the security interest claimed by the secured creditor

so that its position in any reorganization would be unaffected by

In Webb ill Knapp, hW.,35 as previously reported," the Chapter X
trustee instituted an action against the indenture trustee, based on the
latter's alleged misconduct or gross negligence, to recover on behalf of
the debenture holders the entire principal amount of debentures outstanding ($4,298,000). This action, which was supported by the Commission, was dismissed by the district court on motion of the indenture
trustee." The district court ruled that the claims involved were personal to the debenture holders and that the Chapter X trustee had no
standing to assert the claims on their behalf." The trustee and the
Commission had argued before the district court, among other things,
that where public creditors are widely dispersed and may be without
effective representation, the Chapter X trustee should be permitted to
represent their interest, consistent with the aims of the Bankruptcy
Act. The Chapter X trustee has appealed the dismissal of his action."
In Westeo 0orporation,40 Chemetron Corporation filed a claim in
the reorganizwtion proceeding seeking rescission of its sale to the debtor
prior to the Chapter X proceeding of Pan Goo Atlas Corporation
and requested leave to file suit against the debtor and others in connection with this transaction. Shortly thereafter, the trustee filed
objections to Chemetron's claims and to its motion for leave to file
suit and counterclaimed against Chemetron for $10 million. Both
Chemetron's claim and the trustee's counterclaim are based on fraud.

Chemetron objected to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to
hear the counterclaim and its claim in the same summary proceeding.
The Commission urged that the reorganization court had summary
jurisdiction to hear both a creditor's claim and the trustee's counterclaim upon which affirmative relief could be granted where, as in the
instant case, the counterclaim arose out of the same transaction as
the creditor's claim. Thereafter, the trustee and Chemetron proposed
a compromise of the claim and counterclaim, conditioned upon the
approval of a proposed plan of reorganization. The Commission recommended to the court that the compromise be considered only at the
time of the hearing on a plan of reorganization. The court adopted
the Commission's view, and, after the close of the fiscal year, a proposed plan was filed and hearings were conducted by the court.
In F. L. Jacobs 00./1 previously reported," after the plan was
consummated the trustees filed a petition in the reorganization court
to restrain the New York Stock Exchange and the Commission from
delisting the debtor's common stock and to order the restoration of
trading of the stock on the Exchange." The court agreed with the
Commission that the court had no jurisdiction to enjoin an administrative proceeding for delisting and that the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction over such matters, subject to statutory review by
the court of appeals.
The Exchange had suspended trading in the debtor's stock in 1958,
and in 1959 had filed an application with the Commission, pursuant
to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,to strike the
debtor's common stock from listing and registration, but action thereon
was deferred during the reorganization proceedings. After a plan of
reorganization was consummated and after the debtor's unsuccessful
efforts to enjoin the administrative proceeding, the Exchange pressed
its delisting application, referring to the debtor's failure to meet delisting criteria as to assets and earnings for several years during the
reorganization proceeding and noting that the debtor did not meet,
by a substantial amount, certain original listing standards. Under the
Exchange delisting standards, a company which falls below those
standards may be required to bring itself up to the stricter original
listing standards as a condition to continued listing. In opposition,
the debtor noted that it was not presently below the de1isting standards
and pointed to the success of the reorganization and to the fact that
it had been operating at a profit for some years and was expanding.
The Commission held that under the circumstances here involved, including the fact that the Jacobs stock would have been delisted in

1959 absent intercession of the Chapter X proceeding, "it seems clearly
appropriate for the Exchange to require Jacobs to satisfy original
listing standards as a condition to the resumption of trading." ~

TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the prior management is a requisite under Chapter X. One of the primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough study of the debtor to
assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the estate, including
claims against officers, directors, or controlling persons who may have
mismanaged the debtor's affairs. The staff of the Commission often
aids the trustee in his investigation.
In We8tee Oorporatiorc" the trustee conducted an extensive investigation into the affairs of the debtor, in which the Commission's staff
participated. Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the trustee instituted suit against 93 individuals and firms, including 18 brokerage
houses and the debtor's accounting firm, charging fraud and mismanagement leading to the company's financial collapse.
In Oommonwealth Financial Oorporatiotu" the former president of
the debtor moved for a protective order staying any attempts by the
trustees to take his deposition in the course of the trustees' Section 167
investigation. He alleged that the Commission apparently had been
conducting a separate and independent investigation of the affairs of
the debtor including his activities,
The court denied the motion, finding that the Commission was authorized to participate in the trustees' investigation and ruling that the
former president was free to assert his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination at any time and that this constitutional safeguard
was sufficient protection."
After the close of the fiscal year, the former president appealed to the
court of appeals." The oourt denied his motion for a stay pending the
appeal and ordered the trustees' motion to quash the appeal continued
until the argument of the appeal on the merits.

formal advisory reports; its views on 10 plans involved in 5 proceedings were transmitted to the court by written memoranda or presented
orally at the hearings on approval of the plans."
In TNT Trailer Ferry, lne.,50 the Supreme Court reversed 51 the
decision of the court of appeals 52 which had affirmed an order of the
district court confirming a plan of reorganization for the debtor. The
district court had. excluded stockholders from participation in the
reorganized company because of its finding that the debt-or was insolvent. The Supreme Court held, as urged by the Commission and
the stockholders' protective committee, that the going-concern value
of TMT had been improperly established in that the district court
had referred solely to the operating experience of TMT while under
trusteeship and failed to consider the foreseeable prospects of the
company once it was out of the reorganization proceeding. The court
also ruled that the district court erred in allowing almost in full
two substantial disputed claims aggregating about $2 million, on the
basis of alleged compromises, without hearings on the merits of the
claims and the objections to them. The court did not reach other contentions of the Commission and committee: (1) that a Chapter X
trustee, as a matter of law, could not succeed himself as president of
the reorganized company; and (2) that stockholders who had purchased stock sold to them in violation of the Federal securities laws
had. claims against the debtor as to which they could participate as
creditors in a plan of reorganization, regardless of the insolvency of
the debtor.

by Yale to Republic. The Commission took the position, witn which
the court agreed, that, among other things, the plan provided adequate consideration for Yale's relinquishment of its interest in Republic and that implementation of the plan would leave the balance
of Yale's creditors, including its subordinated public debenture holders, in a substantially better posture than that possible under any
consolidated plan of reorganization.
In Oonamdaiqua Enterprises Uorporationr" reported previously,"
the Commission filed four separate memoranda on six different proposed plans of reorganization, and on an amendment of one of the
plans, finding fair and equitable only the two plans which provided
for the auction sale of the debtor's assets at a minimum upset price
of $4 million, and the distribution to creditors of all proceeds and
cash on hand according to their respective priorities. It was estimated
that these plans would provide at least a 50 percent payment of the
unsecured claims, including those of public debenture holders. The
plans were also found to be feasible, with the reservation that the
court Should be satisfied of a firm offer to purchase the assets and the
ability of the offeror to perform. The court has ruled on five of the
plans and in its decision has, in effect, adopted the recommendations
of the Commission. However, only the trustee's plan was approved
because "no advantage to the unsecured creditors would result from
the approval of two practically identical plans."
The three other plans of reorganization were not approved by the
court, which referred to "the reasons set forth" in the Commission's
memoranda. The Commission had objected to one plan because it
provided for the participation of stockholders despite the debtor's
clear insolvency and because of the excessive debt structure it proposed. Another plan providing for a fixed distribution to unsecured
creditors of 48 percent of their claims was found to be unfair because
i,t precluded creditors from benefiting from a possible reduction in the
debtor's recorded claims Or a sale of the assets at a price in excess of
the opening bid. A third plan, which offered unsecured creditors a
49 percent stock interest in the company or a cash alternative of 50
percent of their claims, was found to be unfair because of the inadequate contribution of the plan proponent for the 51 percent stock
interest and control in the reorganized company, and valuable concession rights. As to the sixth plan and the amended plan which the
court has not yet reviewed, the Commission found them to be unfair
because each plan contains alternatives which are unfair, when measured by the parallel provisions in the other. One of the two plans
offers the unsecured creditors the largest stock interest of any proM

posed plan (59 percent) as an alternative to cash, and the other plan
offers the largest cash distribution of any proposed plan (75 percent)
as an alternative to stock. The trustee's motion for authority to sell
the assets of the debtor apart from any plan of reorganization was
opposed by the Commission and denied by the Court. One of the unsuccessful plan proponents has appealed the court's order rejecting
its plan."
In Arizona Lutheran H ospital,57 involving a nonprofit organization, the court approved and confirmed, as urged by the Commission,
the trustee's plan of reorganization which provided for the distribution of the proceeds of a previous sale of all the assets to Lutheran
Hospital & Homes Society of America, Inc. Under the plan, in accordance with the terms of the sale, the first mortgage bonds, held by about
1,000 persons, received cash payment in full for the outstanding principal balance of $2.7 million and accrued interest of $900,000. Unsecured creditors received nonnegotiable notes issued by the purchaser
of the assets representing the full amount of the principal of their
claims, to be paid over a 41;2year period without interest. The Commission noted that the court had found that the value of the assets
securing the bonds was less than the principal due on the bonds, and
that the bondholders nevertheless were to be paid in full, including
interest, while unsecured creditors would not receive interest on their
claims. The Commission pointed out, however, that a suit had been
instituted against the purchaser of the assets and others alleging
violations of Federal securities laws in the sale of the bonds to the
public investors; that dismissal of the suit was one of the conditions
of the sale and the plan; and that the payment to the bondholders reflected in part settlement of the suit.
In POlyCMt 001'p01'ation,58the plan of reorganization for the continuation of the debtor's business, which the court confirmed, provided
that all general unsecured creditors, including the public debenture
holders, would have the option of receiving for each $100 of claim
either $3 in cash or 10 shares of the new common stock. The debtor's
public stockholders would not participate in the plan, since the court
found the debtor to be insolvent. The plan proponents would receive
over 80 percent of the new common stock in return for a contribution
of cash and assets necessary for the operation of a new manufacturing
process. The Commission advised the court, and the court agreed, that
the plan was fair and equitable and feasible.

by the Commission, approved a plan which provided for the sale of
the debtor's assets and the disposition of the proceeds to the debtor's
creditors and stockholders. Under the plan the stockholders were to
receive about $150,000 from the sale after the satisfaction of creditor
claims, plus whatever was recovered from pending causes of action on
behalf of the estate. The plan provided for the subordination of about
000,000shares of common stock held by former officersand directors.
In Atlas Sewing Oenters, lno.,60 as reported previosuly," the district
court in 1965 had declared a plan of reorganization to have been substantially consummated. However, the new securities and cash required to be issued were never issued and in 1967 the court found that
the plan proponent had not fulfilled his obligation to provide additional funds. The district court appointed a receiver and entered an
order adjudging the debtor a bankrupt. In March 1968,the trustee was
surcharged $56,666.67,the total of the fees he had been granted by the
court during the course of the Chapter X proceeding, because he had
acted in "deliberate defiance" of orders of the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit 62 and had given "unfaithful service" to the district
court. The trustee's appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit from the surcharge order was pending at the close of the fiscal
year.
ACTIVITIES

WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid to the various
parties for services rendered and for expenses incurred in the proceeding. The Commission, which under Section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act
may not receive any allowance for the services it renders, has sought to
assist the courts in assuring economy of administration and in allocating compensation equitably on the basis of the claimants' contributions to the administration of estates and the formulation of plans.
During the fiscal year 124 applications for compensation totaling
about $3 million were reviewed.
In Arlington Discount 00., 63 reported previously," the Commission filed a motion under Section 328 of Chapter XI, which was
granted, whereupon the debtor amended its petition to comply with
the requirements of Chapter X. Subsequently, the attorneys for the

debtor-in-possession in the Chapter XI proceeding requested a final
allowance of $40,000 for services rendered for the approximately 6month period during which the proceeding had been in Chapter XI.
The Commission recommended an allowance of $15,000, pointing out
that a great deal of the time spent by the attorneys had been unproductive and of no benefit to the estate because the debtor, on the advice of the applicants, had filed a petition under Chapter XI rather
than under Chapter X. The court allowed $7,500,stating, among other
things, that the use of Chapter XI by the attorneys was "in complete
disregard of the standards laid down by the Supreme Court" in Securities and Exchange tIomanlseion. v. American Trailer Rentals 00.,
379 U.S. 594 (1965). The attorneys have appealed to the Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit 65 and the matter was pending at the
close of the fiscal year.
In Coast Investors, Inc.,66 as previously reported," counsel for a
committee appealed from an order of the district court which awarded
him $10,000 as compensation for services. Counsel sought an allowance
of $18,000, which amount the Commission recommended. On appeal
the Commission argued that the district court erred in holding that
a different standard for allowances applies when the Chapter X reorganization plan provides, as in this case, for an orderly liquidation.
While the court of appeals agreed 68 that the same fee standards apply to all Chapter X proceedings, it held that in the instant case the
lower court's reference to the orderly liquidation over a period of
years under the plan was merely factual, and noted also that failure to
achieve a successful reorganization should not diminish the compensation for useful services since Congress desired to encourage bona fide
efforts to reorganize debtor corporations as going concerns.
In Food Town, Inc.,69 the proceeding had been referred generally
to the referee in bankruptcy who had held numerous hearings as referee and as special master over a period of years. The referee requested
a fee for his services pursuant to Section 241 of Chapter X. The Commission pointed out that the referee's salary is fixed by statute and
any allowances for his services are paid to the Treasury of the United
States for the Referees' Salary and Expense Funds; that these funds
are not allocated to any specific referee and thus referees have no interest in the charges for their official services; and that the annual
salary of the referee may serve as a guide for determining under Section 241 the compensation to be allowed for the referee's services in

Chapter X. The Commission rejected a suggestion that the allowances
for the referee's services should reflect overhead costs of his office.The
court, as recommended by the Commission, awarded the amount requested by the referee, without commenting on the issues raised by the
Commission.
In Westeo Oorporation,70 a practicing attorney who had been designated by the court as special master to conduct and preside over examinations to be taken on behalf of the trustee requested an interim
allowance based on a rate of $350 a day for his time spent so presiding
and in other matters such as conferences with attorneys. The Commission, noting that the applicant was acting as a quasi-judicial officer,
expressed the view that compensation provided for other judicial officers was an appropriate reference. Noting that a United States district
judge receives a salary of $35,000 per annum, or a daily rate of $150 to
$175, it recommended an allowance for the special master at the rate
of $200 per day. The Commission took the position that the allowance
should reflect the fact that the special master must pay his officeoverhead but also the relatively limited scope of his responsibilities. The
court awarded the special master the fees requested by him.
In Hydrooarbon Ohemicale, lno.,71 appeals were taken from the
orders of the district court, previously reported," (1) denying compensation to the debtor's principal attorney because he traded in the
debtor's stock during the Chapter XI proceeding which preceded the
Chapter X proceeding, and (2) denying compensation to two attorneys
retained by the principal attorney on the basis that their retention had
not been authorized as provided by General Order 44 of the Bankruptcy Act (requiring prior court authorization for the services of an
attorney to be performed for a trustee, receiver, or debtor-in-possession). The principal attorney, who served in both the Chapter XI and
Chapter X proceedings, was denied any compensation because he had
sold short stock of the debtor 2 days before the filing of the Chapter
XI petition and had covered his short sale by the purchase of the
debtor's stock immediately after filing that petition. As urged by the
Commission, the court of appeals affirmed the denial of compensation,
noting that Section 249 of Chapter X was applicable to securities
transactions where, pursuant to Section 328 of Chapter XI, a Chapter
XI proceeding has been superseded by a Chapter X proceeding."
The court further held that General Order No. 44 did not bar an award
of compensation to the two attorneys retained by the principal attorney, who sought compensation for services rendered during the ChapS.D. Texas, No. 66-H-62.

ter XI phase of the proceeding." Since a receiver had been appointed
during the Chapter XI proceeding, the debtor had not been in possession and General Order No. 44 did not apply to attorneys for the
debtor unless the services performed by the debtor's attorneys in the
Chapter XI proceeding had been of a character reserved to a receiver
in a Chapter XI proceeding. In accordance with the Commission's
suggestion, the questions of whether the services could have been performed only by counsel for the Chapter XI receiver and the amount
of compensation, if any, to be awarded, were remanded to the district
court for its consideration. The court also agreed with the Commission
that the disqualification from compensation of the principal attorney
did not also bar the attorneys he had retained. After the close of the
fiscal year, the court of appeals granted the petition of the Chapter
X trustee for rehearing on this point and ordered reargument en bane.
In Yale Express System, lne.,75 the collateral trustee under a trust
agreement between the debtor and certain of its institutional creditors
entered into prior to the inception of the reorganization proceeding
sought compensation of $15,000 for its own services as trustee and
reimbursement of $23,250 for payment of fees to its counsel. The
district court, agreeing with the Commission, held that the reasonableness of the fees must be based on reorganization standards, as
distinguished from ordinary commercial standards, although the
terms of the trust agreement would be a factor in evaluating reasonableness." The court awarded the trustee $8,593, as recommended by
the Commission. The Commission had recommended an allowance of
$17,500 for the trustee's counsel, and the court awarded $19,900.
In Parknoood, Inc.,77 the Commission submitted a memorandum in
connection with an application by the holder of a first deed of trust
on one of the debtor's real estate properties for reimbursement of fees
and expenses paid and to be paid to its counsel. The deed of trust and
note provided that the debtor would pay reasonable counsel fees if
suit were brought Orif any litigation occurred. The Commission urged
that, assuming the validity under applicable State law of the deed of
trust and note and of the provision relating to attorneys' fees, a Federal
standard must be applied in determining the reasonableness of the
fees to be awarded by the reorganization court and that the standards
of reasonableness which would be applied by the State courts were not
controlling. In the same case the Commission took the position with
regard to applicatons for interim allowances that such interim allowIn re Hyd,'ocarbon Oliemicals, Inc. (C.A. 3, June 10, 1968) .

ances should not be based on a fixed percentage of what the applicants
regard as full compensation. The Commission pointed out that, since
interim allowances are payments on account of a possible future allowance and do not purport in any way to reflect or measure the value of
the services rendered, the court does not adopt an assumed or hypothetical final allowance and then award a percentage of such allowance.
For the court to do so would create the erroneous impression that
implied approval had been given to the full amount claimed. The
referee in bankruptcy, sitting as special master, agreed with the Commission and the judge adopted his recommendations as to awards.
In the same proceeding the Commission recommended an award of
interim reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred by a committee representing holders of second deeds of trust on various properties of the debtor, The Commission pointed out that interim allowances
for compensation and expenses are not usually recognized for persons
other than the trustee and his counsel. However, formation of committees to represent numerous and usually scattered equity holders is
to be encouraged in reorganization proceedings. Since committees
should be encouraged to take an active role in the proceeding and be
effective instruments for communication between the security holders
they represent, an award of interim reimbursement of reasonable expenses seemed warranted. The committee did not apply for interim
fees.
INTERVENTION

IN CHAPTER

XI PROCEEDINGS

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure by which
debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts
under court supervision. Where a proceeding is brought under that
chapter but the facts indicate that it should have been brought under
Chapter X, Section 328 of Chapter XI authorizes the Commission or
any other party in interest to make application to the court to dismiss
the Chapter XI proceeding unless the debtor's petition is amended to
comply with the requirements of Chapter X, or a creditors' petition
under Chapter X is filed.
In Manu!actu'rers' Oredit Oorporation." the debtors, consisting of
the parent and 25 affiliated and subsidiary companies, were engaged
primarily in the business of operating bus lines in New Jersey and
vicinity. Over a period of many years certain of the debtors had sold
to the public their unsecured promissory notes carrying interest at
rates between 9 percent and 15 percent per annum, totalling approximately $58 million, without registration of these securities with this
Commission or the Interstate Commerce Commission. Approximately
5,000 public investors held these notes at the time of the filing of the
71

D. N.J., No. B-I084-67.

Chapter XI proceeding. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,
affirming 79 the order of the district court, which had granted the
Commission's Section 328 motion," agreed with the Commission that
the proposed plan of arrangement under Chapter XI which would
have turned the companies over to the creditors (including the public
noteholders) was not sufficient to protect the public investors, but that
the full safeguards of Chapter X were required. In reaching this conclusion the court considered the need to make a substantial adjustment
of widely-held public debt, the necessity for a thorough investigation
of possible management improprieties by an independent trustee, and
the fact that there could exist causes of action under Federal securities
laws on behalf of the public investors which could better be prosecuted
by a trustee than by the individuals involved.
In Eendali Industries, Inc.,81 the Commission supported the motion
of creditors pursuant to Section 328 and urged that the financial condition of the debtor required more than a simple composition of its
unsecured debts and that, particularly, a large amount of secured debt
would have to be modified, necessitating the broader scope of Chapter
X. The court granted the motion and the debtor amended its petition
to comply with the requirements of Chapter X.

SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES
PUBLIC

INFORMATION

SERVICES

Dissemination of Information

As the discussion in prior sections of this Report indicates, most
large corporations in which there is a substantial public investor
interest have filed registration statements or registration applications
under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act with the
Commission and are required to file annual and other periodic reports.
Widespread public dissemination of the financial and other data
included in these documents is essential if public investors generally
are to benefit by the disclosure requirements of the securities laws. This
is accomplished in part by distribution of the prospectus or offering
circular in connection with new offerings. Much of the data is also
reprinted and receives general circulation through the medium of
securities manuals and other financial publications, thus becoming
available to broker-dealer and investment adviser firms, trust departments and other financial institutions and, through them, to public
investors generally.
Various activities of the Commission also facilitate public dissemination of information filed as well as other information. Among
these is the issuance of a daily "News Digest" which contains (1) a
resume of each proposal for the public offering of securities for which
a Securities Act registration statement is filed; (2) a list of issuers of
securities traded over-the-counter which have filed registration statements under the Securities Exchange Act; (3) a list of companies
which have filed interim reports disclosing significant corporate
developments; (4) a summary of all notices of filings of applications
and declarations, and of all orders, decisions, rules and rule proposals issued by the Commission; (5) announcements of the Commission's participation in corporate reorganization proceedings under
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act and of the filing of advisory
reports of the Commission on the fairness and feasibility of reorganization plans; (6) a brief report regarding actions of courts in litigation resulting from the Commission's law enforcement program; and
(7) a brief reference to each statistical report issued by the Commission. During the year, the News Digest included summary reports
on the 2,616 registration statements filed with the Commission (not
163

164

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

including investment company offering proposals filed as amendments to previously filed statements), 1,128 notices of filings, orders,
decisions, rules and rule proposals issued by the Commission, 289
developments in litigation under its enforcement program, 19 releases
on corporate reorganization proceedings, and 78 statistical releases.
The News Digest is made immediately available to the press, and it
is also reprinted and distributed by the Government Printing Office,
on a subscription basis, to some 2,956 investors, securities firms, practicing lawyers and others. In addition, the Commission maintains
mailing lists for the distribution of the full text of its orders, decisions, rules and rule proposals.
These informational activities are supplemented by public discussions from time to time of legal, accounting and other problems arising in the administration of the Federal securities laws. During the
year, members of the Commission and numerous staff officers made
speeches before various professional, business and other groups interested in the Federal securities laws and their administration and
participated in panel discussions of like nature. Participation in these
discussions not only serves to keep attorneys, accountants, corporate
executives and others abreast of developments in the administration
of those laws, but it also is of considerable value to the Commission in
learning about the problems experienced by those who seek to comply
with those laws. In order to facilitate such compliance the Commission
also issues from time to time general interpretive releases and policy
statements explaining the operation of particular provisions of the
Federal securities laws and outlining policies and practices of the
Commission.
During fiscal year 1968, the Commission published in booklet form
a compilation of releases, Commission opinions and other material
dealing with matters frequently arising under the Investment Company Act, and a compilation of releases dealing with matters arising
under the Securities Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers
Act. A previous compilation booklet, containing releases relating to
Securities Act matters, had been published in fiscal year 1965.
Puhlications.-In
addition to the daily News Digest, and releases
concerning Commission action under the Acts administered by it and
litigation involving securities violations, the Commission issues a number of other publications, including the following:

D.C. Also available at that location are some additional documents
contained in Commission files and indexes of Commission decisions.
The categories of materials which are available for public examination are specified in the Commission's rule concerning records and
information, 11 CFR 200.80, as revised to implement the provisions of
the Public Information Amendment to Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act which became effective July 4, 1967. The rule also

more than one-half man-hour of work is performed by members of the
Commission's staff to locate and make available records requested.
The fee rate which has been established is $2.50 for each one-half manhour or fraction thereof after the first one-half man-hour.
The Commission has special public reference facilities in the New
York and Chicago Regional Offices,and some facilities for public use
in other regional and branch offices.Each regional officehas available
for public examination copies of prospectuses used in recent offerings
of securities registered under the Securities Act; registration statements and recent annual reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act by companies having their principal office in the region;
broker-dealer and investment adviser applications originating in the
region; letters of notification under Regulation A filed in the region;
and indexes of Commission decisions. Additional material is available
in the New York, Chicago and San Francisco regional offices.
Members of the public may make arrangements through the public
reference room at the Commission's principal officesto purchase copies
of material in the Commission's public files. Under the existing contract with a commercial copying company, the cost of facsimile copies
made from documents supplied by the Commission is 9 cents per
page for pages not exceeding 8%" x 14" in size, with a $2 minimum
charge. In a significant step forward during the fiscal year, the Commission entered into a contract with a private company pursuant to
which a microfilm and "microfiche" service will be available at reasonable cost to persons or firms who have or can obtain viewing facilities.
The microfiche service will provide up to 60 images of pages on a
4" x 6" film, referred to as a "fiche." Initially, annual microfiche subscriptions will be offered in a variety of packages covering all public
reports filed on Forms 10-K, 9-K and 8-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Form N-1Q under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, with subscriptions retroactive to include reports filed
since January 1, 1968. The packages offered will include various
groupings of these reports, including reports based on selected industry classifications. Arrangements also may be made to subscribe to
reports of companies of one's own selection, but at a somewhat higher
cost than for standard subscription packages. It is believed that the
subscription system can be extended to additional groups of filings in
the future. The company also will supply at reasonable prices copies
in microfiche or microfilm form of any other public records of the
Commission desired by a member of the public. Readers will be installed in major public reference areas in the Commission's headquarters and regional offices,and sets of reports will be available for
examination there.
Visitors to the public reference rooms of the Commission's Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago offices also may make immediate

reproductions of material in those offices on coin -operated copying
machines at a cost of 25 cents per 8112"x 14" page. The charge for
an attestation with the Commission seal is $2. Detailed information concerning copying services available and prices for the
various types of service and copies may be obtained from the Public
Reference Section of the Commission.
Each year, many thousands of requests for copies of and information from the public files of the Commission are received by the Public
Reference Section in Washington, D.C. During the 1968 fiscal year,
8,715 persons examined material on file in Washington and several
thousand others examined files in the New York, Chicago, and other
regional offices.More than 16,833 searches were made for information
requested by individuals and approximately 2,470 letters were written
with respect to information requested.

DATA PROCESSING

of Automation

Techniques

Reference has already been made in previous sections of this report
to certain uses of the Commission's computer.' During the 1968 fiscal
year the Commission expanded its use of automation for the analysis
of data related to the economics and practices of the securities industry. In one new application, the computer is now being used for the
analysis of data contained in the quarterly reports of management investment companies on Form N-1Q. These reports provide the Commission with information about portfolio transactions and holdings
for the same periods for all such companies and facilitate market impact and other studies. The computer is also used for the collection and
monthly updating of price and volume data for listed securities. This
data is processed in conjunction with Form N-1Q data in connection
with market impact studies.
In March 1968, the Commission revised Form N-1R, the annual report of management investment companies, to require such companies
to furnish much of the data in a manner readily adaptable to computer processing. A system has been designed to use the computer for
retrieval and analyses of data for industry studies. It also will be used
to screen on a continuing basis the information furnished in the reports in order to identify companies or groups of companies in which
problems exist.
A system is under development for the processing of data contained
in the revised broker-dealer and investment adviser applioation forms.
Much of the examination of information contained in the new forms
will be done by the computer, and the EDP files also will be used for
comprehensive studies of the securities industry.

See, e.g, pp. 87 and 107.

168

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

EDP applications planned for the future include systems for (a)
analyses of data contained in Forms X-17A-10, the new income and
expense reports of registered broker-dealers, and (b) processing of reports of security holdings and transactions of corporate insiders.
Increase in EDP Capability

In fiscal 1968 the Commission increased its EDP capability by making certain changes incident to the purchase of its IBM: System 360
computer configuration. A Model 40 control processing unit and an
1100 line per minute printer were substituted for the Model 30 unit
and the 600 line per minute printer, respectively, which previously had
been under lease.
The EDP staff also developed a series of general purpose statistical!
economic analyses computer programs that offer a high degree of flexibility for varied analyses of large bodies of data related to the economics of the securities industry and industry practices. In addition,
the staff began a study looking toward improved methods and equipment for conversion of data into machinable form.
Assistance to State Administrators and Others

As a further means of coordinating its regulatory activities with
those of the States and the self-regulatory institutions, during the past
year the Commission developed procedures for supplying certain information from its computer files. Under these procedures the Commission, upon request, furnishes State authorities or self-regulatory
institutions with data from the Commission's integrated regulatory
and enforcement information system or the over-the-counter market
surveillance system," In addition, selected data from the Commission's
computer files has been furnished to the Department of Justice in
response to a number of requests from that Department.
Sharing of EDP Facilities

During the past year the Commission continued its sharing arrangement with the Naval Ship Engineering Center, Department of the
Navy. Under this arrangement the Commission provides about 2,000
hours of computer time per year at a significant saving to the Government as compared with the prevailing rates of outside sources. In
January 1968, the Commission entered into a supplemental agreement
with the Center to keypunch and verify more than 1 million cards
per year. The rate charged by the Commission for this project also is
considerably lower than the prevailing outside rate. The Commission
has also provided small amounts of computer time to other Federal
agencies.

These systems were described in the 32nd Annual Report, p. 9.

EDP Training

During the year the Commission continued its training programs
geared to the specific needs of its computer specialists. The program is
designed to enable the Commission's EDP staff to utilize more advanced hardware and software in the development and implementation
of new and revised computer systems.
PERSONNEL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Organizational Changes

During fiscal year 1968, certain organizational changes were effected
in accordance with the Commission's policy of continuing review of
all its operations to assure maximum utilization of manpower and the
most efficient and economical operations possible.
In August 1967, the Branch of Information Processing, formerly
located in the Office of Records and Service, was established as a
separate Officeof Data Processing. With the growing impact of EDP
on the Commission's activities, it is desirable that the head of the
Office of Data Processing should be in a position to deal directly with
users and prospective users throughout the Commission, and, within
the framework of overall Commission policy, be free to make operating
and policy decisions concerning EDP activities.
In October 1967, an additional Associate Regional Administrator
position was established in the New York Regional Office. This position was designated as Associate Regional Administrator for Enforcement, and the previously established position was designated
as Associate Regional Administrator for Regulation. This change
was designed to provide for maximum attention to policy formulation and implementation in each of these programs.
In November 1967, a fifth Branch of Investment Company Regulation was established in the Division of Corporate Regulation. This
change was designed to enable the Division better to cope with the
significant increase in workload in the regulation of investment
companies.
Personnel Program

Highlights of the Commission's personnel program in fiscal 1968
included (1) the adoption of a formal Equal Employment Opportunity Action Plan; (2) the expansion of college recruitment efforts
to fill entrance level positions; (3) the continuation of training activities for employees; and (4) the addition of an important fringe
benefit in the form of a Dependent Life Insurance Plan.
Recognizing a need to translate stated policy into affirmative action,
the Commission, in July 1967, adopted a comprehensive Action Plan
under the Equal Employment Opportunity Program. The plan specifically and realistically outlines short and long-range objectives

170

SECURITIES

AND

EXCHANGE

COl\£MISSION

under the program and specific action to be taken to carry out a
program of equal opportunity for employment and career development. In this connection, the Chairman appointed an Equal Employment Opportunity Officer, reporting directly to him, to serve as consultant and principal staff adviser to the Commission in carrying out
the over-all Equal Employment Opportunity Program.
In furtherance of the objectives of the Action Plan and the Civil
Service Commission's Program for the Maximum Utilization of Skills
and Training (MUST), the Director of Personnel launched a special
program to interview personally and individually all employees in the
Headquarters Officeserving in nonprofessional jobs in the lower grade
levels. The primary purpose of these interviews is to determine whether
the skills of these employees are being fully utilized and to counsel
them about career development opportunities in genera1. As a consequence of these sessions, some jobs were redesigned and promotions
made based on increased duties and responsibilities.
During the fall and spring recruitment season of 1967-1968, the
Commission undertook a nationwide coordinated program for oncampus visitations to selected law schools and colleges with schools
of business administration, for the recruitment of attorneys and financial analysts. More schools than ever before were visited, with
very gratifying results. The Commission's effectiveness in attracting
high-quality graduates was enhanced this year because recruiters were
authorized to make advance commitments to honors graduates. Most of
the visits were made by members of the Commission's professional staff
who had attended or were graduates of the school visited.
Visits to predominantly Negro colleges and universities received
strong emphasis as the Commission stepped up its efforts to recruit
qualified minority group graduates. Additionally, as part of its equal
opportunity program, letters were written to all Spanish-surnamed
college graduates with majors in accounting, finance and economics
from schools throughout the country. They were informed of the
Commission's needs and urged to visit its nearest office for further
information regarding employment opportunities.
Additional emphasis was also placed on the recruitment of women
candidates by taking such positive steps as contacting law and business
schools to obtain the names of women students and sending personal
letters to them about specific job opportunities. Further, with the help
of the Commission's present women employees who belong to bar
associations, or other professional organizations, detailed information
was sent to these organizations about career opportunities for women
in the SEC, and applications were solicited from interested members.
Since the fan of 1967, the Commission has officiallysponsored a stenographic course, after hours, in the Headquarters Office. Upon com-

171

THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

pletion of the course, the participants, who are predominantly members
of minority groups, hopefully will qualify in the necessary civil
service examination and become eligible for reassignyent and possible
grade promotion. This training course, whioli also willlelp to alleviate
the problem of locating qualified stenographers and secretaries, is
available to any SEC employee interested in enrolling.
I n July 1967, all marfied employees of the Commission were offered
enrollment in a voluntary Family Protection Plan sponsored by bhe
SEC Recreation and Welfare Association. The program, providing
complete protection for spouse and children, was designed to supplement insurance coverage already available to Government employees.
This plan is offered as an employee service at no cost to the Commission since employees pay the total premium and deal &reedy with
the insurance company or its agent on a private transaction basis.
A8 part of its Thirteenth Annual Service and Merit Awards
Ceremony held in November 1967, the Commission gave '<Distinguished
Service Awards" to Messrs. Andrew Barr, Chief Accountant; Franklin E, Kennamer, Assistant General Counsel of the San Francisco
Regional Office; Irving M. Pollack, Director of the Division of
Trading and Markets; and Donald J. Stocking, Administrator of
the Denver Regional Office. Sixteen employees were given 30-year
pins for SEC service. Within-grade salary increases in recogqition
of high quality performance were granted to 82 employees. ~n'addition, cash awards totaling $11,705 were presented to 85 employees
for superior performance or special service.
The Commission this year approved the adoption of a Pablic Service
Award. This award is made to recognize those employees who make
a significant contribution toward improving the quality of communications or services to the public. The first recipient of this award
was the Public Reference Sedion of the Office of Records and Service.
