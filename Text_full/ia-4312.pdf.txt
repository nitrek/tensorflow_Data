The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against Hudson Capital

On December 22, 2015, an order of injunction was entered by default
against HCP, permanently enjoining it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act
of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1),
206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, in the civil action entitled

3.
The Commission’s complaint alleged that, from at least April 2007 through
May 2011, HCP, as the investment adviser of the RAHFCO Hedge Funds, engaged in a scheme to
defraud investors, the primary function of which was to convince investors to invest in fraudulent
pooled investments that purportedly traded in options and futures on the S&P 500 Index and in
equities, and then siphon off the invested funds for the defendants’ own purposes. In fact, HCP
did not follow the stated trading strategy, misrepresented the trading success, and misused
investor funds to make Ponzi payments to other investors.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act; and
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the Commission’s
Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
