ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On February 12, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings. A hearing is scheduled to commence on March 4, 2016.
On February 22, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a declaration of service
establishing that seven1 out of eight Respondents were served by February 20, 2016, in
accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). Because service was made by mail, the seven
Respondents’ answers are due by March 4, 2016. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160, .220(b).
For Respondent US WATS Inc., the declaration represents that the OIP was sent by priority mail
express to the address shown on its most recent EDGAR filing, a Form 10-K/A filed with the
Commission on April 4, 2000, at 2 Greenwood Square, 3331 Street Road, Bensalem, PA 19020.
On US WATS’s Form 10-K/A, the Bensalem address is listed as the company’s business
address, but a different address is listed as the company’s mailing address: 111 Presidential
Boulevard, Suite 114, Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004. While Rule 141(a)(2)(ii) does not expressly

The seven Respondents are Shearson Financial Network, Inc., Shelby Acquisition I, Inc. (n/k/a/
Phoenix Capital Source, Inc.), Shelby Acquisition II, Inc., Shelby Acquisition III, Inc., Shelby
Acquisition IV, Inc., Western Hemisphere Investments Corporation, and Whirlwind Marketing,
Inc.

contemplate the situation where the most recent EDGAR filing contains two different addresses,
out of an abundance of caution it would seem best to serve both addresses.
Accordingly, I ORDER the Division to serve the OIP and this order on US WATS at its
mailing address listed on its most recent EDGAR filing. The Division shall file an updated
declaration once service is made.
I further ORDER that the March 4, 2016, hearing is POSTPONED, and a telephonic
prehearing conference is scheduled for March 11, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. EST.
