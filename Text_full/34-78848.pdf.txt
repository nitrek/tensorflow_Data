ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16892

In the Matter of
JAMES T. BUDDEN AND
ALEXANDER W. BUDDEN,
Respondents.

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans (“Rules”), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, that
the Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has submitted to the Commission a proposed plan of
distribution (“Plan”) for the distribution of monies placed into Fair Funds in the above-captioned
matters.
As described more specifically in the Plan, the funds in the above-captioned proceedings, if
the Plan is approved by the Commission, will be transferred, pursuant to Rule 1102(a) of the Rules,
17 C.F.R. § 201.1102(a), to a court-appointed receiver (“Receiver”) in the related Commission
action, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Cowgill, No. 2:14-CV-396 (S.D. Ohio) (the
“District Court Action”), for distribution to injured investors in accordance with the court-approved

plan in the District Court Action (“Receiver’s Plan”).1 In accordance with Rule 1102(a), the District
Court Action is “based upon a complaint alleging violations arising from the same or substantially
similar facts as those alleged in the Commission’s order[s] instituting proceedings.” The Division
has concluded transferring the funds paid in the Commission’s two administrative proceedings and
distributing them through the District Court Action is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
A distribution through the District Court Action in accordance with the Receiver’s Plan will benefit
the same investors injured as a result of Douglas E. Cowgill’s (“Cowgill”) misconduct2 and be more
cost-effective and timely than if the Commission undertakes its own distribution of the funds.
On June 25, 2015, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Public Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 4C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Section 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), and Rule 102(e) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Ceaseand-Desist Order (“Accounting Firm Order”)3 against Michael S. Wilson, CPA (“Wilson”) and
Cotterman-Wilson CPAs, Inc., a Columbus, Ohio based accounting firm (“Cotterman-Wilson”)
(collectively, “Accounting Firm Respondents”).
The order involving the Accounting Firm Respondents found the Accounting Firm
Respondents’ failed to complete surprise examinations in 2009, 2010, and 2011 as required by
Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder. The Accounting Firm
Respondents consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to a finding that they caused
PIM’s violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder, and engaged
in improper professional conduct within the meaning of Section 4C(a)(2) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(1)(ii).
Wilson was ordered to pay a $50,000 civil money penalty and Cotterman-Wilson was
ordered to pay a $25,000 civil money penalty, $10,868 in disgorgement, and $1,029 in prejudgment
interest. The Accounting Firm Respondents paid the Commission, as ordered, on June 26, 2015.
Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, the Accounting Firm
Order created a Fair Fund for the disgorgement, interest, and penalties paid by the Accounting Firm
Respondents for the benefit of PIM’s clients who were harmed due to the misconduct of the
Accounting Firm Respondents.
On October 13, 2015, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“PIM Owner Order”) 4 against James T. Budden and Alexander W. Budden (collectively “PIM
Owner Respondents”).

Docket No. 58.
Cowgill, Professional Management Inc.’s (“PIM”) President and Chief Compliance Officer, violated several
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by misappropriating more than $840,000 in client assets within the
meaning of Section 203(e)(6) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), and, also caused PIM to
violate Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.

The PIM Owner Respondents consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to a
finding that they failed reasonably to supervise Cowgill within the meaning of Sections 203(e)(6)
of the Advisers Act with a view to preventing and detecting Cowgill’s violations of Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 203(a), 204(a), 206(1), 206(2),
206(4), and 207 of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-2, 206(4)-2, and 206(4)-7 thereunder; caused
PIM’s violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7; James T. Budden also
consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to a finding that he caused PIM to violate
Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder.
James T. Budden was ordered to pay a $125,000 civil money penalty and Alexander W.
Budden was ordered to pay a $75,000 civil money penalty. The PIM Owner Respondents paid the
Commission, as ordered, on October 14, 2015. Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as amended, the PIM Owner Order created a Fair Fund for the penalties paid by the
PIM Owner Respondents for the benefit of PIM’s clients that were harmed due to the misconduct
of the PIM Owner Respondents.
If the Commission approves the Plan, the Commission staff will take the necessary steps to
obtain a Commission order transferring the balance of the two Fair Funds, $286,897, to the District
Court Action. The Receiver has agreed to distribute the funds in accordance with the courtapproved Receiver’s Plan to investors who were harmed due to the misconduct found in the two
administrative proceedings.
