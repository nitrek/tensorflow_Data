In the Matter of
JOSEPH J. FOX

ORDER REQUESTING SUPPLEMENTAL
BRIEFING

On September 8, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted proceedings
against Respondent directing the determination of what, if any, non-financial remedial sanctions
under Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are in the public interest.
Briefing on the Division of Enforcement’s motion for summary disposition was completed
yesterday.
The Division’s motion and its reply brief appear to lack any discussion of Respondent’s
scienter, one of the factors I must consider when determining whether the sanctions sought by
the Division are in the public interest. See Gary M. Kornman, Exchange Act Release No. 59403,
2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *22 (Feb. 13, 2009) (citing Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th
Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981)). Respondent disputes that he acted with
scienter, and my evaluation of this factor would be aided by additional information.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Division may file a supplemental brief addressing the
limited issue of Respondent’s scienter by February 5, 2016, and Respondent may file a reply by
February 19, 2016.
SO ORDERED.
