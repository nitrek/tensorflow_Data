Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted against Silberstein Ungar PLLC (or “the firm”), Ronald N. Silberstein, CPA, Joel M.
Ungar, CPA, Seth A. Gorback, and David A. Kobylarek, CPA (collectively “Respondents”)
pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and
Rules 102(e)(1)(ii) and (iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these

proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents consent
to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to
Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 102(e) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Ceaseand-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds1 that
Summary
These proceedings arise out of deficient audits of financial statements of nine issuer clients
by the Respondents, who issued audit reports that failed to comply with Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) auditing standards.2 During the audits in question, each
of the Respondents repeatedly engaged in improper professional conduct pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 4C and Rule 102(e)(1) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice that resulted in violations of
applicable professional standards and demonstrated a lack of competence to practice before the
Commission. Specifically, the Respondents failed to comply with some or all of the following
requirements in PCAOB standards: (1) obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to provide a
reasonable basis for the audit opinion; (2) evaluate the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by management in the context of the financial statements taken as a whole and adequately
document the corresponding audit procedures performed; (3) properly document procedures
relating to the evaluation of the adequacy of disclosure in financial statements; (4) obtain
appropriate engagement quality reviews; (5) properly examine journal entries for evidence of
possible misstatement due to fraud and document the performance of journal entry testing; (6)
document how the firm overcame the presumption to send accounts receivable confirmations; (7)
perform analytical procedures related to revenue; (8) properly supervise the audit; and (9) exercise
due professional care and professional skepticism.
In addition, Silberstein Ungar violated, and Silberstein, Ungar, Gorback, and Kobylarek
willfully aided and abetted and caused the firm’s violations of, Exchange Act Rule 2-02(b)(1) of
Regulation S-X when Silberstein Ungar claimed in each of its audit reports that it complied with
PCAOB standards when it had not. Based upon Silberstein Ungar’s deficient audit reports being
included in issuers’ filings, the Respondents also willfully aided and abetted and caused issuers’
violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 15(d) and Rules 13a-1 and 15d-1 thereunder.

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers and are not binding on any other person or entity in
this or any other proceeding.

The relevant period involves audits conducted for the year ended August 31, 2012 through the year ended
February 28, 2013. References to PCOAB auditing standards refer to the standards in effect during the relevant
period.

1.
Silberstein Ungar PLLC. Silberstein Ungar is a Michigan limited liability
company and CPA firm located in Bingham Farms, Michigan. The firm previously represented
that its specialties included audits of issuers and those companies planning to go public at a later
date. During the relevant period, the firm was registered with the PCAOB, the Canadian Public
Accountability Board, and the International Franchise Association.3 In July 2014, Silberstein
Ungar’s client base was purchased by another CPA firm. Silberstein Ungar still exists but does not
currently conduct work auditing public companies.
2.
Ronald N. Silberstein. Age 59. Silberstein holds an active CPA license in
Michigan and joined the firm now known as Silberstein Ungar in July 2007. Silberstein served as
the engagement partner for all but one of the audits under review. Silberstein served as a nonequity partner at another CPA firm until August 2015.
3.
Joel M. Ungar. Age 54. Ungar holds an active CPA license in Michigan and cofounded Ungar & Associates in 2003 (later known as Silberstein Ungar). He served as the

4.
Seth A. Gorback. Age 37. Gorback began working at Silberstein Ungar in
January 2008 as a staff auditor before becoming a manager in March 2010, a non-equity partner in
August 2011, and an equity partner in or around August 2012. Although Gorback was a partner in
the firm at the time of the audits, he did not serve as the engagement partner in any of the relevant
audits and functioned in a role more analogous to that of engagement manager on four of the audits
under review. Gorback is currently self-employed.
5.
David A. Kobylarek. Age 65. Holds an active CPA license in Michigan.
Kobylarek began working at Silberstein Ungar in December 2007 as a senior accountant before
becoming a manager in March 2010, a non-equity partner in August 2011, and an equity partner in
or around August 2012. Although Kobylarek was a partner in the firm at the time of the audits, he
did not serve as the engagement partner in any of the relevant audits, functioned in a role more
analogous to that of engagement manager on six of the audits under review and prepared and
reviewed certain audit work papers for one additional audit under review. Kobylarek is currently
retired.

The Conduct at Issue
A. Failure to Obtain Sufficient Evidence to Support the Audit Opinion, the
Accounting Estimates Made by Management and Adequately Document the Audit
Procedures Performed (AS No. 15, AU § 342, and AS No. 3)
15.
PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 15 Audit Evidence requires that the auditor plan
and perform audit procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a
reasonable basis for his or her opinion. As the assessed risk increases, the evidence that the auditor
should obtain also increases. For example, ordinarily more evidence is needed to respond to
“significant risks.”4 When using the information produced by the Company as audit evidence, the
auditor should evaluate the evidence by testing its accuracy and completeness and evaluating
whether it is sufficiently precise and detailed for the purposes of the audit.5 Additionally, under
PCAOB Auditing Standard AU § 342 Auditing Accounting Estimates, the auditor's objective when
evaluating accounting estimates is to obtain sufficient appropriate evidential matter to provide
reasonable assurance that all accounting estimates that could be material to the financial statements
have been developed; those accounting estimates are reasonable in the circumstances; and the
accounting estimates are presented in conformity with applicable accounting principles and are
properly disclosed.6
16.
PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3 Audit Documentation requires an auditor to
prepare and retain documentation that provides a written record of the basis for its conclusions.
Audit documentation must clearly demonstrate that the work was in fact performed. Among other
items, the audit documentation must contain sufficient information to enable an experienced
4

PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 12 Identifying and Assessing Risks of Material Misstatement requires the auditor
to determine whether any of the assessed risks of material misstatement are significant risks and provides factors
that should be evaluated when determining whether a risk of material misstatement is a significant risk.

auditor, having no previous connection with the engagement to understand the nature, timing,
extent, and results of the procedures performed, evidence obtained, and conclusions reached.
Audit documentation must also contain sufficient information to enable an experienced auditor,
having no previous connection with the engagement, to determine, among other things, the person
who reviewed the work and the date of such review. 7 The following examples demonstrate some
of the violations of these auditing standards.
1. Issuer A Audit for the Year Ended February 28, 2013
17.
Receivables and property and equipment comprised a total of approximately 87%
of Issuer A’s total assets at 2/28/13 and both audit areas were classified as “significant or fraud
risks” by Silberstein Ungar. Gorback and Silberstein initialed the work papers as the respective
preparer and reviewer of the documents supporting these audit areas. These work papers were
predominantly comprised of testing prepared and performed by a different accounting firm for a
different Issuer A audit. This other audit was separate and apart from Silberstein Ungar’s audit of
Issuer A. The other accounting firm did not assist Silberstein Ungar in performing its Issuer A
audit. Gorback and Silberstein considered the other accounting firm’s work papers as if they were
prepared by Issuer A’s internal accountants and placed no reliance on the testing performed by the
other accounting firm. Nevertheless, Silberstein Ungar’s work papers did not contain sufficient
documentation of additional audit testing performed by Silberstein Ungar.
18.
The audit work papers meant to document the audit procedures for related party
8
transactions, subsequent events,9 and inquiries of Issuer A’s management concerning the risk of
fraud and material misstatement,10 were either duplicates or near duplicates of work papers from
different Silberstein Ungar audits and included the documentation of procedures performed for the
other audits, not Issuer A’s audit. In addition, the audit program meant to document the
subsequent event procedures, which are procedures that are designed to test for events that occur
after the balance sheet date, contains dating that reflects that Gorback performed the procedures
prior to Issuer A’s balance sheet date. Gorback also failed to send Issuer A the inquiries of
management concerning the risk of fraud and material misstatement until the Form 10-K filing
date, and did not receive them back until after the Form 10-K was filed.
2. Issuer B Audit for the Year Ended September 30, 2012 and Issuer C Audit
for the Year Ended December 31, 2012

7

AS No. 3 at .1, .5, and .6.

8

AU § 334 Related Parties contained the auditors’ requirements at the time of this audit for identifying related
party relationships and testing related party transactions.
9

AU § 560 Subsequent Events contains the auditors’ requirements for performing procedures to ascertain whether
transactions or events occurring in the “subsequent period” between the balance sheet date and the date of the
auditor’s report require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements or notes to the financial statements.
10

AS No. 12 requires the auditor to perform procedures for assessing the risk of material misstatement of the
financial statements, including misstatements due to fraud. One of the required risk assessment procedures is for the
auditor to make inquiries of “the audit committee, management, and others within the company about the risks of
material misstatement.”

6

19.
Issuer B and Issuer C are both mining companies whose largest assets, mining
claims and mineral rights, represent almost 80% and 45% of their total assets, respectively. For
Issuer B, Silberstein Ungar also identified the significant risk relating to these mining assets.
However, the audit work papers meant to support the respective audit procedures and conclusion
(that no impairment was necessary) mainly consisted of memos based on generally accepted
accounting principles applicable to companies in the oil and gas industry, which were not
applicable to Issuer B or Issuer C, since they are mining companies. Issuer B’s own treasurer
raised this concern in an email to Silberstein and others, stating that the accounting principles that
were included in the impairment memo pertained to oil and gas wells.11 Despite this red flag,
Silberstein agreed to the use of these accounting principles by the company. These work papers
did not contain sufficient documentation of the procedures performed to test the accuracy and
completeness of the information in the memos, an evaluation of whether the information was
sufficiently precise, or sufficient evidence supporting the company’s use of the oil and gas
accounting principles or the conclusion that no impairment of these assets was necessary. For
example, the audit work papers do not contain evidence Silberstein Ungar reviewed, evaluated, or
tested the process used by management to conclude that no impairment was necessary, or
developed their own independent expectation to corroborate the results of Issuer B and Issuer C’s
impairment tests.12
20.
Issuer B’s audit work papers and notes to the financial statements also reflect the
existence of a derivative valued at approximately 50% of Issuer B’s liabilities at September 30,
2012. The work papers did not reflect the work performed to assess whether the classification as a
derivative was correct. Nor did the Issuer B work papers contain documentation of procedures
performed and sufficient evidence supporting whether the information was sufficiently precise in
order to determine whether the accounting treatment and disclosures related to the derivative were
appropriate. For example, the work papers did not include documentation and sufficient evidence
supporting whether Kobylarek and Silberstein: (1) performed auditing procedures to understand
the application of generally accepted accounting principles for assertions made by Issuer B about
its derivative; (2) determined whether generally accepted accounting principles specified the
method to be used to determine the fair value of Issuer B’s derivative; (3) evaluated if Issuer B’s
fair value of the derivative was consistent with the specified valuation method; or (4) evaluated if
the presentation and disclosure of derivative was in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles .13
11

The memos were prepared by the company or by an accountant engaged to assist in the preparation of the
company’s accounting records.
12

AU § 342 Auditing Accounting Estimates states that the auditor should obtain an understanding of how
management developed the estimate by either reviewing and testing the process used by management to develop the
estimate or developing an independent expectation of the estimate to corroborate the reasonableness of
management's estimate. AU § 342 .10.
13

AU § 332 Auditing Derivative Instruments, Hedging Activities and Investments in Securities provides guidance
for auditors in planning and performing auditing procedures for assertions about derivative instruments, hedging
activities, and investments in securities that are made in an entity’s financial statements. The auditing procedures
required by AU § 332 include obtaining an understanding the application of generally accepted accounting
principles for assertions about derivatives, which might require that the auditor have special knowledge because of

7

21.
Finally, Issuer B’s audit file generally does not contain evidence of the date the
audit work was completed or the dates Kobylarek and Silberstein performed their review of the
work papers. Instead, the audit work papers generally contain the initials of the individual who
prepared or reviewed the respective audit work along with the date the audit work was placed into
the electronic audit file, rather than the date the audit work was completed or reviewed. For
example, the audit work papers reflecting audit testing for the company’s cash, mining claims, gold
bullion loan, financing fees, related party transactions, testing of journal entries, subsequent events,
and inquiries of management concerning the risk of fraud and material misstatement do not contain
evidence of the date the audit work was completed or reviewed.
3. Issuer G Restatement Audit for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 and
Issuer H Restatement Audit for the Year Ended August 31, 2012
22.
Issuer G filed a Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2012 on August 21,
2013 and restated the respective financial statements and notes to the financial statements to
correct its accounting for certain stock warrants. Issuer H filed a Form 10-K/A the year ended
August 31, 2012 on June 4, 2013 and restated the respective financial statements and notes to the
financial statements to report a contingent royalty liability associated with the purchase of certain
assets and liabilities. Silberstein Ungar’s audit documentation for Issuer G’s restated stock
warrants balances and for Issuer H’s restated contingent liability mainly consisted of spreadsheets,
memos, and/or calculations that were prepared by Issuer G or Issuer H or their representatives.
Kobylarek generally initialed these documents as the “preparer.” However, there is no evidence in
the audit documentation that Silberstein reviewed the Issuer G work papers. These work papers do
not contain sufficient evidence or documentation of procedures performed by Silberstein Ungar on
the main financial model inputs and other values underlying the restated amounts in the financial
statements, such as the “risk free rate,” “expected life in years,” and “volatility” inputs in the model
chosen to calculate the restated warrant values (for Issuer G) or the discount rate used to calculate
the contingent liability (for Issuer H). For example, the auditors did not document whether auditing
procedures were performed to test the “volatility” value used to calculate Issuer G’s restated
warrant values or the discount rate used to calculate Issuer H’s contingent liability.14 Additionally,

the complexity of those principles. Additionally, the auditor should determine whether generally accepted
accounting principles specify the method to be used to determine the fair value of the entity’s derivatives and
securities and evaluate whether the determination of fair value is consistent with the specified valuation
method. The auditor should also evaluate whether the presentation and disclosure of derivatives and securities in the
entity’s financial statements are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. AU § 332 at .01, 05,
.35, and .49.
14

AU § 328 Auditing Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes standards and provide guidance on
auditing fair value measurements and disclosures contained in financial statements. The auditor should obtain
sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide reasonable assurance that fair value measurements and disclosures
are in conformity with GAAP. The auditor should test the data used to develop the fair value measurements and
disclosures and evaluate whether the fair value measurements have been properly determined from such data and
management’s assumptions. Specifically, the auditor evaluates whether the data on which the fair value
measurements are based, including the data used in the work of a specialist, is accurate, complete, and relevant; and
whether fair value measurements have been properly determined using such data and management’s assumptions.
The auditor’s tests also may include, for example, procedures such as verifying the source of the data, mathematical
recomputation of inputs, and reviewing of information for internal consistency, including whether such information

8

besides recalculating the company’s own computations, the audit team did not perform procedures
to test the process used by management to develop the “risk free rate,” “expected life in years,” and
“volatility” inputs in the model chosen to calculate the restated warrant values (for Issuer G) or the
discount rate used to calculate the contingent liability (for Issuer H) and did not develop an
independent expectation of these estimates to corroborate the reasonableness of management’s
estimates.
23.
Kobylarek and Silberstein also failed to gather sufficient evidence and
documentation supporting the performance of subsequent event testing. For example, the audit
documentation supporting Kobylarek’s and Silberstein’s subsequent events testing for these
restatement audits was limited to a management representation letter signed by Issuer G and Issuer
H management.15
4. Other Issuer Audits
24.
Failures to comply with the above PCAOB auditing standards regarding sufficient
evidence and documentation for the other issuers mainly relate to the impairment testing associated
with the issuer’s significant assets. Silberstein, Gorback, and Kobylarek failed to: (1) obtain
sufficient appropriate audit evidence supporting the impairment testing performed; (2) evaluate the
company-prepared impairment analyses by testing the accuracy and completeness of the
underlying information; (3) evaluate whether those analyses were sufficiently precise; and (4)
properly document the nature, timing, and extent of the procedures performed.
25.
Issuer D’s audit work papers, initialed as prepared by Gorback and reviewed by
Silberstein, contained company-prepared financial and cash flows forecasts to support the
impairment testing of almost 44% of the company’s assets. The financial forecasts estimated
revenues of $21 – $137 million and income of $4 – $77 million from 2013 – 2015. However, for
2012, Issuer D had no revenues and a $5.1 million loss, and the notes to the financial statements
audited by Silberstein Ungar disclose, “company expects to continue to incur substantial losses
over the next several years during its development phase ….” The work papers did not contain
sufficient evidence to support testing the forecast or the conclusions reached from the forecast,
despite the fact the notes to the financial statements contained information about the company’s
future prospects that conflicted with the forecast. 16 The section of the audit documentation
is consistent with management’s intent and ability to carry out specific courses of action. AU § 328 at .01, .03, and
.39.
15

AU § 560 ¶ 12, states the auditor should also generally perform procedures such as making certain inquiries of
officers and other executives having responsibility for financial and accounting matters, read the latest available
interim financial statements, read the available minutes of meetings of stockholders, directors, and appropriate
committees; as to meetings for which minutes are not available, inquire about matters dealt with at such meetings
and inquire of client's legal counsel concerning litigation, claims, and assessments as part of ascertaining the
occurrence of subsequent events that may require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.
16

“If audit evidence obtained from one source is inconsistent with that obtained from another, or if the auditor has
doubts about the reliability of information to be used as audit evidence, the auditor should perform the audit
procedures necessary to resolve the matter and should determine the effect, if any, on other aspects of the audit.”
AS No. 15 at .29.

9

pertaining to inquiries of Issuer D’s management concerning the risk of fraud and material
misstatement contained inquiries made of a CEO from a different Silberstein Ungar audit client, as
opposed to inquiries made of Issuer D’s CEO. This audit documentation was reviewed by
Silberstein and Gorback. In addition, inquiries concerning the risk of fraud and material
misstatement were sent by Gorback to the Issuer D CFO after the Form 10-K was filed, and were
received back from the CFO even later.
26.
For the Issuer F audit, Gorback and Silberstein used an audit program as
documentation for the impairment testing for 36% of the company’s assets, which were also
identified by the audit team as a significant risk. The audit program mainly contained initials and
dates or “N/A” next to audit steps without further documentation of the procedures performed.17
The audit work papers do not contain evidence Silberstein Ungar reviewed, evaluated, or tested the
process used by management to test for impairment, or developed their own independent
expectation to corroborate the results of Issuer F’s impairment test.
27.
The Issuer I and Issuer E impairment documentation, for assets that comprised
approximately 50% and 87% of the company’s assets, respectively, mainly consisted of statements
from management and/or company-prepared memos without further documentation of procedures
performed to evaluate whether the information was sufficiently precise and accurate. The audit
planning documentation also stated concerning Issuer E that, “there is minimal internal control,
and the opportunity for management override exists, so risk of misstatement will be at a high level.
We should be aware of the possibility of the overstatement of assets ….” Notwithstanding this red
flag, and the fact that significant risks were identified by Silberstein Ungar for these assets,
Silberstein, Gorback (for Issuer E), and Kobylarek (for Issuer I) did not obtain sufficient audit
evidence to respond to these risks. Additionally, the audit work papers did not contain evidence
Silberstein Ungar reviewed, evaluated, or tested the process used by management to test for
impairment, or developed their own independent expectation to corroborate the results of Issuer I
and Issuer E’s impairment test.
B. Failure to Properly Document Procedures Relating to the Evaluation of the
Adequacy of Disclosure in Financial Statements (AS No. 3)
28.
In all of the audits at issue Silberstein, Ungar, Gorback, and Kobylarek failed to
include documentation that clearly demonstrated they reconciled underlying accounting records to
the issuers’ financial statements and/or notes to the financial statements.18 The audit work papers
17

Audit programs may provide evidence of audit planning as well as limited evidence of the execution of audit
procedures. The PCAOB in developing AS No. 3 specifically considered and rejected the idea that use of an audit
program eliminated the need for proper documentation in the work papers. AS No. 3 at A12.
18

“Audit documentation must clearly demonstrate that the work was in fact performed.” AS No. 3 at .6. The auditor's
substantive procedures must include reconciling the financial statements with the underlying accounting records. AS
No. 13 The Auditor’s Response to the Risks of Material Misstatement at .41. The auditor is required to evaluate
whether the financial statements, “contain the information essential for a fair presentation of the financial statements
in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework. Evaluation of the information disclosed in the
financial statements includes consideration of the form, arrangement, and content of the financial statements
(including the accompanying notes), encompassing matters such as the terminology used, the amount of detail
given, the classification of items in the statements, and the bases of amounts set forth.” PCAOB Auditing Standard
No.14 Evaluating Audit Results at .31.

10

contain lists of audit procedures within audit programs and checklists that include a general
procedure for agreeing the financial statements and notes to the financial statements to the
accounting records. The respective procedure includes initials and a date or a “yes” indicating the
respective procedure was performed. However, there is generally no additional documentation
evidencing that the work was actually completed. For example, Issuer A’s audit work papers are
generally in a foreign currency and the financial statements and notes to the financial statements
are presented in U.S. dollars. The audit work papers did not include evidence that Gorback or
Silberstein performed any procedures on the conversion of the foreign currency amounts in the
work papers into the U.S. dollar amounts in the financial statements and notes to the financial
statements. In addition, the Issuer A, Issuer D, and Issuer E work papers did not contain a copy of
the respective Form 10-K or the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included
in the Form 10-K.
C. Failure to Comply with the Requirements for Engagement Quality Reviews (AS
No. 7)
29.
PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 7 Engagement Quality Review requires an
engagement quality review and concurring approval of issuance for each audit engagement. The
objective of the engagement quality reviewer is to perform an evaluation of the significant
judgments made by the engagement team and the related conclusions reached in forming the
overall conclusion on the engagement and in preparing the engagement report in order to
determine whether to provide concurring approval of issuance. The engagement quality reviewer
should review documentation, to the extent necessary, evaluate the significant judgments that relate
to engagement planning, and evaluate the engagement team’s assessment and response to
significant risks. The engagement quality reviewer should also evaluate whether the engagement
documentation that he or she reviewed when performing the procedures indicates that the
engagement team responded appropriately to significant risks, and supports the conclusions
reached by the engagement team with respect to the matters reviewed.19
30.
The engagement quality review documentation should contain sufficient
information to enable an experienced auditor, having no previous connection with the engagement,
to understand the procedures performed by the engagement quality reviewer and include
information that identifies: (1) the engagement quality reviewer; (2) the documents reviewed by
the engagement quality reviewer; and (3) the date the engagement quality reviewer provided
concurring approval of issuance.20 In addition, PCAOB standards provide that the firm may grant
permission to the client to use the engagement report in an audit only after the engagement quality
reviewer has performed the review required and provides concurring approval of issuance.21

1. Issuer G and Issuer H
31.
Silberstein and his firm failed to comply with the engagement quality review
requirements in connection with the Issuer H audit for the year ended August 31, 2012, and the
restatement audits of Issuer H for the year ended August 31, 2012 and Issuer G for the year ended
December 31, 2012. In each of these cases, the firm issued audit reports for these audit
engagements without obtaining an engagement quality review and concurring approval of
issuance. Silberstein was the engagement partner for all three audit engagements.
2. Issuer B
32.
For the year ended September 30, 2012, Silberstein and the firm failed to obtain an
engagement quality review before issuing its audit report and granting Issuer B permission to use
that report. The audit report was dated January 15, 2013 and Issuer B filed its Form 10-K, for the
year ended September 30, 2012, on January 16, 2013. Ungar did not complete the engagement
quality review until after the filing date.
3. Ungar’s Performance of Engagement Quality Reviews
33.
Ungar served as the engagement quality review partner on the Issuer A, Issuer B,
Issuer D, Issuer E, Issuer F and Issuer I audits. The engagement quality review checklist,
completed by Ungar and included in the respective audit work papers, purportedly reflects that he
performed an objective review of audit documentation relevant to significant accounting, auditing
and reporting judgments made by the engagement team and the conclusions reached. It also
purportedly indicates that he reviewed and evaluated the engagement team’s assessment and
response to significant risks, and he acknowledged in the work papers that the engagement work
papers that he reviewed supported the conclusions reached by the engagement team with respect to
the matters reviewed. As noted above, the audit work papers for these audits did not include
sufficient appropriate evidence supporting the procedures performed and conclusions reached by
the audit team and documentation of the procedures performed for significant financial statement
balances and/or areas identified by the engagement team as a significant risk. Additionally, the
audit documentation does not indicate the inquiries Ungar made of the engagement team, the
procedures performed, documents reviewed, or whether discussions were held with the
engagement team to evaluate the significant judgments related to engagement planning and the
engagement team’s assessment and audit responses to significant risks. The audit documentation
also does not indicate all the documents reviewed by Ungar as part of the engagement quality
review.
34.
AS No. 7 provides that the engagement quality reviewer may provide concurring
approval of issuance only if, after performing the engagement quality review with due professional
care, he or she is not aware of a significant engagement deficiency.22 Due professional care entails
possessing the degree of skill commonly possessed by other auditors and exercising it with
reasonable care and diligence.23 However, the audit areas discussed above, including audit areas
22

AS No. 7 at .12.

23

AU §230 Due Professional Care in the Performance of Work at .03-.05.

12

identified as significant risks, did not contain sufficient evidence and documentation, and the
respective audit files do not reflect that Ungar performed his engagement quality reviews with due
professional care.
D. Failure to Properly Examine Journal Entries for Evidence of Possible
Misstatement Due to Fraud and Document the Performance of Journal Entry
Testing (AU § 316 and AS No. 3)
35.
Material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud often involve
manipulation of the financial reporting process through recording journal entries.24 Accordingly,
the auditor should “design procedures to test the appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the
general ledger and other adjustments … made in the preparation of the financial statements.”25 For
purposes of identifying and selecting specific entries and other adjustments for testing, and
determining the appropriate method of examining the underlying support for the items selected, the
auditor should consider factors such as the auditor’s assessment of fraud risk, the effectiveness of
controls over journal entries, the nature and complexity of the accounts and whether journal entries
were processed outside the normal course of business.26
36.
“Because fraudulent journal entries often are made at the end of a reporting period,
the auditor’s testing ordinarily should focus on the journal entries and other adjustments made at
that time. However, because material misstatements in financial statements due to fraud can occur
throughout the period and may involve extensive efforts to conceal how it is accomplished, the
auditor should consider whether there also is a need to test journal entries throughout the period
under audit.”27
37.
The Issuer A, Issuer D, Issuer E, Issuer F, and Issuer H audits did not include
properly designed procedures to test the appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the general
ledger, and Silberstein, Gorback (for Issuer A, Issuer D, Issuer E, and Issuer F,) and Kobylarek (for
Issuer H) did not properly design or perform the testing. Silberstein Ungar’s “standard” journal
entry testing procedures were significantly different than what was actually performed during the
audits and did not comply with PCAOB auditing standards. The following are examples of the
deficiencies uncovered during the investigation.
1. Issuer A
38.
The audit work papers did not include evidence that journal entry testing was
performed by Silberstein Ungar personnel, except for initials or “yes” responses in audit programs
or checklists signed off by Gorback and Silberstein.

AU § 316 at .61.

27

AU § 316.62.

13

2. Issuer E
39.
The journal entry testing performed by Gorback and reviewed by Silberstein was
based on a company-prepared report containing one line of Issuer E’s journal entries and not the
complete journal entries. Gorback and Silberstein did not perform any testing to ensure the report
contained all of Issuer E’s journal entries or document the journal entries that were selected for
testing or the methodology used for selecting journal entries for testing. Although certain journal
entries were selected in connection with testing Issuer E’s account balances, such as testing of
revenues and expenses, there is no evidence that Gorback or Silberstein considered factors from
AU § 316 when testing the journal entries, such as their assessment of fraud risk, the effectiveness
of controls over journal entries, the nature and complexity of the accounts, and whether journal
entries were processed outside the normal course of business.
3. Issuer H
40.
The audit work papers reflect three journal entries were selected when Kobylarek
performed testing of Issuer H’s account balances and transactions. Kobylarek’s initials are
reflected in an audit program next to journal entry testing procedures and Silberstein reviewed
these audit programs. However, there is no evidence these journal entries were selected or tested
in accordance with AU § 316 or that Kobylarek and Silberstein tested these journal entries in
response to considering the assessment of Issuer H’s fraud risk, the effectiveness of Issuer H’s
controls over journal entries, the nature and complexity of the accounts, or whether the journal
entries were processed outside the normal course of business. Additionally, Kobylarek obtained
the general ledger but did not make a selection of journal entries from the general ledger in
connection with fraud testing. Nor did he obtain a listing of Issuer H journal entries. There was no
specific documentation of the following journal entry testing work steps that Kobylarek initialed as
having performed: (1) the results of the journal entry testing; (2) how he determined the journal
entry population was complete; (3) who performed and reviewed the work; (4) the journal entries
selected for testing; (5) the procedures performed; or (6) the conclusions reached.
E. Failure to Document How Silberstein Ungar Overcame the Presumption to Send
Accounts Receivable Confirmations for the Issuer A Audit (AU § 330)
41.
AU Section 330 The Confirmation Process provides guidance concerning the audit
confirmation process. Confirmation of accounts receivable is a generally accepted auditing
procedure. AU § 330 states, “it is generally presumed that evidence obtained from third parties
will provide the auditor with higher-quality audit evidence than is typically available from within
the entity. Thus, there is a presumption that the auditor will request the confirmation of accounts
receivable during an audit” unless certain circumstances arise. AU § 330 reflects that an auditor
who has not requested confirmations in the examination of accounts receivable should document
how he or she overcame the presumption that confirmations should be obtained.28 Receivables
were classified as a significant risk by Silberstein Ungar and the audit work papers reflected
Silberstein Ungar planned to confirm accounts receivable. Additionally, receivables comprised a
28

AU § 330 at .01, .34, and .35.

14

total of approximately 7% of Earn-A-Car’s total assets as of February 28, 2013. Silberstein Ungar
did not request accounts receivable confirmations during the Issuer A audit and the work papers
did not contain documentation concerning why accounts receivable confirmations procedures were
not performed by Silberstein Ungar. The work papers contain an “audit documentation checklist”
designed to “help the auditor assess the completeness of [its] documentation.” Gorback initialed
this document as preparer and Silberstein initialed as the reviewer. The document contains an
“N/A” next to the question prompting Gorback to document how he overcame the presumption to
confirm accounts receivable.
F. Failure to Perform Analytical Procedures Related to Revenue (AS No. 14)
42.
As part of the overall review, the auditor should perform analytical procedures,
including “analytical procedures relating to revenue through the end of the reporting period.”29 No
analytical procedures were performed for the Issuer A, Issuer D, Issuer E, Issuer F, Issuer G, Issuer
H, or Issuer I audits. For example, the Issuer H audit work papers include an “Audit Program for
Fraud and Illegal Acts” prepared by Kobylarek and reviewed by Silberstein that reflects these
revenue analytical procedures were not applicable, and no analytical procedures were performed
for the Issuer H audit. For the Issuer E audit, Gorback marked these procedures, “N/A” in the
“Overall Audit Program,” which was also reviewed by Silberstein.
G. Failure to Properly Supervise the Audit (AS No. 10)
43.
PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 10 Supervision of the Audit Engagement states that
the “engagement partner is responsible for the engagement and its performance. Accordingly, the
engagement partner is responsible for proper supervision of the work of engagement team
members and for compliance with PCAOB standards ….”30 The engagement partner should
review the work of engagement team members and evaluate whether the work was properly
performed and documented, the objectives of the procedures were achieved, and the results of the
audit work support the conclusions reached.31
1. Silberstein
44.
Silberstein was the engagement partner on the Issuer A, Issuer B, Issuer D, Issuer
E, Issuer F, Issuer G restatement, Issuer H, Issuer H restatement, and Issuer I audits and failed to
properly supervise those audits. This failure is illustrated by Silberstein failing to detect the
numerous errors noted above after reviewing work papers and authorizing the release of the
29

AS No. 14 at .5 and .7. AS No. 14 states that analytical procedures performed during the overall review may be
similar to the analytical procedures performed as risk assessment procedures. Analytical procedures performed as
part of the risk assessment procedures should be designed to:
a.

Enhance the auditor's understanding of the client's business and the significant transactions and events that
have occurred since the prior year end; and

b.

Identify areas that might represent specific risks relevant to the audit, including the existence of unusual
transactions and events, and amounts, ratios, and trends that warrant investigation. AS No. 12 at .46.

15

respective audit reports. This was done even though audit evidence and documentation did not
comply with PCAOB auditing standards, and procedures required by PCAOB auditing standards
were not performed. For example, and as noted previously, the Issuer A audit testing was
predominantly comprised of documentation prepared and testing performed by a different
accounting firm for a separate Issuer A audit, even though Silberstein considered those work
papers and testing as documentation prepared by Issuer A’s internal accountants. Also, the Issuer
A and Issuer D audit files contained duplicative or nearly duplicative work papers documenting
procedures and testing from different audits. For the Issuer B audit, Silberstein did not identify, or
consider the impact of, the application of the wrong accounting principles for the impairment
testing of Issuer B’s largest asset, comprising 80% of Issuer B’s total assets. Those work papers,
which Silberstein signed off as reviewing, did not contain documentation of the procedures
performed or contain sufficient evidence supporting the conclusion that no impairment of those
assets was necessary. He was also responsible for the failure of the audit file to properly reflect the
dates on which the Issuer B audit work papers were completed and reviewed. Despite the
completion and review dates reflected in the audit file, Silberstein confirmed that the audit
documentation had been prepared in accordance with applicable auditing standards.
45.
Silberstein also failed to properly supervise the audits and review the work papers.
Those failures related to: (1) the status of engagement quality reviews performed for the Issuer G
restatement, Issuer H, and Issuer H restatement audits; (2) journal entry testing performed on the
Issuer A, Issuer D, Issuer E, Issuer F, and Issuer H audits; (3) the sufficiency of the audit files for
Issuer A, Issuer B, Issuer C, Issuer D, Issuer E, Issuer F, Issuer G, Issuer H, and Issuer I to include
documentation that clearly demonstrated the underlying accounting records reconciled to the
respective issuers’ financial statements and/or notes to the financial statements; (4) the inclusion of
an engagement completion document for the Issuer G restatement and Issuer H restatement in the
audit files; (5) maintaining a complete and final set of audit documentation for the Issuer G
restatement audit; and (6) documentation explaining how Silberstein Ungar overcame the
presumption to send accounts receivable confirmations for the Issuer A audit.
2. Ungar
46.
Ungar was the engagement partner on the Issuer C audit and he failed to properly
supervise the audit. As noted above, Ungar failed to detect that Issuer C used the wrong
accounting guidance when analyzing its largest assets for impairment, even though he reviewed the
impairment analysis. He also failed to properly supervise the audit relating to whether the work
performed for the impairment testing contained documentation of the procedures performed and
sufficient evidence supporting the company’s conclusion that no impairment of these assets was
necessary. Additionally, Ungar was responsible for the failures of the audit documentation to
clearly demonstrate the underlying accounting records reconciled to the financial statements and
notes to the financial statements.

16

H. Failure to Exercise Due Professional Care and Professional Skepticism (AU § 230
and AS No. 13)
47.
PCAOB auditing standards require auditors to exercise due professional care in the
planning and performance of the audit.32 Due professional care requires the auditor to exercise
professional skepticism: an attitude that includes a questioning mind and a critical assessment of
audit evidence.33 Additionally, the auditor's responses to the assessed risks of material
misstatement, particularly fraud risks, should involve the application of professional skepticism in
gathering and evaluating audit evidence. Examples of the application of professional skepticism in
response to the assessed fraud risks are “obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to corroborate
management’s explanations or representations concerning important matters, such as through thirdparty confirmation, use of a specialist engaged or employed by the auditor, or examination of
documentation from independent sources.”34 Respondents failed to exercise professional
skepticism and perform a critical assessment of the audit evidence as evidenced by the repeated
deficiencies noted above.
1. Silberstein
48.
For example, Silberstein authorized the issuance of audit reports even though the
Issuer A audit testing was predominantly comprised of documentation prepared and testing
performed by a different accounting firm for a separate Issuer A audit. Silberstein also reviewed
Issuer A and Issuer D audit documentation that was duplicative or a near duplicate of audit testing
from audits of other Silberstein Ungar clients, and he reviewed Issuer B audit documentation that
was dated as completed and/or reviewed after the date the Issuer B 10-K was filed. The lack of
engagement quality reviews performed for the Issuer G restatement, Issuer H, and the Issuer H
restatement audits also illustrate Silberstein’s lack of due professional care.
2. Ungar
49.
Ungar failed to exercise due professional care and professional skepticism since he
authorized the issuance of audit reports even though the audit documentation for the impairment
analysis of Issuer C’s largest asset was based on the wrong accounting guidance. The audit file
also did not contain documentation of agreeing the underlying accounting records to the financial
statements and notes to the financial statements. Ungar also failed to exercise due professional
care and professional skepticism when acting as an engagement quality reviewer, as noted above.
3. Gorback
50.
Gorback prepared and reviewed audit documentation that contained a significant
lack of audit documentation and sufficient audit evidence. For example, Gorback initialed as
preparer of the Issuer A audit documentation discussed above, which did not include sufficient
appropriate audit evidence and documentation of the procedures he performed. Gorback included
32

33

AU § 230.07.

34

AS No. 13 at .7.

17

audit documentation in the Issuer A and Issuer D audit files that were duplicates or near duplicates
of documents from other audit files for different audit clients, without updating the documents to
reflect whether those respective audit procedures were performed for the Issuer A or Issuer D
audits. Gorback also acknowledged in a “Review and Approval” checklist in the Issuer A and
Issuer D audit files that the audit documentation was complete and clearly demonstrated the work
performed and that they had properly indexed, cross referenced, signed, and dated audit
documentation even though the Issuer A and Issuer D audit documentation contained the
deficiencies noted above. Gorback also failed to include sufficient appropriate audit evidence and
documentation of the procedures performed for the Issuer E and Issuer F audits, including evidence
and documentation relating to the testing of assets that comprised approximately 87% and 36% of
those respective entity’s total assets, and which also contained significant risks identified by the
audit team.
4. Kobylarek
51.
Kobylarek prepared and reviewed audit documentation that contained a
significant lack of audit documentation and sufficient audit evidence. As noted above, the audit
documentation for the Issuer H and Issuer G restatement audits mainly consisted of
documentation prepared by or on behalf of Issuer H or Issuer G, without sufficient appropriate
audit evidence supporting the audit testing and documentation of the audit procedures performed.
Kobylarek also acknowledged in the “Review and Approval” checklist in the Issuer B audit file
that the audit documentation was complete and clearly demonstrated the work performed and
that they had properly indexed, cross referenced, signed, and dated audit documentation even
though the Issuer B impairment testing did not contain sufficient appropriate evidence and
documentation of the procedures performed. The audit file also reflects that Kobylarek reviewed
most of the audit documentation after the Issuer B 10-K was filed.
Violations
52.
As a result of the conduct described above, the Commission finds that Silberstein
Ungar, Silberstein, Ungar, Gorback, and Kobylarek engaged in improper professional conduct
pursuant to Section 4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s
Rules of Practice, which includes negligent conduct in the form of:
(1) A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of
applicable professional standards in circumstances in which an accountant, a registered
public accounting firm, or associated person knows, or should know, that heightened
scrutiny is warranted.
(2) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of
applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence to practice before
the Commission.
53.
As a result of the conduct described above, Silberstein Ungar willfully violated
Exchange Act Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X, which requires that an auditor’s report state

18

whether the audit was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including
the standards of the PCAOB plus any applicable rules of the Commission.
54.
As a result of the conduct described above, Silberstein, Ungar, Gorback, and
Kobylarek willfully aided and abetted and caused Silberstein Ungar’s violations of Exchange Act
Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X.
55.
As a result of the conduct described above, Silberstein Ungar, Silberstein, Ungar,
Gorback, and Kobylarek willfully aided and abetted and caused the issuers discussed above to
violate Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 15(d) and Rules 13a-1 and 15d-1 thereunder, which
prohibits issuers from filing annual reports with the Commission that have financial statements
containing false and misleading information.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondents’ Offers.
Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 4C and 21C of the Exchange Act and Rules 102(e)(1)(ii)
and (iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately,
that:
A.
Respondents shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and
any future violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 15(d) and Rules 13a-1 and 15d-1
thereunder, and Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X.
B.
Respondents are denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the
Commission as an accountant.
C.
After five years from the date of this order, Respondent Silberstein may
request that the Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application
(attention: Office of the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the
Commission as:
1.

a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with
the Commission. Such an application must satisfy the Commission that

J.
Respondent Silberstein shall pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $35,000 to
the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States
Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). Payment shall be made in the following
installments:
1. $12,000 within 10 days of entry of this Order;
2. $12,000 within 180 days of entry of this Order;
3. $11,000 plus interest on the payments described in Section IV.J(1)-(3) pursuant
to 31 U.S.C. 3717 within 360 days of entry of this Order.

M.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents Silberstein and Ungar agree that in
any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by,
offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of
Respondents Silberstein’s and Ungar’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset").
If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents Silberstein
and Ungar agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty
Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil
penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this
proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private damages
action brought against Respondents Silberstein or Ungar by or on behalf of one or more investors
based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent Silberstein and Ungar, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest,
civil penalty or other amounts due by Respondent Silberstein or Ungar under this Order or any
other judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with
this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Respondent Silberstein or Ungar of the federal
securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19)
of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

By the Commission.
