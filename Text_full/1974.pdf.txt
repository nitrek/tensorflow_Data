PART 1
IMPORTANT
DEVELOPMENTS

MARKET REGULATION
During the past year, major developments
affecting the Commission's regulation of
the nation's securities markets took place.
First, the Commission made significant
progress toward Implementation of the
market structure principles enunciated In
its March 1973 Policy Statement on the
Structure of a Central Market System. It appointed an Advisory Committee on the Implementation of a Central Market System,
composed principally of industry representatives, and oversaw the establishment of a
consolidated transactional reporting tape
under a plan filed jointly by several exchanges and the NASD
Next, in September 1973,the Commission
announced that registered exchanges must
fully implement competitive commission
rates after April 30, 1975. Looking toward
that event, It endorsed the proposals advanced by the exchanges to initiate an experiment In negotiated public commission
rates on orders not exceeding $2,000.That
experiment went Into effect April 1, 1974,
and has been morutored closely by the
Commission and the exchanges. The
Commission also announced its intention
to examine the question of whether intramember rates should be negotiated rather
than fixed. And, in May and June It held
hearings to gather information on that subject. Other developments in this area included the expansion of the secondary trading markets tor listed call options, further
refinement of the rules pertaining to non-

member access to exchange markets, continuing Commission Inquiries into the
NASDanti-reciprocal rule, and the initiation
of an inquiry Into the conditions under
which foreign access to United States secuntles markets should be permitted.
At the same time, the Commission greatly
Improved during the fiscal year its early
warning and examination program for
broker-dealers. The designation of principal examining authorities for brokerdealers pursuant to Section 9(c) of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 has
eliminated unnecessary duplication in the
oversight procedures of the Commission
and the self-regulatory organizations. In
addition, the Commission hasstrengthened
the effectiveness of its oversight both by
visiting the self-regulatory organizations to
review and Improve their early warning, surveillance and examination programs, and
by visiting selected broker-dealer members
In order to monitor the effectiveness of
self-regulatory organizations' programs.
Finally, the Commission and its staff devoted substantial amounts of time in assistIng subcommittees of both Houses of Congress in their consideration of proposed
legislation that would both facilitate the establishment of a central market system and
aid the Commission in its oversight of the
national secu rities exchanges and securities associations. These Congressional
deliberations foreshadow basic changes in
the structural and regulatory framework of
the securities industry; the Commission anticipates that if the legislation currently
3

being considered by Congress becomes
law these changes will result In a truly competitive and efficient capital market
system-one capable of meeting the Nation's need for Investment capital while
operating In the public interest and serving
to protect the public Investor.

Industry Advisory Committees
1. Central Market System
On March 29, 1973, the Commission issued its Policy Statement on the Structure
of a Central Market System, setting forth the
results of an extensive review of the recommendations of its three industry advisory
committees,' two Congressional studles2
and an analysis by its staff with respect to
the development of a central market system
for listed securities. The Policy Statement
was intended to give direction to the development of the structure and regulatory
framework within which such a system
would operate. It also announced the
Commission's general intention to establish an Industry committee to advise It on
ways of implementing its proposals for a
central market system. On March 18, 1974,
In compliance with the Federal Advisory
Committee Act, the Commission announced ItS plans to establish a Central
Market System Advisory Committee and ItS
intended chairman.e on May 10, 1974 the
Commission named some of ItS rnernbers.s
Four additional members, one the Director
of the Commission's Division of Market
Regulation, were named In Securities Exchange Act Release No. 10826 (May 24,
1974), 4 SEC Docket 348. The Committee
has generally been asked to study and to
submit recommendations to the Commission on such matters as:
1. The appropriate structure for regulatory supervision of the central market system;
2. The nature and scope of the Commission's role dunnq the process of implementing the central market system;
3. The ways in which a central market
system should be structured In order to
meet effectively the needs of our capital
markets, the public Interest, the protection
of Investors and the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets for securities;
4

4. The needs and perspectives of users of
a central market system including issuers of
and Investors in securities, as well as secuntles professionals; and
5. The appropriate resolution of fundamental policy Issues relating to the central
market system's operations.
One of the chief matters which the Committee will study IS the role of competing
market makers In a central market system.
This study, along with parallel studies by the
staff of the Dlvrsron of Market Regulation,
will aid the Commission In determining the
proper role of the third market in a central
market system and the extent to which
comparable regulation of the exchange and
third markets may be necessary to foster an
appropriate level of competition In the public Interest.
2. Broker-Dealer Reports and Registration Requirements
Recognizing that broker-dealers might be
subject to duplicative and unnecessary
regulatory and reporting requirements, the
Commission in September 1972established
an Advisory Committee on Broker-Dealer
Reports and Registration ReqUirements to
study this problem. As previously reported,
the Advrsory Committee submitted Its report to the Commission In December 1972.
A Commission Staff Task Force considered
the report and the Commission subsequently announced a program to Implement the proposals thereln.s
In general, the Commission, based upon
the recommendations
of the Advisory
Committee Study, the program of implementation outlined by ItSstaff, and other
sources, IS undertaking steps to achieve
four substantive objectives:
1. A self-regulatory program which assures that in regard to financial responsibility and related record keeping a brokerdealer will be examined by and report to
only one self-regulatory organization;
2. The development and implementation
of a key regulatory report for use by the
Commission and the industry, incorporatIng uniform definitions and reporting
periods. The form would replace a number
of forms currently in use;
3. The establishment on a continuing
basis of a Report Coordinating Group under

the Federal Advisory Committee Act composed of knowledgeable
persons from the
secunties
industry,
the accounting
and
legal professions,
and elsewhere to advise
the COmmission regarding ways of providing for long-term simplification
and standardization in reportmg by broker-dealers,
to
advise the Commission
on proposed new
reports and forms, and to advise and assist
the COmmission in the development
of the
key regulatory report, and
4. The completion
of a program already
undertaken
m cooperation
with the state
securities administrators
and others to develop a uniform form for the registration
of
brokers and dealers for use by the states,
the Commission,
and the self-regulatory
organizations, and the completion
of the joint
securities industry effort to develop a uniform form for the registration
of principals
and agents
On May 16,1974, the Commission named
the members of its previously
announced
Report Coordinating
Group.s The Group IS
expected to be a standmg committee for a
penod of two years and, within the first six
months of its formation,
is expected to develop a uniform key regulatory
report.

3. Broker-Dealer

Model Compliance

GUide
The AdVisory Committee
appointed
m
1972 by the Commission
to assist It in developing a model compliance
program for
the broker-dealer
community
has completed and made available to the public a
draft of the Model Compliance
Guide.
Among the subjects covered are supervision, broker-dealer
and personnel registranon, financial and operations
responsibility, and customer accounts. The proposed
GUide is intended to assist each brokerdealer in preparing
or supplementing
its
own compliance
manual;
and not to
supplant it.
The Advisory Committee solicited and received suggestions
on the proposed Guide
from the broker-dealer
community,
the securities industry, the securities bar, the accounting
profession
and other interested
members of the public. The Advisory Committee has met several times to discuss revisions and hopes to complete its work on the
Guide during the fiscal year 1975.

Commission

Rates

On September 11, 1973,7 the Cornrrussron
announced
that It would act promptly to
term mate the fixing of commission
rates by
stock exchanges after Apnl 30, 1975, If the
exchanges did not in the meantime adopt
rule changes achieving that result. At the
same time, the Commission announced that
It would not object to a proposal by the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to increase
fixed commission
rates by 10 percent on
orders up to $5,000 and by 15 percent on
larger orders
up to $300,000,
effective
through March 31,1974. However, to retain
those Increases beyond March 31, 1974, exchanges
would have to permit
member
firms to provide customers less than a full
range of brokerage services and discounts
of up to 10 percent from the then effective
commission
rate schedule. Subsequently,
after drscussrons with representatives
of the
exchanges and the member firm community, the Commlssron determined that It would
entertain
proposed
alternatives
to the 10
percent discount but would adhere to the
objective which the discount was mtended
experimental
to serve, t,e., a meaningful
period pnor to the rntroductron
of completely unfixed commission
rates on May 1,
19758
In a letter dated February 7, 1974, the
NYSE submitted to the Commission
a proposal providmg
for competitive
commissions on orders of $2,000 or less and recissron of the prohibition
against chargmg
commissions
exceeding minimum rates. In
a February 21, 1974 letter, however, the
NYSE modified that proposal so that Intramember commission
rates would remain
fixed for all orders up to $300,000. On March
7,1974, the Commission
announced that it
would not object to the NYSE's proposals
and that it would study further whether to
Include Intra-member
rates in the expen9
mental perrod of limited pnce competition
From May 29 through June 4, 1974, the
Commission
held public
heanngs10
to
gather comments, views and data concerning (1) whether the Initiation in the near future of a limited experiment
in competitive
intra-member rates of commission on orders
not exceeding $2,000 would cause substantial and irreparable harm to floor brokers or

5

to
the
market-making
function
of
specialists,
and (2) whether
exchanges
should maintain any prescnbed schedules
of Intra-member rates of commission. The
matter IS under further study by the Commission's staff and is expected to be resolved during fiscal year 1975

Rule 19b-2
As previously
noted," on January 16,
1973, the Commission adopted Securities
Exchange Act Rule 19b-2. The Rule directed each securities exchange registered
with the Commission to adopt rules requrring every member "to have as the principal
purpose of its membership the conduct of a
public securities business." For purposes
of the Rule, a member is presumed to be
conducting a public securities business If at
least 80 percent of the value of exchange
securities transactions
effected by it consists of business effected for or with persons other than affiliated persons (as defined in the Rule) or consists of certain
kinds of transactions
which contribute to
the liquidity or stability of the markets, such
as those effected
by a stock exchange
specialist in a security in which he is registered. A phase-in penod was Included in the
Rule whereby exchange members who acqurred their memberships pnor to January
16, 1973, were given up to three years to
comply fully with its provisions.
Rules adopted
by the New York and
American Stock Exchanges to comply with
Rule 19b-2 require all members to abide by
the public business requirement, no matter
when they JOined the exchanges.
Rules
adopted by other exchanges which have
compiled with Rule 19b-2 apply that requirement only to members who joined on
or after January 16, 1973.
After the adoption of Rule 19b-2, various
parties, including the PBW Stock Exchange
filed petitions for review In the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to test
ItS validity. On March 19, 1973, that Court
stayed the effectiveness of the Rule as to
PBW members whose membership
antedated the Rule's adoption.
As previously reported 12 the court of appeals dismissed the petitions to review Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b-2 on the
ground, as urged by the Commission, that
6

the court lacked [unsdlctron directly to review the rule.13 On January 21, 1974, the
petitioners filed a petition for a writ of certiorari In the Supreme Court; that petition
was denied on Apnl 29, 1974.14
Thereafter, three lawsuits were filed In
various United States District Courts, seeking to declare Rule 19b-2 Invalid and to enJoin the Rule's operation
and enforcement.15 These suits are presently pending.
On July 29, 1974, the Commission
announced!"
that, during the pendency of
these actions, it would continue In effect the
partial stay of the Rule, in effect slqce March
1973,17 All exchanges which had not yet
complied with Rule 19b-2 would be required to do so subject to these conditions:
(1) all members who [omed an exchange
after January 16,1973, the date of the Rule's
adoption,
would be expected to comply
fully with its terms; (2) those members who
joined prior to that date could continue
membership, if their exchange so decided,
without complying with the Rule's public
business requirements,
provided that their
volume of business did not increase substantially pending the outcome of litigation
as to the Rule's validity.
The Commission's determination
to continue the partial stay was based, in part, on
the fact that pendmg
legislation
would
clarify and resolve most of the fundamental
questions relating to the appropriate utilization of stock exchange membership, with
which Rule 19b-2 is concerned.

Non-Member
Exchanges

Access to the

In its release announcing the adoption of
Rule 19b-2,18 the Commission stated that
exchanges
would be required to amend
their non-member
access provisions
to
eliminate any parent or related test as a
condition to qualification for the 40 percent
non-member discount from fixed exchange
rates.t" In addition, the Comcommission
rnlsston made it clear that exchanges
should amend their non-member
access
rules to provide that the discount would be
available only on non-member transactions
effected for or with persons other than affiliates.
There has been substantial compliance
with the Commission's
request. In amend-

109 ItS non-member
access provislons.s?
however, the NYSE submitted to the Comrrnssron a restricnve
Interpretation
of the
term "affiliated
person, found in Rule 19b2." The proposed interpretation
delineated
certain
circumstances
under which the
term would include an lnstttutlonal
account
over which a money manager exercises investment
discretion.
In response
to the
NYSE submission,
the Commission
informed the NYSE that the terms "affrhated
person" and "control"
(which IS an essential part of the definition
of "affiliated
person") were assigned by the Commission
their traditional legal meanings, and should
be construed flexibly depending on the errcumstances
of each case. The NYSE's interpretation was deemed not to be in accord
with these flexible standards of Rule 19b2.21

In a related development
the NYSE has
submitted an amendment to its rules which
would prohlbrt member and non-member
money managers from creditmq
commission savings against advisory fees.22 The
Ocmmlssron
has soliorted public comment
on this proposal.23

Foreign Access to United States
Securities Markets
On February 8, 1974, the Commission
requested public comment on questions, the
answers to which would enable It to decide
whether foreign entrttes should be permitted to participate
fully in the United States
securities markets, or to what extent, if any,
their parncrpation
should
be limited
or
otherwise condltioned.24 Currently, the participation of foreign persons in U.S. securities markets is a matter subject to the discretion of the self-regulatory
organizations,
which may elect whether to permit them to
seek mernbershrp or otherwise participate

When the comrmsston
eliminated
the
parent test from exchange membership
requirements
by Rule 19b-2, it stated that exchanges could permit firms with foreign
parents to become members, at least until
that subject could be studied and its respective merits and shortcomings
explored,
provided that such exchanges could satisfy

themselves and the Commission
members
were In compliance
19b-2.

Consolidated Tape
As previously
noted,26 Securities
Exchange Act Rule 17&:-15 requires registered
national securities exchanges, national secuntles
associations
and broker-dealers
which are not members of such organizations, to file "plans" with the Cornrnrssron,
on a [ornt basis if desired, for the consolidated reporting of price and volume data as
to completed
transactions
in exchangelisted secuntres
Such a plan was filed
Jointly by the American,
Midwest, Pacrtrc,
PBW and New York Stock Exchanges and
the NASD,27 and was the subject of two
Commission letters of comment to ItS sponsors 28 It was subsequently
refiled with the
Oornrmsslon'" and was declared effective
by the Commission asof May 17, 1974.30The
plan, which specifies the manner in which
the last sale reports Will be collected
and
disseminated,
provides
for a 40-week
period of development
and testing before
the consolidated
tape becomes fully operational.
The plan's sponsors were working to implement by October 4, 1974 the 20-week
pilot phase-a
testing
period
using 15
Widely traded NYSE securities.
In this area, the Commission
also proposed an amendment to Rule 17&:-15 to establish procedures
for appeal to the Commrssron from certain actions which may be
taken pursuant
to the consolidated
tape
plan." and exempted from the provislons of
Rule 17&:-15 the reporting of transactions
In
listed secunnes

pursuant to the plan.32
On October
3, 1974, the Commission,
pursuant to a request by the New York Stock
Exchange, announced that It would not object to a postponement
to October 18, 1974,
of Phase I of the pilot phase of the consolidated tape, provided that Phase II of the
pilot phase would commence as scheduled
in February 1975, and that any further educational, mechanical and regulatory problems
that may arise In connection
with the consolidated tape would be remedied during
operation of the tape. Securities Exchange

Option Market Regulation
When the Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE)33 began as a pilot operation
on April 26, 1973, It had 305 members and it
listed call options on 16 NYSE-listed stocks
By the end of fiscal year 1974 It had 560
members
and listed call options
on 32
NYSE-listed stocks. The average daily volume of options traded reached approxr23,000 contracts,
representing
mately
2,300,000 shares of the underlying stocks.
Because of the Increased Interest by the
public and other secunties
exchanges
In
trading options, the Commission
held public hearings in February 1974 to consider
va no us questions
regarding options trading on and off the exchanges.34 The scope
of the Commission's
mquiry was broad and
Included such matters as whether the trading of options serves a useful economic
purpose In relation to the securities
markets, whether the vanous forms of option
trading on and off registered secunnes exchanges serve the public interest, and the
impact of exchange option trading on public Investing and trading habits The hearIngs also focused on the questions whether
more than one exchange should trade options, what type of regulatory scheme the
Commission
should adopt If such multiple
trading IS permitted, and whether different
exchanges
should be competitive
in tradIng.
The staff of the Commission,
based at
least partly upon the hearings,
recommended strengthened
financial responsibility requirements
for CBOE market makers,
Improvements
In the CBOE floor trading
procedures,
and adoption
of appropriate
exchange rules to deal with problems arising from trading in away-from-the-money
options. The staff also recommended
that,
prior to expanding
the CBOE pilot or the
initiation of multiple exchange options tradIng, all exchanges
concerned
add ress
themselves to the achievement
of a common clearing system, standardization
of option terms and conditions,
a common tape
for reporting
transactions
In all listed options, and, in view of present non-member
8

broker exchange
access provisions
(and
potential elimination
of fixed commission
rates) a system enabling all option quotations to be made available on a current basis
to all qualified non-members
as well as to
members.35 By the end of the fiscal year the
Oornmlssron had noted that substantial
progress In resolving these problems had
apparently been made by the CBOE and the
exchanges interested In multiple exchange
option tradlng.36
On December 15,1973, the Commission
announced the adoption of Rule 9b-1 under
the Securities
Exchange
Act, effective
January 17, 1974.37 ThiS Rule, which was
onginally proposed on January 9, 1973, and
subsequently
revised, provides that a national secunnes
exchange
which effects
transactions
In options
or allows
its
facilities to be used to effect transactions
In
options must file with the Commission
a
plan, which contains those requirements
of
the exchange that relate solely or significantly to transactions
In options on the exchange The plan must be declared effective
by the Commission
before any transaction
In options can take place on that exchange.
To permit continued
CBOE operation,
its
plan for trading options was declared effective simultaneously
with the adoption
of
Rule 9b-1.39
FollOWing the adoption of Rule 9b-1, two
additional
exchanges, the Amencan Stock
Exchange (Am ex) and the PBW Stock Exchange (PBW),39 announced
and filed with
the Commission
plans to begin pilot programs in call option trading. Under both of
these plans, the exchanges proposed to rely
on their existlnq specialist systems for makIng markets In options on their floors rather
than to utilize a multiple market-maker
system like that of the CBOE.40 The PBW plan
contemplates
the trading
of options
on
stocks which are also traded on the PBW.
The proposals of both exchanges are currently under review.
The CBOE made numerous changes to ItS
option plan under Rule 9b-1, which became
effective. Among other things, It eliminated
fixed minimum
Intra-member
clearance
commission
rates. It also altered ItS floor
trading
procedures
to provide improved
market continuity and competitiveness.
For
example, multi-member
market Units were

eliminated
and market-making
responsibilities were given to individuals. In addition, the board broker was given the ability
to call upon market-makers
(who are appointed for a particular class of options) to
make bid~ and/or offers not only in the
interest of a fair and orderly market but also
in the Interest of a competitive market. In an
effort to give the public more adequate
notice of when out-of-the-money
options
" would be restricted,
transactions
the
CBOE has proposed other changes in ItS
plan that were under consideration
by the
Commission at the end of the fiscal year
On August 22,1974, the Commission announced that It had approved In pnnciple,
subject to further submissions by the Amex,
the CBOE and the PBW, and final Commission review: (a) the formation of a central
options clearing organization,
(b) a proposal for dissemination of last sale information and quotations for exchange options,
and (c) proposed standardized terms and
cond itrons for exchange
options.
The
Commission
also considered
and determined not to object to CBOE's Issuance of
195 additional memberships, nor to CBOE's
proposal to list additional
underlying securities subject to the adoption of satisfactory rules relating to trading away-fromthe-money
options,
nor to CBOE's proposed financial
responsibility
rules. Further, the Oornmrssron
advrsed the Amex
that, subject to certain conditions
and
understandings
it would be prepared to
make effective that exchange's option plan
(Securities
Exchange
Act Release No
10980, August 23,1974,5
SEC Docket 40)
As previously reported,42 the Commission
has proposed Securities Act Rule 238 and
secunnes Exchange Act Rule 9b-2, which
would govern put and call options and
those who deal in them These proposed
Rules were revised and republished
for
comment In late 1973.43 Rule 238, as proposed, would exempt put and call options
from the registration
requirements
of the
Securities Act if certain conditions
were
met. These conditions are. (1) that the ISsuer of the underlying security be subject to
the reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act and, in brief, be current In ItS reporting
obligations; (2) that the security underlying
the option be registered on a national se-

curitres exchange or quoted by at least 5
market makers on an automated quotation
system of a national secunties association,
and such security have a current pnce, of at
least $5, (3) that the gross proceeds received from the sale of specified related
options do not exceed $500,000, (4) that the
writer of the option be neither the issuer of
the underlyrnq secunty not an underwriter
of such security, nor a control person of the
Issuer; and (5) that the option be endorsed
by a broker or dealer registered
under
Section 15 of the Exchange Act. Because
(3) and (5), the Rule would
of conditions
apply neither
to current
CBOE option
trading nor to the trading contemplated
by
the Amex and the PBW. Those exchange
options would be fully registered under the
Securities Act
The present version of the proposed rule,
unlike that previously
proposed,
IS not
available for limited price options, those involving a feature by which the option terminates prior to the stated terms, In the event
the market pnce of the underlying security
reaches a specrned level
The Rule does not purport to be exclusive; Issuers of options can rely upon other
exemptions from registration
Proposed Rule 9b-2 as revised specifies
standards of surtabilrty for customers dealIng in options, requires the disclosure by
brokers and dealers to customers of the nature and nsk Involved In options, and requrres endorsers of options to report their
transactions and maintain a net capital of
not less than $50,000

Legislative

Initiatives

At the close of the fiscal year, there were a
number of bills pending In Congress which
If enacted would effect major changes In the
structure and regulation of the secuntres
Industry Among the bills as to which the
Cornrrussron commented, suggested revisions and testified were (1) S 470, which
would require all stock exchange members
to conduct a public sscuntres busmess after
the breakpoint In commission rates IS lowered to $100,000, (2) S 3126, which would
give the Commission authonty to prohibit
over-the-counter
trading of secunnes listed
on

registered

national

securities

ex9

changes; (3) S. 2058, a bill designed to regulate the transfer, clearance and settlement
of securities;
(4) S. 2234, a bIll to require
regular and full disclosure
by institutional
Investors of their portfolio
holdings
and
transactions,
(5) S 2707, which would give
the Commission
limited authority over the
securities
actrvitles of banks offering automatic
investment
plan services;
(6) S.
2842, which is desiqned to limit the amount
of assets which institutions
could invest In
any single security and to decrease the rate
of taxation on capital gains, and (7) H.R
8951, a bill to limit foreign private investment In the United States.
Described In more detail below are three
bills on which the Oornrrussion and its staff
particularly devoted substantial amounts of
time.

(1) H.R. 5050
In 1972 the Subcommittee
on Commerce
and Finance of the House Committee
on
Interstate
and Foreign
Commerce
completed a comprehensive
examination
of the
securities
mdustry.v'
After taking voluminous testimony, the Subcommittee
Issued a
report setting forth the information
and
analysts obtained, along with conclusions
and legislative recommendations
concernIng almost every aspect of the securities
Industry with which the DIVision of Market
Regulation
IS concerned.w
On March 1,
Exchange
1973, a bill entitled theSecuntJes
Act Amendments
of 1973, desiqnated
H.R.
5050, was Introduced
In the House and referred to the Committee
on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce
On August 13, 1974, the
bill was reported by the Subcommittee
on
Commerce
and Finance
to the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.
Title I of H.R. 5050 would amend the Exchange Act provrsrons relating to the selection of members of and administration
of
the Comrmssion.
It would provide for concurrent transmission,
to Congress and the
executive
branch,
of legislative
recommendations, testimony, comments on legiSlation and budget estimates. Title I would
affect the tenure
of the Oornmrssron's
Chairman,
authorize
the comrntssion to
conduct ItS own CIVil litigation,
direct the
10

commrssron

to supply requested
documents to ItS legislative
oversight committees in Congress and modify the provisions
on Commission
appropriations.
Title II ISdesrqned, among other things, to
conform Section 6 of the Exchange Act to
Section 15A of that Act so that national secuntres exchanges and national securities
assocratrons,
as well as their members,
would be subject to substantially
Identical
regulation.
Title II would expand the oversight authority of the Commission
over exchange rules and over disciplinary
actions
by exchanges. It would permit the Commission to eliminate duplicative
oversight responsibrlrtres by the self-regulatory
organizations. It would also phase out fixed commission
rates on national
securities
exchanges on orders exceeding $300,000, and
on orders under $300,000 unless the CommISSIon acted to retain fixed rates, and
would prohibit persons from providing both
management and brokerage services to the
same institutional
account.
Title III would
amend
Exchange
Act
prOVISIonS relating to the regulation of brokers, dealers and exchange members. The
revrsions would affect, among other things,
the tlnancral
responsibrhty
requirements,
the broker-dealer
application,
registration
and examination
process, and certain of the
reporting
requirements.
The revisions
would also clarify the Oomrrussion's authorIty to adopt rules With respect to securities
information
processors
and to require a
composite transaction
tape and a composrte quotation
system, and would grant the
Oornmrsslon
expanded
authority
over the
accounting
procedures
of broker-dealers
and exchange members.
of
Title IV provides for the development
an Integrated
national
system
for the
prompt and accurate processing
and settlement of secuntles
transactions
and includes provrsrons relating to the regulation
and registration
of clearing agencies, secunnes depositories
and transfer agents. It
also directs the Oornrnlssron to eliminate by
December 31, 1976 the use of the stock cernncate as a means of settlement,
and
clarifies the Commission's
authority as to
missmq or stolen sscunnes.
PrOVISiOnS of Title IV wou ld designate the
Commission
as the sole regulator of clear-

Ing agencies and depositories regardless of
whether these entities are incorporated and
authorized to operate as banking organizations. The Commission would be authorized
to set standards for such entitles, administer registration requirements, conduct inspections and ensure compliance with the
standards It has set Similarly, the Commission would be the sole regulator for those
transfer agents which are not banking organizations; In the case of transfer agents
organized as banking organizations, the
Commission would set the standards and
the Federal banking authorities (I.e., the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, Comptroller of the Currency and
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation)
would administer registration requirements, conduct Inspections and ensure
compliance with the standards set by the
Oornrrusslon.w

Title V contains several miscellaneous
provisions relating to the Commission's
Annual Report to Congress and registration
fees. In addition, that title would make uniform the criminal penalties which may be
imposed for violations of the vanous Federal securities laws.
Title VI provides for the development of a
national securities market system, includIng a transactional reporting system for eligible securities traded within the system, a
composite quotation system for reporting
bid and offered quotations In eligible securities, and rules or regulations designed to
provide fair competition between competitors In the system.Title VI would grant to
the Commission broad authority to regulate
the national market system, to determine
whether trading In listed securities should
be confined to exchanges and to promulgate rules to eliminate unfair competitive
advantages among securities dealers resulting from unjustifiable disparities in the
regulation of such dealers by the selfregulatory organizations. The Commission
would also be directed to study the feasibility of establishing a national market board
to regulate the system.
Title VI would, In addition, prevent selfregulatory organizations from limiting,
without Commission approval, after July 1,
1975, the ability of their members to transact business on any other exchange, or

otherwise than on an exchange. Title VI
would also amend the Investment Advisers
Act so that, unless expressly provided
otherwise by state statute, fiduciary money
managers might exercise their reasonable
business Judgments in evaluating brokerage services and In paying brokerage comrrussrons at reasonable rates even If such
rates were In excess of what another broker
would have charged
(2) S. 2519
The Subcommittee on Securities of the
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing
and Urban Affairs held hearings In November and December 1973 on S. 2519
which deals primarily with the subjects of
Title II of H.R 5050 S 2519 ISdesigned to
facilitate the development of a central market systemfor listed securities and to render
more comparable the Commission's oversight of securities exchanges and secunties
associations registered under the Exchange Act. The Subcommittee reported
the bill with amendments to the full Committee, which voted its approval In May 1974.
The Senate approved the bill, as amended,
later that month.
The bill provides for the regulation of securities communications systems by bringIng under the Commission's Jurisdiction all
organizations engaged In the business of
collecting, processing, or publishing information relating to quotations for or transactions In securities. The Commission would
be granted broad authority to regulate and
oversee the acnvines of these newly designated "registered securities information
processors," as well as the activities of national securities exchanges and associations.
The bill also would impose upon the
Commission an affirmative obligation to review the rules of a secuntres exchange or
association to assure that they do not impose any burden on competition, and to
amend or otherwise alter such rules if it
finds that competition has been impeded.
The bill fu rther provides that public securities orders should be given priority over the
orders of secunnes professronals, It seeks
to strengthen the capacity of the securities
markets to handle orders of Institutional
11

size and to govern the activities of market
makers In a central market system.
The bill would require the Commission to
include In ItS annual reports to Congress
information concerning development of a
national market system and the actlvrtres,
capabilities and plans of the self-regulatory
organizations relating to development of
that system.
The bill also provides for procedural
standards which would have to be applied
by the self-regulatory organizations in dealIngs with members and non-members for
various purposes Each organization would
be required to make available to the Comrrussrona concise general statement of the
basis and purpose of each regulatory
amendment it proposed to make and to publish each such amendment for public comment. The bill also would give the Commission broad authority to review the rules of
the self-regulatory organizations and would
require the Commission to approve any
amendment of a rule before the amendment
could take effect.
Finally, S. 2519 would authorize the
Commission, after making specified findings as to competitive factors, the viability
of exchanges and the public Interest, to
limit trading in listed securities to exchange
floors, or to take such other action as It
believes may be warranted This provision IS
designed to remedy possible senous rrnparrrnent of the auction trading markets
(currently the exchange markets) which
might attend the implementation of fully
competitive commission rates.

amend the definition of the term "exempted
security" to exclude rnurucrpal securities
for purposes of Section 15 and 15A of the
Act; (ii) create a new class of dealers called
"municipal securities dealers", which
would Include a bank or a "separately Identifiable" division or department of a bank to
the extent It engages In the business of trading municipal securities for its own account
other than in a fiduciary capacity, (IIi) provide for a new Industry rulemaking board to
establish rules governing municipal secunties professionals; and (iv) provide for
Commission regulation of municipal securities professionals, Including banks.

DISCLOSURE
MATTERS

RELATED

The Rule 140 Series
In the Commission's 1969 Disclosure Policy Study,47a number of recommendations
were made to Improve the overall disclosure
process under the Securities Act and the
Securities Exchange Act and to promote objectivity In the operation, administration
and enforcement of certain provisions of
the Securities Act. The principal recommendations of the Study are embodied in a
series of Commission rules known as the
"Rule 140 Senes", comprised of Rules 144,
145, 146 and 147, adopted pursuant to the
Secunties Act. Rules 144 and 145 were
adopted in 1972 and 1973, respectively;48
during the last fiscal year, the Commission
adopted Rules 146 and 147.

(3) S. 2474

Rule 144

On September 11, 1973,the Commission
transmitted to the Senate a proposal to
amend the Securities Exchange Act to provide for regulation of trading In municipal
securities by secuntres professionals, including banks. That proposal precipitated
the introduction of S. 2474 In the Senate on
September 24, 1974
S. 2474 would provide a new statutory
framework for the regulation of rnurucipal
securities professionals closely paralleling
existing provrsrons of the Act governing
brokers and dealers and their transactions
In nonexempt secunties. S. 2474 would (i)

Rule 144, "Persons Deemed Not to be
Engaged in a Distribution and Therefore
Not Underwriters," provides a method of
resale of secuntres acquired In private
placements and for securities held by affiliates. During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted several amendments to the
Rule. Among others, subparagraph (g)(2) of
the Rule was amended to permit brokers to
continue to insert bid and ask quotations for
a class of securities In an inter-dealer quotation system while selling secunties in the
class, subject to certain conditions. The
amendment also allows a broker to make

12

inquiries of his customers who have indicated a bona fide unsolicited Interest In the
securities within the ten business days preceding the broker's receipt of the order to
sell secunnes pursuant to the Rule. The
Commission
amended also subparagraph
(h) to require transmittal of all amended
notices of proposed sale on Form 144 to the
principal stock exchange on which the secuntres to be sold are listed for tradlng.49

Rule 145
Rule 145, generally, provides that an "offer" or "sale" of securities is deemed to be
involved when there IS submitted for the
vote or consent of security holders a plan or
agreement for (1) reclassifications
other
than stock splits and changes in par value;
(2) mergers, consolidations
and similar
plans of acquisition except where the sole
purpose of such a transaction IS to change
an Issuer's domicile; and (3) certain transfers of assets for securities where there IS a
subsequent distribution
of such securities
to those voting on the transfer of assets On
February 28, 1974 the Commission
published a release setting forth the DIVision of
Corporation
Finance's interpretations
of
Rule 14550 The release deals with the relationship of Rule 145 to certain statutory exemptions; the application
of Rule 145 to
various
types of reclassifications
and
business combination
transactions;
the
type of communications
deemed not to be a
"prospectus"
for purposes of Rule 145, resales of securities acquired in Rule 145
transactions, and related matters. On July 2,
1974, the Commission published a second
Interpretive release regarding the registration procedures
applicable
to open-end
Investment companies Issuing securities In
business combination transactions subject
to Rule 134.51

Rule 146

I

The so-called "private offering" exemption from registration under the Securities
Act, Section 4(2), provides that offers and
sales by an issuer not involving any public
offering will be exempt from registration.
The section has long been a source of uncertainty for Issuers wanting to sell their
securities in private placements.
In April

1974, the Commission
adopted Rule 146
under the Securrtles Act, "Transactions
by
an Issuer Deemed Not to Involve Any Public
Offering," which IS desrqned to protect investors while at the same time providing
more objective standards to curtail uncertainty as to the meaning of Section 4(2) to
the extent feasible 52
In general, the Rule provides that transactions by an Issuer meeting all the conditions
of the Rule do not involve "any public offermq." Major condltrons to be met In general
are that (1) there must be no general advertising or solicitation In connection With the
offering; (2) offers can be made only to persons who the Issuer reasonably believes
have the requisrte knowledge and experience in financial and busmess matters, or to
persons who the Issuer reasonably believes
can bear the economic risk, (3) sales can be
made only to persons who the Issuer reasonably believes have the requisite knowledge and experience, or who can bear the
economic risk and have an advisor (meeting
certain standards) who can provide the reqursite knowledge and experience, (4) all offerees either must have access to or must be
furnished with the type of information that
registration would disclose, (5) there can be
no more than 35 purchasers of securrnes In
the offering; and (6) reasonable care must
be taken to prevent resale of the secuntles
In Violation of the registration provrslons of
the Securities Act.
_~
Rule 146 does not provide the exclusive
means for offering and seiling securities in
reliance on Section 4(2). Issuers may continue to rely on the Section 4(2) exemption
by complying With relevant administrative
and Judicial criteria at the time of a transaction. The staff of the Commission will Issue
interpretative
letters to assist persons In
complying with the Rule, but will Issue noaction letters relating to Section 4(2) only In
the most compelling circumstances

Rule 147
Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act, the
Intrastate
offering
exemption,
which
exempts from registration
secuntres that
are part of an issue offered and sold only to
persons resident in a specific state by an
issuer that is also resident and doing busl13

ness in that state, has been widely relied
upon, but has also been the source of inquiry, misunderstanding,
and uncertainty
over the years. On January
7, 1974 the
Commission
adopted Rule 147 under the
Secuntres Act which defines certain terms
of, the
In, and clannes certain conditions
intrastate offenng exemptlon.53
The Rule
provides some objective standards for determining
when a person is considered
a
resident within a state and whether an issuer IS "doing business Within" a state for
purposes of the exemption. The Rule does
not define which offers and sales constitute
"part of an issue" but relies Instead on the
traditional
understanding
of when offers
and sales will be Integrated; It does however
provide a "safe harbor" as to certain offers
and sales. The Rule benefits only Issuers
and IS nonexclusive.
Since the adoption of
Rule 147, the staff of the Commission
has
ceased responding
to requests
for noaction letters under Section 3(a)(11) except
In the most compelling
circumstances;
but
the staff does provide Interpretative
guidance as to the use of the Rule.

Campaign

r

I

Dunng

Fund Disclosure

the fiscal

year, the Oommtssron

~~nounced that It had denied a ruternakmq
â€¢ petition which had proposed that the Commission amend its proxy rules to require
disclosure In proxy soliciting materials or In
corporate annual reports of Information
required to be filed With the Congress or with
the Comptroller
General under the Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971 ("FECA").54
The Information
relates to "the establishment, administration
and solicitation
of
contributions
to a separate segregated fund
to be utilized for political purposes by a corporation.
. ," as permitted by FECA. The
Oornrmssron noted that Congress had expressly specrned the channels for the dissemination
of information
filed under the
Act, and that the Commission
could not assume that those channels were Inadequate
to achieve the Congressional
goal of "wide
dissemination"
of the information.
The
Commission
found itself unable to conclude that the information
contained in the
reports filed under FECA was of sufficient
relevance to security
holders to warrant
14

adoption of the suggested amendments
to
the proxy rules.
In a separate action on March 8,1974. the
Commission announced the views of the DIvision of Corporation
Finance as to whether
disclosure should be made when the issuer
and/or ItS officers or directors
have been
charged
In an information
or indictment
With, or convicted
of, making Illegal campaign contributions
In Violation of 18 U.S.C.
610. That law makes It unlawful,
among
other things, for a corporation
to make a
contnbution
In connection
With any election for President, Vice-President,
Senator
or Congressman
or any pnmary election or
convention
or caucus to select nominees
for any of such offices.55 In the Divlsron's
view, the conviction
of a corporation,
its
officers or directors for haVing made illegal!
campaign
contributions
In Violation of 18
U.S.C. 610 is a matenal fact that should be
disclosed to the public and specifically
to
shareholders
particularly
In the context of
proxy statements In which such shareholders are being asked to vote for management. The release explains, In addition, that
disclosure of such convictions,
or pleas of
guilty or nolo contendere, should be made
In penodic reports under the Exchange Act,
and in registration
statements filed under
the Securities Act.
The release states that such a conviction
IS material to an evaluation of the integrity of
the management
of the corporation
as it
relates to the operation of the corporation
and the use of corporate
funds. The Division's position as to disclosure of a pending
indictment
or information
IS that management IS usually In the best position to determine whether disclosure
is necessary.

Fuel Shortages, Extractive
Reserve and Natural Gas
Supplies
In view of present energy shortages and
the actual or potential
impact that such
shortages
may have on the operations
of
issuers subject to the registration
and reporting provrslons of the Federal secunties
laws, on December 20, 1973, the Oomrmssron Issued a release reiterating the importance of making prompt and accurate drsclosure of information,
both favorable and

unfavorable, to security holders and the Investing public.56 The Comrmssron
recognized that the extent of possible energy
shortages and the impact of shortages on
particular industnes or Issuers might not be
determinable
at the time and stated It was
not in a position to publish gUidelines for
disclosure.
The Commission
emphasized,
however, that under the secunties laws, the
responsibility
for making full and fair disclosure in filings with the Commission rests
with the issuers required to make those filings; and that management has the responsibility to make full and prompt announcements of material facts concerning
its issuer's operations.
anOn July 3, 1974, the Commission
nounced
that Guide 28, "Extractive
Reserves," of the Guides for Preparation and
Filing of Registration
Statements 57 under
the Securities
Act of 1933 had been
amended to require that when using Forms
8-1 and 8-7 under the Securities Act, registrants engaged In the gathering, transmission, or distribution
of natural gas must disclose material Information
based upon the
facts and circumstances
of their particular
situation, with respect to the current availability of gas supplies.58 The GUide sets forth
certain nonexclusive
factors that firms In
the gas Industry should consider in making
disclosure
of their capacity to respond to
users' needs for natural gas. GUide 28 was
also recaptioned
"Disclosure
of Extractive
Reserves and Natural Gas Supplies."
The Commission
also adopted the substance of Guide 28, as amended, as Guide 2
of the GUides for Preparation
and Filing of
Reports and Registration Statements under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Paragraph (a) of Guide 2 requires that companies engaged in extractive operations include, where appropriate,
the quantitative
amount of their estimated reserves on Form
10. Paragraph
(b) applies
to issuers
engaged in the gathering, transmission
or
distribution
of natural gas and provides for
disclosure
in Forms 10 and 10K similar to
that required of registrants by Guide 28.
On June 14, 1974, the Commission
announced certain practices followed by the
Division of Corporation
Finance in connection with the processing of filings which require
information
of registrants
as to

natural gas reserve estlmates.s? The DiVIsron will request registrants to explain differences between natural gas reserve estimates contained
in filings with trus Commission and estimates reported to any other
regulatory authority Within one year prior to
the filing. In addition,
copies of prospectuses filed by registrants subject to the Federal Power Commission will be submitted to
that agency for comments
and generally
appropriate
technical
personnel
from the
FPC Will be mvrted to attend conferences
where supplemental
natural gas reserve
information
submitted
by a registrant
IS
reviewed.

Annual Reports to security
Holders
On January 10, 1974, based in part on
certain recommendations
of the Commission's Industrial Issuers AdVISOry Committee,60 the Commission
proposed
various
amendments to ItS proxy rules dealing With
the Information
required to be furnished to
security holders In connection
with meetings of security holders and the sollcrtatton
of proxtes.'" The proposals deal with Improving both disclosure
In and dissemination of annual reports to security holders.
Generally, the proposals
would require
that an Issuer's annual report to security
holders disclose the nature of its business, a
hnes-ot-busmess
breakdown
as to sales
and profits and a summary of its operations,
all of which would be comparable
to that
information
set forth In the issuer's annual
report filed With the Commission,
usually on
Form 1D-K. The issuer's annual report to
security holders would also be required to
disclose textual Information
regarding the
nature and scope of the Issuer's hquidrty
and working
capital requirements
based
upon such consrderanons
as peak seasonal
demands for working
capital, availability
and cost of credit, polrcies followed
With
respect to the magnitude of Inventory to be
maintained, and future financmq plans and
requirements.
Additionally,
the proposals
would require that the annual report to secunty holders disclose certain background
information
regarding an Issuer's directors
and executive officers; certain statlstrcal rnformation regarding dividends paid and the
15

high and low prices for the issuer's securities for each quarter dunnq the past two
years; and a statement of the Issuer's drvrdend policy.
With respect to dissemination,
the proposals would require an issuer to make inqurnes of brokers, dealers, banks and votIng trustees to determine
whether
other
persons are the beneficial owners of securities held of record by such persons If there
are such other benencrat owners, an issuer
would have to obtain information
as to the
number of proxy statements and annual reports required,
supply the record holder
with sufficient copies for distribution
to the
benetrcral owners, and pay reasonable expenses of the record holder for rnarlrnq the
material to the benencral owners.
Finally, the proposals would require that a
proxy statement contain a boldface undertaking that an issuer Will furnish a copy of an
annual report filed with the Comrnlssron
(usually on Form 1Q-K) upon receipt of a
written request from any person solicrted In
connection
with the annual meeting

Proposed Rule 240
On June 3, 1974, the Commission
published for comment Proposed Rule 240 (and
related Form 240), "Exemption
of Certain
LImited Offers and Sales by Closely Held
Issuers," wruch would exempt from registration under the Securities Act limited offers and sales of small dollar amounts of
secunties to a limited number of purchasers
by an issuer that, after the transactions
pu rsuant to the rule, would continue to have a
small number of benencral owners of ItS securities.62 The rule would be adopted pursuant to Section 3(b) of the Act. The Rule
would not be available for resales.
In general, the proposed rule would exempt transactions
by an Issuer (other than a

In announcing

or
Summary of Operations and should be in a
position to assess the source and probabilrty of recurrence of net Income (or loss).

Disclosure of Professional
Litigation
On July 25, 1973 the Commission
announced an inquiry by the Divrsron of Corporation
Finance In conjunction
with the
Office of the Chief Accountant,
to obtain
information
and ascertain
views of interested persons relating to the disclosure
In filings
with the Cornmlssron of litigation
Involving professionals,
such as accountants and lawyers, who practice before the
Oornrrusslon.w
The Commission
received
36 letters from professionals,
corporations
and Interested associations
who expressed
their views and add ressed themselves to the
eIght POints raised In the release. The staff
has the matter under conslderatron.

Real Estate Matters
The continued development
of new ways
to finance
and sell real estate and the
applicability
of the Federal securities laws
to such transactions
continued
to be an
area of evolving Interpretations
and practice.
On March 1,1974,65theCommlssion
published proposed Guide 60, "Preparation
of
Registration
Statements
Relating to Interests in Real Estate Limited Partnerships,"
of
the Guides for Preparing and Filing RegiStration Statements under the Securities Act.
The proposed
GUide contains
comments
and suggestions
developed by the Division
of Corporation
Finance In processing registration statements relating to real estate IIrnited partnerships.
The comments
received
on the proposed GUide are being studied by
the staff. The DIVision will continue to apply
the substance of the GUide to filings during
the comment period and thereafter, unless
the Guide is adopted in an amended form

INVESTMENT
Variable

COMPANIES

pany Act and the Investment Advisers Act.66
Basrcally, the term variable life Insurance
refers to Insurance contracts In which the
death benefit, cash surrender
value and
other benefits vary to reflect the investment
experience
of a life insurance company's
separate account which invests primarily in
equity securrtles.
The Commission was persuaded to adopt
Rule 3c-4 under the Investment Company
Act and Rule 202-1 under the Advisers Act
largely In recognition
of the developing system of state insurance laws and rsqulanon
covering variable life, which the Commission believed would provide protections
for
purchasers substantially
equivalent to relevant protections
afforded by the 1940 Acts.
However, In September
1973,67 the Comrnlsston expressed concern that contracts
might be sold In certain states prior to adoption by such states of necessary protections. In January 1974,68 the Commission
ordered hearings to assist It In determining
whether Rules 3c-4 and 202-1 should be
condrtroned
so that exemption
from the
Acts would be available only upon specific
determination
by the Oomrmssion that applicable state laws and regulations provide
protections
for purchasers
substantially
eq uivalent to relevant provrsions of the 1940
Acts.
The Commission
indicated It would conSider whether the Model Variable Life Insurance Regulation developed by the National
Association
of Insurance
Oommlssroners
would meet the terms of the proposed
amendments.
Public hearings were conducted between March 25 and 28. 1974. and
the staff is presently considennq
the substantial comments
received from many interested persons
A petition for review filed in the United
States Court of Appeals In Washington, D.C.
by a group of large mutual fund complexes
seeking review and reversal of the adoption
of the Rules69 was stayed by the court In
reliance
upon
the Oommtssrcn's
announced intention to review them.

Life Insurance

In the past nscat year, the Commission
conducted
further hearings to determine
whether to amend rules which presently
exempt certain variable life insurance from
the requirements
of the Investment Com-

ENFORCEMENT

MATTERS

Joint SEC-NASD Task Force
In 1973, the Commission
announced
it would partrcipate
In tne formation

that
of a
17

JOint Task Force with the NASD to investigate certain abuses emerging In the overthe-counter
market. The Task Force was established
to mobilize
efficiently
the resources ofthe Oornmtssron and the NASD to
prevent the consummation
of manipulative
activities. Broker-dealers
were selected as
the focal POints of investigation
because of
their strategic position in the securities industry.
During the past fiscal year, the Task Force
was utilized In the New York, Salt Lake City
and Los Angeles regions with very Impressive results In the breadth and number of
enforcement
actions instituted. As a result,
of its efforts, ten injunctive actions lnvolvmq
approximately
43 defendants,
and thirteen
administrative
proceedings
naming nearly
110 respondents
have been brought by the
Comrnlssron, In addition, trading In the securitles of ten Issuers was suspended
to
prevent
the consummation
of ongoing
frauds. There has also been a criminal convrction for conduct uncovered by the Task
Force. The NASD Itself recently terminated
the membership
of a broker-dealer
and
sanctioned
ItS principal. The Task Force is
to continue ItS work In the three locations
named above and consideration
Will be
given to moving into new areas In the near
future

Municipal Bonds
The Divrsron's staff IS contrnurnq ItS investigation
of sales and trading
practices
within the municipal
bond industry. In this
area, dunnq the fiscal year 1974, four civil
actions were filed or pending In which 50
defendants,
including
11 municipal
bond
dealers, were charged with violations ofthe
Federal secuntres laws. While brokers and
dealers who transact business only in murucrpal bonds are not required to register
with the Commission
as brokers and dealers, their activities generally are subject to
the antifraud
provrsions of the secunttes
Act and the Sec unties Exchange Act.7Â°

Whisky Interests
On January 7, 1974, the Comrnlssron
in
coordination
with the Office of Consumer
Affairs, Issued a release on Investment
In
18

whisky
Interests?'
The release was designed to warn the American public of the
dangers
of investing
in Scotch Whisky
stored In casks In Scotland
and held for
promised
capital gains over a four-year
penod. The release stated that the sales of
such Interests were usually made under
such circumstances
as to bring them within
the definition
of the term "security"
in the
Federal secuntles laws. The release further
advised that many false and misleading
statements were made In the promotion
of
such Interests. The release pointed out that,
among other things, promoters promised a
20-25 percent return per annum, made no
disclosure
regarding
the quality
of the
whisky sold, failed to state that the price of
the whisky sold to Americans was far in excess of the normal market price in Great
Bntain (sometimes 100 percent in excess of
that pnce) and that the relatively limited
quantities of whisky sold to indivrdual investors often make resale very difficult.72

Significant

Cases

u.s. v, Stanley Goldblum.73-ln connection with one of the largest and most shockIng frauds In recent years, 22 individuals
associated with Equity Funding Corporation
of America were Indicted
Basically,
defendants
were alleged
to have created
trctrtrous life Insurance pohcies which were
then sold to other Insurance
companies
for Immediate
cash. The indictment
also
charges that bank documents,
secunties
purchase
confirmations
and bonds were
counterfeited
for the purpose
of falsely
portraying the income and assets of Equity
Funding. The indictment
alleges that this
false financial picture was Instrumental
In
Increasing
the market
price of Equity
Funding stock and in assisting Equity FundIng's efforts to borrow money, make suecussful debenture offerings
and conclude
mergers.
Thirteen of the 22 defendants pled gUilty
to various counts of the indictment.
The
case is scheduled for trial as to the remainIng defendants
in fiscal year 1975.

National Student Marketing Corporation
(NSMCj14-0n January 17, 1974, a Federal
Grand Jury in the Southern District of New
York returned a 14-count Indictment
nam-

ing, among others, Cortes W. Randell, the
former President of NSMC, and Bernard J.
Kurek, its former chief accounting officer,
Robert C Bushnell and Dennis M. Kelly,
former salesmen and executives of NSMC
and John G. Davies, formerly its chief internal counsel They were alleged to have conspired to violate the Federal mail and wire
fraud statutes, antifraud provisions of the
secunnes Act and Securities Exchange Act
and filing provisions of the Securrtres Exchange Act, in connection with the Issuance
In 1968 and 1969 of false and misleading
financial statements and reports concernIng the assets and earnings of NSMC.
The indictment also charges Anthony M.
Natelli, a partner In the firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., outside auditors for
NSMC, Joseph Scansaroll,
a former employee of that firm, Randell, Kelly, Bushnell
and Kurek, with making false and misleadIng statements In a proxy statement filed
with the Commission in mld-1969.
The indictment
charges that In March
1968, Randell and the four former employees of NSMC began a fraudulent scheme for
recording income and assets on the financial statements of the corporation
with respect to "contracts In progress," although
they knew the income and assets resulting
from those contracts
were largely nonexistent, and that Randell used false reports of
the corporation's sales, earnings and future
prospects in attempting to Induce financial
institutions,
pnvate investors,
and the
shareholders
of acquisition
candidates to
accept NSMC stock for money, property
and securities. According to the indictment,
shareholders of NSMC received an annual
report for the company containing misleading financial statements for the fiscal year
ended August 31, 1968 and misleading
interim reports for subsequent penods.
In connection with the sale of more than
2,000,000 shares of NSMC stock In late
1969, Randell IS alleged to have failed to
disclose that NSMC's Internal youth marketing division had operated at a loss during
the fiscal year ended August 31, 1969 and
was being substantially
disbanded;
that
published reports and projections of substantial earnings by the corporation
were
based in large part on the earnings of other
companies
acquired
by the corporation

after August 31, 1969; that pnor favorable
reports as to the corporation's
sales and
earnings had been based In part on nonexistent contracts; and that unfavorable accountmg adjustments had been made to the
sales and earnings figures which had been
reported
previously
for the year ended
August 31, 1968 and for the nine-month
penod ended May 31, 1969.
The Indictment also alleges that the stock
of NSMC was manipulated from ItS Initial
offenng price of $6 per share to $70 per
share (after a 2 for 1 stock split). Finally the
indictment charges that Randell, Bushnell
and Kelly profited from the sale of their
NSMC stock dunng 1969 and that Randell,
individually,
made $3,000,000 on the sale
of hrs stock dunng 1969
In carrying out the conspiracy, Randell,
Bushnell and Kelly are alleged to have used
forged letters purporting
to be commitments from the Pontiac DIVISion of the General Motors Corporation, Eastern Air Lines
and Amencan Air Lines to purchase National Student Marketing services
S.E.C
v. Amertcen
ShIpbuIlding
Apn11974, the Commission
Company75-ln
sued American Shipbuilding
and ItS chief
executive officer, George M. Steinbrenner
III, for having failed to disclose In documents filed With the Commission and to ItS
shareholders, as allegedly required by the
Securities
Exchange Act, that corporate
funds were being used for illegal contnbutions to political campaigns
This action
was the first one instituted by the Commission making such allegations.
S.E.C v. U.S. Financial, Inc. (USF); In the
February
Matter of Touche Ross & Co.-On
25,1974, the Commission, In major related
actions, (1) filed suit in the United States
Court for the Southern District of California
against USF, ItS former chairman, president, special outside secuntres counsel,
and four purchasers of USF's assets, allegIng the issuance and filing by USF of false
reports.?" and (2) censured
financial
Touche Ross & Co and Imposed certain
other remedial sanctions on it, in connection With ItS audits of USF for the years 1970
and 1971 77
The court action charged defendants With
having schemed to publish financial statements reflecting ncnnous earnings of mil19

lions of dollars for USF from 1969 through
1972 by causing USF to engage in purportedly arm's length transactions
with purchasers of USF properties who were in fact
nominees of USF (and In some Instances
nominees of USF's former chairman)
Pursuant to the alleged scheme, the purchasers
obtained down payments either directly or
indirectly through loans or loan guarantees
furnished by USF or USF's chairman who
pledged hrs own USF common stock as security for the bank loans. USF also continued to bear the nsks of ownership of the
properties
through
secret guarantees
against loss. USF's funds were also alledgedly diverted to the purported
purchasers to fund their repayments to USF
and USF's former chairman. USF and one of
the alleged purchaser-nominees
consented
to the Issuance of permanent Injunctions.
The matter IS stili pending as to USF's
former chairman, president, special counsel and three alleged nominees.
As to Touche Ross, the Commission
found that the firm had failed to obtain suffrorent Independent evidence and supporting materials to support ItS protessronal
opinion In regard to the phony purchases of
USF properties and that Touche had failed
to appraise fully the significance of information known to It and to extend sufflcrently ItS
auditing
procedures
under conditions
which called for great professional skepticism. Touche Ross consented to the findIngs and sanctions Without admitting ordenYlng the charges
S E.C. v Robert L. Vesco, and IDS Ltd.7BAs a direct result of the Commission's suit
against Robert Vesco, IDS Ltd. and others
filed in November 1972, liqurdators have
been appointed outside the United States
for IDS Ltd, Transglobal Financial Services
Ltd , and Fund of Funds Ltd. The Commission has been cooperating With the hqurdators In their efforts to protect and reclaim
the assets of the various funds Involved.
Lawsuits have been filed by the Special
Counsel to International
Controls Corp.,
appointed
by the U.S. Federal Court,
against Vesco and others to reclaim money
allegedly misappropriated
from the company.ln addition, two of the funds have filed
SUitSasserting claims for monies they assert

20

were fraudulently
misappropriated
from
them.
A committee
of regulatory
authorities
from the United States, Canada, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands Antillies has
been established which is overseeing the
actlvrtres of the vanous liquidators. In the
meantime, the Commission's suit is being
pursued.
S.E.C. v. Westgate-Callforma
Corp.79This case involved the allegedly fraudulent
inflation of earnings of this public company
by C. Arnholt Smith and others through control and misuse of the assets of United States
National Bank of San Diego. The alleged
scheme consisted in part of effecting purported
sales of Westgate's
assets to
nominees at grossly Inflated prices. The
nominees paid the purchase prices with
money from loans by United States National
Bank arranged and approved by Smith. As a
result of the conduct Involved In this case,
both Westgate-California
and United States
National Bank went bankrupt. The bankruptcy of the bank lnvolvrnq over $400 million In loans of doubtful collectability, was
the largest ever of a national bank In the
United States.
During the past year, Judgments of injunction by consent were entered against all
of the defendants.s? Defendant Smith was
:urther ordered to resign as an officer or
director of all public companies of which he
was then acting. More recently, the United
States Attorney in San Diego obtained indictments against Smith and Philip A. Toft,
another defendant in the Commission's action, relating In part to their conduct With
respect to Westgate-California
and United
States National Bank

....PART 2
THE DISCLOSURE SYSTEM

PART 2
THE DISCLOSURE SYSTEM

A basic purpose of the Federal securities
laws is to provide disclosure of material financial and other information on companies seeking to raise capital through the
public offering of their securities, as well as
companies whose securities are already
publicly held. This alms at enabling investors to evaluate the securities of these companies on an informed and realistic basis.
The Securities Act of 1933 generally requires that before securities may be offered
to the public a registrationstatementmust be
filed with the Commission disclosing prescribed categories of information. Before
the sale of securities can begin, the registration statement must become "effective." In
the sales, investors must be furnished a
prospectus containing the most significant
information in the registration statement.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934
deals in large part with secunties already
outstanding and requires the registration of
securities listed on a national securities exchange, as well as over-the-counter securities in which there is a substantial public
interest. Issuers of registered securities
must file annual and other periodic reports
designed to provide a public file of current
material information. The Exchange Act
also requires disclosure of material information to holders of registered securities In
solicitations of proxies for the election of
directors or approval of corporate action at
a stockholders' meeting, or in attempts to
acquire control of a company through a
tender offer or other planned stock acquisition. It provides that insiders of companies

whose equity securities are registered must
report their holdings and transactions in all
equity securities of their companies.

PUBUC OFFERING: THE 1933
SECURITIES ACT
The basic concept underlying the Securities Act's registration requirements is full
disclosure. The Commission has no authorrty to passon the merits of the securities
to be offered or on the fairness of the terms
of distribution. If adequate and accurate
disclosure ISmade. it cannot deny registration. The Act makes it unlawful to represent
to investors that the Commission has approved or otherwise passed on the merits of
registered securities.

Information

Provided

While the Securities Act specifies the information to be included In registration
statements, the Commission has the authority to prescribe appropriate forms and to
vary the particular items of information required to be disclosed. To facilitate the registration of securities by different types of
issuers, the Commission has adopted specral registration forms which vary In their
disclosure requirements so as to provide
maximum disclosure of the essential facts
pertinent in a given type of offering while at
the same time rrururniztnq the burden and
expense of compliance with the law. In recent years, It has adoped certain short
forms, notably Forms 5-7 and S-16, which
25

do not require disclosure of matters already
covered in reports and proxy material filed
or distributed
under provisions of the Securities Exchange Act.

the remaining 2,690 statements, the median
number of calendar days between the date
of the onginal filing and the effective date
was 36.

Reviewing Process

Financial Analysis and
Examination

Registration
statements
filed with the
Commission are examined by Its Division of
Corporation
Finance for compliance with
the standards of adequate and accurate
disclosure. Various degrees of review procedures are employed
by the Division.'
While most deficiencies
are corrected
through an informal letter of comment procedure, where the Commission finds that
matenal representations
In a registration
statement are misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete, It may, after notice and opportunity for hearmg, issue a "stop-order"
suspending the effectiveness of the statement.

Time for Registration
The Commission's staff tries to complete
examination of registration statements as
quickly as possrble. The secunnes Act provides that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th day after It ISfiled
(or on the 20th day after the filing of any
amendment). Most registration statements
require one or more amendments and do
not become effective until some time after
the statutory 20-day penod. The period between fllmg and effective date ISmtended to
give Investors an opportunity
to become
familiar with the proposed offenng through
the drsserrunatron of the preliminary form of
prospectus. The Commission can accelerate the effective date to shorten the 20-day
waiting
period-taking
Into account,
among other thmgs, the adequacy of the
Information on the Issuer already available
to the public and the ease with which facts
about the offering can be understood.
During the 1974 fiscal year 2,888 registration statements became effective Of these,
198 were amendments filed by mvestment
companies pursuant to Section 24(e) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, which
provides for the registration of additional
securities through amendment to an effective registration statement rather than the
filmg of a new registration statement
For
26

During the fiscal year, the Office of the
Chief Financial Analyst of the Division of
Corporation Finance conducted reviews of
real estate mvestment trusts ("REITs") and
the airline industry. The principal objective
of the reviews was to provide a basis for
more Uniform and effective staff examination of disclosure documents filed with the
Commission by companies in the selected
industnes. The review of REITs was signaled by the deterioration
in earnings and
liquidity levels occasioned by high cost of
capital on the one hand, and declining
portfolio Yields on the other. The review of
the airlme industry indicated
rising fuel
costs, difficulties in securing outside capital
funds, the negative effect of fare increases
on effective utilization of existmq seat capacity, and other problems attributable to
sudden changes in the economic climate at
the end of 1973.
Late in the fiscal year, additional reviews
were initiated for two other industrieselectnc and gas utilities, and bank holding
companies. Generally, priority for review is
given to those industries most directly affected
by significant
changes
in the
economic environment.
The Office of the Chief Financial Analyst
also IS developing a system which Will collect, correlate and interpret data to assist It
In detecting
Significant
Impairment
of
liquidity of registrants In all industries. The
system is intended to identify specific companies which have experienced
events
suggestmg a likelihood of future financial
difficulties
The system will entail a review of
ratios and tinancral relationships within the
tolerances of industry standards, qualified
accountants' opinions, changes in auditors,
late filings, declines in backlog, reductions
or orrussrons of cash dividends, excessive
amounts of debt maturing In a current or
subsequent penod, proposed recapitalizations, substantial declines In fixed charges
coverage, discontinuance
of certain opera-

tions, changes in line of business, writedowns, excessive amounts of non-earning
assets and dividends paid out of capital.
Where appropriate, the staff may ask a particular company about the need for
additional public disclosure.

Investment

Company

Disclosure

The Division of Corporation Finance has
continued to monitor the procedures instituted in September 19722 to expedite the
processing of investment company posteffective amendments. It has found that the
procedures have benefited both registrants
and the staff by avoiding delays and by
eliminating substantial numbers of "eleventh hour comments". The Division also
continued to work on recommendations for
a simplified prospectus and a new registration form to supplant those presently in
use.3
The past fiscal year has seen a growing
number of investment company mergers
due to declining sales, increasing redemptions, declining assets and increasing
costs, all of which have made the operation
of many smaller funds unprofitable. A novel
merger involved the merger of Surveyor
Fund, a closed-end fund, into the Eberstadt
Fund, Inc., an open-end fund.
A recent development has been the appearance of funds which tie their investment objectives to shifts in the market. The
objectives of these funds are to increase
sharholders' capital during periods of
stock market strength and to preserve it during periods of stock market weakness. The
switch from the growth objective to the
preservation objective is usually made
when appropriate in the judgment of management, although at least one fund (Pilgrim Formula Share's Inc.) revises its investment objective according to formula.
One response to high interest rates has
been a rapid growth in the number of registered money market funds. These funds invest in money market instruments (e.g. certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances,
U.S Treasury bills, and commercial paper)
maturing in one year or less. The growth in
sales of money market fund shares contrasts with an abrupt drop in the registration
of shares of tax exempt municipal bond

funds from $402 million in fiscal 1973 to
$319.4 million in fiscal 1974. A partial response to the increased offerings by money
market funds has been the registration of
funds in which the payment of bond prlncipal and interest on the bonds in the portfolio
of the funds is guaranteed by an independent company.

Office of Oil and Gas
The Division's Office of Oil and Gas has
processing responsibility for all oil and gas
drilling program filings, as well as filings on
Form 5-10 covering fractional undivided
interests in oil and gas rights. Eighty-four
registration statements were filed during
fiscal 1974for oil and gas drilling programs,
totaling $819 million. Seventeen registration statements covering fractional undivided interests in oil and gas rights were
filed aggregating $12.7 million.
In addition to the direct processing of
those filings the Office of Oil and Gas IS
responsible for reviewing the disclosure relating to the oil and gas business and properties, including data on production and reserves of oil and gas, contained in other
filings directly processed by the several
branches of the Division of Corporation FInance.ln fiscal 1974,such other filings consisted of 115 registration statements under
the Securities Act of 1933 and 18 offering
circulars pursuant to the Regulation A
exemption thereunder, as well as registration statements and proxy statements under
the Secunties Exchange Act of 1934.
Additional information regarding offerings of fractional undivided interests is contained under Regulation B in this Part.

Tax Shelters
During the year, a significant number of
registration statements relating to real estate limited partnerships and other tax shelter offerings were filed with the Commission. All registration statements relating to
real estate limited partnerships were processed by one branch within the Divisron of
Corporation Finance, while registration
statements relating to other non-oil and gas
types of tax shelters, such as cattle feeding
and breeding, agri-buslness, and leasing, as
27

well as condominium offerings, were processed in a separate branch. A third branch,
the Office of 011 and Gas, has processing
responsibility for tax shelters relating to 011
and gas.
In all of these types of offerings, the disclosure generally emphasized has Included
the compensation paid to the program
sponsors, the conflicts of Interest Inherent
in many such offerings, the record in prior
offerings of the sponsors of the offering,
and the tax ramifications of the offering.
See the discussion in Part 1 under the
heading "Real Estate Matters" for a descnptlon of developments relating to real
estate tax shelters.

Commercial

Paper-Filing

Fees

On February 1, 1974, the Commission
amended Rule 457 under the Securities Act"
which sets forth the method by which the
registration fee required by Section 6(b) of
the Act is calculated The amendment
provides that the fee for registenng both
commercial paper exempt from registration
under Section 3(a)(3) of the Act, together
with non-exempt commercial paper, ISto be
calculated only on the basis of the total
amount of non-exempt commercial paper.
The Rule before amended required that the
fee be paid upon the aggregate amount of
exempt and non-exempt commercial paper.
Thrs resulted in inordinately high registration costs which tended to discourage the
registration of commercial paper.

Registration

Summary Rule

In September 1973, the Oomrnrssron
adopted Rule 458 under the Securities Act,
to require any company filing any registration statement under the Act, with certain
exceptions, to provide In a letter (not part of
the registration statement) a one-paragraph
summary containing specrned information
about the offering. This summary will be
published In the SECNews Digest, as notice
of the registration staternent," The summaries in the Digest are Intended to promote the dissemination of public information concerning proposed offers of secuntles, By requiring that offerors draft the
summary paragraph, the Commission an28

ticipates more complete descriptions in the
Digest and savings in staff time.

SMALL ISSUE EXEMPTION
The Oomrnlssron is authorized under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act to exempt
securities from registration If it finds that
registration for these securities is not
necessary to the public Interest because of
the small offering amount or limited character of the public offering. The law imposes a
maximum limitation of $500,000 upon the
size of the issues which may be exempted
by the Commission.
The Oornrnlssron had adopted the following exemptive rules and requlations:"
Regulation A. General exemption for
U.S. and Canadian issues up to
$500,000.
Regulation B. Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas
rights up to $250,000.
Regulation E' Exemption for securities of a small business investment company up to $500,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for
assessable stock offered or sold to
realize the amount of assessmentup
to $300,000
Rules234-237 Exemptions of first lien
notes,securities of cooperative housIng corporations, shares offered In
connection with certain transactions
and certain securities owned for five
years.

Regulation A
Regulation A permItSa company to obtain
needed capital not In excess of $500,000
(including underwriting comrrussrons)
In
anyone year from a public offering of its
securities Without registration, provided
specified conditions are met. Among other
things, a notification and offering Circular
supplying basic information about the
company and the securities offered must be
filed With the Oornrrussron and the offering
circular must be used in the offering. In
addition, Regulation A permits selling
shareholders not in a control relationship

with the issuer to offer in the aggregate up
to $300,000 of securities which would not be
included m computing the issuer's $500,000
ceiling.
During the 1974 fiscal year, 438 notifications were filed under Regulation A, covering proposed offerings
of $147,779,248
compared with 817 notifications
covering
proposed offerings of $298 million in the
prior year. A total of 869 reports of sales
were filed reporting
aggregate sales of
$69,664,554. Such reports must be filed
every SIX months while an offering is in
progress and upon its termination
Sales
reported during 1973 had totaled $106 million. Various features of Regulation A offerings over the past three years are presented
In the statistical section of this report.
In fiscal 1974, the Commission temporarily suspended 21 exemptions where it had
reason to believe there had been noncompliance With the conditions ofthe Regulation or With disclosure
standards,
or
where the exemption was not available for
the sscuntres. Added to 18 cases pending at
the beginning of the fiscal year, this resulted
m a total of 39 cases for disposition
Of
these the temporary suspension order became permanent in 22 cases: rn 11 by lapse
of time, m 5 cases after hearings, and In 6 by
acceptance of an offer of settlement. No
temporary suspension orders were vacated
Seventeen cases were pend mg at the end of
the fiscal year.

Litigation Involving Regulation

A

In Koss v S E C.,7 the United States Distnct
Court for the Southern District of New York
was asked by a secuntres underwriting firm
and ItS president, to review certain letters of
comment sent by the Commission's staff to
companies that proposed to make public
offerings of their securities through the
plaintiff-underwriter
In those letters, the
staff had requested the issuers to disclose
In their offering circulars the fact that the
plaintiffs were respondents in an administrative proceedmg
pending
before the
Cornmlssron, The plaintiffs asked the court
to restrain the Oornrnlssron from directing
issuers to mclude such Information In their
offering circulars.
The court ruled, as the Commission had

argued, that the case was not "ripe" for
Judicial review and accordingly
granted
summary Judgment m favor of the Commission The court noted that the staff comment letters contained only informal advice,
were only advisory In nature and did not
represent the views of the Cornrmssron. The
court did in ItS opinion state that the fact of
the pendency of an administrative proceedIng against an underwriter of securities was
material to purchasers of those securities.
In Scientronic Corporeuon v. S.E.C.8 the
issuer of securities sought review In the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Crrcurt of a letter to It from the Commission's Washington Regional Office to the
effect that financial statements in its offermg circular relating to a proposed Regulation A offering must comply With generally
accepted accountmg
principles.
In addition, petitioner sought to overrule the action taken by the Commission's Chief Accountant With regard to ItS "petition"
directed to the Cornrrussroners, dealmg With
accounting for research and development
and other matters. Finally, petitioner asked
the court to compel the Commission to take
affirmative action to revise ItS rules to permit certain proposed accountmg methods
to be used in financial statements.
In moving to drsrruss the petition and to
drsrruss as scandalous portions of a document filed by petitioner with the court, the
Comrnlsston
urged that petitioner had not
yet exhausted ItS administrative
remedies
In effect, petitioner was asking the court to
determine that it should be permitted to
utilize the Regulation A exemption from registration for ItS proposed bond Issue, when
the Oornrnrssron had not yet made a fmal
determination
regarding the suspension of
the exemption. The Commission also urged
that even If petitioner had a right at that
pomt to [udlcral review of the actions of
which it complamed, the right of review
would not be in a court of appeals
On February 21, 1974, the court of appeals dismissed the petition and struck as
scandalous portions of the document filed
by petitioner, of which the Commission had
complained.
In Tabby's tnterneuonet Inc. v. S.E.C.,9
the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit affirmed per curtem an order
29

Issued by the Commission which permanently suspended the Regulation A exemption of a 1969 offering by Tabby's International, Inc. The court of appeals stated that
Its affirmance was based upon the Commission's opinion which the court attached as
an appendix to its own oplruon.'?
In the Commission proceeding, the parties stipulated that Tabby's had not been
aware of the manipulative activities of its
underwriter, which were the cause of the
suspension. Tabby's argued that in view of
this factor, the public mterest would not be
served by suspending Tabby's, Regulation A
exemption and possibly exposing Tabby's
to civil and criminal sanctions for violation
of the Securities Act registration provisions
In ItS opinion, the Commission stated that
the Regulation A exemption is available
only where there ISstrict compliance with the
conditions of that exemption and suspension of the exemption ISappropriate where
these conditions are not met, whether or not
the issuer is at fault.
The Commission further stated that suspension of the exemption is not a penalty
but rather serves the remedial purpose of
protecting Investors by making the safeguards of a registration statement a prerequisite for any further public offering of the
securities either by the Issuer or the underwriter where there has been a failure to
adhere to the exemption's conditions. The
Commission noted that the issuer could
seek relief from these consequences under
Rule 252(f) of Regulation A.

Regulation

B

Regulation B provides an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act
for public offerings of fractional undivided
interests In 011 and gas rights where the initial amount to be raised does not exceed
$250,000, provided certain conditions are
met. An offering sheet disclosing certain
basic and material information of such offering must be filed with the Commission.
Copies of the final offering sheet must be
furnished to prospective purchasers at least
48 hours in advance of sale of these securities.
Form 5-10 ISavailable for the registration
of fractional undiVided interests In oil and
30

gas rights where the initial amount to be
raised exceeds $250,000 or where the
exemption is unavailable for any other reason.
During the 1974 fiscal year, 625 offering
sheets and 751 amendments thereto were
filed pursuant to Regulation B and were examined by the Office of Oil and Gas of the
Divrsron of Corporation Finance. Sales during 1974 under these offerings aggregated
$29.1 million. During the 1973 fiscal year,
725 offering sheets and 1,020 amendments
were filed covering aggregate sales of $19.9
million. For the fiscal year 1972, 1,124 offerIng sheets were filed with 1,259 amendments thereto, covering aggregate sales of
$21.1 million.
In fiscal 1974, the Oomrnlssron temporarily suspended the Regulation B exemption
for one offeror where It had evidence that
the offeror had failed to meet certain standards and requirements. The suspension became permanent later that year when the
offeror withdrew its request for a hearing. In
the prior fiscal year there were two temporary suspensions of the Regulation B
exemption. one of which was vacated and
the other became permanent.

Litigation Involving

RegUlation

B

In Olympic Petroleum Corporation

v.

S.E.C.11 a corporation which had filed Regu-

lation B papers with the Commission,
brought an action In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a judgment declaring that it had complied with the requirements of the Commission's Regulation B. The plaintiff argued
that a letter from a member of the Commission's staff stating that the documents filed
with the Cornmissron did not appear to
comply with Regulation B constituted a determination by the Commission and was
therefore reviewable agency action. The
Commission argued, inter alia, that there
had been no determination
by the
Commission-as
distinguished from. its
staff-and, therefore, there was no reviewable agency action, and that Olymprc had
failed to exhaust ItS administrative remedies.
In an order dated November 8, 1973,
based solely upon the pleadings, the district

court dismissed the complaint for failure to
exhaust administrative
remedies. The suit
was also dismissed as moot since Olympic
had completed the offerings which were the
subject matter of the suit. On January 4,
1974, Olympic appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.12
The appeal had not been decided at the
close of the fiscal year

Regulation

E

Under Section 3(c) of the Securities Act,
the Commission is authorized to adopt rules
and regulations
exempting
securities
issued by a small business Investment company under the Small BUSiness Investment
Act. Pursuant to that section, the Commission has adopted Regulation E, which conditionally exempts such securities issued by
companies registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 up to a maximum offering price of $500,000. The regulation
IS
substantially
similar to Regulation
A, described above. No notifications
were filed
under Regulation
E for the two preceding
fiscal years

Regulation

F

Regulation
F provides exemptions
from
registration
for two types of transactions
concerning
assessable stock. First, an assessment levied upon an existing security
holder may be exempted under the regulation, provided the assessable stock is issued by a corporation
Incorporated
under
the laws of and having its principal business
operations in any State, Territory or the District of Columbia. Regulation F provides an
exemption
also when assessable stock of
any such corporation
is sold publicly to
realize the amount of an assessment levied
thereon, orwhen such stock is publicly reoffered by an underwriter
or dealer. The
exemption
is available for amounts not exceeding $300,000 per year. The Regulation
requires the filing of a notification
and other
materials describing
the offering.
During the 1974 fiscal year, 12 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of stock of $408,652, compared with 15 notifications
covering
assessments of $408,374 in 1973.

Proposed Rule 239: Residential
First Lien Mortgages
On September 6, 1973, the Cornmissron
published
for comment
proposed
Securities Act Rule 239,13 which under certain
conditions would have provided an exemption pursuant to Section 3(b) of the Act from
registration under the Act, for certain promISSOry notes directly secured by first lien
mortgages
on residential
real estate. The
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
had requested adoption of the Rule as appropriate to help it to implement
ItS Congressional mandate to create a liquid secondary market In residentlal mortgages. On
May 23, 1974,14 the comrntssron Withdrew
the Rule from further consideration

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE: THE
1934 SECURITIES EXCHANGE

ACT
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 contains significant
disclosure
provlsrons deSigned to provide a fund of current material
information
on companies
in whose securities there IS a substantial public Interest.
The Act also seeks to assure that security
holders who are sohcrted to exercise their
In
voting rights, or to sell their securities
response to a tender offer, are furnished
pertinent information

Registration

on Exchanges

Generally speaking, a security cannot be
traded on a national secunties exchange
until it is registered under Section 12(b) of
the Exchange Act. If it meets the listing requirernents
of the particular exchange, an
issuer may register a class of securities on
the exchange by filing with the Commission
and the exchange an application which discloses pertinent
Information
concerning
the issuer and its affairs. DUring fiscal year
1974, a total of 225 issuers listed and registered secuntres on a national secuntles exchange for the first time and a total of 434
registration
applications
were filed. The
registrations
of all securities of 218 issuers
were terminated.
Detailed statistics regarding secuntles traded on exchanges may be
found in the statistical section.
31

Over-the-Counter

Registration

Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act requires a company with total assets exceeding $1 million and a class of equity securities held of record by 500 or more persons to register those secunties with the
Commission. unless one of the exemptions
set forth In that section IS available or the
Commission
Issues an exemptive
order
under Section 12(h). Upon registration. the
reporting
and other disclosure
requirements and the insider trading provisions of
the Act apply to these companies to the
same extent as to those with securities registered on exchanges.

statements were filed under Section 12(g).
Of these. 342 were filed by Issuers already
subject to the reporting
requirements.

registered on an exchange or they had registered securmes under the Securities Act.
Included are companies which succeeded
to the businesses of reporting companies.
and thereby became subject to the reportIng requirements

ments under the Securrtres Act which have
become effective. From time to time. the
Commission has Issued statements calling
attention to registrants' obligation to report
current events and explaining procedures
to be followed in certain unusual types of
situations. For example. see the discussion
In Part I concerning Fuel Shortages. Extractive Reserves and Natural Gas Supplies.
In 1974. 53.298 reports-annual.
quarterly
and current-were
filed.
One of the reports which certain Issuers
must file ISa quarterly report on Form 10-0.
On December 12. 1973. the Commission
published a release15 consisting generally
of a compilation of the views and comments
of the DIvision of Corporation Finance as to
questions frequently raised by public companies and as to problems and deficiencies
frequently encountered by the staff, during
the three years since Form 10-0 was
adopted. It was pornted out in the Release
that generally speaking, the majority of the
denciencres in Form 10-0 were the result of
failures to examine closely and comply with
the general Instructions to the form and the
speciftc Instructions to the items contained
therein.

Exemptions
Section 12(h) of the Act authorizes the
Commission to grant a complete or partial
exemption from the registration provisions
of Section 12(g) or from other disclosure
and insider trading provrsions of the Act
where It is not contrary to the public interest
or the protection of investors.
At the beginning of the year. 18 exemption applications
were pending. and 9 applications were filed dunng the year Of
these 27 applications. 6 were withdrawn. 11
were granted. and 0 denied. The remaining
10 applications were pending at the end of
the fiscal year.

Periodic Reports
Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act
requires issuers of secunties
registered
pursuant to Sections 12(b) and 12(g) to file
periodic reports. keeping current the information contained in the registration application or statement. Similar reports are required pursuant to Section 15(d) of certain
issuers which have filed registration state32

Where proxies are soncrted from holders
of secuntres registered under Section 12 or
from secunty holders of registered pubhcutility holding companies. subsidiaries

on which the security holders were asked to
vote, and that they be afforded an opportunity to vote "yes" or "no" on any matter
other than the election of directors. Where
management ISsoliciting proxies, a security
holder desinng to communicate
with the
other security holders may require management to furnish him with a list of all security holders or to mail his communication
for him. A secunty holder may also. subject
to certain limitations, require the management to include In proxy material an appropnate proposal which he wants to submit to
a vote of security holders, or he may make
an Independent proxy solicitation.

Copies of proposed proxy material must
be filed with the Commission
in preliminary
form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation. Where preliminary
material fails to
meet the prescribed
disclosure
standards,
the management
or other group responsible for Its preparation
is notified Informally
and given an opportunity
to correct the deficiencies in the preparation of the definitive
proxy material to be furnished
to security
holders.
Issuers of securities
registered
under
Section 12 must transmit
an information
statement comparable
to proxy material to
security holders from whom proxies are not
solrcrted with respect to a stockholders'
meeting.
DUring the 1974 fiscal year, 6,757 proxy

In addition,
126 mtormatron

statements related to 6,645 companies, and
pertained to 6,615 meetings for the election
of directors,
222 special meetings not involvmq the election of directors, and 30 assents and authorizations.
ASide from the election of directors, the
votes of security holders were solicited with
respect to a variety of matters, including

DUring the 1974 fiscal year, 434 proposals
submitted by 69 stockholders
for action at
stockholders'
meetings were included
in
the proxy statements
of 227 companies.
Typical of such proposals submitted
to a
vote of security holders were resolutions on
amendments
to charters

to
provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors, preemptive
rights, limitations on the grant of stock options to and

their exercise by key employees and management
groups,
the sending
of a post

and limitations on charitable contributions.
A total of 161 proposals submitted by 78
stockholders
were omitted from the proxy
statements of 71 companies in accordance
with the provisions
of the rule governing
such
proposals.
The
most
common
grounds for omission were that proposals
were not submitted
on time or were not
proper subjects
for stockholders'
action
under the applicable state law.
In fiscal 1974, 15 companies
were involved In proxy contests for the election of
directors which bring speciat requirements
into play. In these contests, 398 persons,
Including both management
and non management, filed detailed statements required
of participants
under the applicable
rule.
Control of the board of directors was involved in 14 instances
In 5 of these, management retained control. Of the remainder,
three were settled by negotiation,
four were
won by non management
persons, and two
were pending at year end. Management
retained all places on the board In the one

Litigation on Proxy Rules
In Kixmitter v. S E.C. ,16 the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed a petition to review a
no-action determination
informally given to
a corporation
by the staff of the Commission as well as the Oornrrussron's purported
affirmance of that determination,
in declining to review the staff's position. The court
held that where the Commission
has refused to review informal staff advice or to
express ItS own informal views on the matterthere does not exist any "order issued by
17 that a court of appeals
the Commission"
has [unsdlctton
to review. The court distinguished the situation involved in Kixmiller
from that in Medical Committee for Human
Rights v. S.E.C.,18 noting that "Medical
Committee Involved a no-action ruling by
the staff which
was sanctioned
by the
"
Commission
....
The court did not decrde whether
the
Commission
erred in refusing to deal with
33

petitioner's claim since, in any event, it was
"not at liberty to override" the Commislion's decision. An agency's decision to refrain from an investigation or an enforcement action was thought to be "generally
unreviewable." As to the Commission, the
specifications
of the Securities
Exchange Act "leave no doubt on that score."
The court found nothing arbitrary about the
Commission's policy (as described in 17
CFR 202.1d) not to involve itself in staff activity, as applied in the instant case. "It is for
the Commission to initially draw the line on
administrative review of staff decisions in
this area, and we cannot say that its regulation has done so unreasonably." [footnotes
omitted].

Takeover Bids, Large
Acquisitions
Sections 13(d) and (e), and 14(d), (e) and
(f) of the Securities Exchange Act, enacted

in 1968 and amended in 1970, provide for
full disclosure in cash tender offers and
other stock acquisitions involving changes
in ownership or control. These provisions
were designed to close gaps in the full disclosure provisions of the securities laws
and to safeguard the interest of persons
who tender their securities in response to a
tender offer.
During the 1974 fiscal year, 953 Schedule
130 reports were filed by persons or groups
which had made acquisitions resulting in
their ownership of more than five percent of
a class of securities. One hundred five
Schedule 130 reports were filed by persons
or groups making tender offers, which, if
successful, would result in more than five
percent ownership. In addition, 45 Schedule 140 reports were filed on solicitations or
recommendations in a tender offer by a person other than the maker of the offer. Five
statements were filed for the replacement of
a majority of the board of directors otherwise than by stockholder vote. Four statements were filed under a rule on corporate
reacquisitions of securities while an issuer
is the target of a cash tender offer.

Insider Reporting
Section 16 ofthe Securities Exchange Act
and corresponding proVisions in the Public
34

Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and the
Investment Company Act of 1940 are designed to provide other stockholders and
investors generally with information on insider securities transactions and holdings,
and to prevent unfair use of confidential
information by insiders to profit from shortterm trading in a company's securities.
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires every person who beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent
of any class of eq uity security which is registered under Section 12, or who is a director
or an officer ofthe issuer of any such security, to file statements with the Commission
disclosing the amount of all equity securities ofthe issuer of which he is the beneficial owner and changes in such ownership. Copies of such statements must be
filed with exchanges on which the securities are listed. Similar provisions applicable to insiders of registered public-utility
holding companies and registered closedend investment companies are contained in
the Holding Company and Investment
Company Acts.
In fiscal 1974, 116,110 ownership reports
were filed. These included 17,646 initial
statements of ownership on Form 3, 93,338
statements of changes in ownership on
Form 4, and 5,126 amendments to previously filed reports.
All ownership reports are made available
for public inspection when filed at the
Commission's office in Washington and at
the exchanges where copies are filed. In
addition, the information contained in reports filed with the Commission is summarized and published in the monthly "Official Summary of security Transactions
and Holdings," which is distributed by the
Government Printing Office to about 11,500
subscribers.

Short-Swing Trading Utigation
In Gold v. Sloan ,19 the CommiSSion filed a
brief, amicus curiae, in which it urged that
the defendants' acquisitions of securities
pursuant to a corporate merger were "purchases" of those securities for purposes of
Section 16(b) of the securities Exchange
Act. That section generally provides that an
issuer whose securities are registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Ex-

change Act or Itsshareholders suing derivatively, may recover the profits realized by an
officer, director or beneficial owner of more
than 10 percent of any class of the corporation's equity securities upon his "purchase
and sale" (or "sale and purchase") of such
securities of the issuer if the two transactions occur within a six-month period. The
defendants who had been shareholders of
the corporation acquired in the merger as a
result of the merger became shareholders
of the acquiring corporation. In addition,
they assumed positions as either officers or
directors of the acquiring corporation.
Within the six months of the merger they
sold some of the shares they had acquired
in the merger.
The Commission urged that the defendants' acquisition of stock in the merger
provided them the opportunity to engage in
the kind of speculative abuse that Section
16(b) was designed to prevent and, therefore, should be held to be within the scope
of that section. The Commission argued
that, contrary to defendant's contention,
their acquisitions could not be viewed as
involuntary. The Commission pointed out
that, even if defendants could not have possessed inside information prior to the
merger, the defendants might have timed
their sales on the basis of post merger, inside information.
In a 2-1 decision, the Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit held that, on the particular facts of the case, the acquisitions in
question were to be deemed purchases only
with respect to one of the defendants. The
court stated that, in determining whether
the "possibility of abuse" test was met, only
those circumstances and events connected
with the merger were relevant. The court
concluded that the test was satisfied only as
to the one defendant who had knowledge
of certain inside information concerning
the merger.
The dissenting judge was of the view that
the majority should have considered the
situation that existed in the post-merger
period, when the defendants were officers
and directors ofthe acquiring company and
presumptively in possession of inside information that would have enabled them to
time their sales. It was precisely this sort of
abuse. the judge argued, that Section 16(b)
was designed to prevent.

ACCOUNTING
The securities acts reflect a recognition
by Congress that dependable financial
statements of a company are indispensable
to informed investment decisions regarding
its securities. A major objective of the
Commission has been to improve accounting, reporting and auditing standards applicable to the financial statements and to assure that high standards of professional
conduct are maintained by the public accountants who examine the statements.
The primary responsibility for this program
rests with the Chief Accountant of the
Commission.
Under the Commission's broad rulemaking power, it has adopted a basic accounting regulation (Regulation 5-X) which, together with opinions on accounting principles published as "Accounting Series Releases," governs the form and content of
financial statements filed under the securities laws. The Commission has also
formulated rules on accounting and auditing of broker-dealers and prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies
subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.The accounting rules and
opinions of the Commission, and its decisions in particular cases, have contributed
to clarification and wider acceptance of the
accounting principles and practices and
auditing standards developed by the profession and generally followed in the preparation of financial statements.
However, the specific accounting rules
and regulations-except for the uniform
systems of accounts which are regulatory
reports-prescribe accounting principles
to be followed only in certain limited areas.
In the large area of financial reporting not
covered by its rules, the Commission's principal means of protecting investors from inadequate or improper financial reporting is
by requiring a report of an independent public accountant, based on an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. which expresses an opinion whether the financial
statements are presented fairly in conformity with accounting principles and practices that are recognized as sound and have
attained general acceptance. The requirement that the opinion be rendered by an
35

independent accountant, which was initially established under the Securities Act of
1933,is designed to secure for the benefit of
public investors the detached objectivity
and the skill of a knowledgeable professional person not connected with management.
The accounting staff reviews the financial
statements filed with the Commission to insure that the required standards are observed and that the accounting and auditing
procedures do not remain static in the face
of changes and new developments in financial and economic conditions.
New
methods of doing business, new types of
business, the combining of old businesses,
the use of more sophisticated securities,
and other innovations create accounting
problems which require a constant reappraisal of the procedures. In fiscal 1974,
work was commenced on a new publication
series to provide information to the public
regarding informal administrative practices
and guidelines developed by the accounting staff with respect to specific accounting
and auditing problems considered in the
review of the financial data filed. The first
issue is expected to be published in the near
future

Relations With the Accounting
Profession
In order to keep abreast of changing conditions, and in recognition of the need for a
continuous exchange of views and information between the Comrnlssron's accounting
staff and outside accountants regarding
approprrate accounting and auditing
pollcies, procedures and practices, the staff
maintains continuing contact with individual accountants and various professional
organizations. The latter include the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB),the principal professional organizations concerned with the
development and improvement of accounting and auditing standards and practices.
The Chief Accountant also meets regUlarly
with his counterparts In other regulatory
agencies to improve coordination
on
policies and actions among the agencies.
Because of its many foreign registrants
36

and the vast and increasing foreign operations of American companies, the Commission has an interest in the improvement of
accounting and auditing principles and
procedures on an international basis. To
promote such improvement, the Chief Accountant corresponds with foreign accountants, interviews many who visit this
country and, on occasion, participates in
foreign and International accounting conferences. In August 1973, he addressed the
annual convention of the American Accounting Association in Quebec City,
Canada. In September and December 1973,
he participated in discussions with representatives of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants in Toronto, Canada.
Professional efforts are being made to
improve and harmonize accounting standards among countries through various international accounting conferences and
committees. One committee, comprised of
representatives of accountancy groups
from eighteen countries, was established to
promulgate
international
accounting
standards. This committee has issued a
number of proposed standards and is developing additional proposals. The Commission will cooperate closely with these
committees and groups which have as their
long-term objective the development of a
coordinated worldWide accounting profession with uniform standards.

Accounting
Standards

and Auditing

The FASB supplanted the Accounting
Prlnciples Board (APB) of the AICPA,which
ceased operations on June 30, 1973, as the
organization which establishes standards
offinancial accounting and presentation for
the guidance of issuers and public accountants. The new organizational structure was established on the basis of recommendations by a committee appointed
by the AICPA in early 1971 to explore ways
of improving this function. A financial accounting foundation, sponsored by the
AICPA and consisting of representatives of
leading professional organizations, appoints the seven members of the FASBwho
serve on a salaried, full-time basis, and the
members of an advisory council to the

Board who serve on a voluntary basis. The
Commission
originally
endorsed
the recommendations
for the new structure, which
it believed would provide operational
efficiencies and insure an Impartial viewpoint
in the development
of accounting
standards on a timely basis. Subsequently,20 the
Commission endorsed the FASB and stated
that the FASB's statements and interpretations would be considered
as being substantial
authoritative
support
for an accounting practice or procedure.
The Chief Accountant
and the FASB have
developed liaison procedures for consultation on projects of either the Board or the
SEC which are of mutual
Interest.
The
Board has adopted a heavy agenda of tOPiCS
which urgently require consrderatron.
They
Include accounting
for foreign
currency
translation,
accrual of future losses, reportIng by diversified
companies,
accounting
for leases by lessee and lessor, accounting
for such costs as research and development, materiality
criteria, busmess combinations and related Intangibles,
reporting
the effects of general price-level changes In
fmancral statements,
and the conceptual
framework for tmancial accounting
and reporting. The Board has issued discussion
memoranda and held hearings on several of
the projects, and It has issued two proposed
standards and has adopted a standard on
disclosure
of foreign currency translation
Information.
Another
committee
was appointed
In
early 1971 by the AICPA to study and refine
the objectives
of financial
statements.
It
studied the baSIC questions of who needs
nnancrat
statements,
what information
should be provided, how it should be communicated,
and how much of it can be
provided through the accounting
process.
The committee's
report on the objectives of
financial statements, which was published
in October 1973, IS being utilized by the
FASB as the basis of ItS study of the conceptual framework for fmanctal accounting and
reporting.
The Chief Accountant
also rnalntarns
liaison with other senior committees
of the
AICPA on projects of mutual Interest, principally proposed audit guides and standards of the Auditing Standards
Executive
Committee
and proposed
statements
of

POSition of the Accounting
Standards
Executive
Committee.
Regular
meetings
are held with the Committee on SEC matters
to provide information
and guidance to the
profession concerning
the Interpretation
of
and compliance
with the Commission's
accounting and auditing requirements
applicable to registrants
and their independent
accountants.

Other Developments
Dunng the fiscal year the Cornmissron ISsued 13 Accounting
Series Releases to
provrde Interpretations
or guidelines
on
matters of accounting
principles and auditIng standards, to require Improved disclosure of financial information
by amendment
of reporting forms or Regulation S-X. or to
announce
decrsrons
In disciplinary
proceedings under Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice
concerning
accountants appearing before it.
One release21 contained
a statement of
policy on the establishment
and Improvement of accounting
prlncrples and standards and the Commission's
endorsement
of
the FASB. Two interpretative
releases22
dealt with the effect of treasury stock transactions on accounting
for busrness combinations The subjects of other interpretative
releases
were catastrophe
reserves
by
property
and casualty
Insurance
companles23 and disclosure of Inventory profit
reflected
in income
in periods of rising
prlces.24 In conjunction
with the DIVISion of
Market Regulation,
a release25 was issued
providrnq gUidelines forthe maintenance of
current
books and records
by brokerdealers In accordance
With Rules 17a-3(a)
and 17a-11 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.
A number of amendments
to Regulation
SoX were adopted to effect Improved disclosures In specitrc areas of nnancrat statements: one release26 dealt With the disclosure of lease commitments
by lessees,
another27
With disclosure
pertaining
to
compensating
balances
and short-term
borrowing
arrangements;
and a third release28 With disclosure
of income tax expense.
A general revlsion of Article 7A of Regulation S-X. pertaining to the requirements
for
37

the form and content
of financial
statements of life insurance
companies,
was
to reflect developments
m acadopted29
counting
practice in recent years and the
effect of the publication
m 1972 of an AICPA
audit guide for life insurance
companies
which provides for the presentation
of the
financial
statements
in accordance
with
generally accepted accountmg
principles.
Registration
Form 10 and annual report
Form 1o-K were also amended to remove
the exemption from the requirement
of audited financial statements which had previously
been available
to life insurance
companies.
Another release30 announced
an amendment in Article 4 of Regulation S-X
relating to the requirements
for consolidated and combmed
financial
statements
m filmgs with the Commission.
Finally numerous amendments
to the instructions
pertaining to the financial statements, the summaries of operations and the
exhibits in various registration
and reporting forms were adopted31 to update and
conform
the instructions
to current
termmologyand
practice and to provide other
clarifications
and modifications.
Proposals for amendments to Regulation
S-X were issued for public comment which
would requrre improved disclosures regarding accounting
policies followed by registrants,32 the components
of accounts
receivable and inventories arising out of defense and other long-term
contract
activities of registrants,33 and the capitalization of interest by non-utility
comparnes.ss
In the frnal release, a moratorium
was proposed on the adoption
of a policy
of
capitalizing
interest
by non-utility
companies who had not followed such a policy
prior to the date of the release. Shortly after
the end of the fiscal year, a general revision
of Article 7 of Regulation S-X, pertaining to
the form and content of financial
statements of title insurance
and mortgage
guaranty insurance
companies,
was proposed 35to reflect developments
in accountmg practice, mcluding the requirement that
the financial statements be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Commission
issued opinions in two
proceedmgs
under Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice involving large
38

accounting
firms. In one proceeding,36 the
Commission
censured and imposed remedial sanctions on a firm. The Commission
concluded that the firm had not performed
the audit of financial statements filed with
the Commission
which were found to be
false and misleading
in accordance
with
professional
auditing standards. The sanctions in summary provide for the firm to
adopt and rnamtain certain qualitative audit
and office review procedures, for an investigation by the Commission
regarding the
review procedures
and the professional
practices subject thereto, and for certain
restrictions
on undertaking
new professional engagements.
In the second proceeding,37
concluded
shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission
censured an accountmg
firm
for failing fully to disclose to the Commission and the public the facts relating to a
settlement negotiated between the firm and
a client regarding an audit of certain inventories that were misstated m the trnancral
statements of the client filed With the Commission.
In another proceeding,38
the Commission accepted the sworn undertaking
of a
public accountant not to engage in practice
before the Commission.
The accountant
had been permanently
enjoined by a Federal court in a Commission injunctive action
from violating antifraud
provisions
of the
Federal securities laws.

EXEMPTIONS FOR
INTERNATIONAL
BANKS
Section 15 of the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, as amended, exempts from registration securities issued, or guaranteed as
to both principal and interest, by the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development. The Bank IS req uired to file with
the Commission
such annual and other reports on securities as the Commission
determines to be appropriate.
The Commission has adopted rules requiring the Bank
to file quarterly reports and copies of annual
reports of the Bank to its Board of Governors. The Bank is also required to file advance reports of any distribution
in the
United States of ItS primary obligations. The
Commission, acting in consultation
with the

National Advisory Council on International
Monetary and Financial
Problems,
is authorized
to suspend
the exemption
for
securities
issued or guaranteed
by the
Bank. The following summary of the Bank's
activities reflects Information obtained from
the Bank. Except where otherwise
indicated, all amounts are expressed In U S.
dollar equivalents as of June 30,1974.
Net income for the year was $216 million,
compared
with $186 million the previous
year. Of the $216 million net income the
Executive Directors allocated $116 million
to the Supplemental
Reserve
Against
Losses on Loans and from Currency Devaluations and recommended
to the Board
of Governors that an amount of $1 00 million
be transferred by way of grant to an affiliate
of the Bank, the International
Development
ASSOCiation.
Repayments
of pnncipal
on loans received
by the Bank during
the year
amounted
to $487 million, and a further
$112 million was repaid to purchasers
of
portions
of loans. Total pnncipal
repayments by borrowers through June 30,1974,
aggregated $5.9 billion, including $3.8 billion repaid to the Bank and $2.1 billion repaid to purchasers
of borrowers'
obligations sold by the Bank
Outstanding borrowings ofthe Bank were
$9.7 billion at June 30, 1974. During the
year, the bank borrowed
$428 million
through the issuance of 2-year U S. dollar
bonds to central
banks and other governmental agencies In some 70 countries;
OM 578 million (U.S. $2203 million) in Germany; 122.2 billion yen (U.S. $460.6 million)
In Japan; SwF 550 million (U.S $177 5 million) in Switzerland;
KD 25 million (U.S.
$84.4 million) in Kuwait; U.S. $200 million
in Iran; LD 30 million (U.S. $101.3 million) in
Libya; UAED 300 million (U.S. $76 million) In
United Arab Emirates; and the equivalent of
U.S. $105 million In other countries outside
the United States The above U.S. dollar
equivalents are based on official exchange
rates at the times of the respective borrowings. The Bank also Issued the equivalent of
$43.5 million in bonds that had been sold in
previous years under delayed delivery contracts.
These borrowings,
in part, refunded
maturing issues amounting
to the equiva-

lent of $616 million. After retirement of $60
million equivalent
of obligations
through
Sinking fund and purchase fund operations,
the Bank's outstanding
borrowings showed
a net Increase of $768 million from the previous year after deducting $277 million representing adjustment of borrowings as a result of currency devaluations
and revaluations in terms of U.S. dollars of the value of
the non-dollar currencies in which the debt
was denominated.
The Inter-American
Development
Bank
Act, which authorizes the United States to
participate
in the Inter-American
Development Bank, provides an exemption for certain securities
which may be Issued or
guaranteed
by the Bank Similar to that
provided for securities of the International
Bank for Reconstruction
and Development.
Acting pursuant to thrs authorrty, the Commission adopted Regulation
lA, which requires the Bank to file with the Commission
substantially
the same type of Information,
documents and reports as are required from
the International
Bank for Reconstruction
and Development
The following
data reflects Information submitted by the Bank to
the Commission.
On June 30,1974 the outstanding
funded
debt of the Ordinary Capital resources of
the Bank was the equivalent of $1.316 billion, reflecting
a net increase in the past
year of the equivalent of $30 million. During
the year, the funded debt was Increased
through
public bond Issues totaling
the
equivalent of $49.9 million as well as private
placements for the eq uivalent of $58.1 m illion including
$13.3 million of drawlnqs
under arrangements entered into dUring the
previous
year with Japan
and Spain.
Additionally,
$40.2 million of two-year and
five-year bonds were sold in Latin America
and Israel, essentially
representing
a rollover of a maturing borrowinq of $32.5 rnrlnon. The funded debt decreased byapproxImately $473 million due to downward adjustrnent ofthe U.S. dollar equivalent of borrowings denominated
In non-member
currencies. The funded debt was decreased
through
the retirement
of approximately
$38.4 million from sinking fund purchases
and scheduled debt retirement
The Asian
Development
Bank Act,
adopted In March 1966, authorized
United
39

States participation In the ASian Development Bank and provides an exemption for
certain securities which may be issued or
guaranteed by the Bank, Similar to the
exemptions accorded the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission has adopted Regulation AD which
requires the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same type of information, documents and reports as are required
from those banks. The Bank has 40 members with subscriptions totaling $1 billion.
As of June 30,1973, 12 countries had contributed or pledged a total of $242 million to
the Bank's Special Funds. In addition to the
$26.6 million set aside from Ordinary Capital in 1969 and 1971 by the Board of Governors for Special Funds purposes, another
$51.6 million was set asrde in April 1973,
making a total of $78.2 million set aside. In
addition, Congress has authorized a $100
million U.S. contribution to the Bank's Speoral Funds, and is consrdannq the appropriation of these funds In fiscal 1974. There
have been indications from other countries
of additional contributions.
Through June 30, 1973, the Bank's borrowings totaled the equivalent of $229 million. In 1972, the Bank issued obligations of
the equrvalent of $58.6 million In Japan
($32 5 million), Luxembourg ($8.9 million)
and Italy ($17.2 million). The last U.S. borrowing, In 1971, was $50 million, half In
5-year notes at 6Y2 percent and half In 25year bonds at 7% percent. Before selling
securrties in a country, the Bank must obtain the country's approval.

TRUST INDENTURE

ACT OF 1939

This Act requires that bonds, debentures,
notes and similar debt secuntles offered for
public sale, except as specifically exempted, be Issued under an Indenture which
meets the requirements of the Act and has
been duly qualified with the Oommtssrcn.
The provisrcns of the Act are closely integrated with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant to the
Securities Act of securities to be issued
under a trust indenture subject to the Trust
Indenture Act is not permitted to become
40

effective unless the indenture conforms to
the requirements of the latter Act designed
to safeguard the rights and interests of the
purchasers. Moreover, specified information about the trustee and the Indenture
must be included In the registration statement.
The Act was passed after studies by the
Commission had revealed the frequency
With which trust Indentures failed to provide
minimum protections for security holders
and absolved so-called trustees from minimum obligations in the discharge of the
trusts. It requires, among other things, that
the Indenture trustee be a corporation With
a minimum combined capital and surplus
and be free of conflrcnnq mterests which
might interfere With the faithful exercise of
its duties on behalf of the purchasers of the
securities, and it imposes high standards of
conduct and responsibility on the trustee.
DUring fiscal year 1974, 370 trust Indentures
relating to securities In the aggregate
amount of $23.3 billion were filed.

INFORMATION FOR PUBLIC
INSPECTION; FREEDOM OF
INFORMATION ACT
Registration statements, applications,
declarations, and annual and penodrc reports filed with the Commission each year,
as well as many other public documents, are
available for public inspection and copying
at the Commission's public reference room
in its pnncrpal offices In Washington, D.C.
and, In part, at its regional and branch offices.
The categories of available materials and
those categories of records that are generally considered nonpublic are specified in
the cornmrssron's rules concerning records
and information which Include the rule (17
CFR 200.80) adopted by the Commission to
Implement the provrslons of the Freedom of
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). That rule establishes the procedure to be followed in
requesting records or copies and provides
for a method of administrative appeal from
the denial of access to any record. It also
provides for the imposition of fees when
more than one-half man-hour of work is performed by the Commission's staff to locate
and make records available. In addition to

the records described, the Commission
makes available for inspection and copying
all requests for no-action and interpretative
letters received after December 31, 1970,
and responses thereto (17 CFR 200.81) Also
made available since November 1, 1972 are
materials filed under Proxy Rule 14a-8(d),
which deals with proposals offered by
shareholders for inclusion in management
proxy-soliciting materials, and related materials prepared by the staff (17 CFR 200.82).
The Commission has special public reference facilities in the New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles Regional Offices and some
facilities for public use in other regional and
branch offices. Each regional office has
available for public examination copies of
prospectuses used in recent offerings of
securities registered under the Securities
Act; registration statements and recent annual reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act by companies having their principal office in the region; recent annual reports and quarterly reports filed under the
Investment Company Act by management
investment companies having their pnncipal office in the region; broker-dealer and
Investment adviser applications originating
in the region; letters of notification under
Regulation A filed In the region, and indices
of Commission decisions.
During the 1974 fiscal year, 18,970 persons examined material on file in Washington; several thousand others examined files
in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and
other regional offices. More than 52,948
searches were made for information requested by individuals, and approximately
5,163 letters were written on information
requested.
The public may make arrangements
through the Public Reference Section of the
Commission in Washington, D.C. to purchase copies of material in the Commission's public files. The copies are produced
by a commercial copying company which
supplies them to the public at prices established under a contract with the Commission. Current prices begin at 15 cents per
page for pages not exceeding 8h" x 14" in
size, with a $2 minimum charge. Under the
same contract, the company also makes

microfiche and microfilm copies of Commission public documents available on a
subscription or individual order baSIS to
persons or firms who have or can obtain
viewing facilities In microfiche services, up
to 60 Images of document pages are contained on 4" x 6" pieces of film, referred to as
"fiche."
Annual microfiche subscriptions are offered in a variety of packages covering all
public reports filed on Forms 10-K, 10-0,
8-K, N-l0 and N-1R under the Securities
Exchange Act or the Investment Company
Act; annual reports to stockholders; proxy
statements; new issue registration statements; and final prospectuses for new ISsues. The packages offered Include various
categories of these reports, including those
of companies listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, the American Stock Exchange,
regional stock exchanges, or traded overthe-counter. Reports are also available by
standard industry classifications. Arrangements also may be made to subscribe to
reports of companies of one's own selection. Over one hundred million pages (microimagery frames) are being distributed
annually. The subscnption services may be
extended to further groups of filings In the
future if demand warrants. The copying
company will also supply copies In microfiche or microfilm form of other public
records of the Commission desired by a
member of the public.
Microfiche readers and reader-printers
have been installed In the public reference
areas in Washington, D.C. and the New
York, Chicago, and Los Angeles regional
offices, and sets of microfiche are available
for inspection there. Visitors to the public
reference room in Washington, D.C. may
also make immediate reproduction of material on photostatic-type copying machines.
The cost to the public of copies made by use
of all customer-operated equipment is 12
cents per page. The charge for an attestation with the Commission seal is $2. Detailed Information concerning copying services available and prices for the various
types of services and copies may be obtained from the Public Reference Section of
the Commission.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT LITIGATION
In Preferred Land Corporation v. S.E.C.39
plaintiffs attempted to gain access, under
the Freedom of Information Act, to a report
of investigation prepared by the Commission's Atlanta Regional Office following an
investigation by that Office into the activities of the plaintiffs. After oral argument.
the district court concluded that "the
Commission's staff report is one of the
types of documents that Congress intended
to protect when it enacted the Freedom of
Information Act, exempt from disclosure
under that Act as a part of an 'investigatory
file compiled for law enforcement purposes,' in the words of the seventh exemption to that Act.nolO The district court also
ruled that Securities Act Release No. 5310,
"Procedures Relating to the Commencement of Enforcement Proceedings and
Termination of Staff Investigation" (September 27. 1972). does not constitute a
waiver of the investigatory files exemption
under the Act, with respect to recommendations made by the staff to the Commission concerning the institution of
enforcement proceedings. An appeal by
plaintiffs of the district court's order is
pending.ol!

. PART 3
. . REGULATION OF

SECURITIESMARKETS

PART 3
REGULATION OF
SECURITIES MARKETS

In addition to the disclosure provisions
discussed in the preceding chapter, the Exchange Act assigns to the Commission pervasive regulatory
responsibilities
for securities markets and persons in the secunties business. The Act, among other
things, requires securities exchanges to
register with the Commission and provides
for Commission
supervision
of the selfregulatory responsibilities of registered exchanges. The Act requires registration and
regulation
of brokers and dealers dOing
business in the over-the-counter
markets,
and permits registration of associations of
brokers
or dealers
exercising
selfregulatory
functions
under Commission
supervision.
The Act
also contains
provisions designed to prevent fraudulent,
deceptive and manipulative acts and practices on the exchanges and in the over-thecounter markets
Some recent developments concerning
regulation
of the securities markets are discussed in Part 1.

REGULATION

OF EXCHANGES

Registration
The Exchange Act generally requires an
exchange to register with the Commission
as a national securities exchange unless the
Commission exempts It from registration
because of the limited volume of ItStransactions. As of June 3D, 1974, the following 13
securities exchanges were registered with
the Commission.
American Stock Exchange, Inc.
Board of Trade of the City of Chicago1

Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc.
National Stock Exchange
New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc
PBW Stock Exchange, Inc.
Intermountain Stock Exchange
Spokane Stock Exchange

Dellsting
Pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act, securities may be stricken from
listing and registration upon application to
the Commission
by an exchange,
or
withdrawn
from listing and registration
upon application
by an Issuer, In accordance with the rules of the exchange and
upon such terms as the Commission may
impose for the protection of Investors. It IS
the Commission's
view that in evaluating
dellsting applications, It ISnot generally the
Commission's
function
to substitute
ItS
judgment for that of an exchange, and that
where there has been full compliance with
the rules of an exchange With respect to
delisting, the Commission
IS required to
grant a dellsting application. The authorrty
of the Comrmssron in such cases IS limited
to the Imposition of terms deemed necessary for the protection of investors.
The standards for delistlng vary among
the exchanges, but generally delistlng actions are based on one or more of the following factors: (1) the number of publicly held
47

shares or shareholders
is insufficient
(often
as a result of an acquisition
or merger) to
support a broad-based
trading market; (2)
the market value of the outstanding
shares
or the trading volume is inadequate; (3) the
company no longer satisfies the exchange's
criteria for earnings or financial condition;
or (4) required reports have not been filed
with the exchange.
During
fiscal
1974, the Commission
granted exchange applications
for the delisting of 115 stock issues and 29 bond ISsues. The largest number of applications
came from the American Stock Exchange
(40 stocks and 10 bonds). The number of
applications
granted other exchanges are:
New York (31 stocks and 18 bonds); National (17 stocks and 1 bond), Pacific (14
stocks);
Midwest
and Boston
(4 stocks
each);
Detroit
(2 stocks);
Cincinnati,
Spokane and the Chicago Board of Trade (1
stock each).
The Commission
also granted the applications of two issuers to withdraw their securities from listing and registration
on the
Amencan Stock Exchange.

Exchange

Disciplinary Actions

Although ttfe Exchange Act does not specifically grant the Commission
authority to
monitor disciplinary
actions taken by exchanges,2
each registered
national
secunties exchange reports to the Commission action taken against members and
member firms and their associated persons
for violations of any rule of the exchange or
of the Exchange Act, or of any rule or regulation under the Act.
During the fiscal year. five exchanges reported a total of 83 separate disciplinary
actions including the imposition in 33 cases
of fines ranging from $400 to $20,000; the
expulsion of 19 individuals; the suspension
from membership
(for periods of 3 to 18
months) of 9 member organizations
and 16
individual members; and the censure of 22
member organizations.

also

Act or any rule or regulation thereunder may
be destroyed before the end of the retention
period, or retained on microfilm
or other
recording medium for the remainder of the
retention penod if so provided by an exchange or association
in a record destruction plan filed with and approved by the
Commission.

Exchange

Rules

The Commission's
staff continually
reviews the rules and practices of the nation's
registered
securities
exchanges
to determine the adequacy and effectiveness of the
self-regulatory
scheme. To facilitate Commission oversight, each registered national
sscuntres exchange is required to file with
the Commission
a report of any proposed
change in rules or practices not less than
three weeks (or such shorter period as the
Commission
may authonze) before Implementing a change. These filings are available for public inspection.
During the fiscal year, the Commission
received 127 letters from exchanges proposing changes in several hundred exchange
rules and practices.
The following
were
among the more significant:
1. The New York Stock Exchange and the
Midwest
Stock Exchange
adopted
rule
changes permitting their members to sell all
types of insurance.
Previously their members had been limited to selling life. accident and health insurance.
2 During the fiscal year, most of the registered
stock
exchanges
adopted
rule
amendments
which provided for competitive brokerage commissions
on orders of
$2,000 or less. For further discussron
of
these changes, see Part 1.

Litigation on Exchange

Rules

In Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange,
Inc.,4 the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit unanimously affirmed an order of
the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York dismissing for
lack of subject matter Jurisdiction, a challenge under the antitrust laws to the fixed
minimum commission rate policies of the
national secuntles exchanges. The plaintiffs had sued the New York and American
Stock Exchanges and two representative
member firms of the exchanges.
The Commission
filed a brief, amicus
cunee, in the Court of Appeals arguing that,
In the Securities Exchange Act, Congress
Intended to grant the Commission exclusive
jurisdiction over a broad range of exchange
activities, including the fixing of commission rates, and that a district court has no
Jurisdiction to entertain an antitrust challenge to exchange activities that are within
the Commission's exclusive Jurisdiction.
The Court of Appeals concluded that the
legislative
history of the Securrties Exchange Act demonstrates Congress's Intent
that the Commission "assume the central
role in assuring investor protection and exchange fair dealing" with respect to the fixing of commission
rates. It held, as the
Commission urged, that where governmental oversight of the exchanges' practices is
vested expressly in the S.E.C. "both the language and the history of the 1934 Act, together with the sound policy behind supervised exchange self-regulation,"
mandate
the conclusion that Congress intended to
exempt those practices from the application of the antitrust laws. The court reasoned that If district courts, on an ad hoc
basis, applied the antitrust laws to practices
within the jurisdiction of the Cornmrssron,
"duplicative
or inconsistent standards announced contemporaneously
by courts and
Commission could result."

Moreover, the court noted, denial of antitrust [unsdrctron with respect to the setting
of fixed minimum commission rates was
grounded In sound public policy because
"when something as crucral to the survival
of the securities industry as its very ancient
rate structure is at stake, draqnosrs and
changes must come from an agency with
the Commission's expertise,..
[and] with
respect to the fixing of commission rates,
the process of administrative review In the
first Instance IS far superior to judicial review" The court rejected the decision in
Thill Securtttes Corp. v. New York Stock Exchange 5 to the extent Inconsistent with ItS
own opinion.

Exchange Inspections
An Important element of the Commission's
supervrsron
of exchange
selfregulation is ItS program of regular inspections of various phases of exchange activity.
These Inspections enable the Commission
to recommend,
where appropriate,
Improvements designed to Increase the utility
and effectiveness of self-regulation
Three
inspections
made In fiscal 1974 are descnbad below.6
NYSE
Spectetrsts
Inspection
-The
Commission's staff Inspected the NYSE's
procedures for surveillance of the performance of ItS specialists and ItS stock allocation program. In the Inspection, the staff
Interviewed NYSE Floor Department staff
members, and examined,
among other
things, the Floor Department's case files regarding specrallat performance, reports of
specrallst
Income and expenses and the
minutes both of the Floor Committee and of
the Oornrmttee on Specialist Ratings. The
staff considered the methods and general
adequacy of continuous speciahst surveillance, the method by which new listings of
stocks are allocated among specralists, instances of reallocations of stocks among
specialists and drscrphnary actions against
speciahsts. It also considered the standards
which the NYSE employs In determining
whether a specraltst IS complying with ItS
"affirmative obligation"
under NYSE rules
to engage in a course of dealings for ItS own
account to assist In the maintenance of a
fair and orderly market and its "negative
49

obligation" under Exchange Act Rule 111>-1
to restrict its dealings to those reasonably
necessary to permit it to maintain a fair and
orderly market.
The inspection was, however, primarily
concerned with two of the NYSE's methods
of specialist surveillance-the
NYSE's
"New Measures of Specialist Performance"
("New Measures") and its one-week spotchecks of specialist trading, which are
made at least eight times each year-and
with the manner in which new listings of
stocks are allocated among specialists. The
Commission's staff expressed the view that
the "New Measures" and the one-week
spot-checks did not adequately develop a
basis upon which to measure the performance of specialists in fulfilling their affirmative and negative obligations. In addition, it
appeared to the Commission's staff that
neither the performance ratings computed
under the "New Measures" nor those resulting from the spot checks are used as a basis
for making stock allocations or reallocations; it was unclear what bases for allocations are actually utilized. The staff suggested, as the Martin Report7 had earlier
recommended, that the NYSE staff assume
a greater role in the allocation and reallocation of stocks. In addition, the Commission's staff noted that a review of the minutes of the NYSE Committee on Floor Affairs
revealed the crucial role currently performed by that Committee and its subcommittees in determining the regulatory approach to specialist compliance with Commission and NYSE rules. Because of the
limited information revealed in exchange
records respecting the basis for Committee
decisions, the staff recommended that the
Committee's minutes or other records be
appropriately expanded.
Following the inspection, the NYSE established a committee to examine and make
recommendations to the exchange regarding the NYSE's specialist system and its
regulation. In addition, NYSE staff members
met with the Commission's staff to discuss
the inspection; the NYSE has agreed to respond to the matters raised at that meeting.
Amex Compliance Inspectlon.-The staff
also conducted an inspection of the Compliance Department of the Amex. During the
inspection the staff interviewed Amex staff
50

members and examined selected investigatory case files. Among the matters considered in the course ofthe inspection were
the qualifications of the members of and the
size of the compliance staff; the sources of
information available to it; its methods of
investigation; the general adequacy of the
disciplinary actions; and the depth and detail with which the staff conducts its investigations.
The Compliance Department is responsible for the investigation of possible violations by Amex members of exchange rules
and of the Exchange Act. Although these
violations are in some cases discovered by
the Department, most are referred from
sources outside the Compliance Department. When the Department believes, following its investigation, that an Amex member has committed a rule violation, it brmgs
formal charges before Amex's Disciplinary
Panel.
It was noted by the Commission staff that
although the number of personnel on the
Amex Compliance Department staff was not
at its budgeted strength at the time of the
inspection, its members were generally well
qualified,
adequately supervised
and
seemed to investigate
their
cases
thoroughly. The Oornmtssron's staff did,
however, note that the Compliance Department reviews only those arbltratron
cases which are referred to it by the Director
of Arbitration. It suggested that, in order to
improve its ability to identify rule violations,
the Compliance
Department
should
routinely examine all arbitration cases in
which a decision had been rendered against
a member firm respondent.
FollOWing a previous inspection, the
Oomrntssron's
staff had suggested to both
the Amex and the NYSE that they adopt
rules to require member firms to report to
the exchanges certain Incidents indicating
possible violative conduct involving a firm's
employees on a current basis, rather than
only at the termination of employment with
the firm, so that the exchanges could make
timely investigations of possible rule violanons, The NYSE adopted such a rule (NYSE
Rule 351)which appears to be accomplishing
its purpose. Accordingly, following the
most recent inspection of the Amex Compliance Department, the Commission's staff

suggested that the Amex adopt such a "current reporting" rule.
After its 1971 inspection of the Amex
Compliance Department, the Commission's
staff had expressed concern regarding the
Amex's elimination, from its compliance
program, of its periodic inspections of
member firms' front offices. It was suggested that such inspections be reinstituted. During the most recent inspection, it
was learned that the Amex was preparing to
resume inspecting member firms' front offices. The next inspection will examine the
impact of those inspections upon the Amex
disciplinary program.
A few specific cases reviewed during the
inspection were discussed at a meeting between Amex and Commission staff members. The Amex representatives assured the
Commission's staff that any deficiencies in
the manner these cases were handled
would be corrected in the future.
PBW Stock Exchange

Inspectlon.-In

November 1973, the Commission's staff inspected the self-regulatory program of the
PBW Stock Exchange, Inc. ("PBW"), as part
of its regular oversight inspection program.
It directed particular attention to the PBW's
plans to begin the trading of options on a
pilot basis and to establish a trading floor
with market-making capability in Miami,
Florida. The inspection of the PBW floor
focused on order execution, specialist performance, and on-site, real-time surveillance by PBW staff. The staff also reviewed
the performance of the PBW Department of
the Stock List, Office of Chief Examiner and
Office of General Counsel and examined
the work of the exchange's two principal
exchange-member self-regulatory committees, the Committee on Floor Procedure
and the Committee on Business Conduct.
As a result of that inspection, the staff
recommended to the PBW that it create a
program to evaluate odd-lot dealerspecialist performance and that it consider
adopting the following three performance
standards for its odd-lot dealer-specialists
in primary-listed securities: (i) minimum allowable quotation spreads, (ii) restrictions
on trading with limited price orders on the
specialist's book; and (iii) the prohibition or
restriction of a member firm's promotion of
primary-listed securities in which it is a reg-

istered specialist. The staff also recommended that the PBW formalize the procedures to be followed by its own staff when it
makes inquiry into "news-pending" or unusual trading situations. It was further recommended that the exchange require its
floor members to report to the Committee
on Floor Procedure or to a floor official any
dispute
between floor brokers and
specialists concerning the execution of an
order, that the responsible floor official be
satisfied that the public customers' interests are adequately represented in the dispute, and that a record be kept by the Committee of all such disputes reported to a
floor official. The Commission's staff also
recommended that the minutes and records
of the exchange-member self-regulatory
committees more completely reflect the
committees' activities and the bases for
their decisions.
Following the inspection, the PBW reviewed Its parameters for quotation
spreads, instituted a procedure whereby the
presiding floor official involved in a dispute
would submit a memorandum regarding the
dispute to the Committee on Floor Procedure, and instituted additional surveillance
of odd-lot dealer-specialist performance. It
is anticipated that there will be further discussions between the PBW and the Commission's staff regarding the implementation of these procedures and the remaining
recommendations.

SUPERV;SION

OF NASD

The Exchange Act provides that any association of brokers or dealers may be registered with the Commission as a national
securities association if it meets the standards and requirements for the registration
and operation of such associations contained in the Act. The Act contemplates that
such associations will serve as a medium for
self-regulation by over-the-counter brokers
and dealers. In order to be eligible for registration, an association must have rules designed to protect investors and the public
interest, to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to meet other statutory
requirements.
Registered national securities associations operate under the
Commission's general supervisory author51

ity, which includes the power to review disciplinary actions taken by an association, to
disapprove changes In association rules
and to alter or supplement rules relating to
specified matters. The National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), IS the
only association registered with the Commission under the Act.
In adopting legislation to permit the formation and registration of national securities associations, Congress provided an
incentive to membership by permitting such
assocranons to adopt rules which preclude
members from dealing with a nonmember
broker or dealer except on the same terms
and conditions and at the same price asthe
member deals with the general public. The
NASDhas adopted such rules. As a practical
matter, therefore, membership is necessary
for profitable participation in many underwritings since members properly may grant
only to other members price concessions,
discounts and similar allowances not
granted to the general public.
At the close of the fiscal year, the NASD
had 3,318 members, reflecting a net loss of
567 members during the year. This loss reflects the net result of 184 admissions to and
751 terminations
of membership. The
number of members' branch offices decreased by 643, to 6,148, as a result of the
opening of 1,334 new offices and the closIng of 1,977. During the fiscal year, the
number of registered representatives and
principals (these categories include all
partners, officers, traders, salesmen and
other persons employed by or affiliated with
member firms In capacities which require
registration) increased by 2,158 to 207,095
as of June 30, 1974. This increase reflects
the net result of 27,095 Initial registrations,
25,658 re-reqrstratlons and 50,595 terminanons of registration during the year.
During the fiscal year, the NASDadministered 59,109 qualification examinations of
""hlch 35,105 were for NASD qualification,
2,624 for the Oornmlssron's
SECO program8 and the balance for other agencies,
including major exchanges and various
states.

NASD Rules
Under the Exchange Act, the NASD must
file for Commission review copies of any
52

proposed rules or rule amendments 30 days
prior to their proposed effective date. Any
rule changes or additions may be disapproved by the Commission if It finds them to
be Inconsistent with the requirements of the
Act. Normally, the Commission also reviews, in advance of publication, general
policy statements, directives and interpretations proposed to be issued by the Board of
Governors pursuant to its powers to administer and interpret NASD rules.
During the fiscal year,9 numerous
changes In or additions to NASD rules,
policies and interpretations were submitted
to the Commission for its consideration.
Among the more significant which were not
disapproved by the Oommlsston were:
(1) Amendments to Schedule D ofthe
NASD's By-laws to provide for the Implementation of annual assessments
and entry fees for securities quoted on
NASDAQ,the Association's automated
quotation system.
(2) Amendments to Schedule E of the
NASD's By-laws ("Self-Underwriting
Rules"). Among other things, the
amendments require NASD members
which have made public offerings of
their own securities to establish "Audit
Committees" and to elect "public directors" to their Boards of Directors.
(3) Amendments to Schedule D of the
NASD's By-laws to provide for summary
complaint procedures for NASDAQ
Committee disciplinary proceedings.
(4) Amendments to the NASD's Bylaws to provide new procedures for the
selection of candidates for nominating
Committees (which nominate candidates for election to the District Committees and the Board of Governors)
and to revise nomination and election
procedures of membership on District
Committees and the Board of Governors.
(5) Amendments to the NASO'sRules
of Fair Practice to set forth the initial
margin maintenance requirements to
be followed by NASO members In extending credit to customers in securities transactions.
(6) Amendments to the Interpretation
of the NASO Board of Governors regardmg "free-riding and withholding"

in public
offerings.
Among other
things,
the amendments
prohibit
entirely any allocation of "hot Issues"
to NASD firms and persons associated
with NASD fl rms.

Tax Shelters
In recognition of existing and potential
abuses with respect to tax shelter programs,
the Commission continued ItS efforts durIng the fiscal year to provide for adequate
regulation of such programs. Specifically,
the Commission directed its staff to continue to collect information
concerning
abuses Involving tax shelter programs and
to formulate various proposals, including
new rules or gUIdelines applicable to all
packagers
and promoters
of such programs, enlarged enforcement
programs
and suggestions
for possible additional
legIslation
As previously reported, In July 1973, the
Commission
requested public comments
on proposed NASD Rules of Fair Practice
designed to establish a system of regulation
for the public distribution of tax shelter programs by NASD members.'? The Commission reviewed the numerous
comments
received in response to its release and In a
May 1974 letter to the NASD encouraged It
to pursue its proposals In the traditional
areas of ItS regulation (e.g., underwriters'
compensation, suitability and sales literature)
With respect to the NASD's proposals relating to the operation, structure and management of tax shelter programs, however,
indicated that it did not
the Oornrnissron
then believe that the NASD should attempt
to provide a regulatory structure having a
direct impact on issuers, sponsors and
other non-NASD members.
At the end of the fiscal year the staffs of
the Commission and the NASD were discussing further steps to implement
the
NASD's tax shelter proposals.

Mandatory

Bonding

Toward the end of the fiscal year, the
Commission permitted to become effective
a new NASD rule setting forth mandatory
fidelity bonding requirements
for NASD

members. The rule evolved from a study of
the fidelity bonding requirements imposed
by the exchanges on their members. The
study was conducted by the NASD at the
suggestion of SIPC with a view to developIng similar requirements for NASD members so that various special forms of risk
(such as misappropriation
of firm assets)
would be covered through
appropriate
bonding and, as was the intention of Congress, be excluded from the risks covered
by SIPC The rule requires each NASD
member to maintain the standard "Stock
Broker's Blanket Bond" or an equivalent
bond acceptable to the NASD to Indemnify
the firm (and Indirectly
its customers)
against losses attributable to common law
and statutory crimes such as burglary and
theft (Including "mysterious unexplainable
disappearances"
of property), losses of
property in transit, "forgery and alteration"
losses, and damages from any "securities
loss." In addition, the rule requires NASD
minimum
members to obtain specrfled
amounts of coverage under various msurIng agreements.
Certain NASD members are exempted
from complying with the rule to the extent
that the nature of their business does not
come within the scope of the fidelity bondIng concept Firms In thrs category chiefly
Include dealers engaged exclusively in the
retail distribution
of investment company
shares-firms
which typically do not hold
customer funds or securities-and
sole
proprietorships and partnerships having no
employees.
Both the NASD and the Commission intend to monitor the Impact of the rule to
ensure that no one IS excluded from the
securities business merely because it cannot obtain a bond at a reasonable cost.

Commission Abrogation of NASD
Rule
The Exchange Act permits the Commission by order to abrogate any NASD rule If it
appears that abrogation ISnecessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the
reAct. The Commission,
as prevrously
pcrted!t on June 7,197212 abrogated Rule
25 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice13 to
the extent that it permitted or had been con53

strued to permit the NASD to bar receipt by
Its members of any allowance from nonmembers. The NASD had traditionally interpreted Rule 25 as prohibiting its members
from either granting or receiving comrmssions, concessrons, discounts or any other
allowances from nonmember brokerdealers.
The Commission determined that the
NASD,in interpreting Rule 25 to prohibit the
receipt of allowances from nonmembers,
had gone beyond the authority granted by
Section 15A(I)(1). The Commission's decision was based upon its conclusion that
Section 15A(i)(1), which authorizes the
adoption of rules such as Rule 25 restncting
the business conduct of members of national securities associations, is an exception to the free and open market concept
expressed in Section 15A(b)(8) and therefore must be narrowly construed.
The NASDfiled a petition for review of the
Commission's decision in the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia CircUlt.14 On November 1, 1973, the
court, per cunem and Without oprruon, affirmed the Cornmlssron's order

NASD Inspections
During the fiscal year, the staff Inspected
the NASD's district offices In Boston,
Chicago, Dallas, Denver, the District of Columbia, KansasCity, Los Angeles, NewYork,
San Francisco and Seattle. These inspections were conducted as a part of the Commission's regulatory oversight responsibllrty to assure that the District committees
and their staffs (which operate sernrautonomously from the NASD's national office) are properly carrying out the pollcymaking and administrative functions of the
NASDassigned to them, and to assist in the
proper coordination of the Commission's
and the NASD's regulatory and enforcement activities In the over-the-counter markets.
These inspections involved a review of (1)
the composition and effectiveness of the
Distnct Committees, the Distnct BUSiness
Conduct Committees, examination subcommittees, nominating committees and
quotation committees; (2) the functioning
of the district staffs, especially their working
54

relationships With the various committees;
(3) the drstnct staffs coordination and
cooperation With the Commission's regional offices, exchanges and other interested regulatory bodies; (4) the effectiveness of disciplinary proceedings and
enforcement procedures; and (5) the need,
If any, for new rules or amendments to existIng rules, policres or interpretations.
In general, the Commission staff reported
relatively few substantive problems in the
operations of the district offices vlsrted.
There were, however, several areas which
the staff felt merited further discussion with
the NASD's home office. Specifically, the
staff noted that some districts were: (1) expenencing problems in processing formal
complaints Within a reasonable period of
time, i.e., there were occasional delays in
writing and serving disciplinary complaints
on respondents, and in holding hearings,
negotiating settlements and reviewing
transcripts and other materials; (2) finding
difficulty in conducting on a regular basis
inspections of pnncrpal offices of firms not
engaged primarily In a general over-thecounter secuntres business; consequently,
exchange, mutual fund and specialty firms,
and branch offices of members were not
being routinely examined, although It was
recognized that exchange firms are generally examined by one or more exchanges of
which they are members." (3) in some disciplinary proceedings reviewed on appeal
to the Commission, not documenting
adequately the evidence presented or sub.
stantiating adequately the findings made;
and (4) not applying disciplinary measures
uniformly.
These matters were discussed at length
on various occasions with representatives
of the NASD; in response, the NASD has
undertaken new programs and refinements
of existing programs to improve its selfregulatory performance. With respect to the
problems In the timely processing of formal
complaints, the NASD has Implemented a
monthly reporting form which is being used
by its district offices to report the status of
all pending items. The report is also used by
the NASD's national office to identify district offices expertencinq delays and to assign to them the appropriate manpower to
correct the problem. The NASD has also

undertaken corrective action in connection
with its broker-dealer
examination
program, discussed elsewhere
in this annual
report.16
In connection
with the adequacy
of
documenting
evidence
In NASD disciplinary records
received
on appeal to the
Commission,
the NASD noted that district
staff personnel were being given pertinent
training With respect to local NASD recordkeeping and In the drafting of its decisions
The NASD is also closely monitoring the use
of internal records as early warning devices
in detecting
violations
and, where necessary, IS developing
new procedures
to be
followed by ItS drstrrct offices

NASD Disciplinary Actions
The Commission
receives from the NASD
copies of its decisions
in all cases where
disciplinary
action is taken against members and persons associated with members
Generally, such actions are based on allegations
that
the respondents
violated
specified provisions of the NASD's Rules of
Fair Practice. Where violations by a member
are found, the NASD may impose such
penallties as expulsion, suspension, fine or
censure. If the Violator is an individual, his
registration
with the NASD may be suspended or revoked, he may be suspended or
barred from being associated
with any
member or he may be fined and/or censured.
During the past fiscal year, the NASD reported to the Commission
its final disposition of 919 disciplinary
complaints
(includIng 182 complaints involving NASDAQ) 17 In
which 722 members and 873 individuals
were named as respondents.
Complaints
against 40 members and 81 individuals were
dismissed for failure to establish the alleged
violations. Sixty-four members were expelled from membership and 32 members were
suspended
for periods ranging from one
day to one year. In many of these cases, a
fine also was imposed. In 576 cases, members were fined amounts ranging from $25
to $50,000 and in 45 cases members were
imcensured.
In dlsctpllnary sanctions
posed on indlvrduals associated with member firms, 173 persons were barred or had
their registrations
revoked and 112 had

their registrations
suspended
for periods
ranging from one day to eight years. In addition, 507 other individuals
were censured
and/or fined amounts ranging from $100 to
$50,000.

Review of NASD Disciplinary
Actions
DIsciplinary action taken by the NASD IS
subject to review by the Commission on ItS
own motion or on the timely application
of
any aggneved person
In those cases reviewed by the Commission,
the effectiveness of any penalty Imposed by the NASD is
automatically
stayed pending Commission
review, unless the Commission
otherwise
orders after notice and opportunity for hearIng If the Commission
finds that the disciplined party committed
the acts found by
the NASD and that such acts violated the
specified rules, the Commission
must sustain the NASD's action-unless
It finds that
the penalties imposed are excessive or oppressive, In which case it must reduce them
or set them aside,
At the beginning of the fiscal year, 22 proceedings to review NASD disciplinary
decisions were pending before the Oornrnlssron
and, during the year, 17 additional
cases
were brought up for review. The Commission disposed of 13 cases. In four cases, the
Commission affirmed the NASD's action. It
remanded one case back to the NASD. In
seven cases, the NASD's findings
and/or
penalties were modified and In one case the
NASD's action was set asrde. At the close of
the fiscal year, 26 cases were pending.
In Plaza Securities Corp.,lS the Commission set aside a finding by the NASD that an
NASD member, by merely joining with a
non-member affiliate In a dlstnbutlon of secunties to the public, had violated the NASD
rule forbidding
members to deal with nonmembers except on the same terms as they
deal With members of the general public
[Article III, Section 25]. The Commission,
citing its earlier decision
in the "Aetna"
case,'" stated that the NASD rule must be
viewed merely as prohibiting
a member
from giving a non-member
a discount or
commission
not accorded to the general
public. Since the Oornrnlssron
could I\Ot
find on the basis of the record that Plaza
55

gave such a discount or concession to its
non-member affiliate, it saw no Impropriety
in Plaza's jOining with the affiliate in a distribution of securities.
In another case, Sumner B. Cotzin,20 the
NASD found, as did the Commission on an
application for review, that the respondent
had violated the net capital rule and had
engaged In sham transactions to avoid detection of Its net capital oenciencres, The
principal contention on review related to an
asserted lack of due process in the NASD's
procedures. This was based on applicant's
belief that the NASD permitted ItS district
director to perform investigative
and
prosecutory functions in their disciplinary
proceedings while at the same time advrsing and partlcrpatinq with the District Business Conduct Committee In its deliberations preceding its decision. In sustaining
the NASD's findings, the Commission held
that there was no evidence to support applicant's claim. The Commission noted, however, that although It was unpersuaded that
a rigid separation between investigative and
adjudicatlve personnel is an essential element of fairness In NASD proceedings
at the District Business Conduct Committee
level, the NASD's existing procedures may
present some problems. It suggested that
the Association "re-examine its procedures
to avoid even the appearance of" unfairness.

Review of NASD Membership
Action
The Exchange Act and NASD By-laws
provide that no broker or dealer can be an
NASD member If It or any person associated
With It IS subject to specified disabilities.
These disabilities can be waived only With
specific approval of the Commission.
Commission approval or a direction by it to
admit a person to membership In the Association or to continue the membership of
any person generally IS made after Initial
submission to the NASD by the member or
applicant for membership. The NASD In its
discretion may then file an application With
the Commission on behalf of the petitioner.
If the NASD refuses to sponsor an application, the broker or dealer may apply directly
to the Commission for an order directing
56

the NASD to admit him to or to continue him
in membership. At the beginning of the fiscal year, four applications for approval of
adrnissron to or continuance
in membership were pending. During the year,
seven applications were filed, four were approved and three were withdrawn, leaving
four applications pending at the end of the
year.

BROKER-DEALER

REGULATION

Registration
Brokers and dealers who use the mails or
means of Interstate commerce in the conduct of an over-the-counter securities business are required to register With the Commission
As of June 30, 1974, there were 3,982
broker-dealers registered, compared with
4,407 a year earlier. This represents a decrease of 425, or 9.6 percent, since June 30,
1973. During the year 766 registrations were
terminated, 702 new applications were received, 341 applications were made effective, and 363 applications were returned,
denied or withdrawn. Approximately 689, or
90 percent, of the 766 terminations were
requested by the registrants for a variety of
reasons, while 77, or 10 percent, were the
result of Commission action (cancellation
or revocation).
During the fiscal year, the Commission
clarified certain of ItS rules imposing
record keeping, reporting and financial responsrbrllty obligations on broker-dealers.
It also adopted or proposed for adoption
new rules or amendments to certain of the
existing rules In these areas.

Recordkeeping
During the fiscal year, the Commission for
the first time published a comprehensive
release clarifying the requirement of Rule
17a-3 under the Securities Exchange Act,
that every broker-dealer make and keep
current the books and records specified In
the Rule.21

Financial Responsibility
The basic financial responsibility rules
applicable to broker-dealers are Rules

15c3-1 and 15c3-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act.
Rule 15c3-3, which became effective
January 15, 1973,establishes standards regarding the custody of customers' securities and limits the use of customers'
funds left with a broker-dealer in order to
insure that such funds are not utilized to
support firm activities unrelated to the servicing of customers. On October 12, 1973,
the Commission published a releasesetting
forth standards for the safekeeping of customers' securities held abroad.22Since that
date over 180 applications for foreign control locations have been processed by the
Commission. In addition, during the year
the staff issued over 160 interpretive letters
concerning Rule 15c3-3. Further releases
interpreting this important Rule are anticipated in the next year.
Rule 15c3-1, the "net capital rule," sets
standards of liquidity to be maintained by
broker-dealers. During the fiscal year, the
Commission issued an Interpretive release
to clarify the availability to broker-dealers of
the $2,500 and $5,000 minimum net capital
requirements of the Rule.23In addition, in a
two-part program to raise minimum net capital requirements for broker-dealers who
carry customers' accounts and hold customer funds and securities, the minimum
net capital required by the Rule rose in the
prior fiscal year from $5,000to $15,000,and
as of July 31,1974 became $25,000.24
Most Importantly, during the fiscal year,
the Commission took a significant second
step toward the implementation of a uniform net capital rule for broker-dealers, first
proposed in late 1972.25After release of the
proposal, a great number of constructive
comments were received and were carefully
considered by the Commission. During the
1974fiscal year, the Commission published
a revised proposed rule,26 substantially
changed to reflect many of the comments
received. The rule as adopted would
provide Uniform financial regulations, definitions and interpretations throughout the
securities industry including for the first
time exchange members within its scope
and would facilitate simplification of the financial reporting requirements for brokerdealers.
The new proposed rule does not change

the basic liquidity concept of the original
net capital rule under which the securities
industry has been operating for many years,
but does in some ways depart from the
present Rule. The rule would provide for the
flowing of net capital benefits from the subsldlartea held by broker-dealers to their
broker-dealer parents in amounts equivalent to the liquid assets of such subsidiaries.
In addition, the revised proposal substantially revises the present Rule's securities
"haircut" provisions, In recognition of the
liquidity of U.S. government securities and
certain other securities. The new proposed
rule also deals comprehensively with the
risks associated with the writing and
endorsement of options both by brokerdealers and their customers.

Financial Reporting
The Commission made two major revIsions to Rule 17a-5, the baSICfinancial reporting rule for broker-dealers, and to the
forms thereunder, which serve to determine
compliance by broker-dealers with applicable financial responsibility rules.
First, the Commission amended Rule
17a-5 and Form X-17A-5 under the Secunnes Exchange Act to permit independent public accountants to perform certain
preliminary audit procedures before financial audits of the statements of brokerdealers.27 To accomplish these changes,
Part III of Form X-17A-5 was adopted. That
Part requires the Independent accountant
to descnbe the scope of the preliminary
audit examination, indicate that the information is presented fairly and comment on
any material tnadequactes found to exist at
the date of the preliminary work. Part III also
requires certain statistical information regarding the examination and the preliminary audit procedures performed. Under
the amended Rule 17a-5 such a preliminary
audit examination may not take place
more than 190 days prior to the date of the
broker-dealers'
annual audit required
pursuant to Rule 17a-5(a).
The amendments are designed to accommodate the elimination by most registered national securities exchanges of their
surprise audit requirements. The amendments will also eliminate duplicate costs for
57

broker-dealers
which are public companies
and will lead to more effective audits and
more uniform
reporting
of financial
data
and provide greater flexibility
to the accountant.
The release announcing
the amendments
also provides the Commission's
interpretive
view of material inadequacies which should
be reported by accountants
In connection
with audits performed
pursuant
to Rule
17a-5
Secondly, Form X-17A-5 was amended28
to reflect the additional
information
necessary to monitor
compliance
with Rule
15c3-3 under the Exchange Act and to give
the Commission
sufficient
Information
to
analyze the effectiveness
of that Rule. Certain other amendments
to the form were
In the
made In recognition
of developments
securities Industry since 1967 affecting the
auditing
and financial
regulation
of
broker-dealers.
The amendments
also require Independent
accountants
to review
and comment
upon the procedures
followed in complying
with Rule 15c3-3 and
Regulation T of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System.
The amendments enable the Commission
and the self-regulatory
organizations
to
monitor compliance
with both the Reserve
Formula
Computation
required
by Rule
15c3-3 and the aspects of Rule 15c3-3 related to possession or control of customers'
fully paid for and excess margin securities.
In addition,
an Advisory Committee
on
Reports and Forms, convened by the Comrrussron, recommended
that many financial
reports required of broker-dealers
by the
Commission and the various self-regulatory
bodies be consolidated
Into a single "Key
Regulatory
Report"
Subsequently,
the
Commission
announced
a broad program
to Implement the recommendations
of thrs
Committee,
including plans to develop the
recommended
"Key Regulatory Report."29

Rule 17a-18, Rule 17a-19 and
Related Form X-17A-19
In order to promote more effective report.
Ing by the brokerage community,
the Commission proposed for public comment two
new rules and a related form. Proposed
Rule 17a-18
would
require
all self.
58

regulatory
organizations
to submit to the
Commission
for ItS advance approval any
new form, report or substantial amendment
which it intends to require its member firms
to subrnlt.s?
Proposed Rule 17a-19 and related Form
X-17A-19 are Intended to assist the Commission and SIPC in maintaining
accurate,
current lists of the memberships
of the selfregulatory
orqaruzatrons,
particutarly
With
respect to the SIPC designations
of prlncipal examining authorities
pursuant to Section 9(c) of the SIPC Act of 1970. At the
Comrnlssron
staff's request, all the selfregulatory organizations
Implemented
proposed Rule 17a-19 and began using proposed Form X-17A-19 on a pilot basis in
March 1974. In May 1974, the Commission
prepared a directory of SIPC designees and
broker-dealer
memberships.
In June, the
draft directory
was supplied
to all selfregulators and an exception report of those
firms which have not been examined Will be
produced. The Commission will use this report as a baSIS for reviewing the effectiveness of the self-regulatory
organizations'
examination
programs.

Broker-Dealer Examinations
The comrntssron in January 1972 established the Office of Broker-Dealer
Examination Program to deal more effectively WIth
the problems detarled in the Commission's
1971 Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practrees of Brokers and Dealers.31 By creating
thrs Office, the Commission
substantially
strengthened
its contlnurnq efforts to prevent a recurrence of the cnsis which confronted the secunties Industry In the years
1968 through
1970. During that period,
there occurred
widespread
failures
of
broker-dealer
firms, accompanied
by substantial customer
losses of cash and securities.
One major outgrowth
of these
cnses was the passage in 1970 of the Secunties Investor Protection
Act.
Dunng the past fiscal year, the Office has
primarily devoted its efforts to three areas of
activity: (1) early warning and surveillance:
(2) examination;
and (3) training. See also
pages 56-58 supra, for Information
on
other Commission
action relating to the financial responsibility
of brokers and dealers

Early Warning and Surveillance
Programs
The primary responsibility
for insuring
the financial and operational soundness of
ItS member firms rests with each selfregulatory organization.
The Commission
periodically reviews through on-site inspections and in-house studies the early warning
surveillance tools of the organizations
to
ensure that they constitute sound, effective
programs, which will enable each organization to detect at the earliest possible time
member firms which are In or approaching
financial difficulty and to morntor their conditions. DUring the past fiscal year, the
Commission's
staff conducted on-site inspections of the early warning and surveillance programs of the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the
PBW Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock
Exchange. In addition, the Commission's
staff reviewed the programs of the NASD as
Implemented by its district offices located In
Boston, New York, Dallas, Kansas City,
Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Denver and Washington, D.C. The staff
has also preliminarily
discussed with the
Boston Stock Exchange and the Midwest
Stock Exchange inspections of their programs scheduled for the early part of fiscal
1975.
In-house efforts to review these programs
have Included continuing communications
and Informal meetings with the organizations regarding revisions in their programs,
the morutorinq of the SIPC 5(a) program32
and the development
of a monthly early
warning and surveillance report
The Office IS planning to meet with the
self-regulatory
authorities, in Washington,
D.C., at the Commission to review precisely
each organization's
early warning and surveillance tools In a round-table,
informal
discussron session. Representatives from
SIPC will also attend the meeting to discuss
the SIPC 5(a) program and the organizations' experiences with this program. When
reviewing
their early warning
and surveillance programs, the Commission
ensures that the self-regulatory
authorities
are complying with the provisrons of Section 5(a) of the SIPC Act.
Working together with the NASD and the

self-regulatory
authorities
having SIPCdesrqnated examining responslbrllty.P the
Oornmlssron
has developed
a monthly,
combined early warning list and a Rule
17a-11 list for each regional office.34 This
combined list sets forth for each regional
office information
concerning any brokerdealer firm within ItS region which any selfregulatory authority has reported as In or
approaching
tlnancral
difficulty.
Each
month the self-regulatory
organizations
submit forthe combined list data pertaining
to the financial condition of troubled firms
within each Commission region. The list IS
then timely transmitted to each regional office chief examiner
for hrs verification
within 24 hours. The list incorporates all of
the features of the Commission's
early
warning rule, Rule 17a-11; at the same time
the list provides information
concerning
firms which may not be In violation of any
net capital rule to which they are subject,
but are, nevertheless, considered
by the
self-regulatory
organizations
to be financially troubled. Such a complete, timely list
had not existed before this fiscal year. It has
been of great assistance to the regional offices In monitoring such firms.
Other Commission
early warning and
surveillance
tools Include Rule 17a-11 ,
mentioned
above,
which
requires
a
broker-dealer to notify the Commission If it
breaks through certain specrfted financial
or operational
parameters; Rule 17a-5(j),
which requires a broker-dealer to notify the
Commission
upon the termination
of ItS
membership in one of several enumerated
national
securities
exchanges
If the
broker-dealer was exempt from the Comrmssion's net capital rule by reason of its
holding membership In and being subject to
the capital rules of that exchange; and Rule
17a-l0, which requires a broker-dealer to
file Form X-17A-10 annually with the Commission. The Commission
continues
to
rnorntor these programs, although some or
all of them may eventually be Incorporated
into the FinanCial and Operational
Combined Uniform Single Report being developed for the md ustry by the Report
Coordinating Group.35

Examination

Program

An effective examination program IS essential to the overall regulatory program of
59

any self-regulatory organization and of the
Commission.
The Commission's program for examinIng the self-regulatory organizations has
two parts. First, the Commission staff reviews and attempts to strengthen, where
necessary, their examination programs,
while at the same time evaluating and defining the goals, policies, procedures, design,
budget and staffing of those programs. During the past fiscal year, the Commission's
staff conducted on-site examination program inspections of those self-regulatory
organizations mentioned above at page
59, for which it conducted early warning
and surveillance inspections. Inspections of
the Boston Stock Exchange and the Midwest Stock Exchange were planned for the
early part of fiscal 1975.
While these reviews are Important, the
real test of these programs takes place In
direct examination of the members of the
self-regulatory organizations. The regional
offices are deemed to be in the best position
to conduct these examinations and to ascertain whether the stated policies and procedures of the national offices of the selfregulatory organizations are being implemented. The regional offices' oversight
programs involve (1) examinations of members of self-regulatory organizations to determine if they are in compliance with the
secunties laws, and (2) the examination of
individual members of the self-regulatory
organizations and a concurrent review of
the reports and working papers of the latest
examination of the individual members performed by those organizations to determine
whether their examination programs are
thorough and effective.
The Commission headquarters office
monitors the examination activities of the
regional offices, both in their review of selfregulatory organizations' examinations and
in their direct inspections of member firms,
and have frequent meetings With the field
officers to review the effectiveness of the
examination programs.
In addition to oversight examinations, the
regional offices conduct cause examinations and SECO examinations. Cause
examinations usually result from a complaint received by a customer or another
broker-dealer and are usually limited to the
60

subject matter of the complaint. The exammer may, however, enlarge the scope of the
examination If he believes that the firm's
operations warrant further study. SECO
examinations are usually routine examinations covering all aspects of a brokerdealer's operations. The regional offices
have established a regular examination
cycle in which each SECO broker-dealer36
is examined 30 to 60 days after it becomes
registered with the Commission and on an
annual basis thereafter.
In fiscal 1974, the Commission's regional
offices cond ucted a total of 1176 brokerdealer examinations, representing a 13 percent increase over the previous fiscal year's
total of 1044. Of the 1176 examinations
conducted, 478 were oversight examinations, 551 were cause examinations and 478
were routine examinations (mostly of SECO
flrms).37
Of great assistance to the Commission
and to the self-regulatory organizations in
the case of members of more than one such
organization, have been SIPC's designations pursuant to Section 9(c) of the SIPC
Act of one self-regulatory organization to
serve as a firm's principal examining authority.3s Designations were urged by the
Oommlssron because they would eliminate
much of the duplication in the examination
programs of the self-regulatory organizations.
Another step toward eliminating duplication of effort has been the Commission's
development of a monthly compilation of all
examinations of all broker-dealers conducted dunng the previous twelve months
by either a regional office of the Commission or a self-regulatory organization. The
Commission is currently working on two reVisions to the report in order to improve ItS
usefulness. First, the report will be modified
to Incorporate the SIPC designations of
principal examining authorities. Secondly,
the report will, as revised identify, in one
composite print-out for each SEC regional
office and NASD district office, every member firm of every self-regulatory body and
every broker-dealer situated Within that
[unsdictlon, and set forth all relevant information as to examinations conducted during the immediately preceding twelvemonth period.

The Commission has also made several
revisions in and additions to its examination
manual and fbrms. The Broker-Dealer
Examination Manual, used by the SEC examiners for background material and as a
guide for conducting examinations, was
updated and reprinted for distribution to the
regional offices. The Broker-Dealer Examination Checklist Standard Form, to be
used in examinations of broker-dealers
which conduct a general securities business, has been revised and distributed to
the regional offices. The regional offices
will use the revised checklist on an experimental basis for several months and then
comment on the checklist so that final revisions may be made.
The Commission also developed with its
regional office chief examiners a new
Broker-Dealer Examination Checklist
Short Form, to be used in examinations of
broker-dealers which do not conduct a
general securities business. A draft of this
checklist has also been forwarded to all regional offices for use on an experimental
basis for several months. After written
comments have been received, a new Short
Form will be adopted.

Training Program
In order to improve the caliber of the
examination staff of both the Commission
and the self-regulatory authorities, the
Commission developed a series of training
CdUrseS. Some were directed toward Commission examiners only and others toward
both the Commission examiners and the
self-regulatory organizations' examiners.
These training courses included:
1. A seriesof two-day training seminars
for all self-regulatory bodies on the subject
Of Commission oversight examinations in
regional offices. Each seminar, of which
there were several during the fiscal year,
provided a forum for the interchange of ex:
periences with, and suggestions~for, the
Commission's oversight examination programs.
2. A series of regionai two-day office
seminars for experienced regional office
examiners. Several of these seminars,
which focus o n actual examination
techniques, have been held by the regional
offices.

3. A five-day training program for new
broker-dealer examiners. A seminar was
conducted by the %ommission's Division of
Market Regulation on June 4-6. 1974, to
provide basic, updated information reoarding examiqationi of broker-dealers. participants included Commission compliance
examinerswhh unto threevearsexoerience
with the regional offices, various state securities commissions and several of the
self-regulatory organizations. The seminar
focused on the examination, earlv warnino
and surveillance programs of t h e ~ ~ o m m i s ~
Slon and the various self-regulatory organizations.
The participants in the seminar were
Oiven a case omblem which contained a setof a firm's books and records and facts relatino to the case. The use of such a case studv
method proved t o be extremely effective as
a training tool and will now become a regular part bf the Commission's training G o grams.
4. Regional Office Continuing Examiner
Training Program.
The regionai offices have been holding
brief bi-weekly training sessions for their
examiners. Such sessions are oenerailv one
or two hours long and provide updated or
new information concerning Specific
exammation matters, rules or regulations
and examination experiences.
5. Outside trainino- .oroorams. The Commission is encouraging its examiners in the
regional offices to take correspondence
and college courses. I t i s also assisting i n
the development of at least one correspondence course for examiners and has
been requested t o assist several selfregulatoryorganizations in developing their
training programs.

Financial and Operational
Combined Uniform Single
Report-FOCUS Report
in November 1973, the Commission staff
met with representatives o f the selfregulatory bodies to discusstheelimination
of Unnecessary reports now required of
broker-dealers. Recommendations regarding the format of a uniform "Key Regulatory
ReporC', since renamed the "FOCUS R e
port", were later submitted.

Upon the adoption of a uniform net capital rule, the FOCUS Report will provide a
uniform source of information for evaluatIng the financial and operational soundness
of brokers and dealers. Completion of the
form will require only a reasonable expenditure of effort by the member firm. An outline
for the FOCUS Report has been developed
by the Commission staff and will be considered by the Report Coordinating Group. The
final draft of the FOCUS Report is expected
to be completed shortly

Regulation of Small
Broker-Dealers
The Subcommittee on Government Regulation of the Senate Select Committee on
Small BUSiness held hearings on July 12
and 23, 1973, regarding the reporting burden on small broker-dealers. Testifying before the Senate Committee
were representatives from the small broker-dealer
community, various self-regulatory organizations, SIPC and the Cornrnisston.
Two documents came out ofthe hearings,
Senate Resolution No. 173 and a report of
the Senate Select Committee entitled The
Federal Paperwork
Burden.39 Both contained recommendations
aimed at alleviatIng reporting and other regulatory problems of small broker-dealers
brought out
during the hearings, the problems concerned unnecessary or duplicative reportIng requirements and the small firm's lack
of time, capital and qualified personnel to
complete the reports.
The Senate Resolution
directed
the
Commission to:
1. review and make appropriate amendments to ItS rules to reduce any unnecessary reporting burden on broker-dealers
and help to assure the continued participation of small broker-dealers in the United
States securities markets, consistent with
ItS statutory responsrbtlrtles to protect investors;
2. review and, If necessary, amend ItS
rules to assure that they take cognizance of
the role of small broker-dealers
in the
United States securrties market and permit
such broker-dealers to comply effectively
WIth the rules without unnecessary admin istrative burdens,
62

3. continue active consideration and implementation
of the recommendations
of
the SEC Advisory Committee
Study on
broker-dealers reports;
4. continue to review the position of the
small broker-dealer to ensure ItS continued
participation
in the secunties
markets
within the context of competitive policy and
the protection of Investors,
5. Immediately proceed to examine and
modify its rules to the extent the public
Interest IS not commensurate With the burden Imposed on small broker-dealers; and
6. report ItS progress to the Congress in
its annual report
The Senate
Report
recommended
additionally that:
1. the Congress consider enactment of
legislation which would direct the Cornmrssion to establish a JOint Committee
on
Small Broker-Dealers and to include on the
Committee representatives from both private and public regulatory agencies, major
and regional stock exchanges and from the
small broker-dealer community; this committee would be directed to develop:
(a) a standard, Industry-Wide definition of
the term "small broker-dealer",
and
(b) common pohcres regarding the role
and functions of the small broker-dealer in
the secunties Industry;
2. the Cornmrssron direct its Report Coordinating Group to set a definite timetable for
developing a uniform reporting system;
3. the Oornrrusslon ensure that the Report
Coordinating
Group include at least one
member of the small broker-dealer community; and
4. the Oornrmssron establish the posrtlon
of Small Broker-Dealer Liaison Officer, to
function
both as an advisor
and ombudsman for the interests of the small
broker-dealer community.
Commissum Action>Â« The Commission
recognizes, and has been working toward
alleviating,
the reporting
and regulatory
burden on all broker-dealers, and in particular small broker-dealers. Its efforts in this
area have Involved a contlnurnq review of
the rules, regulations and related brokerdealer reporting
requirements
imposed
not only by the Commission but also by
self-regulatory
organizations
and other
governmental agencies. Such efforts have

also involved the formation of Federal Advisory Committees including the Report
Coordinating Committee, with industrvwide participation to study these particular
reporting problems in the industry.
In particular, the Commission is responding as follows to the directivescontained in
the Senate Resolution:
1. The Commission's staff has been reviewina the financial and o~erationaireporting rules and related reporting requirements of the commission and of other
regulatory bodies in an effort to alleviate the
reporting burden on smail broker-dealers.
Thestaff recoanizesthesDecial orobiems of
small firms inihis area, and is making every
effort to reevaluate existinu requirements.
within thecontext of the
interest and
with a view toward ensuring the continued
participation of such firms h the securities
markets;
2.TheCommissfon is fully complying with
the Senate Resolution's directive as to the
recommendations of the SEC Advisory
Committee Study.
The first recommendation that a brokerdealer should be required to report to a
Single regulator in each area of regulation
has essentially been adopted by virtue of
SIPC's designations of sole reguiatory
aoencies. Dursuant to Section 9lcl of the
~icuritiei'investorProtection A C ~bf 1970.
Such desiunations became effective on
June 30, 1973.
Thesecond recommendation caiisforthe
establishment of the Report Coordinating
Group, which has been done. See below.
The third recommendation seeks to have
uniform registration laws adopted by ail
regulatory bodies. An industry-widead hoc
gmup has developed a proposed uniform
registration form for consideration by the
reguiatory organizations and the Commission. This area is the subject of activity of a
working Subcommittee of the Report Coordinating Group.
The fourth through seventh recommendations concern the formats and filing
frequencies for the uniform, industry-wide
Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report ("FOCUS Report")
which is to be developed. This proposed
report is one of the main projects of the
Report Coordinating Group.

The eighth through tenth recommendations deal with the availability of brokerdealer economic data, the adoption of uniform record retention rules and the securing of trading information from the exchange's own data base. These issues are
being considered by the Report Coordinating Group and the subcommittees thereof.
Regarding the Senate Report, the Commission believes the Committee's recommendation that Congress, through legislation, direct the Commission to establish a
Joint Committee on Small Broker-Dealers is
a constructive one. But there may be no
need to form a new committee. It would
appear appropriate and productive to utilize the already established advisory
committess, the SEC Advisory Committee
on the implementation of a Central Market
System and the Report Coordinating Group
(Advisory), which are already considering
the issues, in the course of their designated
responsibilities, which would be assigned
to such a committee.
The establishment of the .Report Coordinating Group under the Federal Advisory
Committee Act was announced by the
Commission on January 24,1974. Its members were selected in May 1974, and its first
meeting was held in July 1974. The four
subcommitteesoftheGroupaiso have been
meeting. The Group is tosubmit public recommendations on or before December 31,
1974. The Senate Report's recommendation that at least one respresentative of the
smail broker-dealer community be a member of the Report Coordinating Group has
been implemented.
AS to the Senate Report's call for the
establishment of the position of Smail
Broker-Dealer Liaison Officer, thecommission is presently formulating plans for a
broad program in this area.
In sum, the Commission has demonstrated its concern for the reporting burden
on all broker-dealers and, in particular, the
Smail broker-dealers in the securities industry by:
1. a review of the Commission's financial
and operational responsibility rules, all
other rules and regulations, and reiated reporting requirements;
2. the formation of the SEC Advisory
Committee on Broker-Dealer Reports and
63

RegIstration
Requirements-Report
Coordinating Group;
3. the formation of the SEC Broker-Dealer
Model
Compliance
Program
Advisory

Oomrruttee,
4. the formation
of the SEC Advisory
Oomrmttee on the tmplementation
of a Central Market System,
5. the development
of a nationwide clearance and settlement system, and
6. the consrderatlon
of legislative proposals.

Clearance and Settlement
Presently there are In operation a number
of clearing entitles40 and deposttones " atfillated wrtn national securities exchanges
or the NASD. During the fiscal year 1974,
numerous changes in or additions
to the
rules, practices,
and operations
of these
cleanng and depository
entitles were submitted to the Commission for ItS review and
consideratron
under various provisrons of
the secuntres
Exchange Act.42 The following are among the most siqnftcant Items on
which the Commission
acted favorably:
1. The National
Clearing
Corporation
("NCC"), a wholly owned subsrdrary of the
NASD, submitted proposed rule changes to
Initiate operation of a Free Account Net System ("FANS")
FANS allows NCC members
to leave securities With NCC to satisfy projected future settlements, thereby elrrnmatIng the need for a broker-dealer
to take delivery of securttres one day and return them
to NCC in satisfaction
of delivery obligations the next day. In reviewing FANS, the
Commission requested NCC to establish an
electronic
interface
With the Depository
Trust Company ("DTC"), the wholly owned
secunties deposrtory of the New York Stock
Exchange,
as expedinously
as possible.
Dunng
nscat
1974, DTC and NCC accomplished
an Interface which allows NCC
members and DTC members to deliver secunties to each other by bookkeeping
entry.
2. DTC and the Midwest Secunties Trust
Company ("MSTC"),
a wholly owned subsidrary of the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc
("MSE"),
have developed
a two-way link
which permits dual members of MSTC and
DTC to transfer stock by bookkeeping
entry
64

between
their DTC accounts
and their
MSTC accounts.
3. MSTC Will transfer all clearing activities
to a new wholly owned subsidlary
of the
MSE to be called Midwest Clearing Corporation.
4. The PaCIfiC Secunties Depository, the
wholly owned securities depository
of the
Pacific Stock Exchange,
Inc., applied for
and received
an exemption
pursuant
to
Rules 8c-1(g) and 15c2-1(g) under the Exchange Act 43

Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SIPC)
SIPC was established
by the Secuntres
Investor Protection Act of 1970 ("SIPC Act")
to provide certain protections to customers
of SIPC members. It IS a non-profit
membership corporation,
most of its members
are registered
brokers
and dealers and
members of national secunties exchanges.
WhIle SIPC IS funded primarily through assessments on ItS members, it may borrow
under certain conditions
up to $1 billion
from the United States Treasury.
During frscal year 1974, the Chatrrnan of
SIPC formed a Special Task Force to recommend to the SIPC Board of DIrectors
changes In the SIPC Act. The Special Task
Force, which Included a representative
of
the Commission,
has made ItS report and
recommendatrons
to the SIPC Board.
In 1973 SIPC deSignated
princrpal
examining authorities (in regard to applicable
nnancrat
responarbillty
rules) for SIPC
members whrch are members of more than
one self-regulatory
orqamzatton.w
As noted
above, the Commission
believes that these
desrqnatrons
are Important
first steps in
eliminating
unnecessary
and burdensome
duplication
of examtnanons
and reporting
requirements
in the Industry.
In August 1973. the Comrnlssron set forth
ItS positron that, In the case of those of its
members for which It was not the SIPCdesignated pnncipal examining authority, a
self-regulatory
organization
would not be In
derogation
of ItS responsjblhtres
under the
Exchange
Act to police the financial
responsrbihty rules as to ItS members If It deferred to the designated exarrunq authority.4s

Rule Changes Related to SIPC
DUring the fiscal year, the Oomrnleeron
adopted
Rule S6d-1 and related forms
under the SIPC Act.46 Section 6(d)(1) of the
SIPC Act provides for the completion
by a
SIPC Act trustee of those "open contractual
commitments"
effected
by another
broker-dealer
wrth the debtor In which a
customer
had an interest.
Rule S6d-1
places certain limitations
on the commitments of a debtor which are eligible for
completion.
Basically, the Rule permits the completion of only those fails-to-receive
and failsto-deliver (as defined in the Rule) which: (1)
arose from a current transaction
In which a
broker was acting as agent for a customer,
or a dealer was acting for a customer
In
certain narrowly defined principal transactions; (2) are not stale as of the filing date;
(3) are promptly disposed of in accordance
with the provisions ofthe Rule-normally
by
bUyIng In or seiling out; and (4) are promptly
reported to the trustee and supported
by
appropriate
documentation.
On May 1, 1974, the Commission
announced a proposal to adopt securrtres Exchange Act Rule 15b-1 and to amend Rule
15b~ 1 and Form BDW thereunder 47 The
proposed rules and the form provide that in
the case of Commission
revocation or cancellation
of the registration
of a brokerdealer, or a broker-dealer's
WIthdrawal of its
registration,
the effectiveness
of such revocatron, cancellation
or withdrawal would be
delayed for one year for purposes of the
SIPC Act only. Thus, the protections
of the
SIPC Act would be available to the customers of such a broker-dealer
during that
period.

Litigation Relating to SI PC
In SEC v. Guaranty Bond and Securities
Corp.48 the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit held that the protections
of the SIPC
Act were available
to customers
of a
broker-dealer
who, although Insolvent prior
to the effectIve date of the Act, continued to
transact a substantial busmess In securities
after the Act had become effective.
The
Court of Appeals also held that a receiver of
the broker-dealer
appointed
by the district

court had standing to bring an action on
behalf of customers of the broker-dealer
to
compel SIPC to initiate llqurdation proceedIngs under the Act. In its brief in the Court of
Appeals, the Commission
had argued in
support of the first point but had urged that
the receiver had no standing as to SIPC.
SIPC then filed with the U.S. Supreme
Court a pennon for a wrrt of certiorari seekIng reversal of the decision by the Court of
Appeals.
The
Commission
filed
a
memorandum
WIth respect to the petition
stating ItS view that the Court of Appeals
that the receiver of a
erred In concluding
broker-dealer
has an implied right to file an
action to compel SIPC to fulfill its statutory
oblrqatrons. The Commission stated in the
memorandum
that a premature
action
brought by a customer to compel the institution of tlquidatron proceedings
may adversely effect recourse to viable alternatives
that might be in the public interest. The Supreme Court in October 1974 agreed to review the questions whether a customer of a
broker-dealer
had standing to sue SIPC for
ttus kind of relief and whether the receiver
could act on behalf of the customers.

SECO Broker-Dealers
Under the Exchange Act, the Commission
IS responsible for establishing
and administering rules on qualrtrcatron standards and
business conduct of broker-dealers
who are
not members of the NASD in order to provide regulation
of these SECO brokerdealers comparable to that provided by the
NASD for its members.
DUring the fiscal year, the number of
nonmember
broker-dealers
registered With
the Commission
Increased from 276 to 300
and the number of associated persons of
such firms (r.e., partners, officers, directors
and employees not engaged in merely clericalor ministerial functions) Increased from
16,303 to 18,606.
On October
19, 1973, the Commission
announced the adoption of Rule 15b1Q-10
under the Exchange Act, which prohibits
certain reciprocal
brokerage
practices
by
SECO broker-dealers
49 A similar
rule had
been adopted by the NASD, as described in
the Oornrnlssron's
last annual report.50
Rule 15b1Q-10 prohtbrts SECO broker65

dealers from (1) favoring or disfavoring
the
distribution
of shares of open-end
investment companies on the basts of "brokerage
commission"
received;
(2) soliciting
or
making promises of an amount or percentage of brokerage commissions
In connection with the distribution
of such Investment
company
shares; and (3) seeking orders
for the execution
of portfolio transactions
on the basis of their sales of fund shares.
Rule 15b9-2 imposes an annual assessment to be paid by nonmember
brokerdealers to defray the cost of regulation. During the fiscal year, the Commission
increased the base fee from $175 to $250 and
the fee for each associated person from $10
to $12.51 Additionally,
Form SECD-S, required
pursuant
to Rule 15b9-1,
was
amended to Increase the initial fee paid by
nonmember
broker-dealers
from $150 to
$500.

OTHER COMMISSION
CHANGES
Mortgage

RULE

Market Exemptions

The Commission
has been working with
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (" FHLMC") to clarify the applicability
of
Federal securities
laws to Amminet
lnc.,
which was established under FHLMC sponsorship to operate an automated trading information
system designed to promote a
more hquid secondary market for residential mortgages.52 The system would list offerings to buy and sell (1) governmentguaranteed
and non-guaranteed
aggregated and individual whole loan mortgages;
(2) certain participation
Interests in such
mortgages,53
(3) commitments
for such
mortgages;54
(4) FHLMC-guaranteed
particrpatron certificates,
and (5) Government
National
Mortgage
Association
passthrough SeCUritles.55
During the 1973 fiscal year, the Commission adopted
Rule 3a12-1 under the Exchange Act56 to classify as "exempted
securities" those mortgages as defined in the
Emergency
Home Finance
Act of 1970,
which are or have been sold by FHMLC. As
part of its contlnurnq
effort in this area the
Commission,
during the 1974 fiscal year,
66

adopted Rule 3a12-4 and rescinded Rule
15a-1 under the Exchange Act.57 The princrpal effect of Rule 3a12-4 is to exempt from
the registration
and financial requirements
of Section 15 of the Exchange Act brokerdealers who deal, under specified
conditions, solely in mortgage securities (as defined In the Rule) or other exempted securities. Rule 15a-1 had provided an exemption
only from the registration
requirement.
Transactions
in secuntles so exempted are
still subject to antifraud
provisions of the
Exchange Act.

Real Estate Investment
Securities

Contract

On June 7, 1974, the Comrnlssron released for comment proposed Rule 3a12-5
under the Securities
Exchange
Act.58 If
adopted, the Rule would exempt from Sections 7 and 11 (d)(1) of the Act (both of which
deal with the extension or maintenance
of
credit to purchase securities) subject to various conditions,
certain investment
contract secunties mvolvmq the direct ownership of specified
residential
real property
offered by broker-dealers.
In the release, the
Commission stated its preliminary view that
the unique characteristics
of investment
contract
secuntles
involving
the direct
ownership
of specified
residential
real
property (particularly
the traditional
modes
of financing
real property and the lack of
any secondary
trading
market therefor)
make It unlikely
that the concerns
addressed by Sections 7 and 11 (d)(1) Will be
present.
On the same day the Commission
released proposed Rule 3a12-5, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System
announced
that it had deferred, until December21,
1974, an amendment to Regulation T. The amendment would have the effect of treating the extension of credit on
any part of an Investment contract security
as credit on the entire security and would
prohibit broker-dealers
from arranging for
such credit unless collateralized
In compliance with the req uirements of Regulation

T.
The Commission
is presently considering
the comments
received on proposed Rule
3a12-5.

Corporate

Repurchase

Programs

On December 6, 1973, the Commission
released for public comment a revision of
proposed Rule 13e-2 and a related amendment to Rule 10b-6 under the Securities
Exchange Act. Both are designed to prevent
an Issuer from effecting repurchases of ItS
own stock that may have a manipulative
or
misleading Impact on the trading market In
the Issuer's secuntles."
Proposed
Rule 13e-2 specifies
conditions under which an issuer whose equity
securities
are registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act may repurchase
such securities
in the open market or in
negotiated transactions
It also provides for
specific regulation
in connection
with repurchases
by broker-dealer
Issuers. The
proposed amendment to Rule 10b-6 would
provide an exemption
from that Rule for
purchases
by an issuer pursuant
to the
terms and conditions of Rule 13e-2, Absent
the exemption,
the purchases might have
been prohibited
by the existence
of outstanding convertible securities, warrants or
distributions
pursuant to certain employee
plans.
In reproposing
Rule 13e-2 the Commission specifically
solicited
comments
regarding whether an Issuer should be requrred to disclose a repurchase program
and, if so, the manner and content of such
disclosure,
and whether purchases by certain persons, such as officers, directors, or
insiders of an Issuer, should be exempted,
conditionally
or unconditionally,
from the
prohibitions
of the Rule.

Confirmation Requirements
Periodic Transactions

for

On March 15, 1974, the Commission
released for public
comment
a proposed
amendment
to Rule 15c1-4.60 The amendment is Intended to reduce the economic
burden of the confirmation
requirements
of
Section 11 (d)(2) of the Securities Exchange
Act and Rule 15c1-4, with respect to mutual
fund investment
plans, particularly
those
involving
small and periodic
purchases,
without significantly
lessenrng Investor protections.
The proposed amendment
would permit

principal
underwriters
or their agents to
delay sending confirmations
for up to 90
days to Investors purchasing
mutual fund
shares under certain employer-sponsored
plans and certain tax-qualified
plans, and
for as long as 30 days to Investors purchasIng mutual fund shares under specified
tax-qualified
individual
retirement
plans.
The confirmations
would be required to
summarize
all transactions
within the respective 90- or 30-day periods and could be
sent in bulk to the employer or other designated person for distribution
to participants
In group plans In addition, under the rule,
an employer
or designated
person could
collect and remit participants'
payments for
fund shares provided such funds were remitted promptly to the broker-dealer,
but
not later than 30 days after receipt.

Short Sale Regulation
On March 4,1974, the Commission
proposed amendments
to Rules 3b-3, 10a-1
and 10a-2 to establish
comprehensive
short sale regulation
for securities
which
will be traded in the planned pentral market
system for listed securitles.s" The Commission Indicated In ItS Policy Statement on the
Structure
of a Central
Market
System
(March 29, 1973) that the adoption of more
complete and effective short sale regulation
was one of the first of a series of steps the
Commission
had under consideration
to
Implement the proposals made therein, particularly in view of current plans to Implement a composite
last sale reporting
system. The proposed amendments
reflect the
recommendations
which were made to the
Commission by ItS Advisory Committee on a
Central Market System and which are contained in that Committee's
Interim Report to
the Commission
on Regulation Needed to
Implement
a Composite
Transaction
Reporting System (October 11, 1972).

NOTES TO PART 3
'in March 1971, the Executive Committee
of the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago
adopted a resolution to close the Board's
securities market. The Board has not, however, withdrawn
its registration.
2 Under legislation
proposed to the Congress (H.R. 5050), the Ocrnrnissron would be
given the authority
to review and amend

PART 4
ENFORCEMENT

PART 4
ENFORCEMENT

The Ocrnrntsston's enforcement activities, which are designed to combat securities fraud and other illegal activities,
continued at a high level during the past
year. These activities encompass civil and
criminal court actions as well as administrative proceedings conducted internally.
Where violations of the securities laws are
established, the sanctions which may result
range from censure by the Commission to
prison sentences imposed by a court. The
enforcement program is designed to
achieve as broad a regulatory impact as
possible within the framework of resources
available to the Commission. In light of the
capability of self-regulatory and state and
local agencies to deal effectively with certain securities violations, the Commission
seeks to promote effective coordination
and cooperation between its own enforcement activities and those of other agencies.

DETECTION
Complaints
The Commission receives a large volume
of communications from the public. These
consist mainly of complaints against
broker-dealers and other members of the
securities community as well as complaints
concerning the market price of particular
securities. During the past year, some 5,300
complaints against broker-dealers were received, analyzed and answered. Most of the
above mentioned complaints dealt with operational problems, such as the failure to
deliver securities or funds promptly, or the

alleged mishandling of accounts. In addrtion, there were some 6,000 complaints received concerning Investment advisers, issuers, banks, transfer agents and mutual
funds.
The Commission seeks to assist persons
in resolving complaints and to furnish requested information. Thousands of investor
complaints are resolved through staff inquiries to the firms involved. While the
Oornmissron does not have authority to arbitrate private disputes between brokerage
firms and Investors or directly to assist investors in the legal assertion of their personal rrghts, a complaint may lead to the
institution of an investigation or an.,enforcement proceeding, or it may be referred
to a self-regulatory or local enforcement
agency.

Market Surveillance
To enable the Commission to carry out
surveillance of the securities markets, its
staff has devised procedures to identify
possible violative activities. These Include
surveillance of listed securities, which is
coordinated with the market surveillance
operations of the New York, Amerrcan and
regional stock exchanges.
The Commission's market surveillance
staff maintains a continuous watch of
transactions on the NewYork and Amerrcan
Stock Exchanges and reviews reports of
large block transactions to detect any unusual prrce and volume variations. Also the
financial news tickers, financial publications and statrstloal services are closely fol73

lowed In addition, the staff has supplemented Its regular reviews of dally and
penodrc market surveillance reports of exchanges with a program for review of special surveillance
reports, which provide a
more In depth analysis of the information
developed by the exchanges
For those secuntres traded by means of
the NASDAQ system, the Commission has
also developed
a surveillance
program,
which IS coordinated with the NASD's market surveillance staff, through a review of
weekly and special stock watch reports.
secuntrss not
For those over-the-counter
traded through NASDAQ, the Comrrussron
uses automated equipment to provide an
efficient and comprehensive surveillance of
stock quotations drstnbuted by the National
Quotation Bureau This IS programmed to
Identify, among other things, unlisted securities whose price movement or dealer interest vanes beyond specined limits In a preestablished time period When a secunty IS
so Identified, the equipment prints out current and hrstonc market information
Other
programs supplement this data with information concerning sales of secunnes pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act,
ownership reports, and penodrc company
filings such as quarterly and annual reports
Trus data, combined with other available information, IS analyzed for possible further
mquiry and enforcement action
In addition, recognizing
that the computer
provides
the most expedrtious
method of reviewing and analyzing the voluminous trading data generated by the secuntres markets, the Comrmssron has developed a program which provides an analysrs of the bid listings for each security by
summarizing specrtred types of activity by
each broker-dealer
firm subrmttrnq pnce
quotations for that particular security
The staff also oversees cash tender offers,
exchange offers, proxy contests and other
activities involving efforts to change control
of public corporations.
Such oversight involves not only review of trading markets In
the secunnes Involved, but also filings with
the Commission
of required schedules,
prospectuses, proxy matenal and other intormation
74

INVESTIGATIONS
Each of the acts administered
by the
Commission authonzes investigations by It
to determine If Violations have occurred.
Most of these are conducted by the Comrnrssron's regional offices. Investigations
are carned out on a confidential basis, consistent With effective law enforcement and
the need to protect persons against whom
unfounded charges might be made Thus,
the existence or results of a non public investigation are generally not divulged unless they are made a matter of public record
In proceedings
brought before the Comrrussron or In the courts. Dunng fiscal year
1974, a total of 382 investigations
were
opened, as against 472 the preceding year.

Litigation Involving Commission
Investigations
Wlchard v. TPO, Incorporated'
was an acnon brought by a customer against her
broker-dealer, charging Violations of the antifraud provisrons of the federal secunties
laws The plaintiff moved, pursuant to Rule
34 of the Federal Rules of CIVil Procedure,
to compel the production of transcnpts of
deposrtrons of the broker-dealer's
officers
and directors, taken dunng a private investigation conducted by the Commission. The
Commission
submitted
a memorandum,
amicus cunee, In response to the request of
the court that the Oomrnrssion generally advise the court of ItS POSition With respect to
the proposed discovery
In ItS memorandum,
the Commission
reaffirmed the POSItion It earlier had outlined In a memorandum It had filed In ln re
Four Seasons Securtttes Law Litlgatlon.2
When discovery IS sought In CIVil IIgitatlon of
transcripts of testimony given or documents
submitted In a Commission investigation, If
the witness who gave the testimony or produced the documents opposes such discovery, he should have the opportunity to
present to the court any objections he may
have, including those based on lack of relevancy or privilege. In the event the witness'
objections are overruled and he does not
then have the transcripts
or documents
sought,
the witness
should obtain the
transcnpt or documents from the Cornrrus-

sion pursuant to the court's order. Should a
subpoena be Issued to the Commission for
transcripts
or documents
which, If requested by a witness, would be obtainable
under Rule 6 of its Rules Relating to lnvestigations,a the Commission may resist compliance with the subpoena until the witness
has had an opporturuty to bring to the court's
attention whatever objections he may have
to production, or the Commission may Itself
object
to disclosure
on Independent
grounds
In ItS memorandum, the court, agreeing
with the procedures outlined by the Comrrussron, ordered the broker-dealer and the
other defendant to obtain copies of the requested transcripts from the Commission
and to submit them to the court for inspection In camera so that the court could determine their relevancy to the issues presented in the case.

ENFORCEMENT

PROCEEDINGS

The Commission
has available a wide
range of possible enforcement remedies It
may, in appropriate cases, refer ItS files to
the Department of Justice with a recommendation for criminal prosecution.
The
penalties upon conviction are specified In
the various statutes and include Imprisonment for substantial terms as well as fines.
The securities laws also authorize the
Commission to file injunctive actions In the
Federal district courts to enjoin continued
or threatened Violations of those laws or
applicable Commlssron rules. In injunctive
actions the Oornrnlssron has frequently
sought to obtain ancillary relief under the
general equity powers ofthe Federal district
courts The power of the Federal courts to
grant such relief has been Judicially recognized. The Commission has often requested
the court to appoint a receiver for a brokerdealer or other business where Investors
were likely to be harmed by continuance of
the existing management. It has also requested, among other things, court orders
restricting future activities of the defendants, requiring that rescrssion be offered to
secunties
purchasers,
or requiring
drsgorgement
of the defendants'
,II-gotten
gains.
The SEC's primary function is to protect

the pubhc from fraudulent and other unlawful practices and not to obtain damages for
Injured individuals
Thus, a request that
disgorgement be required is predicated on
the need to deprive defendants of profits
derived from their unlawful conduct and to
protect the public by deterring such conduct by others.
If the terms of any injunctive decree are
Violated, the Commlssron may file Criminal
contempt proceedings, as a result of which
the Violator may be fined or Imprisoned.
The Federal securities acts also authorize
the Commission to Impose remedial administrative
sanctions
Most commonly,
administrative
enforcement
proceedings
Involve alleged Violations of the secunties
acts or regulations by firms or persons engaged In the securities business, although
the Oomrmssron'sjunadlctton extends to all
persons Generally speaking, if the Commission finds that a respondent Willfully violated a provisron of or rule under the securities acts, failed reasonably to supervise
another person who committed a Violation,
or has been convicted for or enjoined from
certain types of misconduct,
and that a
sanction IS In the public interest, It may revoke or suspend
the registration
of a
broker-dealer or Investment adviser. bar or
suspend any person from the securrtres busmess or from association with an investment company, or censure a firm or lndivrdual. Proceedings may also cover adequacy
of disclosure In a registration statement or
In reports filed With the Commission. Such a
case may lead to an order suspending the
effectiveness of a registration statement or
directing
compliance
With reporting
requirernents The Commission also has the
power to summarily suspend trading In a
security when the public Interest requires.
Proceedings
are frequently
completed
Without hearings where respondents waive
their right to a hearing and submit settlement offers consenting to remedial action
which the Comrnlssron accepts as an appropriate disposition
of the proceedings.
The Commission tries to gear its sanctions
In both contested and settlement cases to fit
the circumstances
of the particular case
For example, It may limit the sanction to a
particular branch office of a broker-dealer
ratherthan sanction the entire firm, prohibit
75

only certain kinds of activity by the brokerdealer during a period of suspension or only
prohibit an individual from engaging in
supervisory activities.
A chart listing the various types of enforcement proceedings, as well as statistics
on such proceedings are located In the
statistical section.

ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS
Summarized below are some of the many
administrative proceedings pending or disposed of In fiscal 1974.
First Mid America. Inc. (FMA).4-ln this
administrative proceeding against a New
York Stock Exchange member firm, its president, senior vice-president and whollyowned subsidiary, the Commission found,
pursuant to offers of settlement submitted
by the respondents without admitting or
denying the charges, that the respondents
had violated antifraud and antlrnarupulatrva
provisrons of the Securities and Securities
Exchange Acts. Specifically it was found
that FMA prematurely closed an underwriting of debentures which It was comanaging and retained over $1,500,000
of the securities In ItS own account. FMA
then entered NASDAQ as a market maker In
the debentures, and dominated, controlled
and artificially maintained the market and
price for these securities FMA was also
found to have used Increased compensation and a sales contest for its employees to
distribute its position In the securities
withm a short period to ItS customers
without disclosing its manipulative activities.
FMA and its subsidiary were suspended
for 60 days from underwriting and overthe-counter trading activities subject to certain conditions. FMA's president was suspended from association with a brokerdealer for nine months and thereafter barred from such association in a supervisory
capacity, except that he may apply to the
Commission for removal of the bar after two
years. FMA's senior vice-president was suspended from association with a brokerdealer for 60 days and from association as a
director for an additional 120 days.
A. P. Montgomery & Co., Inc.576

Administrative proceedings were instituted
on January 30, 1974, against twenty-seven
respondents, including partnerships and
corporations organized to invest in securities and three broker-dealers and certain
Individuals charging violations of the antifraud, anti manipulative, short sale, margin
and recordkeeping provisions of the Exchange Act. The order for proceedings alleged that respondents, other than the
broker-dealers, made short sales of certain
sscunues to the broker-dealer respondents
after they had given indications of Interest
to purchase the same class of securities
covered by pending registration statements
relating to "secondary offerings" of socalled "cold Issues" The short sales were
effected prior to the effective dates of the
registratIOn statements and were subsequently covered by shares obtained in the
offerings. The broker-dealer respondents in
turn resold the shares prior to the effective
dates of the registration statements. The
short sales were part of a scheme to manipulate the price of the securities. Ten of the
securities were listed for trading on various
exchanges and five were traded over-thecounter. The order also alleged that the short
sales were effected in cash accounts rather
than In margin accounts as a result of which
the respondent customers avoided making
the necessary initial margin deposits.
Eleven respondents thus far have consented to sanctions by the Commission in
this matter. The registration of one brokerdealer has been revoked and other respondents have been suspended or barred
from certain activities for periods up to one
year. As a result of the investigation of this
practice known as "shorting
into secondary offerings," the Commission has issued proposed Rules 10b-20 and 10b-21
governing short sales prior to secondary offerings and other practices in connection
with the marketing of secunnes.s
Holland Andrews & Perrier.-This
administrative proceedings arose out of the
Accurate Calculator Corp. matter, the subject of a companion civil action. In its respective Findings and Orders, the Commission found that Holland, Andrews & Perrier,
a Canadian broker-dealer, Alan Perrier,7 and
Chartered New England Corp," violated the
registration provisions of the Securities Act

10 that they offered for sale, sold or delivered after sale shares of the common stock
of Accurate when no registration statement
was on file or 10 effect with respect to said
secuntres.
In each case the respondents
consented
to the Commission's
Findrnqs
and Order without admitting or denyrnq the
allegations

Chartered New England Corp. 10 addition
to consenting to a 10-day suspension of its
over-the-counter
retail operations,
undertook to continue certam pollcies and prornvotvmq (a) the securing
of
cedures

Holland Andrews & Perrier and Alan Perrier were barred from association
With a
broker-dealer
With the proviso that Alan
Perrier might reapply to the Commission
after a period of two years to become so
associated in a non-supervisory
capacity.

TRADING

SUSPENSIONS

The Securities Exchange Act authonzas
the Commission
summanly
to suspend
trading in a security traded on either a national securities exchange or 10 the overthe-counter
market for a penod of up to 10
opmlon, such
days If, 10 the Commission's
action IS required 10 the public interest.
During fiscal 1974, the Commission
suspended trading
in the securities
of 279
companies, an mcrease of 60 percent over
the 174 secunties suspended 10 fiscal 1973
and almost a 400 percent increase over the
47 securities
suspended
10 fiscal 1972. In
most mstances, this action was taken either
because of substantial
questions as to the
adequacy, accuracy or availability of public
information
concerning
the companies'
financial condition or business operations or
because of transactions
in the companies'
securities
suggesting
possible manipulation or other violations.
The Commission
during fiscal 1974 suspended tradrnq also in the securities of a
substantial number of Issuers who were delinquent in filing required reports with the
Commission. This was done in order to alert

the public to the lack of adequate, accurate
and current information
concerning
such
Issuers.
On October
18, 1973 the Commission
suspended tradmq in all securities of Seainitiboard Ccrporatron." The Commission
ated the suspension
of trading because of
questions which had been raised concern109. (a) the adequacy and accuracy of disclosures made in Seaboard's
registration
statement covering a pnor sale of 500,000
Seaboard
Units (consistmq
of common
stock and warrants),
and in filings made
With the Commission
subsequent
thereto;
(b) certain activities
engaged 10 by Seaboard in connection With ItS management of
four registered investment companies With
current net assets of approximately
$90 million (Admiralty Fund, Inc., Competitive Capital Fund, Seaboard
Leverage Fund, Inc,
and The Income Fund of Boston); and (c)
the possible terrnmation
by the aforementioned Investment
companies
of their investment contracts
With Seaboard which
are Seaboard's
pnmary source of mcorne,
In addition, the Commission
had been informed
that the Investment
companies
under Seaboard's management
had voluntarily terminated
sales of new shares. Seaboard was the underwriter
for these mvestment companies

necessary to make Informed investment decisrons, One of the fundamental elements to
the success of this disclosure scheme is the
timely filing of required reports In proper
form.10
In the latter part of fiscal 1973 the Commissron became aware of two disturbing
trends in thrs area. First, there appeared to
be a general increase in the number of regrstrants which had failed to comply With
the Exchange Act reporting requirements.
Secondly, there were mdlcattons that registrants in certain industries, which were experiencing
detenorating
business
conditions, failed to comply with the Act's report77

Ing requirements
more often than other registrants.
On June 11, 1973 the Commission
publicly expressed ItS concern with the many
registrants
who failed timely to file Exchange Act reports In proper form."
The
staff then went to work to develop and implement a program
(1) to monitor
compliance by registrants with the reporting requirernents and (2) to take prompt enforcement action where registrants
were delinquent
During the 1974 fiscal year, the Commission suspended trading in the secuntres of
nearly 200 registrants
solely because of
their failure to file required reports. With few
exceptions,
the duration of such suspensions was ten days While the majority of
such registrants could be characterized
as
small In terms of net assets and number of
shareholders,
many of such registrants had
secuntres listed for trading on a national
secunties exchange and thus enjoyed the
recognition
and market
appertaining
thereto.
An example of the type of action taken
under thrs program was the suspension of
trading In the securities of 48 registrants for
the ten day paned commencing April 11, 1974
As a result of diligent staff rnqurry, each of
these registrants
was found to be deunquent at the least In filing its Annual Report
on Form 1D-K for its fiscal year ending in
1972.12
During this fiscal year the Commission
also brought a civil injunctive action against
registrant First Wisconsin
Mortgage Trust
("First Wisconsin"),
a Massachusetts
real
estate Investment trust, solely on the basis
of its failure to comply with the reporting
requuernents.P
Its shares of beneficial
interest are listed for trading on the New
York Stock Exchange At the time the action
was commenced
First Wisconsin
was alleged to be delinquent
In filing its Annual
Report on Form 1D-K for ItS fiscal year
ended December 31, 1973 and ItS quarterly
report on Form 7-0 for the fiscal quarter
ended March 31, 1974. In trus action the
Commission seeks, inter eue, an order compelling First Wisconsin to file forthwith the
delinquent
reports with the Commission
and permanently
enjoining First Wisconsin
from again violating the reporting require78

ments This matter is pending.
In addition to the First Wisconsin action,
the staff has done substantial
work with a
view to fu rther litigation involving other regrstrants delinquent
in filing reports.
The program
IS expected
to result in
prompter Commission
responses to delinquent reporting.
It is anticrpated
that the
program will encompass
substantially
all
Exchange
Act reports.
Beyond mducrnq
compliance
with Exchange Act reporting
requirements,
It IS hoped that this program
will bring about an Increased public awareness of the Importance
of the Act's reportIng provisions.

CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
Dunng fiscal 1974, the Commission
instituted a total of 148 injunctive actions. Some
of the more noteworthy
of these injunctive
proceedings
and Significant developments
in actions instituted In earlier years are reported below. Coordination
between selfregulatory
bodies and the DIvision of Enforcement
resulted In several enforcement
actions, in addition to investigations.
In S.E.C. v, Shapiro 14 the Court of Appeals
for the Second Oircurt affirmed a judgment
of the district court15 which permanently enjoined Norman Berman, a merger and acqursitrons broker, from further violations of
the antifraud
provlsrons
of the Exchange
Act. The order in addition required Berman
to disgorge all profits he denved from trading in the stock of Harvey's Stores, Inc.
("Harvey's")
on the basis of material nonpublic Information
relating to the existence
and progress of merger negotiations
involving Harvey's and Ridge Manor Development
Co ("Ridge
Manor"),
and the ramifications of a merger. Berman had acquired the
Information
In acting as a finder and partieipant In the merger discussions.
The court
agreed with the district court that Berman
had violated the antifraud provlsions by his
own trading and by "tipping"
others about
the merger negotiations.
Although
Berman admitted that he had
acquired inside information,
he contended
that, at the time of each of his purchases of
Harvey's stock, the prospects for a merger
between Harvey's and Ridge Manor were so
remote that Information
concerning
a pos-

.>

sible merger was not material, and therefore
was not required to be disclosed. The court
noted that facts are deemed material if a
reasonable investor might have considered
them Important in the making of an investment decision. Citing S.E.C. v. Texas Gulf
Sulphur CO.16the court stated that whether
facts relating to a future event are material IS
dependent "upon a balancing of both the
Indicated
probability
that the event will
occur and the anticipated magnitude of the
event In light of the totality of the company
activity"
In applying the test, the court
found that even at the time of the first of
seven purchases by Berman of Harvey's
stock two significant events had occurred
which dictated a conclusion that the information concerning a proposed merger was
material. In any event, the court found It
unnecessary to "speculate as to how a reasonable investor might have received this
Information"
in view of the substantial
amounts of Harvey's stock purchased by
Berman and other persons in possession
of the information
The court rejected Berman's contention
that he should not be enjoined because It
was not shown that he acted In bad faith,
and determined that a likelihood of future
violations was indicated since Berman engaged in not one but seven purchases of
Harvey's stock In violation of Rule 10b-5,
and that these violations occurred In the
context of his regular business as a "corporate marnage broker." As to this latter factor, the court stated that, "[o]ne who has
displayed such frailty in the past and faces
so many temptations in the future may well
need the admonition
of an injunction
to
obey the law."
The court further ruled that the district
court's approach-in
requiring Berman to
disgorge
not the actual profits realized
when he sold shares In Harvey's after public
disclosure of the material information,
but
the "paper"
profits which had earlier accrued as of the date of public disclosurewas reasonable and did not Involve the imposition of a penalty. In effect, under the
disgorgement order Berman had to surrender more profits than he actually realized
since the price of Harvey's stock dropped
after public disclosure. To hold otherwise,
the court observed, "would emasculate the

deterrent effect of Rule 10b-5."
S.E.C. v. Bausch & Lomb Inc. 17_ This
case Involves the drssernmatron
and improper disclosure and use of inside information concerning
Bausch & Lomb's disappointing sales and earnings from its soft
contact lens Defendant Richard J Clancy,
formerly a partner In the investment advisory firm of another defendant, without admitting or denying the allegations
in the
complaint, consented to a permanent injunction enjoining him from future violations Similar to those alleged In the complaint He consented also to a Oornrrussron
suspension of the effective date of the application for registration as an Investment
adviser of Clancy Management
Corp of
which he IS the sole stockholder,
officer,
and dlrector.18 The action as to the remainIng defendants IS In the discovery phase
SEC v. Geon Industries Inc.19-Qn
Apnl2,
1974, the ccrnrmssron,
after a [omt investigation with the American Stock Exchange,
filed a complaint against Geon, ItS chairman, chief fmancral officer, a comptroller of
a Geon suosidrary, a registered representative, his broker-dealer employer, Edwards &
Hanly, and two tippees of Geon's chairman,
seeking to enjoin them from further Violations of the antifraud provrsions of the Exchange Act. The complaint charged, among
other things, that the tippees, the registered
representative
and the comptroller
purchased Geon stock while In possession of,
and without prior disclosure of, material
non-public Information
concerning
a proposed acqulsinon of Geon by Burmah Oil
Company of England, and that the same
persons later sold Geon stock while In possession of, and without prior disclosure of,
negative rnatenal non-public
information
concerning Geon's financial condition and
ItS potential effect on the proposed acqursltion. The two trppees, Geon's comptroller
and the registered
representative
consented to permanent Injunctions enjoining
them from future Violations of the antifraud
provisions
of the Exchange Act and rescmded their transactions in Geon stock. In
addition, the registered representative and
the comptroller
consented to injunctions
against future Violations of the margin proVisions of the Exchange Act and the Federal
Reserve Board's margin regulations. The
79

case was tried against the remaining
defendants; the matter IS pending.
In S.E.C. v. Koscot Interplanetary,
Inc.20
the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit
reversing the previously
reported decisron of the district court." held
that the interests
in the Koscot pyramid
promotion
scheme that were sold to the
public are "investment
contract[s)"
and
therefore securities, as defined In the Federal securities
laws In so doing, the court
rejected a restnctrve Interpretation
of the
standard enunciated by the Supreme Court
in S.E.C. v. W. J. Howey CO.,22 which found
an Investment
contract to exist where "a
person Invests his money In a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely
from the efforts of the promoter or a thrrd
party."
Instead,
the court
of appeals
adopted a "resilient
standard
which will
allow for a practical and dynamic scrutiny of
investment schemes.
The court determined
that the Koscot
scheme Involved a "common enterprise," although there was no pooling of profits. The
"entreat factor" was "not the similitude
or
comcrdence of investor input, but rather the
umtormrty of Impact of the promoter's
efforts."
With regard to the element of the Howey
formula that profits come "solely from the
efforts of others" the court of appeals rejacted a "literal" mterprstatron
of Howey for
a "functional"
approach, which would not
frustrate the remedial purposes of the Federal securities
laws It found the "proper
standard" to be that recently explicated by
the Ninth CIrcuit
In S.E.C. v. Glenn W
Turner Enterprises,lnc.23-"whether
the efforts made by those other than the Investor
are the undeniably
significant
ones, those
essential
managerial
efforts which affect
the failure or success of the enterprise."
Thus, a scheme is no less an investment
contract merely because an Investor contributes "some effort as well as money to get
into it."
The court concluded
by noting that ItS
holding was confined to "those schemes in
wrnch promoters
retain lmrnedrate control
over the essential managerial conduct of an
enterprise and where the investor's realization of prouts is inextricably tied to the success of the promotional
scheme." Thus the
80

holding does not extend to "conventional
trancmse arrangements"
in whrch the investor contributes
truly siqruficant
efforts
which are "unfettered
by promoter
mandates."
Such a "conventional"
franchise
would not be subject
to the regulatory
scheme of the Federal securities laws.
In S.E.C. v. Continental
Commodities
Corp.24 the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit held that commodity
options
are
investment contracts and that notes are secunties when issued In an "Investment"
context.
In its complaint the Oornrnlssron had alleged vlolatrons of the regIstration and antrfraud provisions of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act in connection
with the
offer and sale of purported
options on
commodity
futures and in the subsequent
offer of promissory notes in partial payment
of clarrns owed to persons who had invested
in the scheme. The district court dismissed
the Commission's
complaint
holding that
the court lacked subject matter jurisdrctlon
because
the so-called
optrons
and the
promissory
notes were not securities.25
In ItS brief In the court of appeals, the
Cornrmssron disputed only so much of the
district
court's decisron
as held that the
notes issued to investors were not secunties. Nevertheless, the court of appeals consrdered whether
the commodity
options
being sold were securltres.
In holding
these options,
which it descnbed as dlscretronary
accounts, to be investment contracts,
the court focused on
whether
the requisite
"common
enterprise" was present. Oonsistent wrth ItS recent declsron
in S.E.C.
v Koscot
Interplanetary,
Inc., the court again adopted
the view of the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit,
as expressed
in S.E.C. v.
Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc., that "[a)
common enterprise is one in which the fortunes of the investor are Interwoven
with
and dependent
upon the efforts and success of those seeking the Investment or of
thrrd parties."
The court specrtlcally
rejected the proposition that the pro rata sharIng of prouts is critical to a finding of commonality. It also rejected the district court's
view that no common
enterprise
was involved because Continental
Commodities
invested
in different
options
on com-

modities futures for different Investors. The
court stated that "the critical inquiry IS confined to whether the fortuity of Investments
collectively
IS essentially
dependent
upon
promoter expertise."
On the question whether notes issued by
Continental
Commodities
to its customers
in payment of their claims were securities,
the court of appeals considered It "not dispositive" that the notes possessed a maturIty date of less than nine months. According
to the court, "It IS the character of the note,
not its maturity date, which determines coverage"
under the securities
laws. Consistent with the position urged by the Commission, the court concluded
that shortterm notes are exempt under Section 3(a)(3)
of the Securities Act and excluded from the
definition
of a security
under Section
3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, only if they are
the type of prime quality commercial
paper
not generally
offered to the public, and
which qualifies for discount at a federal reserve bank.
In S.E.C. v. Glen-Arden
Commodities.
Inc.26 and S.E.C. v. Heitenden-Rttner International, Inc. 27 the Courts of Appeals for the
Second and Fourth Circuits, respectively,
held that the offer and sale of Interests In
casks of unblended scotch whisky aging in
warehouses In Scotland, to Investors In the
United States involved the offer and sale of
Investment contracts in violation of the registratlon
and antifraud
provlsions
of the
Federal securities laws. In both decisions,
the courts noted that investors. who were
sold relatively small quantities
of scotch
never Intended to take actual possession of
the purchased casks, bought with the intention of reselling at a profit, and relied upon
their sellers to select the types of whisky for
them. and to assist in the contemplated
resale to blenders
since there was no organized scotch whisky market, were dependent
upon the defendants
to realize
profits promised
by the promoters
of the
Investments
As the district
court
in
Hettenden-Rimer
stated In its decisron,
which was adopted by the Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit, "[t]heir participation
in the enterprise was limited to providing
capital with the hope of a favorable return."
S.E.C. v. Marasol Properties. 28_ Thrs was
a case brought by the Commission
seeking

to enjorn the sale of condominium
Units on
the grounds that the promoters were offerIng sacuntres in violation of the registration
and antifraud provlsions of the Federal securities laws. It IS one of the first of ItS kind.
The Commission
sought
to enjoin
Marasol Properties,
Iberia lnmobluana
Internacronal Inc., Inter-Fed Travel Services
ASSOCiation, Inc., De Ritchie and Galarents,
S.A from violating Sections 5(a) and (c) and
17 of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b)
and 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5. The promoters
were allegedly offering
and seiling condorrunurn
units in Costa del Sol, Spain, forthe primary
purpose of Investment
rather than occupancy by the purchasers. The sale of a unit
IS coupled with an undertaking
to arrange
continuing
rental of the units for the benefit
of the purchaser.
In connection
With their activities It was
also alleged that the defendants made false
and misleading statements of material facts
regarding, among other things, the parties
and risks involved in such an investment.
A consolidated
hearing on the merits was
held on the Commission's
application
for a
temporary restraining order and motion for
a preliminary
injunction
on September 24,
1973. The court found that the defendant's
offers and sales constituted offers and sales
of secuntres in the form of "investment
contracts" as well as certificates
of Interest or
partrcipatron
in a profit-sharing
agreement
The action was dismissed as to Galarents,
S A for lack of proper service of process.
The court permanently enjorned the remainIng defendants
from Violating registration
and antifraud
provlsions
of the Securities
Act and of the Exchange Act.29
S.E C. v. Strathmore
Distillery
Co.
Ltd.3D-ln
January 1974, the Cornmisston
filed an injunctive
action in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia against Strathmore
and John B R.
Turner, a director of Strathmore,
alleging
Violations of the registration
and antifraud
provlsions
of the Federal securittes laws
The complaint alleged that the defendants,
without registration,
were offering to sell
and seiling interests In scotch grain whisky
which constituted
investment contracts and
thus securities.
It was further alleged that
Strathmore had made false and misleading
a1

statements
as to matenal
facts about,
among other things' the safety, profrtabrhty
and marketability of the Interests, the marKet pnce for scotch grain wrusky, the varranee between Strathmore's prices and the
market price and the difficulty of resale
In S.E.C. v Memme & Co 31the Commission brought an action to enjoin Memme &
Co., a broker-dealer, from further violating
the net capital and recordkeeping
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and
the rules promulgated
thereunder and to
enjoin several of Memme's registered pnncipals from further aiding and abetting
those violations. With the exception of John
Charles Fina, a registered
principal
of
Memme, injunctions were entered against
all of the defendants either by default or by
consent. After a evidennary heanng the distnct court prehrrunanly enjoined Frna,
On appeal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second ClrcUlt,32 Frna argued that he should not have been enjoined
because, as he stated, he had not been responsible
for the investment
decisions
whrch precipitated
the net capital vrolanons, had not had the authority to prevent
Memme from dornq business while It was
out of compliance witn the Commission's
net capital rules, and had resigned from the
firm before the violations were discovered
by the Commission
The Cornrmssron argued that had Mr Fma computed Memme's
net caprtal position-which
computations
were his responsibility-he
would have drscovered that Memme was not In compliance
and he could have Informed Memme's pnncrpals ofthat fact. HIs resignation before the
violations were discovered by the Oornrnrssion, although after they had occurred, dId
not relieve him of his responsibility.
On January 8, 1974, the court of appeals
affirmed the district court's order from the
bench. Frna subsequently consented to the
entry of a permanent injunction.
On June 11, 1974, the United States Distnct Court for the Southern Distnct of New
York, In S.E.C. v Eznne,33 entered a Final
Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Ancillary Relief against an attorney (who consented to the final decree) upon a finding by
the court that he intentionally appeared and
practiced before the Commission In contravsnnon of Rule 2(e) of the Commission's
82

Rules of Practice. The attorney stipulated
that he appeared as counsel at a Commission administrative
proceeding
after his
privilege to appear and practice before the
Commission
had been permanently
suspended The district court earlier had preIiminanly enjoined the attorney from appearing or practicing before the Commission In contravention
of Rule 2(e).34 Under
the terms of the final decree, the attorney is
enjoined from representing any person before the Commission, from preparing or filIng any documents wrth the Commission,
and from representing or advising, in connection with the Federal securities laws, any
broker-dealer or other entity registered or
required to be registered with the Cornrrussion.
The attorney is also enjoined from rendering advice with respect to the Federal securrtles laws, except where such advice is a
necessary Incident to any attorney-client
consultatron, the princrpal aspects of which
do not relate to the securities laws, and certain other conditrons are met. Under the
terms of the decree, he is further prohibited
from accepting any legal fees In connection
with matters he ISenjoined from performing.
The order also directs him to disgorge any
legal fees or compensation
he received in
connection with such matters during the
penod of his suspension from practice before the Commission.
As previously reported,35 S.E.C. v. Na-

tiona/

Student

Marketing

Corporation

("NSMC") was originally
brought by the
Commission against NSMC and 19 others,
including two law firms and NSMC'soutslde
auditors
NSMC and ItS comptroller
have
thus far consented to injunctions.
At the
close of the fiscal year, documentary discovery was being conducted in both the
Commission's CIVil enforcement action and
private acnons wruch had been consolidated with It for pretrial purposes
In January 1974, an Indictment charging,
among other things, conspiracy to violate
the mail and securities fraud laws was returned In the United States Distnct Court for
the Southern District of New York against
fIve officers and employes of NSMC, mcludIng the former president. In addition, two
members of the firm that audited NSMC's
financial statements, a partner and a former

aud it-manager,
were charged with participating In the preparation for NSMC of a
materially
false and misleading
proxy
statement.
See Part 1, pages 18-19 for
further information on the cnmrnal aspects
of the NSMC matter.
In S.E.C. v. Crofters, /nc.,36 the Commission brought an action against various corporate and individual defendants charging
provrstons
of the
violations
of antifraud
Federal secunties laws in the sale of secunties to the State of Ohio, and seeking an
Injunction against further violations
Most
of the defendants consented to the entry of
permanent injunctions;
the complaint was
dismissed as to one defendant. After a trial,
the drstnct court permantly enjoined the
two remaining defendants, William V. Coffey and John M King.
On appeal, (the case was captioned as
S.E.C. v. Coffey,37 in ordenng the case remanded as to Coffey and dismissed as to
King, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit applied standards for liability that had previously been applied only In
private actions for damages. The court, In
determining that the conduct of the defendants was not fraudulent, focused not on the
nature of the conduct
Itself, but on the
characteristics
of the target of the alleged
fraud and Implied that for the Commission
to establish a violation there must be actual
injury. The court held that in an injunctive
SUIt charging fraud the Commission must
show that a defendant acted In "Willful or
reckless disregard for the truth." The Commission filed a petition for certroran With the
Supreme Court in the last half of the calendar year, arguing that the standard appeared to be In conflict With Supreme Court
and other appellate authority.
InSEC. v. DO/nick 38the Courtof Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit rejected the language In Coffey requiring the Commission
to show a violation of Rule 10b-5 that a
defendant acted With "Wilful or reckless disregard for the truth," as "lnconsistent
With
the law" of the Seventh CirCUIt. The court In
DO/nick also held, inter alia, that pledges of
stock at banks were sales Within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, and that
defendant had Violated the registration provisions ofthat Act when he pledged unregistered shares of stock with banks as collat-

eral for loans where the loans could be repaid only through the unregistered drstnbutron of the pledged shares to the public.
Some of the pledged shares were subsequently sold In the over-the-counter
market as they were released by the banks to
defendant, in order to reduce the balance of
the loans With the proceeds of the sales
In S E.C v. Spectrum Ltd.,39 the Court of
Appeals forthe Second Circuit reversed the
denial by the drstnct court of a preliminary
injunction
requested by the Cornrrussron
against an attorney who authored an Opinion letter which was used to effect a drstnbunon of unregistered secunties. The drstnct court had held that the attorney's conduct did not nse to a Violation of the secunties laws since the record did not show that
the attorney had actual knowledge that he
was aiding and abetting an Illegal drstnbunon of securrtres
In remanding forfurther proceedings, the
court of appeals stated that, In a Commission injunctive action, the proper standard
to be applied In determining whether a defendant aided and abetted Violations of the
Federal securities laws IS whether that defendant acted negligently. The court emphasrzed, among others things, that the
negligence standard was not overly stnct In
the case of attorneys, In light of the unique
and pivotal role the legal protessron plays In
the effective Implementation of the Federal
securities laws.
S.E.C. v Seaboard
Corp.4o-The
Comrrussron filed a complaint
In the Federal
Court for the Central Drstnct of California
against Seaboard and twenty-eight
other
Individuals and entities. The SUit essentially
deals With the alleged mismanagement and
outright
looting of a complex of mutual
funds ("Funds").
The complaint
alleges that a portfolio
manager of the Funds engaged In a practice
of first purcnasmq thinly traded secunties
through nominees, then causing the Funds
to purchase the same securmes in large
volume, thereby causing a pnce rise. He
then allegedly sold rns personal holdings
either to the Funds or Into the market when
the Funds were buymq As a result, the
Funds were alleged to have lost as much as
$4,000,000.
83

The complaint also alleges that finders'
fees in excess of $200,000 were illegally
paid to affiliates of the mutual funds and
that securities were purchased, investment
advisers selected and other decisions relating to the Investment funds made m order to
benefit Seaboard and ItSaffiliates to the detriment of the Funds.
S.E.C. v. RepublIc Neuonet Life Insurance
Company. On March 8, 1974 the Commission instituted an injunctive action against
Republic National Life Insurance Company
("Republic"), Realty Equities Corporation of
New York ("Realty"), Peat, Marwick, Mitchell
& Company, Westheimer, Fine, Berger &
Co., and eleven individuals who were employees of Republic or Realty.41The Commission charged extensive violations of antifraud and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act. In essence, the complaint alleged that Republic, in trying to conceal its
failing mvestment m Realty, put millions of
dollars into Realty through certain transactions. The proceeds were usually channeled
back to Republic to repay earlier Realty
debt. Realty was thus enabled to retain suftlcient funds through the transactions to
continue in operation. Republic and Realty
and each of their independent auditors
were alleged to have made and issued false
and rrusleadmq frnancral statements.
Realty, its president and treasurer consented to permanent Injunctions enjoining
them from future violations of antifraud
provisions of the Exchange Act. In addition,
the management of Realty has been restructured in an attempt to insure that violations
of the law do not reoccur. Special counsel is
to be appointed by the court, to prosecute,
on behalf of Realty, civil actions which Realty may have. The litigation IS continuing
agamst the remaining defendants.
S.E.C. v Talley Industries, Inc.42-0n October 30, 1973 the Commission filed a complaint seekmg injunctive and ancillary relief
against Talley Industries, Peat, Marwlck,
Mitchell & Co. and two officers ofTalley. The
complaint alleged violations of the anti.
fraud, reporting, and proxy provrsrons of the
Federal securities laws, arising out of a
merger in May 1970 of Talley with General
Time Corporation.
The complaint alleged that Talley's financial statements, which were included in a
84

joint proxy mailed in April 1970 to shareholders of Talley and General Time, were false
and misleading in greatly overstating earnings. Projections of future sales and future
production costs were alleged to have been
made without reasonable bases. The complaint also alleged that at least $8.9 million
classmed as inventory should have been
treated as an expense, which If done would
have reduced Talley's earnings for the year
ended March 31, 1969 from $1.71 per share
shown in the proxy to 62t per share.
The complaint alleged that the false earnings statements in the proxy statements
served to mislead former General Time
shareholders by misrepresenting that the
exchange ratio offered to them by Talley was
fair and reasonable.
Among other things, the complaint
sought an order directing Peat, Marwick to
implement procedures designed to prevent
the recurrence of the violative conduct alleged in the complaint, and such other relief
as necessary and appropriate to redress the
wrongs suffered by the former shareholders
of General Time.
In April 1974, Talley and the 2 officers
consented to an injunction without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.43 The Oornmlssron's suit was settled
by the defendants in conjunction with the
settlement of related private litigation.
S.E.C. v. Allegheny Beverage Corporation.-As
previously reported,44 the Commission instituted an injunctive action
against Allegheny and 24 other defendants
alleging violations of reporting, antifraud,
and registration provisions of the securities
acts. In addition to Allegheny, the defendants include an Allegheny subsidiary, four
Allegheny officers, the company's auditors,
the underwriter of the subsidiary's public
offering, counsel for the underwriter, counsel for the subsidiary, and the escrow agent
for the public offering, Suburban Trust
Company.
On August 31, 1973, Judge George Hart
denied a Motion to Dismiss filed by certain
of the defendants. On May 14,1974, JUdge
Har.t denied cross motions for summary
judgment by the plaintiff Commission and
certain of the defendants.
In S.E.C. v. First U.S. Corporatlon,45 a
Tennessee broker-dealer and 5 of its offi-

cers and employees were named as defendants In an Injunctive action filed by the
Commission In the Western District of Tennessee. The complaint charged violations
of the antifraud provisions of the Federal
securities laws The complaint alleges that
the defendants purchased from, and sold
to, customers rnurucrpal bonds at prices not
reasonably related to current market pnces
and churned certain accounts. In one instance, the complaint alleges that the defendants induced a 70 year old widow to
engage In over 200 secuntres transactions
in a one year period involving nearly $1 million which adversely
affected the customer's Interests.
S.E.C. v Investors Associates of Amenca,
Inc. 46_ The Commission filed a complaint
In October 1972 In the United States District
Court for the Western District ofTennessee,
alleging that the defendants, including 4
firms and 5 Individuals, had violated the antifraud provrsrons of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act by having engaged In a
fraudulent scheme to sell municipal bonds.
The defendants were alleged to have used
high pressure, "boiler room" techniques
and employed a scheme in which two of the
firms traded certain secunties
between
themselves In order to create an artificial
market for the securities.
In addition, the complaint alleged that the
defendants engaged in "reverse trading," a
practice whereby customers were Induced
to purchase municipal bonds at prices the
customers believed to be less than the current market prices while at the same time
the defendants purchased other municipal
bonds from the same customers at prices
unreasonably below the then current market price, thereby denving a substantial undisclosed profit from the transactions In this
action, as well as in each of the previous
SUItS filed by the Commission
involving
these practices, the Commission
sought
certain ancillary relief, Including disgorgement of the alleged Illegal monetary gains of
the defendants.
The defendants, all of whom had previously consented
to preliminary
injunctions,47 without admitting or denying the
Commission's
allegations
consented
to
orders of permanent injunction. The orders
required also that, under certain conditions,

the defendants

disgorge

sums

totaling

$202,990.58.48
S.E.C. v. Paragon Seounttes Co.49-0n
August 2, 1973, the Commission filed an
Injunctive action In the District Court forthe
District of New Jersey charging Paragon, 4
associated firms, and 11 individuals with
violations of the antifraud, broker-dealer
registration
and other provrsrons
of the
Federal securities laws
In essence, the Commission's complaint
alleges that Paragon while purportedly dealIng only In municipal bonds was in fact
dealing In other securities and failed to register as a broker-dealer with the Commission Additionally,
the complaint charged
Paragon with filing false and misleading
statements with the Commission with respect to ItS financial condition and with respect to its line of business In other matters.
Moreover, the complaint charged the defendants with violations of the antifraud and
prophylactic
provisions of the secuntres
acts and also alleged that they abused their
discretionary authority with respect to various accounts; that they purchased and sold
securities at prices unreasonably related to
the current market price of such securities;
and employed
high
pressure
sales
techniques to accomplish such fraudulent
ends Additionally,
the complaint charges
that the defendants made numerous fraudulent misstatements
of material facts and
omitted to state material facts concerning
Paragon's relationship with ItS customers;
the pnce of the secuntres being sold; Paragon's underwriting;
its Interest in the distribution of certain bonds It was seiling; and
the safety of an investment in bonds being
sold.
During fiscal year 1974, the defendants In
S.E.C. v. Charles A. Morris & ASSOCiates,
Inc., consented to permanent Injunctions,
without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations that they had engaged In
high pressure sales campaigns to induce
customers to purchase murucipal bonds at
prices as high as 75 percent In excess of
their current market value. Among other
things, the defendants consented to the
drsqorqernent of alleged Illegal profltS.50
S.E.C. v Accurate
Calculator
Corp. 51_
The United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York entered de85

crees of permanent injunction by consent
against Accurate,
its promoter
and five
other defendants enjoining them from violating the registration and antifraud provrsions of the Federal securities laws in connection with a dlstnbutron of Accurate's secunties in the United States and Canada. As
part of Its complaint the Commission alleged, among other things, that Accurate's
promoter had diverted for his own use and
benefit and other non-corporate purposes a
substantial portion of an offenng of Accurate's secunties In Canada and participated
In the preparation
of a false and misleading
offenng circular relating to Accurate
The Court ordered the appointment of a
receiver
for Accurate
with directions,
among other things, to take custody of all
assets of Accurate and to obtain funds and
secunties diverted from Accurate by ItS
promoter and others. The Commission also
accepted offers of settlement from three respondents In an administrative proceeding
ansrnq out of the Accurate matter who had
been charged With Violating the registration
provrsions of the Securities Act. See In the
Matter of Holland Andrews & Perrier 52
S.E.C. v. WhIttaker Corporetron,53_On
February 8, 1974, the Commission filed a
complaint In the United States Drstnct Court
for the Central District of California against
Whittaker alleging Violations of the proxy
rules. The complaint alleged that Whittaker
had failed to adequately and accurately descnbe ItS relationship with ItS Independent
certified public accountants In the proxy
matenal which solicited shareholder approval for retention of the accountants for
the coming year. The defendant allegedly
had failed to disclose matenal facts concerning the settlement of a claim asserted
against the auditors In connection
with
pnor audits and failed to disclose that In
Whittaker's opinion such auditors had done
Inadequate auditing for the fiscal years
ended October 31, 1970 and 1971. Contemporaneously With the filing ofthe complaint,
Whittaker, without admitting or denying the
allegations, voluntanly
consented to the
entry of an order enjOining it from future
Violations of the proxy rules and requirlnq It
to set forth In its next proxy statement a full
and accurate descnption of its relationship
With ItS accountants.

S.E.C. v. J. Hugh Ltedtke.54---{)n July 1, 1974
the Commission filed a complaint seeking
to enjoin J. Hugh Liedtke, chairman of the
board of Pennzorl Co., William C. Liedtke,
Jr., Pennzoil's
President,
and Choctaw
Corp., a pnvate investment company, from
further violations of the antifraud provrsions
of the Exchange Act. The Oornrrussion's
complaint
alleged
that both Lredtke s,
through Choctaw Corp., purchased substantial amounts of Pennzorl stock during a
two-month period when both Liedtkes were
In possession of matenal non-public information regarding the fact that Pennzoil was
planning to spin-off ItS wholly-owned gas
pipe line substdrary, United Gas Pipe Line
Co. All three defendants consented to a
permanent Injunction against further such
Violations, and agreed to disgorge some
$108,000 to persons who sold Pennzorl
stock to Choctaw during the two month
penod.
This case IS an example of sxpedltrous
investigation
and enforcement
action
where the factual Situation is relatively uncomplicated and uncontested. In this case
the investigation
was begun on May 28,
1974 and the complaint was filed on July 1,
1974.
SEC. v. Prudent Real Estate Trust.55-ln
May 1973, the Commission filed a complaint
seeking an injunction
and other relief
against Prudent and ItS trustees, named
only in their representative capacities. The
complaint
alleged that Prudent Violated
Sections 5(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Act
and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 10b-5 thereunder in connection With
Prudent's offenng In March 1972, of $2.5
million principal amount of 7 percent convertible subordinated debentures and warrants.
The Oommlssron alleged that Prudent
had prearranged the sale of 50 percent of
the offering to two private investors, pnor to
the effective date of the registration statement. The registration statement discloses
neither this fact nor that Prudent had, as an
inducement
to purchase, entered into a
consulting
agreement with the Investors
which had the effect of providing them with
a greater return on their investment than
was to be realized by public investors Prudent failed also to disclose that these two

investors would become the largest stockholders In the Trust and that various trustees of Prudent were purchasing
shares of
beneficial interest in Prudent on the American Stock Exchange throughout
the offering period.
On November 9, 1973 the Court permanently enjoined Prudent from violating Sections 5(a) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act
with respect to securities
issued by Prudent.56 The complaint was dismissed as to
the trustees. The court also ordered Prudent to redeem all its then outstanding
7
percent convertible
subordinated
debentures no later than February 28, 1974. Prudent consented
to the entry of the order
Without admitting
or denying the allegations in the Commission's
complaint.

S.E.C. v. Techni-Culture,

Inc. 57-The

Commission
in a complaint, filed in August
1973, alleged a massive fraudulent distribution of unregistered
common
stock of
Techni-Culture,
Inc. during the promotion
of this shell corporation
as a firm involved in
an advanced form of hydroponic
farming.
On April 2, 1974, after a hearing on the
Commission's
Motion for Preliminary
Injunction, Judge William P. Copple, United
States District
Judge for the District
of
Arizona, preliminary
enjoined
five of the
defendants from violations of the antltraudand registration
provisions
of the Federal
securities
laws.58 In addition,
he directed
these defendants to deposit any shares of
Techni-Culture,
Inc. which they owned or
controlled
With the court for the benefit of
public shareholders.
He further ordered the
alleged principal promoter of the scheme to
file with the court a quarterly report of all his
securities holdings and prohibited him from
acting as an officer or director of any public
company,
except upon a showing to the
court that measures have been taken to prevent repetition of the conduct of the nature
alleged by the Commission.

S.E.C. v. Marvin Bernstein.59-ln June
1973, the Oommrsston filed a complaint for
injunction
in the United States District
Court In New Jersey against
Marvin S.
Bernstein and eight others alleging violations of registration
and antifraud
provisions of the Federal securities
laws. The
Commission's
complaint
alleged that the

promoters of Computron Corp., a Utah shell
corporation,
had made false and misleading
statements in Computron's
offering circular
and had misappropriated
funds received
during
its
Regulation
A offering.
Additionally
the promoters,
working
with
M. Bernstein Securities Inc., a New Jersey
broker-dealer,
arranged
a merger With a
group of privately held New Jersey manufacturing
concerns
called Star-Glo
Inc
The merged company, defendant
Star-Glo
Industries, Inc., was unable to make the filings required by the Securities
Exchange
Act because of inadequate
financial
and
shareholder
records kept by the promoters
of Computron.
Seven of the nine defendants have thus far consented to Injunctions.
The Court has also approved a plan which
enabled Star-Glo to clarify its records concerning ownership of its stock, about which
there was some question
S.E.C. v. Protesstone!
Service Associa-

tion, Inc.6Â°-Qn April 29, 1974 the Commission filed a complaint
seeking injunctive
and other relief in the Western District of
Missouri against Professional
Service Association, Inc. ("P.S.A."), John E. Robinson
and Hilton Patterson. The complaint alleges
that the defendants Violated antifraud proVisions of the Federal securities
laws In
connection With the promotion ofthe securrties of P.S.A.
The Oommlssion alleged that the defendants were circulating
false, misleading and
fraudulent
promotional
materials
and financial statements
which materially overstated the value of the company's "training
and reference"
manuals. In addition,
the
Oornmtsston
alleged that the defendants
had forged
a letter from a corporation
domiciled
in Missouri which purported
to
state its intention to make a substantial
investment in P.S.A. Finally, the Commission
alleged that the fraudulent promotional
mao
terlals, financial statements and forged letter were part of the defendants'
efforts to
sollcit stock subscnptrons
In P.S.A. from the
Investing public.
On the same day that the complaint was
filed the defendants consented to the entry
of a permanent Injunction without admitting
or denying the allegations in the complaint.
Robinson and Patterson agreed to offer to
rescind all agreements to purchase or sell
87

P.S.A. securities from November 1, 1973 to
the date of the consent.
The Institution of this enforcement action
represents
an additional
phase of the
Commission's
program to deal effectively
and expeditiously
with on-going current
abuses In the securities market. Within 24
hours after it had received information
concerning the illegal activity, the Commission was prepared
to file a complaint
against the defendants.
The defendants
thereupon promptly agreed to consent to
the injunction. It can be expected that future
Commission enforcement efforts will continue to utilize this approach to attempt to
enjoin violative conduct soon after it is discovered

S.E.C.
v. Occidental
Petroleum
corporeuon.v'<-sr: December 1973, the
Commission filed a complaint seeking to
enjoin Occidental and its board chairman, Dr.
Armand Hammer, from further violations of
antifraud provisrons of the Federal securities laws The Cornrntssron's
complaint
charged that Occidental and Hammer had
failed to disclose in prospectuses relevant
to two public offerings of securities In 1971,
that Occidental
faced potential
massive
writedowns
on its tanker fleet The complaint further charged that there were various other material misrepresentations
in
the prospectuses With regard to its tanker
fleet which had the effect of concealing Occidental's actual financial situation. Occidental and Hammer both consented to a
permanent order enjoining them from future Violations of the antifraud provrsrons
S.E C. v. Florida East Coast RaIlway Co.
("FEC").62-The
United States District
Court for the District of Columbia entered a
decree of permanent Injunction by consent
enjoining FEC from Violating the antifraud
and proxy provisions of the Federal securities laws The court additionally entered a
consent order declaring null and void proxres solicited by FEC In 1971 and 1972 in
connection
with an exchange offer proposal of common stock for its outstanding
First Mortgage Bonds
The Alfred I duPont Testamentary Trust,
another defendant In the action, undertook
to offer rescission to sellers of $476,000 face
amount First Mortgage Bonds purchased
by the Trust while allegedly In possession of
88

material Inside information
relating to the
railroad. The Trust and Florida East Coast's
Chairman and It President (who were both
also defendants) undertook not to engage
in any transactions
in FEC securities
Without prior notification
to the court and
the Commission. In view of these undertakIngs the Oornmissron determined to discontinue the proceedings against the Trust and
the two officers of the rallroad.63

S.E.C. v.snomer, Sltomer& Porges.64-ln
October 1973, the Commission filed an injunctive action In the District Court for the
Southern District of New York against the
New York law firm of Sitomer, Sitomer &
Porges, three of its partners and the Empire
Fire and Marine Insurance Company and
certain of its officers and directors, charging violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the Federal securities
laws in connection with the registered public offering of certain securities.
The complaint alleged the lawyer defendants had received a $200,000 undisclosed
contingent fee upon the successful completion of a registered public offering by Empire
Fire, In addition to legal fees of $95,000
(which were disclosed) and paper profits of
approximately $167,000 on stock they purchased With a loan guaranteed by the issuer. Although the stock pu rchase itself was
disclosed, that the stock was subject to a
buy-back agreement and that the purchase
loan was guaranteed by the issuer was not
disclosed. The complaint alleged the compensation was received pursuant to a written compensation
agreement with the issuer, which was hidden from the auditors of
the issuer.
The law firm and its partners were also
charged with attempting to employ a similar scheme in connection With an aborted
registered public offering of the securities
of another Issuer The defendants were alleged to have induced the Issuer to enter
Into a written compensation
agreement
pursuant to which the defendants were to
receive an undisclosed
contingent fee of
$400,000
In addition
to legal fees of
$200,000 and paper profits of $900,000 on
stock of the Issuer. The stock was subject to
a buy-back agreement in the event the public offering was not successful.
Empire Fire and Marine Insurance Com-

pany and its officers and directors consented to the entry of permanent injunctions in March 1974, without admitting or
denying the allegations in the complaint.65
Empire consented also to an order directing
it to file an amended registration statement
disclosing the matters discussed above and
amendments to other filings concerning the
matter. The president and chairman of the
board of Empire consented also to an order
directing him to indemnify Empire for expenses Incurred in connection with the alleged violations, up to $100,000.The case is
pending as to the law firm and Its partners.

MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION
Amendments to Multldistflct Litigation
Procedures-S. 2904 which was introduced
In the Congress In the last fiscal year, would
exempt enforcement actions brought by the
Commission from 28 U.S.C. 1407.That section provides for the transfer to a Single district court, for coordinated or consolidated
pretrial proceedings, of civil actions that
haveone or more common questions of fact
pending In different judicial districts. Presently, only Injunctive actions brought by the
United States under the Federal antitrust
laws are exempt from Section 1407.
Section 1407was enacted by Congress in
1968. The legislation was prompted by the
institution of more than 2,000 private antitrust damage suits filed in 35 federal district
courts following the successful criminal
prosecution under the antitrust laws of electrical equipment manufacturers in 1961.for
this reason, the primary focus during the
hearings which led to the enactment of Section 1407was upon the problems presented
by the institution of numerous private damage actions having common parties and
common Issuesof fact. Congress did, however, recognize the need to place certain
Government ciVil actions on a different footing from private civil litigation. It excluded
antitrust injunctive actions brought by the
Govemment from the operation of the bill.
There were no other express exclusions
however from the bill.
Hearings on S. 2904 were held on February 20,1974 before the Subcommittee on
Improvements in Judicial Machmery of the
Senate Committee on the Judiciary. At

those hearings the Commission related
that, in its experience, the resulting uncertainty of the outcome of a motion under
Section 1407 has often caused district
courts in which the Oomnusston's enforcement action is pending, to await disposition
of the motion by the JudiCial Panel on Multidistrict litigation before proceeding With
the disposition of the Commission's action.
Even where a motion has been ultimately
denied by the Panel, 66 the Commission
often has experienced substantial delay in
its actions. When the motion is granted, the
delay in resolution of the Commission's action ISeven more substantial. For example,
in the Oornmlssron's injunctive action
against National Student Marketing Corporation.67 a motion was made to the Judicial
Panel in April 1972to transfer the Commission's case for pretrial consolidation with
private damage actions pending In other
districts. Almost eight months later, the
Panel on December 1,1972, ordered seven
related private actions transferred to the
district where the Oornrmssron's suit was
pending. These cases were consolidated
With the Commission's case for pretrial
purposes.68 The effect of that motion was to
delay the Oornmtssron's Injunctive case
substantially, and that case at the close of
the fiscal year was still only In the early
stages of discovery.
In view of the Multidistrict Panel's decision in National Student Marketmg and the
adverse effect of that decision on the Commission's ability to obtain prompt dispositions of ItS injunctive actions, the Commission strongly urged passage of S. 2904.
In In re Harmony Loan Co.â€¢ Inc. Securities
Litigatlon69 the Judicial Panel on Multldistrict litigation refused under 28 U.S.C.1407
to transfer to one district for consolidation
or coordinated pretrial proceedings a
Oornrnissron enforcement actlon-8.E.C. v.
Fisher7o-and to private actions all of
which contained some common questions
of fact. The Oomrrussion case and one private action were pending In one district and
the other private action was pending in
another distnct. The Panel noted that the
pending actions sought different relief and
were at different stages of development.
The minimal discovery needed in the Commission's enforcement action had been
89

completed and it appeared to the Panel that
that action was ripe for decision
on the
Commission's
request for injunctive relief.
Without reaching the Commission's
basic
argument that the nature and purpose of a
Commission
enforcement
action requires
its exclusion
from consolidated
pretrial
proceedings
with private damage SUitS, the
Panel determined
that inclusion
of the
Commission's
case in Section 1407 proceedings could needlessly complicate
and
delay final disposition
of all the actions involved.

Participation

as Amicus Curiae

The Commission
frequently
participates
as amicus cunee in litigation
between private parties under the securities laws where
it considers It important to present its views
regarding
the interpretation
of the provisions involved. For the most part, such participation
is in the appellate courts.

Manor Drug Stores v. Blue Chip
Stamps,71-Thls is an action brought to recover damages for violations of Rule 10b-5
under the Securities Exchange Act. Plaintiffs, among the alleged beneficiaries
of a
government
anti-trust
consent Judgment
against certain ofthe defendants, were entitled to purchase shares in a newly formed
corporation
allegedly at a "bargain"
price.
The complaint
alleges that defendants
devised a scheme to dissuade the offerees, by
means of misleading statements, from purchasing the securities.
The district court
dismissed the complaint on the basis of the
in
so-called "BIrnbaum rule," announced
Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F. 2d
461 (CA
2), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 956,
which holds that a person who is neither a
purchaser nor a seller of securities has no
cause of action under Rule 10b-5.
The Commission as amicus curiae argued
in the court of appeals that Rule 10b-5
should not be limited to actual purchasers
and sellers of securities but should extend
to all Investors and potential
investors. In
the alternative the Commission
contended
that the consent decree was the functional
equivalent of a contract to sell. The court of
appeals adopted this alternative
argument
and reversed the drstnct court.
Defendants
petitioned
for a writ of cer90

tloran. The Commission,

in a memorandum
of this petition, urged the Supreme Court to review the
matter, among other reasons, to resolve the
conflict among the courts of appeals as to
the Birnbaum rule by rejecting the rule. On
November 1, 1974, the Court granted the
petition.

amicus cunee filed In support

In tntemettonst Controls Corp. v. Vesco,72
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
held that the pro rata distribution
of a
portfolio
securrty by a corporation
to its
shareholders
was a sale Within Section
10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act and
Rule 10b-5 The court of appeals further
held that a district court could freeze assets
of defendants
"to assure compensation
to
those who are victims of a securities fraud."
The Special Counsel, who had been appointed for International
Controls Corporation ("ICC") pursuant to a consent order of
permanent injunction
entered against ICC
In S.E C. v. Vesco,73 filed a suit on behalf of
ICC against 32 indlvidual and corporate defendants alleging varrous violations of the
Federal securities laws. Among the defendants were Fairfield General Corporation and
two of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries
(the
"Fairfield group"), Vesco and Co., Inc. and
Robert L Vesco. Among other things, ICC
alleged that Vesco had fraudulently
misled
other directors of ICC into spinning off the
company's stock holdings in the parent of
the Fairfield group to ICC shareholders.
The district court had entered several orders to prevent dlssipatron of certain assets
to which ICC would be entitled if its suit
were successful.
Specifically,
the district
court's
orders
prohibited
the Fairfield
group from selling its principal
asset (an
airplane) and enjoined Vesco and Co. from
selling or otherwise disposing of ItS principal asset (approximately
850,000 shares of
ICC). The district court also enjoined the
continued
prosecution
of a number of actions by the defendants
In state courts.
The Fairfield group argued primarily that
the district court lacked jurisdiction
over
the subject matter. They argued that the
spin-off
of Fairfield
General
to ICC
shareholders
was not a sale under Section
10(b) of the Secunties
Exchange Act and
Rule
10b-5
thereunder
because
the
shareholders
of ICC were in the same posl-

non after the spin-off as they had been before It. The court of appeals rejected this
argument and held that In light of the "umbrella protection
placed over securities
transactions
by Section 10(b)
.. ICC must
be deemed a seller ....
" The court viewed
a recent line of cases74 which hold that Spin
offs are sales for purposes of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
as Inapposite
because those cases all involved consideration
flowing to the parent
corporation's
principal shareholders
(e.g.,
in the form of the enhanced value of the
retained shares because of the creation of
a public market for the shares). In this connection,
the court rejected the Commission's argument,
as amicus cunee, that
there had been consideration
to ICC and/or
Vesco In the transaction.
The court stated that, "although
in other
contexts the term 'sale' might appropriately
be construed
more narrowly, we find emphasis on consrderation
inconsistent
with
the broad scope of protection
under Section 10(b) for those who engage in transactions eventuating
In the acquisition
or disposition of securities."
The court also reasoned that It should look beyond the question of whether or not there is harm to the
recipient shareholders
in the stock distribution because Section 10(b) is designed for
the protection
of creditors
as well In the
court's view, the spin-off was a "transaction
Involving . . . the disposition
of securities
and, therefore, one for which the corporation IS well deserving and entitled to the
protection
of Section 10(b)."
The court of appeals affirmed the orders
of the district court freezing the assets of
the defendants,
but vacated the district
court's
orders enjoining
the continued
prosecution
of actions by the defendants in
state courts, with one exception. The court
of appeals reversed those orders which it
deemed beyond the purview of the narrow
exceptions
to the Antr-lnjunction
Act, 28
U.S.C. 2283.
In Safeway Portland Employees' Federal
Credit Union v. C. H. Wagner & CO.,75 the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held,
In accordance with the views expressed by
the Commission as amicus curiae, that certain brokered bank certificates
of deposit
were required to be registered
under the

Securities
Act. Each brokered
certificate
consisted of a certificate of deposit Issued
by a bank, together with a broker's promise
to pay, upon the maturity of the certificate,
bonus Interest over and above the interest
payable by the bank. The money used by the
broker to pay the bon us interest came from
a person who was seeking a loan from the
bank and was Willing to pay a premium to
Induce an Investor to purchase a certificate
of deposit Issued by the bank so that the
bank would be willing to make a loan. The
court held that the combination
of the bank
certificate With the bonus Interest "created
an integrated
investment
package which
must be Viewed In ItS entirety In determining
whether It IS within or without the Act." Noting that this package differed "fundamentally" from the underlying certificate of deposit issued by the bank since there was a
greater rate of return to the Investor, and
porntlnq out that the economic Inducement
for the purchase of the brokered certificate
was the total combined rate of Interest, the
court concluded
that the package, the elements of which were "Inseparable,"
constituted an Investment contract and therefore
a security. The court further held that since
the package, unlike the underlying
bank
certificates,
was not Issued by a bank, the
exemption
from registration
accorded
to
bank-issued secuntres was unavailable.

Reserve Life Insurance Co. v. Provuient
Life Insurance CO.76 Involved the solicitation by the trustees of an expiring voting
trust of certificate
holders In the trust for
their consents to a continuation
of the trust
for an additional term of ten years. The votIng trust held the controlling
voting stock of
the Provident Life Insurance Co., an Issuer
that was exempt from registration
under
Section 12(g)(2)(G) of the Securities
Exchange Act.
In its brief, amicus curiae, the Commission argued primarily that the sohcrtatlon of
the voting trust certificate
holders by the
trustees involved the offer of a security required to be registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, and that the exemption
from
registration
contained In Section 3(a)(9) of
the Securities
Act for "[a]ny security exchanged by the issuer with its existing security holders,
exclusively
... ," was not
available to the voting trust, since, In the
91

Commission's view, the original trust by the
terms of the trust agreement would and did
expire at the end of its original 15-year term
and the requirement of a single issuer under
Section 3(a)(9) was not met. In rejecting the
Commission's view, the court of appeals
considered the trust and its renewal to be a
single, continuing legal entity.
The court of appeals agreed with the
Commission, however, that the voting trust
was an issuer required to register its certificates under Section 12(g) of the Securities
Exchange Act. In this connection the court
upheld the validity of Rule 12g5-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act, pursuant to which
the assets of a corporation whose stock IS
held by a voting trust are attributed to the
trust in order to determine if the trust has
sutncient assets to require registration. The
court also agreed with the Commlssron that
the solicrtatlon by the voting trustees to extend the term of the trust was a sollcrtatlon
"in respect of" the voting trust certificates
as well as the underlying Insurance company stock and therefore subject to the
proxy rules. The court stated that the solicitation by the trustees constituted "a sellertation for the trustees' right to exercise indirect control over the corporation for many
years."
Finally, In response to a collateral issue
concerning what weight, if any, is to be
given to views expressed by members of the
Commiasron's staff that conflicted expressly or by implication With the Commission's position as amicus curiae, the court
of appeals held that the views expressed by
the staff do not constitute an oftlcral expression of Commission opinion and do not
bind or estop the Commission from espressinq contrary views.
In Meyerhofer v. Empire Fire & Marine
Insurance CO.77The United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit held that an
attorney under the peculiar circumstances
of the case did not Violate provisions of the
American Bar Association's
Code of
Protessional ResponSibility by drsclosmq
certain information relating to one of tus law
firm's clients to attorneys who represented
plaintiffs in a lawsurt against that client.
Upon learning that a registration statement and prospectus prepared by hrs law
firm relating to the public offering of the
92

client's securities did not contain certain
required material information, the attorney
reported that fact to the commlssron and
resigned from the law firm. Shortly thereafter, this material information was disclosed
in a 1D-K report filed with the Oommlssron.
As a result of that disclosure, certain
shareholders of the client filed SUItagainst it
based on its failure to Include the information in ItS registration statement and prospectus. The attorney also was named a defendant in the lawsuit. In order to demonstrate to plaintiffs' counsel that he was not
culpable and have himself dropped as a defendant, the attorney gave plaintiffs' counsel a copy of the affidavit he earlier had provided to the Commission.
On motion by the client corporation, the
district court ruled that the delivery by the
attorney of his affidavrt to the plaintiffs' attorneys, and their receipt of that affrdavrt,
Violated Canons 4 and 9 of the ABA's Code
of Professional Responsibility In that It involved the revealing of confidential information by an attorney and had the appearance of Impropriety. Accordingly, the district court dismissed the case without prejudice and enjoined the attorney who had
revealed the information and plaintiffs'
counsel from further association With the
case.
In the court of appeals the Commission
filed a brief, amicus curiae, argUing that the
delivery of the affidavit by the attorney to
counsel forthe plaintiffs did not constitute a
breach of the Code: (1) the information In
the affidavit was not confidential because it
Involved a fraud perpetrated by the client;
and (2) even if the information were confidential, the attorney had a right, under ABA
Disciplinary Rule 4-101(c)(4), to reveal the
information in the course of defending himself against an accusation.
Without reaching the issue of whether the
attorney had, in fact, revealed confidential
information, the court of appeals reversed
the dismissal of the case on the ground that
the delivery of the affidavit by the attorney to
counsel for the plaintiffs was authorized
under Disciplinary Rule 4-101 (c)(4). The
court concluded that In light of his urgent
situation, the attorney had the right to make
an appropriate disclosure of his role in the
public offering; since the affidavit was the

best evidence of his Innocence, It was also
appropriate
for the attorney to turn the affidavit over to counsel for plaintiffs.
The court of appeals also reversed the
Injunction
agaihst plaintiffs'
counsel barring them from further association With the
case, but sustained so much of the iruunction against the attorney as would bar him
from representing the plaintiffs In their case
against the client corporation.
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith v.
Ware78 Involved a wage dispute between a
member of the New York Stock Exchange
and a former employee. Pursuant to an Exchange rule, the employee had Signed an
agreement to arbitrate all disputes arising
out of his employment.
After the employee
had brought SUit in California state court,
the member firm attempted to Institute arbitration, arguing that since the Exchange
rule was adopted
pursuant
to the Exchange's self-regulatory
power under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, it preempted a California statute which gave employees the right to a judrcial forum In wage
disputes
regardless
of any arbitration
agreement.
Commission
counsel participated
in the
filing of a brief for the United States as
amicus curtee in the Supreme Court. Consistent with the views expressed
in that
brief, the Court held that since the Exchange rule requirlnq arbitration
was, only
peripherally,
if at all, related to fair dealing
and investor protection,
It would not preempt inconsistent
state law. The Court also
rejected the member firm's contentions that
national
uniformity
In regulation
of exchanges
required
application
of the Exchange rule, that the Securities Exchange
Act required the law of New York (where the
arbitration rule would be valid) to be applied
because that is where the New York Stock
Exchange IS located, and that application of
the California statute would unduly burden
interstate commerce.

CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS
As a result of Investigations
conducted by
ItS staff, the Commission
during the past
fiscal year referred 65 cases to the Department of Justice for criminal
prosecution.
This represents more than a 35 percent In-

crease overthe 49 cases referred during the
preceding fiscal year As a result of these
references, 40 indictments
naming 169 defendants were returned, as compared to the
same number of indictments
against a total
of 178 defendants during the previous year
In addition, dUring the past fiscal year, the
Commission
authonzed
ItS staff to file 2
Criminal contempt actions and convicnons
were obtained against 6 defendants. DUring
the past fiscal year, 81 defendants
were
convicted in the 28 Criminal cases that were
tried Convictions
were affirmed in 7 cases
that had been appealed, and appeals were
still pending In 7 other cases at the close of
the period.
Members of the staff of the Commission
who have Investigated a case and are familrar with the facts involved and the applicable statutory
provisrons
and legal pnnciples, are usually requested by the Department of Justice to participate and assist In
the trial of a criminal case referred to the
Department, and to partlcrpate and assist In
any subsequent appeal from a convrctlon,
The Criminal cases that were handled durIng the fiscal year demonstrated
the great
variety of fraudulent
practices
that have
been devised and employed against members of the investing public.
As a result of the Oommlssron's reference
of the files in the Everest Management Corporation case,79 an indictment
was filed In
the Southern
District of New York which
named Morton Kaplan, Philip Zane, Jerome
Silverman, Charles Fischer, Robert Persky,
and others. Among other things, they were
alleged to have concealed the fact that approxrrnately
$500,000
which
had been
raised by Microthermal
Applications,
Inc
("Microthermal"),
in a public offering of its
stock,
was
dissipated
by, two
coconspirators
not named as defendants.
They thereafter caused the company to file
tmancral
reports
with the Commission
which indicated that the money had been
invested in certificates of deposit. Zane, Silverman and Persky were convicted after a
non-Jury trial of filing a false and misleading
Form 1D-K annual report With the Oornrnrssion and were sentenced to two years imprisonment
with all but four months suspended. The judgment
was affirmed
on
appeal.80 A petition for certiorari
is now
93

pending before the Supreme Court.
Kaplan,
the former
president
of MIcrothermal,
pleaded guilty to conspirmg
with Zane, Silverman and Persky to file the
report. He was sentenced to two years of
which four months was to be served in a
Federal institution
By virtue of their convictions
in ttus case,
Zane and Silverman, both accountants,
and
Perksy, a lawyer, were automatically
suspended from appearing or practicing before
the Commission pursuant to Rule 2(e) of the
Commission's
Rules of Practice.
In December 1973 in the case of U.S. V.
AloI,81 Vmcent
T. Aloi, John Dioguardi,
Ralph Lombardo
and John Savmo were
convicted of conspiracy to violate the securities laws and securrtres fraud in connection
with the securities of At-Your-Service
Leasing Corp. The defendants had engaged 10 a
fraudulent
scheme to acquire control of
At-Your-Service
Leasing Corp. 10 order to
misappropriate
corporate
funds.
The
scheme also mvolved the distribution
of
fraudulent offering circulars. Dioguardi and
Aloi were sentenced to prison terms of ten
and nine years, respectively
This case IS
particularly
significant
in that these repeated secunties
violators
received substantial terms of imprisonment.
U.S. v. Arthur J. Levine82 was a case involvmg Weis Securities,
Inc. ("Weis"),
a
broker-dealer
firm registered
with the
Commission
and a New York Stock Exchange member firm. Wels collapsed financially and is currently being liquidated pursuant to the Secunties Investor Protection
Act of 1970. Arthur J. Levine, the former
chairman
of the board of Wels; Sol t.eit,
former president;
Alan Solomon,
former
vtca-president
and treasurer,
Joel Kubie,
former
comptroller;
and Robert
Lynn,
former assistant comptroller,
were indicted
in this case for falslfymg the books and records of the firm in order to conceal its true
financial
condition
Wels, which had approximately
40,000 customer
accounts
IS
the largest brokerage firm ever to be hquidated under the provisions of the Act.
Lert, Kubie, Levine and Lynn each pled
guilty to one count of the indictment
alleging conspiracy to violate the Federal securities laws. In addition, Leit and Levine both
pled guilty to an mformation
charging each
94

of them with violations of the bookkeeping
provisions of the Exchange Act. Solomon,
the only defendant to go to tnal, was found
guilty of one count of violatmg the bookkeeping provisions of the Exchange Act.
U.S. v. Joel Kline83 and U.S. v. Max
Zerkm.84-These two cases arose out ot a
rnvesnqatlon into the possible
Commission
manipulation
of certain over-the-counter
stocks. Joel Klme, Enc Adolph Baer and
Donald Harrison Abrams were indicted in
connection
with their efforts to obstruct the
Commission's
rnvesnqatlon.
They were
charged with mfluencing
witnesses to testify falsely before the Commission,
conceal109, altering and destroying
evidence relevant to the mvestigation
and committing
perjury before the Commission.
Each defendant pled guilty to one count of the indictment
charging
conspiracy
to obstruct
justice. Kline was fmed $10,000, and given a
prison term of 20 months to five years, Baer
was fined $10,000, given a suspended sentence and placed on probation
for three
years; and Abrams was fmed $7,500, given a
suspended sentence and placed on probation for two years.
After Kline, Baer and Abrams were sentenced, Max Zerkm waived indictment
and
pled gUilty to a one count information
charging
him with manipulation
of the
over-the-counter
market prices for the securities of Penn Metal Fabrications,
Inc.,
U.S Vinyl Corp. and Montgomery
Land Investment
and Development
Corporation.
Zerkin was fined $10,000 and placed on

United States v. Bernard Deutsch.85After a six week trial Bernard Deutsch and
Stanley DUBoff, two New York registered
representatives
and Milton Cohen, a St.
Paul, Mmnesota
businessman
and presrdent of Richard Packmg Company, were
found guilty on all four counts of an information filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in
the Southern District of New York.
The information
charged that the defendants conspired to manipulate
and did manipulate the market price of Richard's common stock from 1968 to 1970. Deutsch and
DuBoff were alleged to have secretly directed transactions
in the common stock of
the company at Kelly, Andrews & Bradley, a
brokerage firm, pursuant to a "kickback"

arrangement.
As part of the scheme
Deutsch and DuBoff also Induced three
mutual funds to purchase 129,000 shares of
the stock at an eventual loss to the funds of
over $5 million.
The information
also charged
that
Deutsch, DuBoff and Cohen caused a false
and misleading
offering
circular
to be
mailed in connection
with a public offering
of 10,000 shares of Richard stock, pursuant
to a Regulation A exemption from registration.
Deutsch and DuBoff are currently under
Indictment in four other cases involving violations of the conspiracy,
mail fraud and
Federal securities laws in connection
with
trading In the securities of Acrite Industries
Inc., Frigitemp Corp. and Integrated Medical Services, Ltd.86
In U.S. v. The Technical Fund, Inc 87 a
twenty-count
Indictment
was returned
against an investment company and certain
of its officers, directors and related individuals and entities In the Federal court In
Boston. Several defendants
were charged
with violations of provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and affiliated transaction
provrslons of the Investment Company Act.
This case IS one of the small number of
criminal cases charging violations
of sections of the Investment Company Act.
In another Significant case, U.S. v. Manning88 a federal JUry in the Central District of
California convicted Daniel E. Manning and
David A. Wooldridge
of securities
fraud,
mail fraud, the sale of unregistered
securities, and conspiracy
in connection
with
transactions
in the securities
of Capitol
Holding
Corp. Three other defendants,
Irwin "Steve" Schwartz, Robert Eisenberg,
and Bernard Klavir failed to appear at trial
and are ctasstfled
as fugitives
The trial,
which lasted more than SIX weeks, disclosed that millions of unregistered
Capitol
Holding shares were fraudulently
sold to
shareholders
throughout
the United States
and Canada, that Schwartz was responsible
for a market manlputatron
through Canadian brokerage firms; that Manning and a
Schwartz associate met secretly in a Los
Angeles motel and exchanged thousands of
stock certificates
for large sums of cash;
that Manning
and Wooldridge
unlawfully
received
large profits
from the sale of

Capitol Holding stock through nominees;
and that Eisenberg, a former Commission
attorney, was the mastermind
behind the
scheme. On September 5, 1973, Judge Irving Hill sentenced Manning and Wooldridge
each to SIX years imprisonment
and fined
each $10,000.
In U.S. v Seymour Pol/ack89 a conviction

In U.S. v. A.J White & CO.90 Allen J. White
pled guilty to one count of an indictment
which charged
Violations
of the brokerdealer bookkeeping
requirements
of the
Exchange Act. Although bookkeeping
proVISions of the Act are frequently the subjects
of Commission
administrative
and civil enforcement
proceedings,
they
are infrequently
the subjects of Criminal indictments.
White was fined $8,500, given a one year
suspended sentence and placed on probation for one year.

Organized

Crime Program

The prosecution
of securities
cases IS
often based pnrnanly on circumstantial
eVIdence requrrlnq extensive investigation
by
highly trained personnel. The difficulties
in
such investigations
and prosecutions
are
compounded
when elements of organized
cnme are Involved. Witnesses are usually
reluctant to cooperate because of threats or
fear of physical harm Books, records, and
other documentary
evidence essential to
the investigation
and to a successful
prosecution
may be destroyed or nonexrstent The organized cnme element is adept
at diSgUISing ItS participation
in transac95

tions,
through
the use of aliases
and
nominee accounts, by operating across international
boundaries,
and by taking advantage of foreign bank and other secrecy
laws. It frequently operates through "fronts"
and infiltrates
legitimate
business
concerns Organized
crime has an extensive
network of affiliates throughout
this country In all walks of life, and In many foreign
nations.
Despite
these difficulties,
the
Commission,
working in cooperation
with
other enforcement
agencies, has been able
to make major contributions
to the fight
against organized crime.
DUring fiscal year 1974, the organized
crime program focused principally
on two
ends (1) increasing the Oomrrussron's effectiveness In obtaining current reliable information relating to organized criminal actrvIty In the securities Industry; and (2) aggressively pu rsuing to completion
investigations of situations
brought to the Commission's attention as potentially
Involving the
Inftltratron of elements of organized crime
Into the ind ustry
In order to Increase the flow of reliable
data, an intelligence
unit has been established In the DIVIsion of Enforcement.
Its
prmcrpal function ISto maintain channels of
cornmurucanon
with state, local and other
Federal agencies,
as well as comparable
agencies of foreign
governments,
which
might have information
on organized Criminal actrvitly In the securities Industry. Information received by ttus unit IS correlated
with other available information
and evaluated In light of the Commission's
responsrbihtles under the Federal securities laws.
possrble securities
Information
indicating
law violations
by organized
Criminal elements is relayed by the intelligence
unit to
those other members of the staff whose
principal duties are to investigate actrvity by
organized crime.
Members of the staff have participated
in
seminars and lectures sponsored
by state
and local governments
and state and local
representanves
have been Included in the
Cornrmssion's
training programs. This has
alerted local authortties
to the role of the
Commlssron
In curtarlinq organized Criminal activity In the secunties industry. Members of the Cornmlssron
staff are also as-

96

Signed on a full time basis to certain of the
Justice
Department's
Organized
Crime
Strike Forces. Both the Strike Forces and
the Oomrnlssron
staff have thereby benefited in learning more about criminal activIty In the securities industry.
As a result of the organized crime unit's
enforcement
efforts dUring the past nscat
year, there has been a dramatic Increase in
the number and Importance of actions In this
area In the past year, In cases where members of organized crime were involved, the
Commission filed mjunctive actions naming
51 persons and contributed
to the return of
indictments
relating to 39 indrviduals and
the convicnon of 54 individuals. Seven persons considered
to be Important members
of organized crime were enjoined, two such
members were Indicted and eleven such
members were convicted on indictments
returned
In prior years. The cornrntssron
presently has 48 matters under investigation Involving organized crime.

Cooperation with Other
Enforcement Agencies
In recent years the Comrnlssron has given
Increased
emphasis
to cooperation
and
coordination
WIth other enforcement
agencies, including the self-regulatory
organizations, enforcement
agencies at the State
and local level, and certain foreIgn agencies. Its programs in trus area cover a broad
range. For example, the Commission
believes that certain cases are more appropriately enforced at the local rather than the
Federal level where the activities, while VIOlatmg the Federal secunnes laws, are essentially of a local nature. In these instances,
the Commission
authorizes the referral of
the case to the appropriate
State or local
agency, and members of the staff familiar
with It are made available for assistance to
that agency in its enforcement
action.
The Commission
has also fostered programs designed to provide a comprehensive exchange
in information
concerning
mutual enforcement
problems and possible
securities violations. DUring the fiscal year,
It continued its program of annual regional
enforcement
conferences.
These conferences are attended by personnel from State

securities agencies, the U.S. Postal Service,
Federal, State and local prosecutors' offices and local offices of self-regulatory associations such as the NASD. They provide
a forum for the exchange of information on
current enforcement problems and new
methods of enforcement cooperation. One
result of these conferences has been the
establishment of programs for joint investigations. Although the conferences were initially hosted by the Commission's regional
offices, many State agencies are now serv1n9 as sponsors or co-sponsors. During the
past year, the Commission's Divlsron of Enforcement conducted an Enforcement
Training Seminar to which were invited representatives of all the State securities agencies and their counterparts in the Canadian
provinces. Invitations were also extended to
other Federal agencies having Investigative
or enforcement responsibilities Involving
laws relating to the issuance of or transactions in securities.
The Commission's Proceedings and litigation Records Branch continues to provide one means for cooperation on a continuing basis with other agencies having
securities enforcement responsibilities.
The Branch acts as a clearinghouse for information regarding enforcement actions in
securities matters that have been taken by
State and Canadian authorities, other governmental and self-regulatory agencies,
and the Commission itself. It answers requests for specific information and in addition publishes a periodic bulletin which IS
sent to contributing agencies and to other
enforcement and regulatory bodies. During
fiscal 1974, the branch received 3,964 letters either providlnq or requesting information, and sent out 3,023 communications to
cooperating agencies. Records maintained
by the Branch reflect a steady increase in
recent years in the number of enforcement
actions taken by State and Canadian authorities. The data in the SV (Securities Violations) Files, which IScomputerized, is useful in screening Issuers and applicants for
registration as securities or commodities
brokers or dealers or investment advisers,
as well as applicants for loans from such
agencies as the Small Business Administration.

FOREIGN RESTRICTED

UST

The Commission rnalntams and publishes a Foreign Restricted List desiqned to
alert broker-dealers, financial institutions,
Investors and others to possible unlawful
distributions of foreign securities in the
United States. The list consists of names of
foreign companies whose securities the
Commission has reason to believe have recently been or are currently being, offered
for public sale in the United States In violation of registration requirements. While
most broker-dealers refuse to effect transactions in securities Issued by companies
on the list, this does not necessarily prevent
promoters from Illegally offering such secunties directly to United States investors.
DUring the past fiscal year, 7 corporations
were added to the Foreign Restricted List,
bringing the total number of corporations
on the list to 82. The follOWing companies
were added during the year:
City Bank AS.91-This is a company incorporated under the laws of Denmark,
Which, In United States publications, offered to pay 9 percent interest to United
States Investors who would open savings
accounts in Danish kroner In the City Bank
AS in Copenhagen.
Los Dos Hermanos, S.A. 92_ Thrs Spanish
corporation publicly offered In the United
States bonds in 42,000 peseta (about
$735.00) denominations for the stated purpose of financing a specialized hotel In
Spain for rheumatic patients. Prospective
investors were offered bonds at a substantial discount and were promised that each
year they would receive a return of 18 percent, free round-trip air travel to Malaga,
Spain, and one week's accommodation.
Also offered were investment contracts involVing a condominium in Spain, With similar promises of an 18 percent return and

Global Insurance Company, Limited 93 offered In the United States "guaranteed income debentures"
In face amounts of
$1,000 or multiples thereof, maturing In one
to four years and paying between 10 to 12
percent Interest per annum. In addition, the
firm represented that these investments
would be "cloaked In Swiss-like secrecy"

97

and "tax free," implying that the Investor
might avoid payment of United States income taxes on the income received.

Globus Anlage-Vermittlungsgesellschaft
NBH. 94_ This German corporation
advertised In newspapers
In the United States
promising
investors a return of 10 percent
each month on funds in amounts not less
than $1,000, or the eq urvalent of 120 percent
interest per annum
The firm also represented to investors that the return on the
securities would be "tax free" through the
use of secret bank accounts in Luxembourg
and also represented
that the investments
would be Insured by Lloyd's of London.
Prestige Finance Corporation
Limited of
Nassau in the Bahamas solicited
brokers
and dealers in the United States with a proposal to rebate secretly 15 percent of all
funds which the brokers and dealers might
persuade their customers to Invest In shares
of the stock of corporations
recommended
for investment
by Prestige.
The initial
shares recommended
were those of International Oommunlcettons
Corporatlon,95 a
company
said to be Incorporated
in the
Cayman Islands, British West Indies. In an
accompanying
prospectus,
it was stated
Inthat the company,
which apparently
tended to publish a directory of telex subscnbers, would pay dividends of $1,900 for
each $100 invested.

Atlantic and Pacific Bank & Trust Co., Ltd.
of Nassau in the Bahamas 96 issued certificates of deposrt in $50,000 denominations
to United States nationals
who in turn
futilely endeavored to exchange these certificates for valuable assets, including,
in
one instance, eleven luxury automobiles.
On September
7, 1973, the minister of finance of the government
of the Bahamas
revoked the license of the company.

James G. Allan and sons;" of Edinburgh,
Scotland engaged in an extensive newspaper and mail campaign
to solicrt United
States investors
to purchase
Investment
contracts covering cases of newly distilled
scotch whiskey, to be held in storage in
warehouses
In Scotland until the whiskey
aged and became more valuable. One letter
distributed
by the firm promised
a 30-34
percent return per annum. The investment
opportunities
were Similar to those recently
characterized
as secuntles by the courts

PART 5
INVESTMENT COMPANIES
AND ADVISERS

PART 5
INVESTMENT COMPANIES
AND ADVISERS

Under the Investment Company Act of
1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, the Commission IS charged with extensive regulatory and supervisory responsibilities over investment companies and
investment advisers.The primary responsrbility for discharging these duties lies with
the Division of Investment Management
Regulation.
Unlike other Federal securities laws
which emphasize disclosure, the Investment Company Act provides a regulatory
framework within which investment companies must operate. Among other things
the Act: (1) prohibits changes in the nature
of an investment company's business or its
investment policies without shareholder
approval; (2) protects against management
self-dealing, embezzlement or abuse of
trust; (3) provides specific controls to eliminate or mitigate inequitable capital structures; (4) requires that an investment company disclose its financial condition and investment policies; (5) provides that management contracts be submitted to
shareholders for approval, and that provision be made for the safekeeping of assets;
and (6) sets controls to protect against unfair transactions between an investment
company and its affiliates.
Persons advising others on their securities transactions for compensation must
register with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act. This requirement
was extended by the Investment Company
Amendments Act of 1970 to include advisers to registered investment companies.

The Advisers Act. among other things, prohibits performance fee contracts which do
not meet certain requirements; fraudulent,
deceptive or manipulative practices; and
advertising which does not comply with certain restrictions.
Investment companies and assets under
the management of investment advisers
constitute Important resources for investment in the nation's capital markets. In
order to continue their role of channeling
individual savings into capital needed for
Industrial development, investment companies and investment advisers must have
the confidence of investors, and the safeguards provided by the Investment Company and Investment Advisers Acts contribute to sustaining such confidence.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION
From time to time the Oomrmssron develops and proposes further legislation
which It deems necessary in the public
interest and for the protection of investors.
A number of such proposals have recently
been submitted to Congress and are currently awaiting action.

Proposed Oil and Gas Investment
Act
In June 1972.the Commission submitted
to the Congress a proposed Oil and Gas
Investment Act. The proposed legislation
would requrre registration of 011 programs
and subject them to comprehensive regula103

tion. Oil programs are generally unincorporated associations
which are primarily engaged In the business of holding or investing in 011 or gas interests. They are designed
to enable their investors to obtain directly
the tax advantages provided in the Internal
Revenue Code for the oil and gas busmess,
Many of the problems with the programs
with which this proposed legislation is concerned stem from the fact that generally
ownership
is separated from control. As a
result, the arrangements
for the management of oil programs
virtually
always involve self-dealing
and other transactions
and practices which may be unfair to investors.
The legislation
would provide controls
desrqned to prevent conflicts of Interest and
unfair transactions
between the programs
and their managers and to insure fmancial
responsibility
of program
managers.
It
would further prohibit changes In fundamental policies of an oil program without
approval
of the participants,
and require
that a person acting as a program manager
do so under a written contract which contams certain provrsrons. Some provisions of
the proposed
statute would be administered primarily by the National Association
of Securities
Dealers With Commission
oversight
These relate to sales charges,
sales literature, suitability of an investment
and a classification
system for the various
forms of management
compensation.
The legislation
was Introduced
in both
houses of the 92d Congress, but was not
acted upon. It was reintroduced
In the 93d
Congress In 1973 1

either (1) a payment contingent
upon the
use of influence to secure approval of a new
adviser or (2) an assurance of profits for the
successor
adviser under a new advisory
contract and renewals.
In submitting
the proposed
legislation,
the Commission
expressed its view that the
prlncrples of equity were appropriately
applied to the facts of the Rosenfeld case,
which involved an outright sale by an investment adviser of its advisory contract
With a registered investment company. The
sweep of the court's language cast doubt
however on whether an Investment adviser
without Incurring liability to the company or
its shareholders,
could profit when it sold its
business by selling its assets
In ItS statement accompanying
the legislation, the Oornrnlssion
suggested
that it
would be in the public interest to remove the
uncertainty generated by the Rosenfeld decision. The amendments
are intended to
permit an investment
adviser, or an affiliated person of an adviser, to obtain a
profit
In connection
With a transaction
which results in an assignment of the adVISory contract If certain conditions
are met
These conditions
are designed to prevent
an Investment adviser or an affiliate from
receiving any payment or other benefit In
connectron
With the sale of its business
which Includes any amount reflecting
its
assurance that the investment advisory contract Will be continued.
The proposed bill was not enacted in the
92d Congress. In 1973 it was reintroduced
in
modified form and passed by the senate.s m
September 1973, similar legislation was introduced In the House of Representatives.s

Sale of Investment Adviser
In 1972, the Commission
proposed legislation2 to clarify the arnbiqurty created by
the declsion of the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circurt in Rosenfeld v. Black.3 In
that case, the court held that the general
prmciple
In equity that a fidUCiary cannot
sell his office for personal gain is Impliedly
Incorporated
Into Section 15(a) of the Act
which requires shareholder approval of any
new Investment
advisory
contract
Consequently, a retiring Investment adviser of
an Investment company violates the Act by
receivmg
compensation
which
reflects
104

Institutional Disclosure
In the Letter of Transmittal
of the Institutional Study Report the Oommlssion stated
that "gaps [exist] In the information
about
the purchase, sale and holdings of securities by major classes of institutional
investcrs," and recommended
that such gaps be
eliminated by amending the securities laws
"to provide the Commission
with general
authority to require reports and disclosures
of such holdings and transactions
from all
types of institutional
Investors."6
On April 25,1973, It was announced that

the Commission would draft and sponsor
institutional disclosure legislation requiring
all institutional investors to report all oftheir
securities holdings and their Institutionsized trades? Such institutional disclosure
would permit Commission study of the effects of institutional trading and holdings
on the securities markets, and the characteristics of institutional Investors, for the
purpose of developing possible further disclosure requirements and, If needed, further regulatory controls on Institutional investors. On July 23, 1973, Senator Hamson
A. Williams, Jr., Chairman of the Senate
Subcommittee on Securities, introduced
legislation In the Senate along these conceptual lines" with the Commission's support as to the objectives of the bill. Later, on
November 1, 1973, the Commission's own
version of Institutional disclosure legislation was introduced in the Senate.9 On April
4, 1974, Representative John E. Moss,
Chairman of the Interstate and Foreign
Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce
and Finance, introduced Similar legislation
in the House of Representatlves.t?

RULES
The normal continuing review of rules in
light of changing conditions and administrative experience resulted in the revlsion or
proposed revision of several rules relating
to investment company and Investment adviser activities.

Amendment of Rule 17g-1
Rule 17g-1, before amended, required a
registered management investment company to provide and maintain a fidelity bond
in such reasonable amount as a majority of
its board of directors who were not persons
covered bythe bond should determine, subject to modification by the Commission as
to the amount, type, form and coverage of
such bond. In the last fiscal year,ll the
Commission amended the Rule to require
the amount of the bond to be at least equal
to an amount computed in accordance with
a schedule set forth in the Rule. The minimum amount depends on the gross assets
of the particular investment company.
The amendment also now makes clear

that a registered management investment
company has the option of maintaining
either a single Insured bond in which only
the Investment company is named insured,
or a joint insured bond which names as an
insured with the investment company one
or more additional parties of a type
specified In the Rule.
The amended Rule in addition now provides certain minimum factors which must
be considered by the directors of investment companies in approving the amount
and form of coverage of bonds and the portion of the premium to be paid by investment companies covered under Joint insured bonds. Finally, the amendment tightens the cancellation, termination and modification requirements of fidelity bond coverage.

Investment Company Shareholder
Account Processing Requirements
Dunng the fiscal year,the Commissiontook
severalsteps to enable mutual funds to provide more economical service in connection With payroll deduction plans, group
rates and retirement plans. In March 1974,
the staff posed no objection to the Investment Company Institute's proposal to
permit funds to distribute In bulk to employers for distribution to employee participants, dividend statements, proxy statements and shareholder reports, and to permit the automatic redemption of small inactive accounts under certain conditlons." At
about the same time, the Commission published a proposal to amend Rule 15cl-4
under the Exchange Act. The amendment
would relax the Rule's confirmation requirements as to purchases of mutual fund
shares pursuant to individual tax-qualified
and group plans."

Amendments of Rule 17d-1
Section 17(d) of the Investment Company
Act prohibits any affiliated person of or
principal underwriter for a registered investment company from effecting any
transaction in which the registered company, or a company controlled by it, is a joint
or a joint and several participant with the
affiliated person or principal underwriter, in
105

contravention
of any rule prescribed by the
Commission for the purpose of limiting or
preventing participation
by the registered
or controlled company on a basis different
from or less advantageous than that of other
participants.
Rule 17d-1 prohibits affiliated persons of
and principal
underwriters
for registered
investment companies from effecting any
transaction In connection with any [ornt enterprise
or other joint arrangement
or
profit-sharing
plan In which any such registered company, or a company controlled by
such registered company, IS a participant
unless an application regarding such Joint
enterprise has been filed with, and granted
by, the Commission.
In March 1974, the Oornrnlssron proposed
for comment an amendment to Rule 17d-1
which would enable certain affiliated companies and persons affiliated
with such
companies to participate in joint transactions with registered Investment companies
and companies controlled by registered investment companies without an orderofthe
Commission.
Other described
affiliated
persons and the prlncrpal underwriter of the
registered investment company would not
be permitted to participate or have a financial Interest
In the tranaactron.tThe
amendment would also remove doubt in the
present rule by making clear that certain
registered small business Investment company ("SBIC") stock option plans may become operative without an order of the
Commission.
At the close of the fiscal year, the staff was
analyzing comments received on the proposal; adoption of a rule in this area was
expected soon.

Temporary Rule 6c-2(T) and
Proposed Rule 6c-2 Regarding
Alaska Native Claims Act
Corporations
In February
1974,
adopted
Temporary

Rule 6c-2(T) 15 to
recently organized
Native Claims Set-

tlement Act of 197116 ("Settlement
porations")
from most sections
vestment Company Act, pending
proposed Rule 6c-2.
106

Act corof the Inaction on

Settlement Act corporations were created
to hold, administer, and distribute the land,
mineral properties
and cash which the
United States Government awarded Alaska's Native Indian, Aleut and Eskimo population in settlement
of their aboriginal
claims to land in the State of Alaska. These
corporations
are owned and managed exclusively by the Alaska natives; over 200
such entities, representing the various regions and Villages in the state, have been
established. Stock in the corporations
has
been given to each eligible native and may
not be traded until after January 1, 1992.
These corporations
may be viewed as investment companies Within the meaning of
the Act because, pursuant to the terms of
the Settlement Act, they have received significant amounts of the cash portion of the
settlement prior to acquisition of the land
and minerai assets to which they are entitled, and much of this cash has been invested In securities.
Under Rule 6c-2(T), Settlement Act corporations that register with the Commission
under Section 8(a) Will be exempt from all
provisions of the Act except Sections 9, 17,
36, and 37.17 Proposed Rule 6c-2, If adopted
as proposed, would provide the same relief.

MUTUAL FUND DISTRIBUTION
The Oornrmssron has for some time been
concerned
about inefficiencies
and inequities in the process by which mutual
funds are sold to the public. Of particular
Interest has been the retail price maintenance system, a fundamental aspect of the
distribution
process. Under present law, in
the sale of a mutual fund security to the
public,

the principal

underwriter

dealer must sell the security

and any

at the current

pubtlc offering price-net
asset value plus
stated sales Charge-set
forth in the prospectus. The Section thereby precludes retail price competition In the sale of mutual
fund shares.
In 1969 the Committee on Banking and
Currency of the United States Senate requested that the Commission study the potentral consequences of repeal of the section and report its findings to the Committee. Such a study was conducted by the
Commission's staff, and its report, entitled

"The Potential Economic Impact of the Repeal of Section 22(d)," was transmitted
to
the Committee
in November
1972. The
Commission
held public hearings in February and March 1973, to explore the major
Issues in the marketing of mutual funds and
the laws and regulations which affect them.
A broad range of subjects was covered including further liberalization
of mutual fund
advertising
rules; measurement
and portrayal of Investment results and proposed
rules to permit group sales or pooling of
orders for the purpose of obtaining quantity
discounts. The public hearings Included 15
days of testimony
from 72 witnesses.
Among
others
testifying
were
representatives of the Department of Justice,
the NASD, mutual fund underwriters
and
managers and various trade associations
(including
the Investment
Company Institute, the No-Load Mutual Fund Association,
the Securities Industry Association,
the Independent
Broker Dealers Trade Association, the National Mutual Fund Managers
Association,
and the American
Life Insurance Association).
More than 100 written
subrnlssrons, many of which were quite extensive, were also made.
At the end of the fiscal year, the staff was
nearing completion
of a comprehensive
report on the mutual fund distribution
system
and was preparing
to submit its recommendations to the Commission.
As part of its efforts to deal with the problems in this area the Commission
adopted
Rule 22d-2, effective as of March 29,1974.18
The Rule permits an investment company to
offer a shareholder
who has redeemed investment
company
shares a privilege
to
reinvest an amount not in excess of the proceeds, in shares of the same company or In
any investment
company
which
offers
shareholders
In that Investment company
an exchange privilege at net asset value.
This reinvestment
privilege (a) must be offered pursuant to a uniform offer described
in the prospectus
or supplements
thereto
filed pursuant to Rule 424(c) under the Securities Act; (b) may be exercised only once
by an investor with respect to any particular
investment company; and (c) must be exercised within 30 days of redemption.
Action may be taken In the near future
with respect to two other significant
rule

proposals

which were published

shortly

be-

fore the 1973 mutual fund distribution
hearings and which were the subject of comment and testimony at those hearings. One
is a proposed
amendment
of Rule 22d-1
under the Investment Company Act to permit quantity discounts for group purchases
of open-end investment company securities
under certain limited circumstances.ts
The
other IS a proposed amendment of Rule 134
under the Securities Act to permit greater
flexibility
In investment
company
advertisements by expanding
the categories
of
information
Includible
in the advertisements.20

Litigation Relating to Mutual
Fund Distribution
In early 1973, the Department of Justice
and private persons separately brought civil
suits in the District Court for the District of
Columbia, alleging that the defendants (including several funds, underwriters,
dealers, the NASD, and the Investment Company
Institute) had conspired, In violation of the
Federal antitrust laws, to inhibit a market for
In fund shares and
brokerage transactions
to suppress growth of a secondary dealer
market in fund shares. Specifically,
plaintiffs attacked the agreements
between the
principal
underwriters
and the dealers in
fund shares, which require dealers to sell to
everyone at net asset value plus a stated
sales load (the current
public
offering
price). Moreover, all redemptions
of shares
are made by a particular fund at the prevailing net asset value. This precludes a competitive secondary market.
Defendants
moved to dismiss the complaints on various grounds. The Commission set out its position in a letter to the
district court. After oral argument, on December 14, 1973, the court dismissed the
complaints
for failure to state claims upon
which relief could be granted.21
The court held that the challenged
conduct was explicitly
authorized
by the Act
and thereby immune from antitrust
challenge. The court noted first that the mutual
fund distribution
network
was "patently
repugnant to the free and open competition
requirements
of the Sherman Act," but that
plaintiffs had conceded antitrust immunity
107

for the primary distribution system. The
court stated that plaintiffs had failed to take
into account the fact that the maintenance
of a free and open secondary market would
be totally inconsistent with and might destroy the primary marketing system created
by the Act and particularly by Section 22(d),
the repeal of wrucn, the court noted, had
several times been urged upon Congress
with no success. The court further stated
that Congress knew of the existence before
the passage of the Act of a secondary market In shares of mutual funds termed the
"bootleg" market, and wanted to suppress
this market. By Section 22(f), a fund was
given the right to limit transferability of Its
shares; by Section 22(d), all dealers, including non-contract dealers, were required to
maintain the public offering price. "Congress designed Sections 22(d) and 22(f) to
create and protect a primary distribution
system which is repugnant to the antitrust
laws and did so in complete recognition of
the fact that the legislature would frustrate
the growth of a free secondary market." In
this manner, non-contract dealers would be
deprived for all practical purposes of a supply of fund shares other than through the
contract dealer network.
The court also held that the practices
challenged were impliedly immune from the
antitrust laws. The court found that the
Commission and the NASD were given pervasive statutory control over the area. Indeed, Section 15A(b)(8) specifically requires the Commission to employ antitrust
standards when reviewing rules promulgated by the NASD The court concluded
that Congress "clearly Intended to substitute a pervasive regulatory scheme, i.e.,
Section 22 of the 1940 Act, for the usual
antitrust prohibitions in the narrower area
of distribution and sales of mutual fund
shares.
The Department of Justice filed an appeal
directly to the Supreme Court under the Expediting Act. On October 7, 1974, the Supreme Court noted probable [unsdlction.

VARIABLE ANNUITY
ILLUSTRATIONS
For a number of years, representatives of
the life insurance industry have maintained
108

that variable annuity contracts could best
be explained through the useof illustrations
based on hypothetical investment experience. These illustrations have not been
permitted by the Commission's 1957 Statement of Policy which governs.
After the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission proposed for comment an
amendment to the Statement of Policy to
permit variable annuity illustration The
proposal is designed to allow portrayal of
the operation and unique characteristics of
variable annuities and provide a baSISfor
meaningful comparisons of potential costs
and benefits of different variable annuity
contracts.22

RECIPROCAL
PRACTICES

BROKERAGE

Over the past several years, the Commission has been qurte concerned with reciprocal brokerage practices. And, In February
1972, in its "Statement on the Future Structure of the Securities Markets," the Commission urged the NASD to initiate measures designed to terminate reciprocal practices. Thereafter, in May 1973, the NASD
adopted a new sub-section (k) to Article III,
Section 26 of its Rules of Fair Practice (the
"Anti-Reciprocal Rule"). This rule broadly
prohibits reciprocal arrangements with respect to the sale of mutual fund shares and
the allocation of brokerage by fund managers.
Recently, the NASD and representatives
of the investment company and securities
industries requested the Commission to review suggested interpretations
of and
amendments to the Anti-Reciprocal Rule. In
response, the Commission at the close of
the fiscal year announced that it would hold
public hearings23 to consider the folloWing
Issues: (1) whether there is any relationship
between the comparatively high portfolio
turnover rates of investment companies and
the allocation of brokerage on the basis of
sales of shares of investment companies;
(2) whether existing shareholders benefit
from such allocations; (3) whether there is
any pressure on investment companies to
select broker-dealers which do not have adequate capabilities to provide best execution; (4) whether broker-dealers recom-

mend shares of particular investment companies to customers on the basis of allocation of brokerage; and (5) whether such allocations of brokersage create anticompetitive Impacts on smaller investment
companies and broker-dealers.

NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS
As of June 30, 1974, there were 1,288 investment companies
registered under the
Investment Company Act. with assets havIng an aggregate market value of over $62

APPLICATIONS
One of the Commission's

principal

ac-

tivities in its regulation of investment companies and investment advisers is the consideration
of applications
for exemptions
from various provisions of the Investment
Company and Investment Advisers Acts or
for certain other relief under these Acts. Applicants may also seek determinations
of
the status of persons or companies. During
the fiscal year. 279 applications
were filed
under both acts. and final action was taken
on 261 applications.
As of the end of the
year. 176 applications
were pending under
both Acts. Of the totals described, the predominant number were applications
under
the Investment Company Act. With respect
to the Advisers Act. only four of the applrca-

nons filed sought relief from ItS provrsrons:
final action was taken on two such applications, and four were pending at year end

SLMA argued that certain of its functions
could not practically be performed if it were
required to register. Based on the application, the Commission exempted SLMA from
the Act to the extent it might be deemed
subject to iUs
The Bank of New York acts as custodian
of the assets of eight plans for the accumulation of mutual funds shares. Since
amounts contributed by participants in
such plans are invested In mutual fund
shares,the plans themselves are investment
companies and are registered under the Act
as unit investment
trusts. Section
26(a)(2)(0)of the Act requires a custodian of
a unit investment trust to be In possession
of all securities or other property in which
the funds of the trust are Invested. Strict
compliance with this provision requires
such a custodian to have physical possession of stock certificates representing
mutual fund shares owned by a plan. However, the Bank, together with the sponsors
of the involved plans, applied for an exemption from Section 26(a)(2)(0) to permit the
Bank to hold up to 5 percent of the fund
shares owned by the plans in the form of
"book shares," i.e., as entries on the records of the transfer agent of the mutual
funds.26The Commission, by the Division of
Investment Management Regulation, approved the application based on the applicants' statement of the Impracticality of
compliance and the lack of danger to mvestors.27
As previously reported,28 In September
1971, Pacific Scholarship Trust Sponsored
by the Pacrnc Scholarship Fund filed an application requesting exemptions from certain sections of the Investment Company
Act to permit the sale of scholarship plans.
The plans would require investors to deposit sums In bank savings accounts, from
which earnings would be periodically transferred to a trust fund and mvestedto provide
funds for the eventual college education of
designated child beneficiaries. A portion of
the payouts to students who did attend college would be derived from amounts forfeited by other investors in the plans. A for-

110

teiture would result if the designated child
failed to enter college or to complete the
first year successfully, or if the investor
failed to maintain his savings account or to
make required periodic payments. In order
to offer plans which include such a forfeiture feature, the trust required exemptions
from several sections of the Act, including
an exemption from Section 27(c)(1), which
prohibits the sale of non-redeemable
periodic payment plan certificates. After
hearings, the parties waived an initial decision and the Commission heard oral argument.
On October 31, 1973, the Oornmlssron
denied an exemption from Section 27(c)(1).
It found that applicant had failed to show
forfeitures and dilution of planholder interests to be consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes of the Act or to
be necessary or appropriate In the public
interest 29In reaching this result, the Commission specifically overruled its previous
decision in The Trust Fund Sponsored by
the Scholarship Club, Inc.3o

Litigation Involving Applications
In Independent
Investor Protective
League v. S.E.C.31the Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit dismissed, for lack of
standing, petitions filed by the Independent
Investor Protective League, an organization of mdividual investors, to review the
propriety of the Commission's entry of
orders granting exemptions from provisions of the Investment Company Act to
certain applicants. The review provisions of
the Act grant standing to "any person
or party aggrieved" by an order of the
Oommissron. The court agreed with the
Commission that, in the absence of a showing that the League or any of its members
owned securities of the applicant companies or suffered any actual injury or discrimination as a result of the Commission's
orders, the League had no standing to obtain court review under the Investment
Company Act. The court deemed insufficient petitioner's claim that its members
might in the future own securities of the
applicant compames.

I.

PART 6
PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANIES

Under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, the Commission regulates interstate public utility holding company systems engaged In the electnc utility business
and/or retail dlstnbution of gas The Commission's Jurisdiction also covers natural
gas pipeline companies and other nonutility companies which are subsidiary
companies of registered holding companies. There are three principal areas of
regulation under the Act: (1) the physical
integration of public utility companies and
functionally related properties of holding
company systems, and the simplification of
intercorporate relationships and financial
structures of such systems; (2) the financing operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiary companies, the
acquisition and disposition of secunties
and properties and certain accounting
practices, servicing arrangements, and intercompany transactions; (3) exemptive
provisions relating to the status under the
Act of persons and companies, and provrsions regulating the right of persons affiliated with a public-utility company to become affiliated with another such company
through acqursrtron of securities

COMPOSITION
At the end of calendar year 1973, there
were 22 holding companies registered
under the Act.' Twenty were included in the
17 "active" registered holding company
systerns.s The remaining two registered
holding companies, which are relatively

small, are not considered part of "active"
In the 17 active systems, there
were 78 electnc and/or gas utility subsidlarles, 63 non-utility subsidianes, and 16
Inactive companies, or a total, including the
parent holding companies and the subholding companies, of 177 system companies.
Table 27 In Part 9 lists the active systems
and their aggregate assets.

PROCEEDINGS
New England Electflc System," The
Commission approved a plan submitted by
NewEngland Electric System("NEES"), for
the saleof three of ItSgas utility subsidianes
and of an LNG-gas subsidiary to Eastern
Gas and Fuel Associates, an exempt holding company." A Massachusetts township
and other intervenors which had opposed
the acqursrtlon by Eastern entered into a
settlement and withdrew from the proceeding. The Commission noted that the acquisition by Eastern was not subject to its approval under Section 10,and stated: "Since
the participants have settled their dispute
and withdrawn from the proceeding, we
have no occasion ... to consider our jurisdiction, If any, With respect to the alleged
consequences of Eastern's acqusltion.'
In a separate proceeding the Commission
approved the sale, for cash, of Lawrence
Gas Company, ("Lawrence"), the last remaining NEES gas subsidrary, to Spnngfield Gas Light Company (now Bay State
Gas Company), an exempt holding company 6 The plan provided for the retirement
115

of the publicly held minority stock In Lawrence. In addition, Bay State agreed to pay
for the minority stock the same price per
share that NEES received for its stock interest in Lawrence.7
The Association of Massachusetts Consumers opposed the acqursrtron and requested a hearing. The Commission denied
the request" and a subsequent petition for
reheannq." The Association has filed a petition for review in the court of appeals."
which at the close of the fiscal year was
pending.
Utah Power and LIght Company. An application was filed by Utah Power and Light
Company ("Utah"), an operating company
as well as a registered holding company,
seeking permission to acquire all of the assets of The Western Colorado Power Company ("Western Colorado"), its sole subsidiary utility company, thus terminating its
holding-company status under the Act. The
Commission ordered a hearing principally
to determine whether the proposed merger
of the Western Colorado system with the
Utah system would satisfy the Integration
standards of Section 11(b)(l) of the ACt.11
Prior to hearing, Utah withdrew its application, consented to an order that it divest
Western Colorado pursuant to Section
11(b)(l), and submitted a plan under Section 11(e) to sell the assets of Western Colorado. Utah accepted one of three final offers for the assets, subject to Commission
approval A hearing has been held on the
proposed sale. At the close of the fiscal
year, the matter was pending.
Delmarva Power & Light Company. 12-0n
June 26, 1974. an administrative law judge
rendered an initial decrsion In consolidated
administrative proceedings to determine
whether under Section 11(b)(l) of the Act
Delmarva, an operating utility company and
a registered holding company, should be
required to divest ItS gas utility properties
and whether Delmarva's application for
exemption from the Act under Section
3(a)(2), should be granted The administrative law judge found that Delmarva's gas
sytem was not retainable under Section
11(b)(1), but that Delmarva was entitled to
an exemption from the Act under Section
3(a)(2). He accordingly concluded that the
11(b)(1) proceeding should be dismissed
116

and that divestiture should not be ordered.
He further concluded that the current
shortage of gas supply made it unnecessary
to require at this time that the exemption be
conditioned on divestiture of the gas properties. The Division's petition for review was
granted by the Commission and briefs 'have
been filed.
Union Electric Company.13 The Commission granted Union Electric Company ("Union"), an exempt holding company, permission to acquire the common stock of MIssouri Utilities Company("MU").14 The
Commission also continued
Union's
exemption as a holding company under
Section 3(a)(2) of the Act.
The Commission declined to impose
conditions requiring Union to divest MU's
small water properties and a small isolated
electric distribution property of MU which,
unlike the other properties of MU,would not
be a part of Union's integrated electric system.lt held that an acquisition by an exempt
holding company was not rigidly governed
by the Integration requirements of Section
11(b)(l) and that the minuscule size and
other characteristics of the nonintegrated
properties did not warrant a finding that
their acquisition by Union, as an exempt
holding company, was contrary to the Act
under the "unless and except" clause of
Section 3(a).
The Commission also held that it would
not order at this time divestiture of the gas
properties of Union and MU. It took note of
the recent adverse developments in gas
supply and concluded that it could not decide on the record whether such divestiture
should be ordered. It considered further
hearings In the pending proceeding inappropriate In view of the current state of the
Industry. The City of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, has filed a petition for review in the
court of appeals, which is pending.15
General Public Utilities Corporation. The
Commission authorized, pursuant to Sections 6 and 7 of the Act, certain amendments
to the first mortgage bond indenture of Metropolitan Edison Company ("Met Ed"), a
subsidiary of General Public Utilities, and
authorized also the solicitation of proxies
for bondholder consent to those amendments.16Later, Met Ed filed a request for an
extension of time to solicit the requisite

consents. The Commission ordered a hearIng,17 at which a bondholder, Walplan and
Company, opposed the solicitation,
alleging that the proxy material was false and
misleading.
Walplan also urged that the
amendments were contrary to the Act. In its
brief to the Oomrnlssron, the DIvision supported Met Ed's position
The matter IS
pending before the Commission
Prior to its appearance in the administrative proceeding, Walplan sued Met Ed 18 alleging that Met Ed's proxy statement was
false and misleading, substantially
in the
same respects as urged before the Commission. The suit was dismissed by the district court. Walplan appealed.t'' The Commission filed a brief amicus curtee urging
that the district court had no Jurisdiction to
entertain the complaint. The case IS now
awaiting decisron by the court of appeals.

John H. Ware-Penn Fuel Gas, Inc An
individual, John H Ware, III, filed an application In 1969 to acquire a controlling stock
Interest In North Penn Gas Company, an
operating gas utility, which was at that time
unaffiliated
with Ware or Penn Fuel Gas,
Inc, an exempt utility holding company
controlled by Ware Ware's application was
approved on condition
that the minority
stockholder interest In North Penn be elrrrunated.2o Ware and Penn Fuel filed a plan
under Sections 9 and 10, offering to Issue
shares of Penn Fuel stock in exchange for
all the outstanding
shares of North Penn
stock held by Ware and by the minority.
The Commission
issued a notice and
order for hearing.21 The principal issue was
whether the proposed exchange offer satisfied Ware's commitment
to eliminate the
North Penn minority In light of the fact that,
under the exchange
offer, the minority
stockholders of North Penn would become
minority
stockholders
of Penn Fuel A
number of rninonty shareholders appeared
to oppose the exchange offer. The matter
was pending at the close of the fiscal year.

FINANCING
Volume
DUring fiscal 1974, a total of 15 active registered holding-company
systems issued
and sold 62 issues of long-term debt and

capital stock pursuant to authonzations
by
the Commission under Sections 6 and 7 of
the Act. All of the issues were sold at competitive bidding. Except for approximately
$85 million
needed to refund maturing
long-term debt, all of the Issues were for
purposes of raising new capital Table 28 In
Part 9 presents the amount and types of
securities Issued and sold by these holding
company systems.
The volume of external financing by these
companies aggregated $2.562 billion in fiscal 1974, a decrease of 5.7 percent from the
total of $2 715 billion the prior fiscal year.

Leasing
Rule 7(d) adopted In fiscal year 1973 requires lessors of utility equipment to file
Form U 7D for each lease of utility equipment.22 DUring the initial filing period endIng July 31, 1973, a total of 21 certificates
covering $562 million In leased facilities
were filed. DUring the period August 1,
1973-June 30,1974, a total of 16 certificates
were filed covering leased property valued
at approximately $100 million.
Rule 7(d) concerns the status ofthe lessor
under Sections 2(a)(3) and 2(a)(4) of the Act.
but does not deal With the regulatory requirements applicable to the public-utility
company as lessee. Since Section 2(a)(22)
of the Act includes a lease within the definition of the word "acqursttion,"
the leasinq
of utility assets, such as generating equipment or nuclear fuel, IS an acqursitron subject to Section 10. In a case of first rmpressron, the Commission approved under Section 10 the leasinq of nuclear fuel, at an
estimated cost of about $40 million, by Arkansas Power & Light Co. ("AP&L"), a subsrdiary of Middle South Utilities, Inc 23 Although, as a mat1erof accounting, AP&L did
not propose to capitalize the lease obligation, the Commission stressed that the lease
must be considered under Section 10(b)(3),
which "requires
registered
systems to
maintain an appropriate balance of equity
capital.
. [which] requirement cannot be
avoided by indiscriminate
use of lease obhgatlons.24 The Commission found that the
lease in question did not have the effect
proscribed by Section 10(b)(3).
117

Competitive

Bidding

The Commission's
Rule 50, adopted m
1941,25 requires that securities
issued by
registered holding companies or their subsidiaries
be sold by competitive
biddmg,
where two or more mdependent
bids have
been received, the best bid may be accepted
by the issuer without further authorization
by the Commission.
For more than 30 years,
Rule 50 has provided an effective and economical procedure for marketmg utility securities. In 1974, a group of registered holdmg companies and security underwriters
informally presented to the Cornrnissron
information
and studies purportmg
to show
that recent, generally unsettled securities
markets, high mterest rates and the utilttres'
unprecedented
demand for new capital,
have (1) adversely affected the capacity of
the secunties
industry
to handle utility
common stock Issues and (2) rendered It
unfeasible
for the utility industry to raise
effectively the required common equity capital through competitlve
bidding.
Based on that preliminary
presentation
and on ItS own awareness
of prevailing
conditions
in the securities
markets, the
Commission
on July 19, 1974 noticed for
comment
a proposed
temporary
suspension of the competitive
biddmg
requirements of Rule 50 with respect to the sale of
common stock of registered holding companies.
In its release, the Commission
stated, ". . . It appears that registered holding companies
under our jurisdiction
have
reason for concern
as to their ability to
comply with Rule 50 m the immediate future. The risks of contmued
insistence on
competitive
biddmg procedures for holdmg
company common stock Issues seem substantial In comparison
With the effects of a
temporary
suspension
of that requirement." 26The issuance and sale of preferred
stocks and debt obligations
of registered
holding
companies
or their subsidiaries
would however continue to be subjectto the
full requirements
of Rule 50.

Revenue

Bonds

As an additional source of capital, electric
utility companies
have turned increasingly
to the use of tax-exempt
revenue bonds to
118

finance the substantial
costs of pollution
control equipment.
Typically, such trnancmg arrangements,
made with local governmental authorities,
involve the Issue and
sale of revenue bonds by the authonty m an
amount equal to the estimated cost of the
facilities;
disbursement
of the bond proceeds to cover construction
expenditures;
and, when construction
IS completed,
the
sale of the facilities to the utility company
pursuant to an mstallment-sale
contract.
The sale contract, which is pledged as security for the revenue bonds, obligates the utilIty company to make semi-annual payments
thereunder
rn amounts sutncient to cover
interest and principal, when due, on the related revenue bonds
In some cases the
company also pledges a special series of
first mortgage bonds Issued under its own
mortgage indenture as additional
security
for holders of the revenue bonds
In each case the transaction
IS "capitalized" on the company's
books, i.e., the
pnysrcal equipment
IS Included In plant account and the liability (equal to the pnncrpal
amount of the related revenue bonds) is included in long-term debt. Besides facilitatIng the companies' compliance
with a wide
range of laws and regulations aimed at environmental protection,
the tax-free revenue
bond financmgs
provide the companies
With capital at costs considerably
below the
current costs of direct financing.
Where a revenue bond transaction
involves a registered holding company or any
of its subsidiary
companies,
the Commission's approval must be obtamed under applicable provlsions of the Act; during fiscal
1974 the first Significant
number of such
transactions
were authorized. In fiscal year
1974, applications
filed by 16 electric-utility
companies
involved revenue bond agreements with authorities
acting under the
laws of ten states.27 The applications
covered approximately
$263 million princrpal
amount of revenue bonds;28 and in the two
months immediately
following the close of
fiscal 1974, filings covering another $217
million principal amount were pending.

PART 7
CORPORATE

REORGANiZATIONS

The Commission's
role under Chapter X
of the Bankruptcy
Act, which provides a
procedure for reorganizing
corporations
In
the United States district
courts, ditters
from that under the various other statutes
which it administers. The Commission does
not Initiate Chapter X proceedings
or hold
ItS own hearings, and it has no authority to
determine
any of the Issues In such proceedings. The Commission
particlpates
In
proceedings
under Chapter X to provide independent, expert assistance to the courts,
participants,
and Investors In a highly complex area of corporate
law and finance. It
pays special attention to the Interest of public security holders who may not otherwrse
be respresented
effectively.
Where the scheduled
mdebtness
of a
debtor corporation
exceeds $3 million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires the judge,
before approving
any plan of reorganization, to subrmt It to the Oornmrssron for its
examination
and report. If the indebtedness
does not exceed $3 munon, the judge may, If
he deems It advisable to do so, submit the
plan to the Oornrrussion
before decidinq
whether to approve It. When the cornrrussion files a report, copies or summaries
must be sent to all security holders and
creditors when they are asked to vote on the
plan. The Oornrrnssron has no authority to
veto a plan of reorqaruzatron orto require ItS
adoption
The Ocmrmsslon
has not considered
It
necessary or appropriate
to participate
in
every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessive administrative
burden,
many of the

cases Involve only trade or bank creditors
and few public Investors. The Commission
seeks to participate
principally
In those
In which a substantial
public
proceedings
investor Interest In involved
However, the
Comrmssron may also partlcrpate because
an unfair plan has been or IS about to be
proposed,
public security holders are not
represented adequately, the reorganization
proceedings
are being conducted
In Violatron of important provisions of the Act, the
facts lndrcate that the Comrmssron can perform a useful service, or the judge requests
the Oornmrssron's participation.
The Commission
in ItS Chapter
X acnvities has divrded the country
into five
geographical
areas.
The New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle regional
offices of the Oornrnlssron each have responsrbrhty for one of these areas. Supervision and review of the regional
offices'
Chapter X work IS the responsibility
of the
Drvlsion of Corporate
Regulation
of the
Oornmissron, which. through ItS Branch of
Reorganization,
also serves as a field office
for the southeastern
area of the United
States

SUMMARY

OF ACTIVITIES

In fiscal year 1974, the Oornrmssron entered 23 new Chapter X proceedings involving companies With aggregate stated assets
of approximately
$1.1 brtuon and aggregate
Indebtedness of approximately
$1.0 billion.
Includrnq
the new proceedings,
the
Commission
was a party In a total of 132
123

reorganizations
proceedings during the fiscal year.' The stated assets of the companies Involved in these proceedings
totaled approximately
$3.3 billion and their
indebtedness
about $2.8 billion
During the fiscal year, 17 proceedings
were closed, leaving 115 In which the Commission was a party at fiscal year end.

ADMINISTRATIVE

MATTERS

In Chapter X proceedings,
the Commission seeks to protect the procedural
and
substantive
safeguards afforded parties In
such proceedings. The Commission also attempts to secure Judicial uniformity
In the
construction
of Chapter X and the procedures thereunder.

East

Moline

Downs,

Inc.2-This

publicly-held
company
operates
a horse
race track It filed a voluntary petition under
Chapter X. A number of mechanics
lien
claimants filed an answer to the petition alleging essentially that It was "unreasonable
to expect that a plan of reorganization
could
be effected." The claimants sought dlsmrssal of the petition for lack of good faith; and
the special master so recommended.
The
district judge, however, approved the petition, relying in part on a commitment
of a
substantial
loan to the debtor that was
negotiated subsequent to the special master's report. The hen claimants
appealed
and their appeal is still pending.
In the
meantime, despite the pendency of the appeal, the district court approved a plan of
reorganization
that incorporates
the loan
commitment
and provides for the continuation of the debtor's operations.
tmpenet '400' National Inc. 3_ The district
jUdge discharged
counsel for the trustee
pursuant
to a resolution
by the Judicial
Council of the Third Circuit to the effect that
when a chent of counsel for a Chapter X
trustee or of his law firm is a plan proponent
of a conflict of
there IS "the appearance
Interest."4
The district
court"
refused a
mandamus
application
seeking
relief
against the council. The court of appeals on
appeal from that order, in view of the long
lapse of time since counsel's
removal, remanded the case for reconslderatlon.s
The
Judicial Council petitioned for a rehearing.
It asserted that the remand for a hearing
124

should have been made to the Judicial
Council ratherthan to the district court The
court of appeals however denied a rehearIng since the district court was "au courant
with the affairs ofthe case." 7 Subsequently,
the district
court accepted
the trustee's
counsel's resignation
nunc pro tunc as of
the date of the original order of removal.
Traders Compress Company.8-As previously
reported,9
the debtor,
a small
publicly-owned
corporation,
IS engaged
primarily in the distribution
of liqurfled petroleum gas ("LPG") to over 8,500 rural customers In Oklahoma. A major supplier has
sought to discontinue
sales of LPG to the
debtor, asserting a shortage of supply. The
trustee, supported by the Commission,
obtained a district court order permanently enjoining
the supplier
from terminating
its
agreement to supply the debtor. The Commission argued that the Chapter X court had
summary jurisdiction
to enter the injunction
In order to preserve the going-concern
value of the debtor for the benefit of its credrtors and shareholders
if local law prohibited termination
of the supply contract. The
court found that the termination
was discriminatory
and Violated state public utility
and antitrust laws. During the fiscal year,
the supplier withdrew
its appeal from the
order
Equity Fundmg Corp. of America. 10_Two
days before the debtor filed its Chapter X
petition, its depository
banks set-off about
$10 million
In deposits
against secured
notes of Equity Funding. The order approvIng the Chapter
X petition
directed
the
banks to reverse the set-offs, and the banks
appealed. The court of appeals granted a
temporary stay of the district court's order.
Prior to the submission
of briefs on the
merits, the trustee stipulated to a dismissal
of the appeal and the retention by the banks
of the funds set-off. Trustee's counsel was of
the opinion that the reorganization
court
lacked summary [unsdlotlon
over tbrs matter; but no plenary action was initiated by
the trustee. The Commission
urged that a
reorganization
court has power to prevent a
set-off which would interfere With the continued operation
of the business
being
reorqanlzed." Such power does not alter
the underlying
rights of either party. Without the set-off the trustee would have use of

the debtor's bank account; the estate would
remain fully Indebted to the bank; and the
plan of reorganization would give equitable
recognition of any secunty interest the bank
might have had in the bank account.
The Supreme Court subsequently dealt
with the subject of set-off In reorganization
proceedings, in an aspect of the reorganization of the Penn Central Transportation
Company under Section 77. In Its opmron,
the Court concluded that a set-off "IS a form
of discrimination to which the policy of Section 77 ISopposed. As a general rule of administration ... the set-off should not be
allowed."12
In the Equity Funding proceeding, the drstnct court also authonzed the trustee to sell
the assets of Liberty Savings & Loan Association ("Liberty"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the debtor, to another savings and
loan institution. Liberty IS but one subsrdiary In the debtor's large and complex
corporate system. The trustee had determined that Liberty was not needed for the
reorganization of the debtor, and that It was
In the best Interest of the debtor to sell LIberty prior to the conclusion of these proceedings. The Commission supported the
trustee in his effort to prune the debtor's
business In order to tacrhtate a successful
reorqaruzatron.t? The court further ordered
that the proceeds from the sale be deposrted In an Interest beanng account from
which no disbursement could be made except with approval of the court and upon
notice to interested parties.
The sale was opposed by a group of
former Liberty shareholders, who had exchanged their stock for convertible preferred stock of the debtor in a 1971 merger
of Liberty with Crown Savings & Loan Association, then a subsidiary of the debtor.
The objectors asserted the nght to rescind
the 1971 transaction for alleged fraud and to
reclaim the assets of Liberty. They appealed
from the drstnct court's order authorizing
the sale.
The court of appeals, as urged by the
Commission, affirmed the order of the district court.t- The court of appeals agreed
with the lower court's findings of fact" ...
that the market value of Liberty was likely to
detenorate In the near future, that it might
be a very substantial decline and that the

proposed sale would be In the best interest
of the bankrupt estate." It also stated that
impoundment of the proceeds adequately
protected the interest of the appellants until
their claims for rescission and reclamation
should be resolved.
The objectors have asked the Supreme
Court to overturn the ruling of the court of
appeals Further proceedings have been
continued pending settlement negotiations. The sale was concluded by agreement, and a settlement agreement IS pendIng before the bankruptcy court.
First Home Investment Corp. of Kansas.
Inc. 15_ The debtor (" FHI") ISa publicly-held
face-amount certificate company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940. Over 22,000 public Investors purchased more than $50 million of ItS stock
and face-amount certificates Sales of FHI
securities ceased after a Commission staff
investigation disclosed that fraudulent misrepresentations had been made in the sale
of the securities by Bush & CO.,1ea brokerdealer and prlncrpal underwriter for FHI. FHI
filed a Chapter X petition because It was
unable to meet ItS obligations on over $30
million In loan commitments. Theretofore.
the continuing sale of securities had been
the princrpal source of funds to meet loan
commitments. Subsequently the trustee
was able to sell the bulk of the outstanding
loan commitments but at a loss of almost $3
million pnmanly because of money market
conditions and the uneconomic terms of
the commitments
The debtor's primary liability consists of
face-amount certificates, of which over $33
million were outstanding when the Chapter
X petition was filed The trustee, with approval of the court, resumed redemption of
these face-amount certificates. The trustee
has thus far redeemed over $20 million of
these certificates.
Dunng the course of the proceedings, a
former officer and director of the debtor and
others associated with him began soliciting
funds from public Investors, as well as authority to represent them in the proceedings.H The Commission obtained an order
from the court enjoining further solicitations
and directing an accounting of receipts and
disbursements.ts The Commission subsequently filed objections to the accounting
125

and req uested disallowance of substantially
all claimed expenses. The district court has
not yet rendered a decision
Farrington Manufacturmg
Compeny.w-Â«
In approving the trustee's plan to distribute
cash to creditors, the court ordered that
stockholders, classified as creditors for alleged claims based on Violations of the Federal securities laws, should be given notice
of the plan by publication only Atthe urging
of counsel for creditor-stockholders
and
the Commission,
the court amended its
order to provide that they be gIven notice by
mall and to receive, on request, the material
required to be submitted to security holders
under Section 175 of Chapter X.
Courts have held that fundamental reqursrtes of due process require that persons
whose rights are to be affected and whose
Identity can be ascertained With reasonable
effort receive notice reasonably calculated
to apprise them of the pending action. Publication
IS not a substitute
for actual
notlce.20

TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION
STATEMENTS

AND

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by the prior management ISa requisite under Chapter X. One
of the primary duties of the trustee IS to
make a thorough study of the debtor to assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the estate, Including claims against
officers, directors, or controlling
persons
who may have mismanaged the debtor's affairs. The staff of the Commission often aids
the trustee In his investigation
EquIty Fundmg Corp. of Amertca.21-The
Commission
filed an injunctive
action
against this holding company, alleging VIOlations of antifraud and numerous other
provisions of the Federal secunnes laws.22
After entry of a permanent injunction and
appointment by the court of a special investigator and directors, the company filed ItS
Chapter X petition.
Within ten months of hrs appointment, the
trustee filed With the court an extensive report of hrs preliminary investigation of the
debtor's affairs. A summary of It was transmitted to creditors and stockholders
The
trustee reported that a large amount of the
126

insurance policies, purportedly issued by a
principal Insurance subsidiary of the debtor
were fictlttous and a substantial portion of
ItS assets were non-existent.
If the debtor had published ItS annual report for 1972, it would have shown consolidated assets of about $737.5 million and
consolidated stockholders' equity of about
$143.4 million. As adjusted by the trustee,
consolidated revenues for 1972 were about
$103.6 million, consolidated assets, about
$4889 million; consolidated stockholders'
equity showed about a $42.1 million deficrt.
Westec Corporatlon.23-The
trustee has
entered Into a compromise settlement with
almost all the major defendants in a civil
action based on alleged violations of the
securities laws and breaches of fiduciary
duty, In connection with alleged manipulation of the debtor's stock.24 The action was
brought against 92 defendants on behalf of
the debtor estate and the class of allegedly
defrauded shareholders.
Total estimated
damages were about $37 million of which
$28 million represented the out-of-pocket
losses suffered by the class of shareholders.
In various separate settlements approved
by the court to date, the major defendants
have contributed
approximately
$6.8 million to the settlement fund, which IS being
held In escrow pending conclusron of the
lawsuit. Thereafter, allocation will be made
among the reorganized company, the class
plaintiffs and certain creditors, pursuant to
the confirmed plan of reorganization.
R. Hoe & Co., Inc.25-As
a result of rus
mvestrqatron,
the trustee commenced
in
1971 a lawsuit against the debtor's former
auditors
and management.
The claims
against the auditors were based on their
alleged failure to perform properly the protessionat services for which they were retained. The claims against debtor's management were based on ItS alleged waste
and mismanagement
of corporate assets
and to recover profits from alleged msider
trading In the debtor's secuntres. Both before and after the filing of the Chapter X
petition, a number of mdrvidual and class
shareholder
actions had been initiated
against the debtor, ItS former officers and
management based upon substantially the
same acts Since the order approving the
Chapter X petition enjoined the contmua-

tion of SUitS against

the debtor,

proofs

of

claim in excess of $25 million have been
filed In the Chapter X proceeding on behalf
of class and individual shareholders.
After more than two years of negotiations,
an overall settlement was proposed. A settlement fund of $4.5 million was created by
the debtor's former officers, directors, auditors and their insurers. Under the proposed settlement $2.7 million plus Interest
was to be allocated to the shareholders In
the class actions and $1.8 million plus interest to the estate.
The Commission urged that to determine
whether the allocation was fair the court
hold a hearing so that evidence be presented to permit a fair assessment of the
compromise 26 Following such a hearing,
the Commission advised the court that It
had no objection to the terms of the settlement, which the court subsequently
approved
King Resources Company.27-The
trustee, during the fiscal year, continued to resolve key problems regarding the estate. He
negotiated agreements of settlement With
Global Natural Resources Properties, Ltd.
and National Resources Company concernIng the development of over 25 million acres
of Canadian Artie oil and gas properties.
Next, the court approved the sale of debtor's mining Interests in South Africa for $4
million, which enabled the trustee to enter
Into a compromise
agreement
With the
Bank of America to release ItS claims and
liens on the property.
The court also approved the sale of debtor's interest in certain real estate in Denver,
Colorado, and certain exploratory rights in
the Dutch North Sea, from which the trustee
realized a net of about $3 million and $1.4
million,
respectively.
These funds were
used to repay the balance owed on trustee's
certificates
and to exercise an option to
purchase certain property which the trustee
had under lease. The trustee also settled
claims of Canadian lien creditors on the
same terms that had previously been accepted by domestic lien creditors, I.e., 75
percent in cash and the balance to be
treated as an unsecured claim.
Dtversitted Mountaineer Cotporetton. 28_
The debtor, a financial service holding company, operated through eleven of ItS wholly-

owned Subsidiaries, located In four states,
an uninsured Industrial savings and loan
business. Over 20,000 persons Invested
over $50 million In ItS pass book savings
accounts.
The debtor's board of directors did not
file reorganization
petitions for the parent
and all subsrdrarles
in one [unsdrctron
as
permitted under Section 129 of Chapter X.
Rather, the parent debtor and all of the West
Virginia subsidranes filed under Chapter X
in the appropriate
court In West Virginia
about a month after the other subsidiaries,
located In Kentucky and Tennessee, had
filed Chapter XI petitions In their respective
states.29 The Virginia subsrdianes
were
placed under the control of state courtappointed receivers at the Insistence of the
Virginia State Corporation Cornrmssron.t''
The ftducrarles
appointed
by the four
junsdrctions
each took different positions
With respect to the interpretation
of the
Inter-company
debt and transfers that occured prior to reorganization
and commenced litigation against one another. The
primary controversy was whether certain
sales of loan receivables by one subsidiary
to another With the proceeds subsequently
funnelled to the parent, were bona fide
transactions or whether the sales were actually loans to the parent Improperly collateralized
by assets of the seiling subsrdiary. The flducrarles
recognized
the
complex
nature of the inter-corporate
transactions,
and after extensive
arm's
length negotiations,
In which Commission counsel assisted, entered Into an overall settlement of all Inter-company matters
The settlement was subsequently approved
by the courts in all the junsdrctrons

PLANS OF REORGANIZATION
Generally, the Commission files a formal
advisory report only in a case which involves substantial public Investor Interest
and presents significant
problems
When
no such formal report IS filed, the Commission may state its views briefly by letter, or
authonze ItS counsel to make an oral or
written presentation
During the fiscal year
the Cornmlssron published two advisory reports to supplement a prior advisory report
dealing With four plans of raorqaruzatron."
127

Its views on five other plans of reorganrzation were presented to the courts either orally or by written memoranda."
Imperial '400' National, Inc.33-The
court
of appeals affirmed the district court's order
of valuation
subject to reconsideration
In
light of, among other things, "the manner of
dealing
with a possible
tax carry-forward."34 Subsequently,
the district
court
reconsidered
the valuation
in connection
with the various proposed
plans of reorganization and concluded that It should be
increased by "a maximum of $200,000" for
the value of the tax loss carry-forward
35
One plan proponent amended rts plan to
comply substantially
with the suggestions
supplemencontained In the Commission's
tal advisory report36 and the district court's
oplruon." The court approved the amended
plan and an appeal was taken by a stockholder,3s who had proposed
a competing
plan which the court declined to approve 39
Shortly after the approval of its amended
plan, the successful
plan proponent
reported a sharp decline in gross revenues
and net after-tax earnings. The plan was
further amended at the court's direction,
and after its approval the plan was subrmtted to Imperial's creditors and shareholders
for their acceptances
The shareholder,
who appealed from the original approval
order, also has appealed from the order approving the plan as amended.40 The two appeals were consolidated.
The plan was
not accepted by creditors or stockholders.
The Commission's motion to stay the appeals
on the ground that they may be moot, was
granted. A new plan ISto be proposed by the
trustee.
TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc.41-The
trustee's
plan provided In the alternatrve for an internal reorganization
or a sale of TMT as a
going-concern
to a privately-held
shipping
firm. The proceeds from the sale would be
used to pay creditors in full, including
post-bankruptcy
interest, and to pay the
holders of common stock $3 per share after
adjustment
for a one-for-five
reverse split
effected In 1958, which reduced the number
of outstanding
shares to about 800,000. In
the interim, settlements of the pnncipal disputed claims had been approved and the
settlement
amounts
paid After hearings,

128

the court directed the trustee to proceed
with the sale alternative.
The Commission
filed a memorandum
advising the district court that the alternative plan could be found to be fair, equitable
and feasible. After the close of the fiscal
year, the alternative
plan was approved by
the district court, accepted by the stockholders (the only affected class) and confirmed.
Atlanta International
Raceway, Inc.42The court approved the trustee's amended
plan of reorganization,
based on the solvency
of tnrs automobile
race-track
operator,

which

provided

that (1) the mor-

tage debt would be partially paid off and the
remainder assumed at a higher rate by the
reorganized
debtor;
(2) other creditors
of
would receive new shares In satisfaction
their claims; (3) proponents
would receive
52 percent of the reorganized company's
outstanding
shares In payment for a capital
contribution
and making available certain
loans; and (4) existing stockholders
would
retain their shares, representing
about 20
percent of shares to be outstanding.
The
creditors
overwhelmingly
accepted
the
plan; but stockholders,
also overwhelmingly, voted against the plan
Although a plan providrnq for the resrdual
equity of a reorganized company to remain
with ItS present stockholders
does not alter
substantive
rights, the proponents
agreed
to purchase the shares of dissenting stockholders at $1.60 per share. Since the court
previously found a reorganization
value of
not more than $1 per share, it concluded
that the proponents'
offer provided the "adequate protection"
required
by Section
216(8), and confirmed
the plan.
An appeal from the order of confirmation
was taken by a shareholder
and one of the
proponents
of a competing
plan.43 The
Cornmlssron In ItS brief supported the district court's order confirming
the plan. On
December 6,1974, the Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Crrcurt affirmed per curiam Without
opinion the district court's confirmation
order.
Tilco, Inc. 44_ The debtor IS a publiclyheld holding company with a number of
wholly-owned
subsidranes
engaged In the
business of producrnq 011and gas One of

the debtor's subsidiaries, Natural Resources Fund, Inc. ("NRF"), ISthe general
partner in six limited partnerships formed
for the purpose of exploring, drilling, and
operating oil and gas properties. About
5,500 investors contributed In excess of $27
million for interests in the SIX limited
partnerships.
The trustee submitted a plan of reorganization which calls for the sale of the principal debtor corporations. Administration
costs and secured creditors will be paid In
full with any balance remaining to be distributed pro rata to the unsecured creditors.
Shareholders will not participate under the
plan since the debtor is insolvent. With respect to the limited partners of NRF, the
trustee will make an offer to purchase the
individual partnership Interests based on
the cash liquidating value as computed
under the original partnership agreement.
The Commission advised the court, inter
etiÂ«, that the plan was unfair to the limited
partners since it ignored their right under
two separate provisions of the partnership
agreements to liquidate the partnership
properties for their own account without
being limited to the cash Iiqurdatmq value
relied on in the plan. The court approved the
plan.
Showcase Corp 45_The trustee filed a
plan of reorganization
for this small
publicly-held company whose business is
leasing microfilm IIbranes of construction
materials. The plan made provrsion for
shareholders even though the debtor was
found to be Insolvent; shareholders were
offered the nght to purchase stock of the
reorganized company for cash In exchange
for their old shares. The money from the
offering was to be used to pay about
$500,000of administrative, prionty and secured indebtedness The court concluded
that under Section 264(a){2) of Chapter X
the shares to be offered to the public shareholders were exempt from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933.The Commission objected, urging that Section
264(a){2) did not apply.
The Commission argued that Section
264(a){2) by ItS terms requires that securities Issued pursuant to a plan of reorganization be in exchange, at least in part, for
secunnes of or claims against the debtor.

The legislative history of Chapter X clearly
shows that new securities not so Issued are
not exempt from registration merely because Issued pursuant to a plan of reorganization.46Several district courts have so interpreted Section 393a(2) of Chapter XI47
and Section 3(a){10) of the Securities Act of
1933,48which also provide exemptions for
securities issued in bankruptcy proceedIngs.
The Commission also urged that for the
"exchange"
to come Within Section
264a(2),the old stock must have some subsisting value. It has no value when the
debtor IS insolvent
The Commission had intervened in the
proceeding as the agency charged Withthe
enforcement of the Federal sacuntres laws,
and in that capacity appealed the court's
ruling on the exemption Subsequently, the
trustee amended the plan to provide for registratron of the securities to be offered for
sale to the old shareholders. The Commission will withdraw its appeal If the amended
plan is confirmed

bythe court, provided for an orderly tlquidation of the debtor's assets.The most Important feature was a settlement With debtor's
major secured creditor who ISto receivethe
stock of the debtor's most substantial subSidiary In exchange for its entire claim.
Under the settlement the major creditor
also ISto pay $625,000to the estate which
when added to the funds already on hand
will permit the trustee after payment of all
priority and administrative claims to make a
pro rata distribution estimated at 17 percent
to the debtor's other creditors. Since the
debtor is insolvent, ItScommon shareholders were excluded from participation.
Eastern
Credit
Corporation.
50-The
equity receivership, which originated from
an injunctive action by the comrmsston.s'
was superseded by a Chapter X proceeding
after the receiver had determined that a sale
of the debtor as a gOing-concern could best
be effected by a Chapter X plan of reorganization.
Thedebtor's preferred stock and about89
percent of its common stock are owned by
Eastern Finance Corporation and the re129

maining 11 percent of the common stock by
about 120 persons. Smce the debtor was
solvent, funds from the sale would be available for distribution to Eastern Fmance and
to the public holders of common stock. The
reorganization was concluded in about four
months from the date the Chapter X petition
was flled.52

ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO
ALLOWANCES
Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem of determinmg
the compensation to be paid to the vanous
parties for services rendered and for expenses incurred in the proceeding. The
Commission, which under Section 242 of
the Bankruptcy Act may not receive any allowance for the service it renders, has
sought to assist the courts 10 assurmg
economy of adrrunlstratron and in allocat109compensation equitably on the basis of
the claimants' contributions to the admmistratron of estates and the formulation of
plans. During the fiscal year 319 applications for compensation totaling about $11
million were reviewed.
Yale Express System, Inc. 53-Twelve applicants sought final allowances (includmg
amounts previously paid), and reimbursement of expenses aggregating
about
$2,696,000.
The Commission
recommended payment of about $1,654,000. The
court awarded fees and expenses totaling
about $1,684,000 54
Two applicants, a former trustee and trustee's counsel, requested interest at the rate
of 6V2 percent per annum on the unpaid
portion of their respective allowances. That
was the rate applied to the claims of Yale's
creditors under the confirmed plan of reorganization. The court, as urged by the
Commission, did not award interest to these
applicants. The court noted that they had no
specific claim to fees and that they did not
have the same status as Yale's credltors.P
Cybern Education, Inc. 55-The court of
appeals vacated an order award 109the trustee and his counsel fees that equalled the
cash remainmg 10 the debtor's estate after
liquidation of all its assets." On remand,
counsel for the trustee requested a final allowance of $30,000, and trustee waived any
130

further allowance to himself. The distnct
court in award 109 only $10,000 to counsel
for the trustee stated that "(a] request for
one-half of an estate is not for the benefit of
the debtor or the creditors, but is for the
attorneys' benefit, and cannot be allowed."
In addition, the distnct court ordered that
counsel for the debtor who had filed the
debtor's Chapter X petition return to the
estate $4,800 of a $6,000 fee received prior
to the lnstrtutron of these proceedings.
The district court confirmed the trustee's
plan of llquidatlon which provided for distribution of the remaining cash for adrnlrustrative costs and tax claims. A final decree
closmg the proceeding was entered after
the end of the fiscal year.

INTERVENTION

IN CHAPTER XI

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides
a procedure by which debtors can effect
arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts under court supervision. Where
a proceedmg is brought under that Chapter
but the facts mdicate that It should have
been brought under Chapter X, Section 328
of Chapter XI authorizes the Oommlssron or
any other party in interest to make application to the court to dismiss the Chapter XI
proceeding unless the debtor's petition is
amended to comply With the requirements
of Chapter X, or a creditors' petition under
Chapter X is fried.
The Supreme Court adopted Chapter XI
rules effective as of July 1, 1974. Under Rule
11-15, which governs the filing of Section
328 rnotrons, the Commission as well as
other parties in interest, except the debtor,
have 120 days from the first date set for the
first meeting of creditors to file a motion.
The time may be extended for good cause. A
motion made by the debtor for transfer,
however, may be made at any time. The rule
also requires a showing that a Chapter X
reorganization is feasible. Tms 10 effect
means that a motion can be granted only if
the Court finds both that Chapter XI is inadequate and reorganization under Chapter X
is possible. The prior procedure for filing a
Chapter X petition after the granting of the
motron and a separate hearing on the petition have been abolished.
Attempts are sometimes made to misuse

Chapter XI so as to depnve Investors of the
protection which the Secunties Act of 1933
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are
designed to provide.s8 In such cases the
Commission's staff normally attempts to resolve the problem by Informal negotiations.
If this proves fruitless, the Commission intervenes in the Chapter XI proceeding to
develop an adequate record and to direct
the court's attention to the applicable provrsions of the Federal securities laws and
their bearing upon the particular case.
Arlan's Dept. Stores, Inc. 58-The company operates a chain of discount stores.
For the two and one-quarter years prior to
the Chapter XI proceedings,
it reported
losses in excess of $45 million. The company's capitalization includes$15 million in
subordinated
convertible debentures held
by 775 public Investors. The Commission In
ItS motion pursuant to Section 328 urged,
among other things, that rehabilitation
of
the company required a substantial adjustment of widely-held public debt. The court
granted the Commlssron's
motlon,60 and
subsequently a voluntary Chapter X petition
was approved and a trustee appointed.
Lyntex Corporation. 61_ The company IS a
wholesale distributor
of sewing materials.
For the two and three-quarter years prior to
the Chapter XI proceedings,
it reported
losses in excess of $19 million. Shortly before the inception of the Chapter XI proceedings, the company's
financial statements reflected

a deficit net worth of $10.5

million. The company's
capitalization
inconcludes $13.7 million in subordinated
vertible debentures held by 1,450 public investors. The Oornrnlssron in its Section 328
motion urged, among other things, that
there was a need for a thorough investigation by an Independent trustee and that rehabilitation of the company required a substantial adjustment of widely-held
public
debt. The court granted the Commission's
motion. A Chapter X petition was thereafter
filed and approved, and a trustee appointed.

Welfare Finance corporeuon. 62_ The
debtor is engaged in the small loan business. It had financed its operations through
the sale of over $63 million in debt instruments to about 8,000 persons. In filing a
Section 328 motion, the Oornrnlssron urged
that the financial condition of the debtor

called for more than a simple composition
of unsecured debt, and that a disinterested
trustee was needed to investigate potential
causes of action against certain officers and
directors of the debtor.
A plan of arrangement was filed before
the motion was acted upon. It provided for a
sale of the debtor
to an unaffiliated
publicly-held
corporation.
Public creditors
Will be paid $50 million, $10 million in cash
at confirmation,
and $40 million In various
debt Issues of the purchaser bearing interest at different rates and maturing over a
16-year period. The Commission
raised
questions as to whether the debtor had accepted the best offer. Thereupon, the court
appointed an Investment banking firm to
evaluate the purchase offers made by the
three bidders, all substantial publicly-held
corporations. As a result, the proponent improved his onqrnal offer by over $1 million.
The plan also provides for new management; assignment
of causes of action
against certain officers and directors to a
special designee who will pursue them for
the benefit of the public Investors; and effectively eliminates
any participation
by
past management.
Under
these
circumstances, the Oomrrussron withdrew its
Section 328 motion.

North Western
Corporatlon.63-Over

Mortgage

Investors

1,700 persons purchased from the debtor, corporate notes
secured by fractional Interests In over 100
mortgages, real estate contracts, and parcels of real property. The debtor's
sole
shareholder
filed a preliminary
plan that
sought in essence to retain his control over
the corporation
while creditors, including
the public secured creditors,
would be
asked to wait for up to three years for payment. The Commission, supporting a creditor's Section 328 motion, urged that there
was a need for a new management and a
disinterested
investigation
into the prior
acts of management. It also urged that the
secunty was so fractionalized that the reorganization machinery was essential to preserve its value for public creditors. The motion was granted. Thereafter, the court approved an Involuntary Chapter X petition
that had been previously filed by creditors
and appornted a trustee
Puts & Call, Inc. 64_ The company was en131

gaged in the business of issuing and brokering commodity option contracts on unregulated commodities. After the commencement of the Chapter XI proceeding, a
California state court found that debtor had
been selling a security and enjoined the further sale of commodity futures contracts
until qualified under California law.65 This
effectively put the debtor out of business,
although it had conducted no operations
since the Chapter XI proceeding began.
The debtor's assets were liquidated leavin $600,000 In cash. More than 4,000 creditors, mostly customers, held claims exceeding $26 million. A plan of arrangement was
proposed which provided for a privatelyheld commodity broker to acquire debtor's
assets, for which it would pay a modest
amount in cash and issue Its stock in exchange for claims against the debtor.
The court granted the Commission's motion to intervene specially to enforce the
Federal securities laws.66 The purpose of
the intervention was to develop the record
as to the adequacy of the disclosure of material facts and to assist the court in its task
of scrutinizing securities which were to be
issued pursuant to the arrangement and
thus prevent the distribution of stock of
doubtful value to an unsuspecting public.s7
During the hearing, the proposed arrangement was Withdrawn.
Section 393a(2) of Chapter XI provides an
exemption from the registration provisions
of the Securities Act for "any transaction in
any security issued pursuant to an arrangement in exchange for claims against
" Since the debtor had
the debtor ....
ceased its operations, It was the Commission's view that there was no business to
rehabilitate in Chapter XI, and that the
claimed exemption would serve no purpose
other than a public distribution of the nondebtor's stock without reglstratron.68
Digital Application, Inc.69-The debtor, a
publicly-held manufacturer of certain electronic equipment (printed circuit boards),
proposed a Chapter XI arrangement with its
unsecured creditors whereby another public company would purchase through a
newly created subsidiary all the assets of
the debtor. Creditors Will be offered cash or
common stock of the subsidiary in exchange for their claims. The pubhc share132

holders, In exchange for their common
stock In the debtor, will receive 20 to 25
percent of the common stock of the newly
created corporation, depending on the
amount of stock creditors choose to accept.
In order to comply with the registration provisions of the Securities Act for these securities, the Issuer filed with the Commission a
combination registration, prospectus and
proxy pursuant to Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

1933 is required for the issuance of securities to the security holders or creditors of
the debtor in whole or part exchange for
their old secuntres or claims. However, new
issues sold by the reorganized company for
cash are required to be registered under the
Securities Act just as any other new issues
of securities,
In order that prospective
investors may have all material information
before buying."
47The Southern District of New York has
Interpreted
Section 393a(2) to mean that:
"Stock issued entirely for cash does not
meet the requirements
of the statute on its
face. To be exempt the stock must be partly
or completely
in exchange
for claims
against the arrangement
debtor, and cannot be completely
in exchange for cash."

SEC MANAGEMENT
OPERATIONS

1974 was another year in which the Commission made optimum use of its money
and personnel for the public interest.

ORGANIZATIONAL

CHANGES

The Commission effected some orqaruzational changes to ensure the best possible
application of Its resources. The more significant changes are mentioned below.
Three new specialized
offices were
created in the Division of Enforcement: a
Branch of Investment Management Enforcement to handle proceedings against
investment companies and advisers; a
Branch of Program Management to handle
special projects such as a tax shelter study
and a program on delinquent filings; and a
Chief Counsel's Office to render legal advice to the staff, regions, and other Federal
agencies on enforcement matters. In addition, the Dlvrsion's organizational structure
was modified to provide that the only persons reporting directly to the Director are its
three Associate Directors.
Changes were made in the structure of
several of the Regional Offices to give all
nine offices parallel organizations. The staff
in each office has been divided between the
two program areas, enforcement and regulation, with one senior official reporting directly to the Administrator on each program.
The Executive Director added a senior
level official to his staff to serve as Regional
Office Coordinator. The coordinator's position was established to insure uniformity

among the Regional Offices In program objactlves and resource availability, to Improve communication, and to give those offices a voice at headquarters.

EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT
CONFERENCE
The Oomrrusston held ItS first executive
management conference In October 1973.
In announcing the conference, the Chairman stated that Its purpose was "to assemble the SEC's top management team ...
for a concentrated
discussion
of our
priorities and objectives for the next two or
three years." The conference was an attempt to avoid "the constant danger of becoming so engulfed in critical day-to-day
decrsions that we may not adequately focus
upon the necessarily broad perspective of
our overall objectives and Congressional
mandates." The eight conference sessions
focused on current Cornrnlssron responsibilities, probable future responsibilities,
and the agency's management process.
Since October, each of the major DiviSions
has had the opportunity to meet with the
Commission for an informal discussion of
projects, priorities, and special areas of
concern.
The need for Improved communications
amon9 the Regional Offices themselves and
between the Offices and Headquarters was
recognized as paramount. West Coast and
East Coast conferences of Regional Administrators were scheduled later in the
year. The topics discussed at these confer137

ences included case referrals, examination
programs, the manpower reportmg system,
equipment budgets, training. and grade
structures.

Recruitment
With the Congressional autncrtzatron of
263 addrnonal positions during the fiscal
year, the Commission launched an intensive recruitment program. Attorney recruiting trrps to schools from New England to
California resulted In applrcanons from
many highly qualified students. Special efforts were made to Identify senior accountants for a varrety of staff positrons More
than 200 responses were received from a
notice placed in the CPA Bulletin. Many of
those responding received eligible ratings
10 the senior level civil service examination.
In addition to filling the Commission's own
needs, this nationwide effort resulted in
greatly Increasing the number of accountants on the register who are now available
to other Federal agencies Extensive efforts
were also made to recrurt secretarres, 10cluding trrps to business schools in several
states outside the Immediate Washmgton,
D.C area.
During all of the recruitment efforts, the
Oommlssron's commitment to increase opportunities for rrunoritres and women was
emphasized. Of all new and vacant pOSItlons which were filled during the year 19
percent were filled by women and
rnlnorines. Of attorneys hired, 23 percent
were women or rnrnorrty group members.

Training and Development
Two new upward mobility programs were
mitiated during the year Under a pilot Tui138

non Support Program, many employees
who enroll in college degree programs may
receive tuition assistance for those courses
which relate to their present positions orthe
Comrmsslon's general area of work. At the
same nrne a Career Opportunrties Program
ISenabling an Initial group of 10 employees
to receive training 10 tYPing, EnglIsh, and
office skills to qualify them to move out of
their present clencal jobs.
Seminars, conducted by the staff on a variety of subjects, were offered to the Comrmsslon staff as well as the staffs of companion Federal, state, and industry agencies.
EIght of the Regional Offices sponsored
three to frve day semmars on enforcement
and regulatory
matters. encouraging
cooperation
and developing expertise
among all area officials On a larger scale,
two of the major DiVISIonssponsored seminars for enforcement officers and securities
compliance examinars, respectively. These
programs included mock trials and analysis
workshops.

Personnel Management
Evaluation
In February 1974, the CIVil service Commlssion rrutrated a nationwide review and
evaluation of the ccrnnussion's personnel
management program CSC evaluators visited nine regional and three branch otnces
durmg the following three months. Members of the Office of Personnel assisted the
regional and branch offrces in preparmg for
the evaluations and participated in the oral
close-out presentations made by CiVil Service Comrmssron personnel. The Headquarters Office revrew was scheduled for October 1974

INFORMATION

DISSEMINATION

The full disclosure program requires that
an acnve program of mtorrnatton drsserrunation be mamtamed by the Commission
Public lntormatron
is made available
through a variety of services and publicanons
As noted above, the Commission has Public Reference Rooms in Washmgton, DC.,
New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, where
members of the public may examme Comrnlssron records.
Because of space

shortages,
the Washington
Public Reference Room was moved from the headquarters bUilding to Eleventh and LStreets, N.W.
Despite some temporary confusion, visitors
now find a greater availability of carrels, microfiche
readers and reader/printers,
and
Xerox machines than before.
Microfiche
copies of reports filed with
the Commission
are made available to the
public under a contract which was awarded
at no cost to the government.
During the
second year of that contract, several services have been expanded
Exhibits which
are filed with registration
statements and
various other reports filed with the Commission are now being filmed with the baste
document
A comprehensive
financial
thesaurus and other research tools which
are of great assistance In accessing the files
were also developed during 1974.
Subscriptions
to the SEC Docket,

those used in the Code of Federal Regulations and the Federal Register.

AUTOMATED
SYSTEMS
Significant

INFORMATION

progress

was made during the

year with respect to Improving
the SEC's
research and reporting capabilities
The capacity of the Commission's
own
computer was increased by the Installation
of additional core storage and several disk
drives. This equipment provides for a larger
memory and direct access capability, allowing more Jobs to be run simultaneously
and
eliminating
costly processing time Involved
In sequential access systems.
The Office of Data Processing developed
several new products during the year. A system was developed from which a Public Delinquency List will be published periodically, identifying
firms which have failed to
timely file required reports. In July 1973, a
system designed
to coordinate
Broker/
Dealer examinations
conducted
by the
Commission,
SIPC, and the Industry's selfregulatory
organizations,
became operational. The system provides information
to

the examining
authorities
which enables
them to perform more effective examinations.
One other new product

from the Office of

Data Processing
was Computer
Output
Microfiche
(COM) This process, by which
computer
output
is filmed
rather than
printed, IS cheaper, more durable, and requires far less storage space than traditional printed computer reports Expanded
use of this technique will be continued
In
1975.
A JOint NASD/SEC Task Team dunnq the
year explored the potential use of computer
technology
for Improving
the surveillance
and enforcement
programs.
Some experience
with time-sharing
and
other types of hardware was also acquired
during the year A programmable
calculator
was purchased for the Office of Economic
Research. The calculator can satisfy many
of OER's analysis needs at less cost than the
computer and without delay. In order to respond to the needs of the Central Market
System
Advisory
Committee
for fast,
sophisticated
analyses, an account was established
with the National
Institutes
of
Health. The Commission
IS thus able to use
exrstlnq soft-ware and obtain Instant feedback. Two automated systems, one for accounting and the second for legal research
were reviewed during the year to determine
their cost effectiveness

as research

tools.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Fees collected by the Commission
In fiscal 1974 amounted to 60 percent of funds
appropriated
by the Congress for Commission operations.' The Commission
is required by law to collect fees for (1) registration of securities issued; (2) qualification
of
trust indentures;
(3) registration
of exchanges;
(4) registration
of brokers and
dealers who are registered with the Commission but are not members of the NASD;
and (5) certification
of documents filed with
the Commission.
In addltron, by fee schedule, the Commission
imposes fees for certain filings and services such as the filing of
annual reports and proxy material.
With reference to the fee schedule, on
March
29, 1974, the Commission
announced the repeal of certain provrsrons of
139

Rule 203-3 under the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940. One of the paragraphs repealed, Rule 203-3(b), required each registered Investment adviser to pay a $100 annual fee to the Commission during the
period of its registration. The action was
taken following the Commission's consideration of recent decisions of the United
States Supreme Court2 with respect to the
Independent Offices Appropriation Act of
1952,31 U.S.C. 483(a), which was thoughtto

140

provide the statutory basis for establishing
these fees. The Commission is presently reviewing all other fees imposed pursuant to
the same Act.

THE SECURITIES

INDUSTRY

Income and Expenses
Gross revenue of broker-dealers from all
activities fell 21 percent to $5.5 billion In
1973 from $7.0 billion In 1972. Except for
interest Income on customers' accounts,
commodities income and other business,
all income sources registered sizeable declines compared to 1972. Revenue derived
from over-the-counter market making, tradIng In non-exempt securrties and underwritIng activities fell more sharply than the
other revenue Items. (Note: A small number
of firms pnncrpally engaged In the insurance business have been deleted from all

years on this table to eliminate distortions
created by the disproportionately
large
amounts of their other Income unrelated to
the securities busmess.)
Total expenses decreased 9 percent 10
$5.5 billion In 1973 from $6.0 billion In 1972.
Registered representatives' compensation
and clerical and administrative employees
costs accounted for nearly all of the $559
million decrease. In contrast, commissions
paid to other brokers and Interest expenses
increased $188 million In 1973 Brokerdealers' operating Income, before partners'
compensation and taxes amounted to $57
million In 1973 compared With $976 million
in 1972.

Broker-dealers'
reported
assets total
$25.9 billion at year-end 1973 compared
With $33.7 billion at year-end 1972. This 23
percent decline in total assets was attributable to the 28 percent drop In securities
failed to deliver to $1.9 billion, the 33 percent drop In debit balances earned for customers securities accounts (including both
cash and margin accounts), and the 17 percent drop in long positions in securities and
commodities to $10.0 billion. The 14 percent decrease in the number of reporting
firms to 2,164 accounted for much of the
decline In these assets. (NOTE: A small
number of firms principally engaged in the
insurance business have been deleted from
all years shown on this table to eliminate
distortions
created
by the disproportionately large amounts of their assets unrelated to the securities business.)

Number and Assets of
Registered Investment Companies
As of the end of the 1974 fiscal year, 1,377
Investment companies were registered with
the Commission, an increase of 16 from the
number of one year earlier. Of the registered
companies, 89 were classified as "inactive."
Approximately 62 percent of the active
companies were management open-end
companies ("mutual funds").
The 1,288 active companies had total assets having an approximate market value of

$62 billion, with mutual funds accounting
for about 74 percent of that value. The $62
billion figure respresents about an 18 percent decline from the $73.1 billion total at
the end of the last fiscal year. Despite this
decline, the investment company industry
has experienced tremendous growth in the
years since the Investment Company Act
was enacted, a fact which can be appreciated by noting that In 1950 there were
366 Investment companies with total assets
of about $4.7 billion, and that, as recently as
1960, there were only 570 companies With
assets of $23.5 billion.

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table below reflects, the securities
laws provide for a wide range of enforcement actions by the Commission. The most
common types of actions are injunctive
proceedings instituted in the Federal district courts to enjoin continued or

threatened securities Jaw violators, and
administrative proceedings pertaining to
broker-dealer firms and/or individuals associated with such firms which may lead to
various remedial sanctions as required in
the public interest. When an Injunction IS
entered by a court, violation of the court's
decree is a basis for criminal contempt action against the violator.

SEC OPERATIONS
Net Cost
Fees collected by the Commission in fiscal 1974 amounted to 60 percent of funds
appropriated by the Congress for Commission operations. The Commission is required by law to collect fees for (1) registration of securities issued; (2) qualification of
trust indentures; (3) registration of exchanges; (4) brokers and dealers who are
registered with the Commission but are not
members of the NASD; and (5) certification
of documents filed with the Commission. In
addition, by fee schedule, the Commission
imposes fees for certain filings and services
such as the filing of annual reports and

180

proxy material. With reference to the fee
schedule, on March 29, 1974, the Commission announced the repeal of certain provisions of Rule 203-3 under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940.One of the paragraphs
repealed, Rule 203-3(b), required registered investment advisers to pay a $100 annual fee to the Commission during the
period of their registration. The action was
taken following the Commission's consideration of recent decisions of the United
States Supreme Court with respect to the
Independent Offices Appropnation Act of
1952,31 U.S.C. 483(a), which had provided
the statutory basis for establishing these
fees. The Commission is presently reviewing all other fees imposed pursuant to the
same Act.
