SUMMARY
4.

This enforcement action arises from a fraudulent and unregistered

13

securities offering by Enviro Board Corporation (“Enviro Board”), its co-founders,

14

co-chairmen and co-chief executive officers Glenn Camp and William Peiffer, and

15

Joshua Mosshart, who solicited investors for the company. Enviro Board was formed

16

in 1997 and is the successor to a company that Camp founded in the early 1990s. The

17

company intended to profit from recycling agricultural waste fiber into low-cost,

18

environmentally-friendly building materials. Yet as of 2011, it had consistently

19

failed, for nearly 20 years, to successfully commercialize its technology. Despite

20

this, Defendants raised approximately $6 million from investors from 2011 to 2014

21

on the basis of financial projections that were false and misleading, and had no

22

reasonable basis in fact.

23

5.

These projections showed near-immediate, eight-figure profits – for

24

instance, in one set of projections, approximately $32.3 million in the company’s first

25

year of operation, $56.3 million at the close of year two, and $95.2 million by the end

26

of year three. Defendants’ projections, however, supposed several things. First, that

27

Enviro Board would successfully place ten (and later one, in subsequent projections)

28

commercially-viable mills in operation within six to 18 months – neither of which
COMPLAINT

2


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 3 of 24 Page ID #:3

1

was remotely likely. Second, that Enviro Board would be able to quickly earn money

2

by selling millions of dollars in federal tax credits through a complex transaction that

3

depended on third-party financing which the company could never realistically obtain

4

because, among other things, it had to be secured by Enviro Board mills that did not

5

even exist at the time. For these reasons, Enviro Board’s near-term projections of

6

millions of dollars in illusory operating profits were fraudulent, false and misleading.

7

6.

In addition to these fraudulent projections, Enviro Board’s offering

8

materials represented that the company had previously designed and installed a viable

9

production line, that its panels were available in two sizes, already in use in

10

residential and commercial construction projects and “mass produced,” and that the

11

company had secured $161 million in “vendor financing.” These statements were all

12

false. The company had never placed a commercially-viable production line in

13

operation. No customer had ever used Enviro Board’s building materials for any

14

construction project. And the purported “vendor financing” was actually to be

15

provided by a related-entity Peiffer had created and controlled, and which in any case

16

lacked the financial wherewithal to make such a large loan.

17

7.

Enviro Board has never generated any meaningful operating revenue.

18

Notwithstanding this, Defendants personally profited from their fraud. Of the

19

approximately $6 million raised by Enviro Board from 2011-2014, Camp, Peiffer and

20

Mosshart took as much as $2.6 million for themselves in purported compensation.

21

8.

As a result of the conduct alleged herein, Defendants Camp, Peiffer, and

22

Enviro Board have violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the

23

Exchange Act; Defendants Camp, Mosshart and Enviro Board have violated the

24

securities registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act; and Defendant

25

Mosshart has violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15 of the

26

Exchange Act.

27

9.

28

With this complaint, the SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief against

Defendants from violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal

2

penalties, and an officer and director bar against Defendants Camp and Peiffer.

THE DEFENDANTS
10.

4

Enviro Board is a Delaware corporation formed on March 27, 1997, and

5

is the successor of Enviro Board International, Inc., which Camp formed in 1992.

6

During the relevant period, Enviro Board maintained offices in Westlake Village and

7

Thousand Oaks, California. Since its inception, the company has been controlled by

8

Camp and Peiffer.
11.

9

Glenn B. Camp, 59, is the co-founder, co-chairman, and co-chief

10

executive officer of Enviro Board. He resides in Thousand Oaks, California. He has

11

never been registered with the SEC in any capacity.
12.

12

William J. Peiffer, 62, is the co-founder, co-chairman, co-chief executive

13

officer, and general counsel of Enviro Board. He resides in Haddonfield, New

14

Jersey. He has never been registered with the SEC in any capacity.
13.

15

Joshua D. Mosshart, 43, began to raise money for Enviro Board in May

16

2011, became the company’s titular president in or about January 2012, and resigned

17

from Enviro Board in April 2013. Mosshart resides in Malibu, California. He held

18

Series 7, 24, 63 and 66 licenses until January 2014, when he consented to a FINRA

19

regulatory action barring him from associating with any FINRA member in any

20

capacity. The FINRA regulatory action arose from his conduct in referring investors

21

to Enviro Board.

22
23

THE ALLEGATIONS
A.

Enviro Board’s Long-Standing Inability to Commercialize Its Technology

24

14.

Camp formed Enviro Board’s corporate predecessor in 1992.

25

15.

Enviro Board, as did its predecessor, planned to develop a technology

26

that would allow it to manufacture low-cost, environmentally-friendly building panels

27

out of straw and other agricultural waste fiber.

28

16.
COMPLAINT

Enviro Board called these building panels “E-Board.” The company
4


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 5 of 24 Page ID #:5

1

also planned to develop technology to manufacture a drywall substitute called “E-

2

Wall.”

3

17.

The plan was to design and construct large machines, called fiber

4

extrusion mills, which would manufacture E-Boards and later E-Wall using Enviro

5

Board’s technology.

6
7
8
9
10
11

18.

Although the effort began in 1992, Enviro Board has never designed and

constructed a mill capable of commercial manufacturing operations.
19.

Over the course of nearly 20 years of development work, Enviro Board

only constructed prototype mills, but none of those prototypes met the operational
specifications required for commercial production.
20.

Specifically, Enviro Board’s prototype mills suffered from serious “in-

12

service” problems – e.g., issues with paper tracking, glue adhesion, and panel density

13

– that required them to be shut down or slowed to make corrective adjustments. As a

14

result, the prototypes were incapable of maintaining a production rate of five feet per

15

minute, as required for commercial operations.

16

21.

By early 2011, development of Enviro Board’s mill had been suspended,

17

and its only existing prototype placed in storage, where some components were

18

exposed to the elements and rusted.

19
20
21

22.

Over the next year, Defendants failed to reverse this protracted history of

commercial failure.
23.

In March 2011, Camp signed an agreement with a third-party

22

manufacturing firm which called for the delivery of ten commercially-viable mills by

23

November 1, 2011.

24

24.

Enviro Board also hired a project manager to oversee its 2011 push to

25

commercialize.

26

25.

Camp, however, quickly learned that building ten commercially-viable

27

mills by November was not a realistic goal and, under the circumstances, neither he

28

nor Peiffer had a reasonable basis to believe that this goal could be achieved.
COMPLAINT

5


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 6 of 24 Page ID #:6

26.

1

In May 2011, Enviro Board amended the agreement to push back

2

delivery to December 31, 2011; shortly thereafter, Enviro Board decided to revise the

3

number of mills to be constructed from 10 to only two; and then in early June,

4

changed its plans once more to focus on building just one commercially-viable mill.
27.

5

Even that objective proved too much. Assembly work by the third-party

6

manufacturing firm did not begin until fall 2011. By year-end 2011, Enviro Board

7

had failed to design and construct a mill capable of commercial manufacturing

8

operations.

9

28.

Enviro Board fired its project manager on December 31, 2011.

10

29.

With the project manager’s departure, Enviro Board’s development work

11

slowed dramatically.
30.

12

Since then, Enviro Board’s mill technology has not advanced past the

13

prototype stage at any point in time, and no significant progress has been made to

14

commercialize the technology.
31.

15

During the relevant time, Enviro Board had never designed, constructed,

16

or operated a commercially-viable mill.

17

B.

20

The Enviro Board Offering
32.

From 2011 to 2014, Enviro Board, Camp and Mosshart offered and sold

investments to nearly 40 investors residing in several states.
33.

These investments took the form of common stock, secured or unsecured

21

bonds, and promissory notes that at times called for interest to be paid through the

22

issuance of Enviro Board stock and included the issuance of additional shares as a

23

bonus or incentive to invest.

24

34.

In all, Enviro Board raised approximately $6 million from investors

25

during 2011 to 2014 through its sale of about $3 million in common stock, $2 million

26

in bonds purportedly secured by Enviro Board’s claimed interest in state tax credits,

27

$1 million in unsecured bonds, and $50,000 in promissory notes.

28

35.
COMPLAINT

Camp and Mosshart directly solicited the majority of Enviro Board’s
6


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 7 of 24 Page ID #:7

1
2

investors via e-mail, by telephone, and through in-person meetings.
36.

Camp and Mosshart typically provided prospective investors with copies

3

of Enviro Board’s private placement memorandum, business plan, a subscription

4

agreement, an investor questionnaire, and/or other marketing materials, including

5

brochures, corporate updates, and PowerPoint presentations on Enviro Board’s

6

business.

7

37.

The stock, bond, and promissory note investments offered by Enviro

8

Board were securities. In fact, defendants’ private placement memorandum

9

repeatedly referred to these investments as securities, and stressed that they had not

10
11

been registered with the SEC.
38.

The investments in Enviro Board were investments of money. Investors

12

purchased bonds and promissory notes by providing money that was deposited into

13

the company’s bank account over which Peiffer was sole signatory.

14

39.

The investments in Enviro Board were also investments in a common

15

enterprise. Investor money was pooled for the purpose of funding Enviro Board’s

16

mill development project and operations. Returns of investors’ investments were

17

dependent on Enviro Board’s ability to profitably commercialize its technology.

18

Finally, investors were dependent on the efforts of Camp and Peiffer, who controlled

19

Enviro Board.

20

40.

Further, the bonds and promissory notes offered by Enviro Board

21

typically provided that investors would receive cash interest payments in the range of

22

10-12% annually, which far exceeded rates of return available on investments in CDs

23

or money market accounts. Those bonds and promissory notes were also marketed

24

and sold by Enviro Board, Camp, and Mosshart to approximately 20 accredited and

25

unaccredited investors who would benefit from the protections provided by the

26

federal securities laws. There is no alternative regulatory scheme that would render

27

the application of the federal securities laws to the Enviro Board offering

28

unnecessary.
COMPLAINT

7


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 8 of 24 Page ID #:8

41.

1

A reasonable investor would consider the company’s bonds and

2

promissory notes to be securities since Enviro Board’s PPMs repeatedly referred to

3

those instruments as an “investment.”

4

C.

5

Defendants’ Misrepresentations and Omissions to Investors
42.

When soliciting investors in Enviro Board, Defendants Enviro Board,

6

Camp, and Peiffer made materially false and misleading statements and omissions

7

concerning the company’s financial projections and about the true status of its

8

commercialization efforts.

9

43.

Camp and Peiffer drafted, reviewed, and/or approved the use of the

10

Enviro Board private placement memoranda (“PPMs”), business plans, and other

11

marketing materials that were provided to prospective investors from 2011 to 2014.

12

44.

Camp and Peiffer each had ultimate authority over the statements

13

contained in those offering materials, including their content and whether or how to

14

communicate them to potential investors.

15
16

1.

False and misleading revenue projections

45.

The PPMs and/or business plans distributed by Defendants to potential

17

investors typically contained three years of projected financial information, including

18

an income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

19

46.

Peiffer prepared the Enviro Board financial projections.

20

47.

Camp reviewed and approved the Enviro Board financial projections.

21

48.

Defendants distributed several versions of the Enviro Board financial

22
23

projections to potential investors.
49.

Although Enviro Board had no history of operating revenues or profits,

24

each version of the company’s financial projections forecasted immediate, eight-

25

figure revenues that would occur in the company’s very first year of operation.

26

50.

Defendants distributed PPMs and business plans to investors containing

27

financial projections whose figures differed, depending on when these materials were

28

distributed. They sent one set of financial projections to investors from about
COMPLAINT

8


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 9 of 24 Page ID #:9

1

February 2011 to January 2012; they sent another set from about June 2012 to

2

September 2013; and they circulated a third set of financial projections from about

3

October 2013 and thereafter. The differences in the PPMs’ and business plan’s

4

financial projections were not significant, from the standpoint of a reasonable

5

investor, because in spite of those differences, they all forecasted immediate, eight-

6

figure revenues occurring in the company’s first year of operation.

7

51.

The PPMs and business plans distributed to investors by Defendants

8

from about February 2011 to January 2012 contained financial projections for Enviro

9

Board that forecasted approximately $42.8 million in revenue and $30.8 million in

10

net income during the company’s first year of operation. The PPMs and business

11

plans further projected approximately $31 million, $18 million, and $44 million in

12

earnings during the company’s first, second, and third years of operation,

13

respectively.

14

52.

The PPMs and business plans distributed to investors by Defendants

15

from about June 2012 to September 2013 contained financial projections that

16

forecasted approximately $58.8 million in revenue and $32.3 million in net income

17

during the company’s first year of operation. The PPMs and business plans further

18

projected approximately $32 million, $50 million, and $94 million in earnings during

19

the company’s first, second, and third years of operation, respectively.

20

53.

The PPMs and business plans distributed to investors by Defendants in

21

October 2013 and thereafter contained financial projections that forecasted

22

approximately $56.3 million in revenue and $15.5 million in net income during the

23

company’s first year of operation. The PPMs and business plans further projected

24

approximately $18 million, $28 million, and $49 million in earnings during the

25

company’s first, second, and third years of operation, respectively.

26

54.

Enviro Board’s projected revenues were derived from three sources: (a)

27

the sale of certain tax credits that Peiffer and Camp claimed Enviro Board would be

28

qualified to receive once it successfully commercialized its technology; (b) the sale of
COMPLAINT

9


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 10 of 24 Page ID #:10

1

E-Board and E-Wall products; and (c) the sale of mills and associated royalty

2

payments.

3

55.

Enviro Board’s projected revenues were based on two key assumptions:

4

the company could actually make and sell commercially-viable products by

5

developing a mill capable of commercial production, and the company could actually

6

obtain and then sell huge tax credits.

7
8

a.
56.

The unreasonable assumption regarding sales

The first assumption – described in the PPMs as management’s

9

“reasonable” assumption – was that the company would be able to place mills in

10

commercial production in a short amount of time and would then be able to sell

11

commercially-viable E-Boards and E-Walls. For example, in the offering materials

12

given to investors in mid-2011, the projections assumed that ten mills would be in

13

place and operating in less than a year-and-a-half; in subsequent offering materials in

14

the fall of 2013, the projections assumed that one E-Board mill would be in

15

production within six months.

16

57.

In the financial projections distributed to investors from about February

17

2011 to January 2012, approximately $15 million in revenue was projected to come

18

from the sale of E-Board and E-Wall products in Enviro Board’s first year of

19

operation.

20

58.

In the financial projections distributed to investors from about June 2012

21

to September 2013, approximately $12.5 million in revenue was projected to come

22

from the sale of E-Board and E-Wall products, and $30 million from the sale of mills,

23

all in the first year of operation.

24

59.

In the financial projections distributed to investors from October 2013

25

and after, approximately $26 million in revenue was projected to come from the sale

26

of E-Board products and $15 million in royalties from licensing its mill technology,

27

all in the first year of operation.

28

60.
COMPLAINT

Unless Enviro Board took the initial step of commercializing its
10 


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 11 of 24 Page ID #:11

1

technology and placing mills in production, it was impossible for Enviro Board to

2

meet any of these eight-figure revenue forecasts from the sale of E-Board and E-Wall

3

products, or from the sale or licensing of entire mills.

4

61.

At the time the Defendants provided these financial projections to

5

potential investors, however, Enviro Board, Camp and Peiffer knew, or were at least

6

reckless in not knowing, that the company had been attempting to commercialize its

7

technology without success for nearly twenty years, and that as things then stood, its

8

prototype mill suffered from serious deficiencies that had yet to be resolved.

9

62.

Even in 2011, it was apparent no later than that spring that building ten

10

mills in the near term was not a realistic goal. Most significantly, the company’s

11

December 31, 2011 termination of the project manager overseeing the development

12

effort rendered the defendants’ goal of ten mills – or even one commercially-viable

13

mill – exceedingly remote, if not an impossibility.

14

63.

By 2013, the prospect of successfully commercializing the company’s

15

technology and placing one mill in service by the second quarter of 2014 – which is

16

what the projections were assuming at that point – was equally unrealistic.

17
18

b.
64.

The unreasonable assumption regarding tax credits

The second assumption was that Enviro Board would be able to

19

complete a complicated tax transaction that would make it eligible to receive the tax

20

credits that the company planned to sell.

21

65.

In the financial projections distributed to investors from about February

22

2011 to January 2012, approximately $22.8 million was forecasted from the sale of

23

federal New Market Tax Credits, in its first year of operation.

24

66.

In the financial projections distributed to investors from about June 2012

25

to September 2013, approximately $11.4 million was forecasted from the sale of

26

federal New Market Tax Credits, in its first year of operation.

27
28

67.

In financial projections distributed to investors in October 2013 and

thereafter, approximately $12.5 million was forecasted from the sale of federal New

3

Market Tax Credits, in its first year of operation.
68.

A PPM described these federal New Market Tax Credits, or “NMTCs,”

as follows:

4

NMTCs are intended by the Federal Government to spur Qualified

5

Low Income Community Investments and jobs. The investor is

6

permitted to take a credit against Federal Income Taxes in the

7

amount of 39% of the qualified investment.

8

69.

Enviro Board, Camp and Peiffer claimed that once Enviro Board made

9

plans to acquire land and construct a manufacturing plant that would run its mills in

10

an economically-disadvantaged area, that “qualified investment” under the federal

11

NMTC program would be entitled to certain tax credits, which the company could

12

then sell to banks through syndicators. Specifically, the PPMs stated that “[t]here are

13

significant Federal and State Tax credits available to the Company relating to certain

14

investments, including environmental investments.”

15

70.

With respect to their progress in effectuating those transactions, the

16

PPMs and/or business plans at times claimed that the company qualified for the

17

federal tax program, and had “engaged legal counsel, an accounting firm, and a tax

18

syndicator to process and sell $55 million of such tax credits beginning in 2012.”

19

71.

However, to meet its projections of $11.4 million, $12.5 million, or

20

$22.8 million in revenue from the sale of federal NMTCs in year one, Enviro Board

21

needed a “qualified investment” in the range of $100 million. It did not.

22

72.

For example, financial projections in PPMs and/or business plans

23

distributed to investors from February 2011 to at least January 2012 forecasted $45.7

24

million in federal NMTCs in the first quarter of year one, with the company realizing

25

$22.87 million in revenue net of selling costs and discounts. Because under the

26

federal NMTC program, qualified investments are entitled to a 39% tax credit, the

27

forecasted $45.7 million credit required a $117.2 million qualified investment (.39 x

28

$117.2 million = $45.7 million).

73.

To be a qualified investment, Enviro Board’s proposed plant and mill

equipment had to be located and operated in an economically-disadvantaged region.
74.

Under the Defendants’ plan, the more than $100 million qualified

4

investment in their business would have to be primarily financed by third-party

5

capital loans.

6

75.

However, in order to obtain capital financing of more than $100 million,

7

Enviro Board had to provide collateral in the form of the plant and equipment. And

8

that collateral would not be acceptable to any potential lender without an independent

9

valuation or bona fide sales contract establishing the economic viability of Enviro

10
11

Board’s proposed mill operation.
76.

At no time when the Defendants were providing investors with their

12

financial projects did Enviro Board have anywhere near sufficient collateral to secure

13

such a large financing. Nor did they have the needed independent valuation of that

14

collateral or bona fide sales contract.

15

77.

As of June 2011, Defendants Enviro Board, Camp, and Peiffer no longer

16

had any reasonable expectation of being able to place ten commercially-viable mills

17

in service by the end of 2011, and thereafter, Enviro Board’s development work

18

slowed dramatically.

19

78.

Without a working mill, Enviro Board did not have sufficient collateral,

20

and could not obtain the independent valuation or enter into a bona fide sales contract

21

required to secure third-party financing, either. Without financing, Enviro Board

22

could not establish a “qualified investment” under the federal NMTC program. And

23

without a “qualified investment,” there was no possibility of Enviro Board meeting

24

its projections of $11.4 million, $12.5 million, or $22.8 million in revenue from the

25

sale of federal NMTCs in year one.

26

79.

Peiffer was further advised by a third-party tax credit consultant that the

27

company’s alternative plan – Enviro Board would instead place the value of ten mills

28

at more than $100 million through a related-party transaction with an affiliated entity

2

at a marked-up price – would never work to secure the necessary capital financing.
80.

In dealing with Enviro Board and Peiffer, that third-party tax credit

3

consultant was never able to understand the company’s plan for financing, and

4

ultimately concluded that Enviro Board’s business “was all vapor.”

5
6

c.
81.

False and misleading, and no reasonable basis

As a result, the financial projections provided investors were false and

7

misleading, and Defendants Enviro Board, Peiffer and Camp had no reasonable basis

8

to believe in the accuracy of those projections.

9

82.

Defendants Enviro Board, Peiffer, and Camp had no reasonable basis to

10

believe in the accuracy of their two assumptions about the projected sale of

11

commercially-viable products or about the tax credits. Instead, they were aware of

12

facts never disclosed to investors that tended to seriously undermine the accuracy of

13

the company’s financial projections.

14

83.

Specifically, Defendants Enviro Board, Camp and Peiffer failed to

15

disclose to potential investors facts relevant to the company’s inquiry into or

16

knowledge concerning its financial projections, which investors needed to know in

17

order to evaluate the Enviro Board financial projections in context, including that: (a)

18

throughout its history of operations, the company had only managed to design

19

prototype E-Board mills, all of which suffered from serious in-service issues that

20

made their use in commercial operations unworkable; (b) the basic assumption on

21

which Enviro Board’s financial projections were all based – that the company would

22

be able to place ten commercially-viable E-Board mills in service in the near term –

23

would not occur given the failure of Enviro Board’s commercialization efforts at the

24

end of 2011; and (c) Enviro Board had engaged in only preliminary, unproductive

25

discussions with a third-party tax credit consultant about its plan to achieve eight-

26

figure revenues from the sale of federal NMTCs.

27
28

84.

A reasonable investor in the offerings would have considered it

important in making their investment to know, among other things, the foregoing

undisclosed facts.
2.	

3
4

False and misleading statements concerning the status of Enviro
Board’s commercialization efforts

85.

The Enviro Board offering materials sent to investors also contained

5

further false and misleading statements about the state of its commercialization

6

efforts.

7

86.

Defendants’ offering materials falsely claimed that the company had

8

“successfully designed and installed its first production line,” and that it had

9

“developed” a green manufacturing process. In truth, its prototype mills were wholly

10
11

incapable of commercial operations.
87.

Defendants’ offering materials falsely claimed that it had previously

12

designed and installed a production line, when in fact the company had only

13

developed prototypes with serious “in-service” issues which precluded their

14

commercial use.

15

88.

Defendants’ offering materials falsely claimed that its E-Board panels

16

“are used” in construction, panels “are available” in two sizes (namely, E-Board and

17

E-Wall panels), “are mass produced,” and were in every way superior to traditional

18

construction materials. None of these assertions was true. Moreover, Defendants

19

failed to disclose that the company had never fabricated a mill capable of

20

manufacturing E-Wall, or that the manufacturing process for E-Wall was completely

21

different than the one used to produce E-Board panels.

22

89.

Defendants’ offering materials falsely claimed that it had a track record

23

of using its panels to “build residentially and commercially,” and featured a model

24

home and warehouse that were purportedly built using E-Board or from “straw

25

panels.” To the contrary, Defendants failed to disclose that the model home and

26

warehouse were in fact constructed with similar materials purchased from another

27

manufacturer.

28

90.	

Defendants’ offering materials falsely claimed that the company had

COMPLAINT 	

15 


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 16 of 24 Page ID #:16

1

plans to “expand production”; yet, the company failed to disclose that commercial

2

production had not even begun, given the commercial unsuitability of its existing

3

prototype mills.

4

91.

Defendants at times disseminated a 2007 History Channel video clip that

5

showed Enviro Board’s mill in operation, claimed the mill could manufacture 600

6

panels a day, and asserted that Enviro Board had “perfected” the technology. All of

7

these representations were false.

8

3.	

9
10
11
12

False and misleading statements concerning Enviro Board’s access to
financing

92.

Defendants’ offering materials falsely claimed to have secured $161

million in “vendor financing” with off-balance sheet partnerships.
93.

Investors, however, were never told by Defendants that the “vendor”

13

was a related-party that Peiffer had created and controlled which in any event lacked

14

the financial ability to loan any significant amount of funds to Enviro Board.

15

4.	

16
17

False and misleading statements concerning Enviro Board’s secured
bonds

94.

Enviro Board issued bonds in 2011 to 2014 which Defendants falsely

18

claimed to be secured by a state tax credit issued by the Oregon Department of

19

Energy.

20
21
22

95.

No such tax credit had been issued, as Enviro Board had only received a

preliminary certificate.
96.

Defendant Enviro Board, Camp, and Peiffer’s statements concerning the

23

status of Enviro Board’s commercialization effort, the efficacy and marketability of

24

its technology, its access to available financing, and whether certain state tax credits

25

had in fact been issued were materially false and misleading. A reasonable investor

26

in the offerings would have considered it important in making their investment to

27

know, among other things, that the company had never constructed a working mill

28

capable of meeting the production specifications required for commercial

1

deployment, that the building materials created by Enviro Board’s technology had

2

never been widely distributed and used in the construction of residential and

3

commercial buildings or used to construct its model home and warehouse, that Enviro

4

Board’s claimed $161 million in available capital was illusory, and that state tax

5

credits that the company offered as security for its bonds had not been given final

6

approval.

7

D.	

97.

8
9

98.

At all relevant times, Camp and Peiffer were negligent in making the

foregoing false and misleading statements.
99.

12
13

At all relevant times, Camp and Peiffer knew, or were reckless in not

knowing, that the foregoing statements were false and misleading when made.

10
11

Defendants’ Roles in the Fraud

As the co-founders, co-chairmen, and co-chief executive officers of

Enviro board, Camp and Peiffer’s states of mind are imputed to Enviro Board.
100. Camp and Peiffer each had intimate knowledge and familiarity with

14
15

Enviro Board’s operations and the state of its technology through the relevant period.

16

Both Camp and Peiffer knew of manufacturing problems that persisted for years,

17

which needed to be corrected before Enviro Board would be able to place a

18

commercially-viable mill in service. Both Camp and Peiffer knew, were reckless in

19

not knowing, or acted negligently when failing to disclose, that without a mill in

20

commercial production, Enviro Board’s financial projections had no reasonable basis

21

and were therefore false and misleading, and that the various statements in the

22

company’s offering materials touting the commercial progress made by Enviro Board

23

and the extent to which its products were already in use were false and misleading.

24

E.	

Enviro Board Spends Almost Half of Investor Proceeds on Executive

25

Compensation and Commissions

26

101. Despite raising approximately $6 million from investors between 2011

27

and 2014, capital flow was a recurring issue for the company, which failed to make

28

required payments to employees, outside vendors crucial to its commercialization
COMPLAINT 	

17 


Case 2:16-cv-06427 Document 1 Filed 08/26/16 Page 18 of 24 Page ID #:18

1

efforts, and the company’s bond and note holders.
102. Instead, Camp, Peiffer and Mosshart received about $2.6 million in

2
3

compensation and commission payments in 2011 and 2012 alone.
103. In 2011 and 2012, Camp received as much as $1.125 million in

4
5

compensation, paid from investor proceeds.
104. In 2011 and 2012, Peiffer received as much as $940,000 in

6
7

compensation, paid from investor proceeds.
105. In 2011 and 2012, Mosshart received approximately $540,000 in

8
9

commissions and salary, paid from investor proceeds.

10

106. Because Enviro Board used a large share of all investor proceeds raised

11

from 2011 to 2014 to enrich the individual defendants, the company’s difficulties in

12

commercializing its technology were exacerbated. The company operated in a near-

13

continual cash crunch in that time period. For example, at various points in its

14

development effort, Enviro Board failed to make required payments to the third-party

15

manufacturing firm it had retained to construct the necessary mills, and in May 2012,

16

the firm suspended work on the project for almost four months.

17

F.	

Defendants’ Offer and Sale of Securities Without Registration or

18

Exemption

19

107. Defendants did not register with the SEC any of the transactions or

20

securities Enviro Board, Camp and Mosshart offered or sold for the company.

21

108. Defendants Enviro Board, Camp and Mosshart engaged in the offer and

22

sale of investments without Enviro Board registering those transactions or securities

23

with the SEC, and the offers and sales were not exempt from registration.

24

109. Camp and Mosshart personally solicited most of Enviro Board’s

25

investors, spoke with offerees via telephone, met them in person, and sent them

26

offering materials and other information by e-mail.

27
28

110. By directly soliciting investors who purchased securities offered by
Enviro Board, Defendants Enviro Board, Camp and Mosshart were necessary

1

participants and each played a substantial factor in the offer and sale of Enviro Board

2

securities.

3

G.

Mosshart’s Illegal Broker-Dealer Activities

4

111. Mosshart was hired to raise capital for Enviro Board.

5

112. Beginning in May 2011, Mosshart referred at least 18 individuals to

6

Enviro Board, who then purchased nearly $5 million of the company’s securities.

7

113. Mosshart solicited Enviro Board investors, provided those investors with

8

Enviro Board’s offering materials, and/or participated in taking investors’ orders,

9

thereby inducing the purchase or sale of securities.

10
11
12
13

114. Mosshart was paid transaction-based compensation in the form of
commissions on sales of Enviro Board securities.
115. Accordingly, Mosshart regularly participated in Enviro Board’s offer
and sale of securities at key points in the chain of distribution.

14

116. Although Mosshart was associated with LPL Financial LLC (“LPL”), a

15

registered broker-dealer, in the relevant period, he was not acting within the scope of

16

his employment with LPL because the firm was unaware and did not approve of

17

Mosshart’s conduct, and was not supervising him for purposes of his sale of Enviro

18

Board’s securities.

19

117. Indeed, Mosshart was ultimately barred by FINRA from association with

20

any FINRA member in any capacity, for his conduct in raising capital for Enviro

21

Board.
