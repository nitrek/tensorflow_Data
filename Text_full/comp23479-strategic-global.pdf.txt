SUMMARY
1.

In February 2014, Strategic Global Investments, Inc. (“Strategic”) and

21

Andrew T. Fellner, its CEO, made material false and misleading statements in

22

various press releases, which they disseminated publicly on www.otcmarkets.com.

23

2.

Following Colorado’s January 2014 legalization of the sale of

24

recreational marijuana, Strategic and Fellner, in several press releases, falsely

25

portrayed Strategic as owning a revenue-generating marijuana cultivation facility in

26

Teller County, Colorado. Strategic was, at the time, involved in industries wholly-

27

unrelated to marijuana.

COMPLAINT

Case 3:16-cv-00514-H-JLB Document 1 Filed 02/29/16 Page 2 of 13

1

3.

In reality, at no time did Strategic have the ability to operate in the

2

marijuana business space or legally generate revenue from the sale of marijuana

3

generated from its purported cultivation facility in Teller County, Colorado. In fact,

4

Strategic lacked the requisite licensure, funding, and other corporate infrastructure

5

needed to run a successful marijuana-related business.

6

4.

Strategic and Fellner also made material misrepresentations and

7

omissions in connection with a January 2014 securities offering by failing to

8

disclose in Strategic’s Form 1-A offering documents filed with the Commission

9

that: (a) Strategic had used investor proceeds to enter the marijuana business; and

10
11

(b) Strategic had later decided to exit that business.
5.

Strategic and Fellner knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the

12

information in the press releases and offering documents Strategic disseminated

13

contained false and misleading statements relating to Strategic’s purported

14

marijuana business and use of investor proceeds.

15

6.

By knowingly or recklessly engaging in the conduct described in this

16

complaint, Defendants Strategic and Fellner violated, and unless enjoined will

17

continue to violate, Section 10(b) and Rule 10-5(b) of the Securities Exchange Act

18

of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, and

19

Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. §

20

77q(a)(2). Defendant Fellner also aided and abetted Strategic’s violations of

21

Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) of the Exchange Act and Section 17(a)(2) of the

22

Securities Act. Unless restrained and enjoined, Defendants are reasonably likely to

23

continue to violate the federal securities laws.

24

7.

The Commission therefore respectfully requests the Court enter an order:

25

(i) permanently restraining and enjoining Defendants from violating the federal

26

securities laws; (ii) directing Defendants to pay civil money penalties; (iii) imposing

27

a penny stock bar against Fellner; and (iv) imposing an officer and director bar

28

against Fellner.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
8.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b),

3

20(d)(1) and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(1) & 77v(a),

4

and Sections 21(d)(1), 21(d)(3)(A), 21(e) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.

5

§§ 78u(d)(1), 78u(d)(3)(A), 78u(e) & 78aa(a).

6

9.

Strategic and Fellner have, directly or indirectly, made use of the means

7

or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a

8

national securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices and

9

courses of business alleged in this complaint.

10

10. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities

11

Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a), and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §

12

78aa(a), because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of conduct

13

constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred within this District. In

14

addition, venue is proper in this District because both Strategic’s principal place of

15

business and Fellner’s residence are in located this District.

16

THE DEFENDANTS

17

11. Strategic, formed in 2008, is a Delaware corporation based in San

18

Diego, California. Strategic’s common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink

19

marketplace (symbol STBV).

20

12. Strategic’s stock is a “penny stock” as defined by the Exchange Act. At

21

all times relevant to this action, the stock’s shares traded at less than one dollar per

22

share. During the same time period, Strategic’s stock did not meet any of the

23

exceptions to penny stock classification pursuant to Exchange Act Section 3(a)(51),

24

15 U.S.C. § 78(c)(a)(51), and Rule 3a51-1, 17 C.F.R. § 240.3a51-1. For example

25

the Company’s stock: (a) did not trade on a national securities exchange; (b) was

26

not an “NMS stock,” as defined in 17 C.F.R. § 242.600(b)(47); (c) did not have

27

tangible assets (i.e., total assets less intangible assets and liabilities) in excess of

28

$5,000,000; and (d) did not have average revenue of approximately $6,000,000 for

the last three years. See Exchange Act, Rule 3a51-1(g).

2

13. Fellner is a resident of Carlsbad, California and is the CEO, secretary,

3

treasurer, and sole director of Strategic. Fellner acquired a controlling interest in

4

Strategic in 2010. In July 1982, Fellner pleaded guilty to conspiracy and federal

5

mail fraud for his role in a multi-million dollar real estate and forgery fraud scheme.

He served approximately three years in prison.

THE ALLEGATIONS
A.

Defendants’ Misrepresentations and Omissions
1.

False Statements in Strategic’s Press Releases

14. On April 4, 2013, Strategic, which previously purported to be operating

11

a video production business, issued a press release announcing its first foray into the

12

marijuana business. Among other things, this release stated that “GrowLife, Inc., a

13

provider of highly effective indoor growing technologies and unique lifestyle

14

brands…has signed a Letter of Intent with [Strategic] to build a comprehensive,

15

multichannel media network for the marijuana industry.”

16

15. Strategic made no further statements about its purported involvement in

17

the marijuana industry until February 10, 2014, when Strategic issued a press

18

release, which announced that the Company had “entered into meaningful

19

negotiations for the purchase of a Marijuana Growing facility located in Teller

20

County, Colorado.” Strategic further stated that it expected “to yield a harvest and

21

generate revenue from the sale of [marijuana] plants by the 3rd Quarter of [2014]”

22

and that it planned to have “the first new crop started in the first week of March.”

23

Fellner is quoted in the press release stating that “the demand in this newly

24

legalized industry is sure to bring in significant revenue going into the third and

25

fourth quarter of 2014.”

26

16. On February 20, 2014, Strategic issued a press release announcing that it

27

had “signed an agreement for the purchase of Bearpot, Inc., controlling entity of an

28

existing Marijuana Growing facility located in Teller County, Colorado.” In that
COMPLAINT

4

Case 3:16-cv-00514-H-JLB Document 1 Filed 02/29/16 Page 5 of 13

1

same press release, Strategic further claimed that it had “evaluated the industry and

2

[expected] to be able to yield a harvest and generate revenues from the sale of plants

3

by the 4th Quarter of this year.”

4

17. Fellner reiterated this projection in a February 24, 2014 letter to

5

shareholders, which Strategic included in a press release. The release quotes

6

Fellner as stating that Strategic now owned a “marijuana cultivation facility.” In

7

that same press release, Fellner acknowledged the increase in trading activity of

8

Strategic’s stock over the past weeks and attributed it to the marijuana cultivation

9

facility.

10

18. Four days later in an “executive interview” published in a February 28,

11

2014 press release, Fellner explained that “the largest amount of growth that we will

12

see in the next 3-6 months for [Strategic] surely will be in the growing and

13

distributing of medical and recreational marijuana.”

14

19. On March 27, 2014, Strategic issued a press release listing Strategic’s

15

accomplishments relating to the purported marijuana cultivation facility. This list

16

included completion of all electrical and structural upgrades to the Bearpot facility.

17
18
19

20. These statements regarding Strategic’s purported foray into the
marijuana business were false and misleading.
21. First, the Defendants falsely mischaracterized to investors its purchase of

20

Bearpot’s assets as the acquisition of “an existing” marijuana cultivation facility in

21

Teller County, Colorado. In fact, Bearpot had no such facility – the purported

22

cultivation facility was a two-story house Bearpot rented in a residential area of

23

Teller County.

24

22. Second, Defendants failed to disclose that the law did not permit Bearpot

25

to have a facility in that location: (1) Teller County Ordinance #18, effective as of

26

March 2013, prohibited the licensing and operation of, among other things,

27

marijuana cultivation facilities, (2) under various Colorado state laws, commercial

28

medical marijuana cultivation required a license, which Bearpot, Strategic, and their
COMPLAINT

5

Case 3:16-cv-00514-H-JLB Document 1 Filed 02/29/16 Page 6 of 13

1

officers have never had, and (3) Teller County zoning regulations did not permit

2

commercial marijuana grow houses in the residential area where Bearpot’s

3

purported facility was located.

4

23. Third, the fact that neither Bearpot nor Strategic had or legally could

5

have a functioning marijuana cultivation facility rendered baseless Strategic’s

6

revenue and growth projections.

7

24. At the time of the press releases, Fellner was the CEO, secretary,

8

treasurer, and sole director of Strategic. He had the ultimate authority over the

9

press releases’ content and formulation. He also had authority over whether or not

10
11

to issue the press releases.
25. In his position as CEO, secretary, treasurer, and sole director of

12

Strategic, Fellner knew or should have known the legal and licensing requirements

13

of the marijuana business in Colorado. Further, Fellner knew or should have known

14

that Bearpot did not have a facility that was properly located, licensed, or equipped

15

to legally cultivate marijuana.

16

2.

Misleading Information in Strategic’s Form 1-A Filing

17

26. Strategic raised operating capital via offerings pursuant to Regulation A

18

of the Securities Act. Between March 2013 and September 2015, the Commission

19

qualified five of Strategic’s Regulation A offerings.

20

27. Rule 253(e) of Regulation A, 17 C.F.R. § 230.253(e), required Strategic

21

to revise its January 2014 Regulation A offering documents during the 12 months

22

succeeding the date of qualification whenever the information in the corresponding

23

Forms 1-A became false or misleading, material developments occurred, or there

24

was a fundamental change to the information initially presented. A Form 1-A

25

essentially acts as a registration statement used during an offering under Regulation

26

A of the Securities Act. The Form 1-A informs investors about the offering

27

company including what type of business it conducts and transacts.

28
COMPLAINT

6

Case 3:16-cv-00514-H-JLB Document 1 Filed 02/29/16 Page 7 of 13

1

28. Beginning in January 2014, Strategic offered its securities to investors

2

and prospective investors via an offering under Regulation A, which ultimately

3

raised $3.4 million, and concurrently disseminated false and misleading information

4

about its business venture and use of investor proceeds in its corresponding Form 1-

5

A during the offering.

6

29. The Commission qualified Strategic’s Regulation A offering on January

7

17, 2014. The corresponding Form 1-A, which Fellner signed in his capacity as

8

CEO, described Strategic as being in the video business and contained no reference

9

to the marijuana business.

10

30. The Form 1-A further stated that the proceeds from the offering would

11

be used “primarily to increase the marketing efforts of the company and to install

12

more equipment for its live [streaming] based business and for other general

13

corporate purposes.”

14
15
16

31. Strategic sold approximately $2.1 million worth of stock pursuant to the
exemption set forth in Regulation A in the first three months of 2014.
32. In February 2014, Strategic did not file an amendment to its Form 1-A.

17

Such an amendment was required by Rule 253(e) because, while the offering was

18

ongoing, the company used $50,000 of investor proceeds to acquire Bearpot. While

19

Bearpot did not have the revenue, licensure, or other necessary requirements to

20

actually legally grow commercial marijuana, its purchase still indicated a switch in

21

Strategic’s business plan. Thus, the failure to file an amendment to the Form 1-A

22

rendered its statements about Strategic’s business and its use of proceeds false and

23

misleading.

24

33. In April 2014, Strategic decided to exit the marijuana business.

25

However, Strategic never updated its Form 1-A to reflect its plan to exit the

26

marijuana business. Strategic did subsequently file a Form 1-A and amendments

27

for a new Regulation A offering in April 2014, in which it did disclose its entrance

28

into and plan to exit the marijuana business, into which it had placed investor
COMPLAINT

7

Case 3:16-cv-00514-H-JLB Document 1 Filed 02/29/16 Page 8 of 13

1

proceeds. However, this did not relieve Strategic of its obligation under Rule

2

253(e) to update the prior Form 1-A for a different offering. In short, the filing of a

3

new Regulation A offering form did not correct the previously filed, false and

4

misleading Form 1-A.
34. Investors depend on true, correct, and complete Form 1-A disclosures to

5
6

understand how their funds are being used by companies. Reasonable investors

7

would have wanted to have timely known that (a) funds they thought were being

8

used for video production were being used in a marijuana business instead, and (b)

9

Strategic decided to exit the marijuana business shortly after entering it.

10

B.

The Market Impact of Strategic’s Misstatements

11

35. Concurrent with its issuance of the press releases and its failure to

12

amend the original Form 1-A, Strategic stock’s average daily trading volume

13

increased significantly: from about 5.13 million shares between April 1, 2013 and

14

February 7, 2014 to 849 million shares between February 10, 2014 and March 27,

15

2014.

16

36. Strategic’s closing share prices also increased: from $0.0032 on

17

February 7, 2014 to $0.055 on February 10, 2014 (an increase of over 1,600%),

18

when Strategic announced its entrance into the marijuana industry, with a trading

19

volume that day of 470 million shares. Trading reached a peak volume of

20

approximately 2.13 billion shares on March 24, 2014 before the price dropped to

21

$0.0001 on April 16, 2014.
