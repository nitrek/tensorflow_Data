In the Matter of

ORDER APPROVING
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

On December 12, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”)
issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”) against GLG Partners, Inc. and GLG Partners, L.P. (collectively, “Respondents”).1
The Order found, among other things, that Respondents failed to design and maintain
adequate internal controls related to the valuation of fund assets, on the basis of which fee
revenues were calculated and recorded. As a result of GLG Partners, L.P.’s deficient
valuation policies and procedures, the monthly valuation for a particular asset in its fund was
overstated by approximately $160 million during the period from November 1, 2008 through
November 30, 2010. This led to inflated or excess management and administration fees
remitted to Respondents totaling approximately $7,766,667. The Order required Respondents
to pay disgorgement of $7,766,667 and prejudgment interest of $437,679. Each Respondent
also was ordered to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $375,000. In accordance with
the Order, Respondents paid a total of $8,954,346 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and
civil monetary penalties to the Commission.
The Order created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, as amended, for the funds paid by the Respondents (the “Fair Fund”). The Fair Fund
is subject to the continuing jurisdiction and control of the Commission and the Fair Fund has
been deposited at the United States Department of Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service
(“BFS”) for investment. Other than potential interest income from the BFS investment, the
Commission does not anticipate that the Fair Fund will receive additional funds.

Exchange Act Release No. 71050 (Dec. 12, 2013).

On September 19, 2014, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment2 (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.3 The Notice advised interested
parties that they could obtain a copy of the proposed Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) from the
Commission’s public website at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/fairfundlist.htm#glg or by
submitting a written request to Nancy Chase Burton, Esq., United States Securities and
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-5631.
The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Plan could submit
their comments, in writing, no later than thirty (30) days from the publication of the Notice (1)
to the Office of the Secretary, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F
Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090; (2) by using the Commission’s Internet comment
form (http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin.shtml); or (3) by sending an e-mail to rulecomments@sec.gov. The Commission received no comments on the Plan.
The Fair Fund is comprised of the amounts of disgorgement ($7,766,667),
prejudgment interest ($437,679), and civil money penalties ($750,000) paid by the
Respondents to the Commission. As set forth in the Plan, the proposed methodology allocates
the Fair Fund by dividing a harmed investor’s present values of incorrectly collected fees by
the aggregate amount of all harmed investors’ present value of such fees multiplied by the
total amount of the present value of all incorrectly collected fees.
The Division of Enforcement now requests that the Commission approve the Plan.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s
Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans,4 that the Plan is approved.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
