Policy 1.02

Section 1: About the Organization

Policy: 1.02 Mission and Vision
Statements of Xavier University
and the Office of Human Resources

Xavier is an educational community dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, to the
orderly discussion of issues confronting society; and, as would befit an American
institution grounded in the humanities and sciences, Xavier is committed
unreservedly to open and free inquiry.
Xavier, while primarily an undergraduate institution emphasizing the liberal arts,
is also committed to providing graduate and professional education in areas of its
demonstrated competence and where it meets a particular need of society,
especially of Xavier’s regional constituency. Faculty members, moreover, are
strongly encouraged to engage in research outside the classroom in order to
maintain the professional standing of the institution.
With attention to the student as an individual, Jesuit education seeks to develop:
1. Intellectual skills for both a full life in the human community and service in the
Kingdom of God;
2. Critical attention to the underlying philosophical and theological implications of
the issues;
3. A world view that is oriented to responsible action and recognizes the intrinsic
value of the natural and human values;
4. An understanding and communication of the moral and religious values
through personal concern and lived witness, as well as by precept of instruction;
and
5. A sense of the whole person- body, mind, and spirit.
In keeping with the Jesuit tradition, Xavier believes that religious insights are
complementary to the intellectual life, and that a continuing synthesis of the
Christian perspective with all other forms of human knowledge is conducive to
wisdom and understanding. Xavier shares in worldwide Jesuit commitment to a
creative and intelligent engagement with questions of peace and justice.
Xavier aims to provide all students with a supportive learning environment which
offers opportunities for identifying personal needs, setting goals, and developing
recreational and aesthetic interests and skills for daily living and leadership. The
self-understanding and interpersonal development that result are vital corollaries
to a student’s academic development.

Last Reviewed Date: April 30, 2008

POLICY
Employees who are newly hired, transferred or rehired are considered to be in an
introductory period for the first 90 days in their position. Use of an introductory
period in no way alters the at-will employment relationship between Xavier
University and each employee, whereby either party may terminate the
employment relationship at any time, with or without cause and with or without
notice.
During the introductory period, the employee learns the job duties and functions,
and their supervisor determines whether or not the employee can effectively
perform the assigned job duties.
Upon completion of the introductory period, the employee may be placed in
continuing status. A supervisor in consultation with the Office of Human
Resources may extend the introductory period for no more than 30 days (this
option should be used in rare circumstances). Successful completion of the
introductory period will not result in salary increase or promotion.

Last Reviewed Date: April 30, 2008

A. POLICY
Applicants for open positions will be evaluated solely on the basis of their
qualifications. However, in order to eliminate situations of real or perceived
favoritism, Xavier University will exercise careful judgment in the hiring and
placement of relatives by blood or marriage.
As such, Xavier University prohibits the employment of relatives in continuing
positions where they would supervise or be subject to the supervision of a
relative, direct or control the work of the other, or have any review or sign-off
relationship with the other. The Associate Vice President of Human Resources
will review the hiring and placement of relatives on a case-by-case basis. Any
exceptions must be approved by the President.
Two employees in a reporting relationship who become related while working for
Xavier University may not continue the reporting relationship. In such instances,
when possible, Xavier University will attempt to find a suitable transfer
opportunity for the parties involved. When a transfer opportunity is possible, the
related individuals will have 30 days to decide who will transfer. If the related
parties cannot decide who will transfer, Xavier University reserves the right to
decide which party will transfer if requested by Xavier University. In the event
that a transfer opportunity is not available, one party must either go on an unpaid
leave of absence, or resign. In such case, the parties involved will have 60 days
to decide who will either go on unpaid leave (until a suitable opportunity within
Xavier University is available), or resign.

Policy 2.06

Section 2: Employment

Policy: 2.06 Employment of Relatives

In cases where there is no reporting relationship, but relatives working together
create conflict or other disruption to normal operations, Xavier University
reserves the right to reassign or transfer such employees as it deems necessary.
In cases where such disruptions exist and there are no transfer/reassignment
opportunities, the employees will be given 30 days to demonstrate that they can
work together without disruption. Related employees who cannot work together
without conflict or disruption are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.
B. DEFINITION
For purposes of this policy, "immediate family member" is defined as: spouse,
parents, children, brothers, sisters, in-laws, or any person related by blood or

A. POLICY
To the extent feasible, all new positions at Xavier University will be reviewed by
the Office of Human Resources and will be placed into salary schedules as
appropriate.
Xavier University acknowledges that position responsibilities may change so

1. New Position
When a new position is approved, the supervisor will complete a job description
and submit it to the Office of Human Resources.
The Office of Human Resources will evaluate the position and determine if it is
exempt or non-exempt based on the guidelines from the Fair Labor Standards
Act (FLSA). Positions determined to be non-exempt will be classified according

2. Reclassification
At any time of the year, if a supervisor and employee determine there have been
significant changes to a position’s responsibilities, they may elect to request the
position be reviewed for possible reclassification.
The supervisor should submit to the Office of Human Resources the old job
description, the new job description and a cover memorandum stating how the
position responsibilities have changed including, identifying the significant
changes in responsibilities and why the changes necessitate a reclassification.
The Office of Human Resources will then follow the same classification process
as it does for new positions. A recommendation will be presented to the
appropriate Vice President or Associate Provost for a final decision. The Office
of Human Resources will then notify the Vice President or Associate Provost of
the decision.
Affirmative determinations may be delayed until spring based upon available
funding.

salaried positions. Such employees shall not receive a reduction in pay for
absences of less than one (1) day. Such absences will, when applicable, be
deducted from the employee’s accumulated sick leave or vacation leave time.
Exempt employees are expected to work a minimum of thirty-seven and one-half

and holiday pay are based upon a thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) hour week or
other number of hours the employee is instructed to work.
2. Many positions fall into the non-exempt status. That is, they are covered by
the provisions of the FLSA, and therefore eligible for overtime compensation, and
they are commonly called hourly positions. Accordingly, Xavier University pays
any non-exempt (hourly) employee compensation at a rate of one and one-half
(1 ½) times their regular rate of pay for any hours worked in excess of forty (40)
hours in a seven (7) day workweek.

compromise the employee’s obligation to the University. An actual or
apparent conflict of interest exists where:
•

An employee’s actions or activities involve both an advantage to the
employee and any effect on the University’s interests; or

•

An employee’s association or involvement with a third party prevents

A. PHILOSOPHY
Xavier University expects high standards of performance and conduct from its
employees. Therefore, policies and rules have been established as guidelines
for employee conduct. It is the responsibility of supervisors to (a) have
knowledge of the organization's policies, rules and procedures; (b) ensure their
employees have an understanding of the conduct, expectations, and rules; and
(c) respond to violations of employee conduct in an appropriate, consistent and
impartial manner in keeping with the guidelines outlined in this section.
It is impossible to list every single action or situation that will cause disciplinary
steps to be taken. Therefore, this policy will reflect the most common situations.
It is expected the supervisors will use good judgment in evaluating employee
conduct and related violations.
B. POLICY
Violation of any Xavier University policy or rule can subject an employee to
disciplinary action as outlined in Policy 2.18 (Progressive Discipline Policy). The
following are a few examples of behaviors that may result in disciplinary actions;
but this list is not all inclusive:
•
•
•
•

Xavier University policy stresses that supervisor’s efforts should focus, when
appropriate, on preventing serious personnel problems rather than disciplining
employees for misconduct. But whenever disciplinary actions are taken, it is
essential that:
a. Each problem be investigated thoroughly so that the facts of the
situation are known; and
b. Any action taken be primarily corrective and appropriate to the offense.

•
•
•
•
•

Verbal Warning

Final Written Warning
Suspension
Discharge

The final warning should make it clear that, unless there is significant
improvement, discharge will result. When a final warning is given, a copy should

immediate discharge could be required.
d. Discipline may be administered by the supervisor, the Associate Vice
President of Human Resources, or other designee.
Supervisors should adhere to the following procedures, when appropriate, with
respect to taking disciplinary action:
a. Secure the necessary facts related to the misconduct. Obtain verifiable
information by interviewing witnesses and obtaining all necessary
supporting documentation.
b. Discuss the alleged misconduct with the employee by seeking the
employee’s side of the story.
c. Analyze the facts that have been obtained, including those presented
by the employee. Determine if sufficient facts exist to support
disciplinary action.
d. If appropriate to the situation, determine corrective action. Consider the
severity of discipline, and when appropriate, apply principles of
progressive discipline.
e. Inform the employee of the disciplinary decision, including
documentation of any disciplinary action that is being taken.
A Human Resource representative should be present when an employee
termination is performed.

An employee has the right to request the presence of a support person during an
investigative interview that may result in disciplinary action against the employee.
The support person attends in an observatory role.
For example, an employee has the right to have a support person attend an

The Office of Human Resources will schedule a voluntary exit interview with the
terminating employee on or preceding his/her last day of work, with the exception
of those employees who provide less than two weeks notice or those who are
discharged by Xavier University. The purpose of the exit interview is to learn
more about the employee’s employment experience at Xavier University.
Employees will be asked for their opinion of Xavier University, and any other
information they would like to share about their employment.
The following areas should be covered at the Exit Interview:
1. Discuss clearly with the employee to establish and record:
a. Effective date of the termination, the final pay period and last day
worked;
b. Termination of insurance;
c. Status of any other applicable benefits; and
d. Actions taken regarding retirement, if applicable.
2. Inform the employee about his or her final paycheck. Upon an employee’s
employment separation, the employee is entitled to pay for all hours actually
worked, accrued, and unused vacation up to a maximum of 30 days.
3. Upon retirement, non-exempt employees receive 10% of their accumulated
sick leave balance.
4. Conduct an overall evaluation of the reasons related to the termination and an
indication of any corrective action necessary. Inquire into the employee’s
impressions of working conditions, supervision, advancement and training
opportunities, opportunities for self-expression, and handling of problems or
difficulties. The exit interview provides an excellent opportunity to see the
organization from the employee’s point of view. Relevant areas of discussion

3.02 ABSENTEEISM, TARDINESS AND NOTIFICATION
Scope: Staff

Responsible Department:
Human Resources

Approved By:
President’s Office

Last Reviewed Date: April 30, 2008

A. PHILOSOPHY
Regular attendance of all employees is important to the planning, efficiency and
provision of services required by Xavier University. Absenteeism and tardiness
increases the workload of other employees and affects the quality of services.
Thus, it is vitally important that each employee be at work when scheduled.
B. POLICY
It is the responsibility of employees to contact their supervisor in advance if they are
unable to report to work as scheduled.
If an employee is absent without notifying his/her supervisor or the Office of
Human Resources for three (3) consecutive workdays, the employee will be
considered to have terminated his or her employment without notice.
C. PROCEDURE
1. Absent and/or tardy employees must contact his or her supervisor as soon as
possible and prior to the employee's scheduled starting time on each day of
absence or tardiness. Upon return to work, the employee shall report to his or her
immediate supervisor to further explain the reason for the absence or tardiness and
to provide documentation, if any is needed, to substantiate the absence or
tardiness. Documentation must be completed and submitted on the employee's next
scheduled workday.

Section 3: Employee Responsibilities

Policy: 3.02 Absenteeism,
Tardiness and Notification

2. In the event of an absence, supervisors should speak with the employee to find
out if the absence was a result of an illness or other emergency. In the event of an
illness where a doctor’s visit is required, the supervisor may ask for such
documentation from the employee. Should the employee find himself or herself in a
position where unscheduled absences could occur as a result of illness or other
personal emergencies, the supervisor should ensure that the employee is using the
proper type of leave, in accordance with Xavier University policies and procedures.
3. If an employee is unable to report to work, at his/her designated time, the
employee should immediately notify their supervisor. In the event that an employee
is unable to reach their respective supervisor, he/she should follow standard
department practices for reporting absences.

Scope: Faculty and Staff

Responsible Department:

Approved By:
President’s Office

Last Reviewed Date: April 30, 2008

A. PHILOSOPHY
Xavier University is committed to providing a work environment that is free of
discrimination and harassment of any form. Actions, words, jokes, or comments
by any employee, supervisor, vendor, or student that are based on an
individual’s sex, race, ethnicity, age, religion, disability, any other legally
protected or non-protected characteristics will not be tolerated.
We encourage the prompt reporting of acts or words of harassment, whether the
actions or words are directed against the person making the report, or against
another person. Prompt reporting is crucial because it will allow us to take
prompt and appropriate action to deal with the problem.
B. HARASSMENT POLICY
Introduction to the Xavier University Harassment Code and Accountability
Procedures
Individuals who believe they have been harassed, individuals charged with
harassment, and individuals with knowledge of situations in which harassment
may exist should consult the Xavier University Harassment Code and
Accountability Procedures (HCAP). To encourage persons to come forward,
Xavier University provides several channels of communication, information, and
both informal and formal complaint resolution procedures. Persons or groups
who believe they are victims of such an action are encouraged to report the
incident to the appropriate Xavier University authority. All complaints are

Page 1 of 2

Policy 3.03

Section 3: Employee Responsibilities

Policy: 3.03 Harassment

considered serious and are dealt with through informal intervention or formal
intervention resolution procedures. Disciplinary action will be taken in all cases
where there is a finding of responsibility through a formal procedure.
This HCAP is only part of Xavier University’s effort to prevent harassment in our
community. In addition to outlining steps for making and resolving complaints,
Xavier University is also committed to programs of education to raise the level of
understanding concerning the nature of harassment and ways to prevent its
occurrence.
Applicability of the HCAP
This HCAP applies to the “University Community” which includes all persons who
are enrolled at or employed by Xavier University while they are on campus or are
participating in a Xavier University-related off-campus activity, except where
noted. Additionally, all others present on the Xavier campus or participating in a
Xavier University-related off-campus activity are expected to observe the policies
outlined herein.
This HCAP is subject to change as deemed appropriate by Xavier University.
Notice of changes to this HCAP will be provided to all persons to whom it applies
through the Campus portal, email system, or by some other method reasonably
intended to reach all members of the Xavier University Community. Xavier
University will strive to provide this notice of changes within a reasonable period
of time after the changes have been made.

Responsible Department:

Approved By:
President’s Office

Last Reviewed Date: April 30, 2008

A. PHILOSOPHY
The issue of drug and alcohol abuse concerns the entire Xavier University
Community, as well as our surrounding neighborhoods. The use of illicit drugs
and misuse of alcohol contributes to unrecoverable loss of time, talent and lives.
Xavier University also must comply with the federal Drug Free Schools and
Communities Act Amendments of 1989, which require schools, colleges and
universities receiving federal financial assistance to implement and enforce drug
and alcohol prevention programs for students and employees.
B. POLICY
Xavier University prohibits the illegal use, possession, sale, manufacture or
distribution of drugs and alcohol by all students and employees on Xavier
University premises or property or as part of any Xavier University activity. The
standard also applies to student-sponsored social activities or professional
meetings attended by employees if such activities are considered to be Xavier
University sponsored. Any misuse of substances by Xavier University students
and employees that presents physical or psychological hazard to individuals also
is prohibited.
The policy is applicable to all employees and any person who has access to
students, or property, or who may perform work in conjunction with Xavier
University operations, whether as an employee, student, temporary affiliate, or an
individual affiliated in any other capacity.

Each employee is encouraged to conduct his or her personal business so that
garnishments are unnecessary.
B. POLICY
A court-ordered legal claim or legally executed agreement by a creditor against
the wages of an employee for non-payment of a debt must be recognized and
executed by the Payroll Office.
C. PROCEDURE
1. Any court-ordered garnishment, tax levy or wage assignment rendered
against an employee must be forwarded immediately to the Payroll Office for

Approved By:
President’s Office

Last Reviewed Date: April 30, 2008

A. PHILOSOPHY
Xavier University encourages its employees to further their formal education by
attending courses offered by Xavier University and provide employees and their
spouses and dependents tuition remission for undergraduate and graduate
courses as a fringe benefit program.
B. POLICY
Full-time and part-time employees, spouses, and dependents up to and including
age 25 meeting the dependency criteria established by the Federal tax law (IRS
Code Section 1529a, Reg. 1, 152-1) are eligible participants for tuition remission.
Employees who wish to attend classes must first satisfy the admission
requirement of Xavier University and are subject to all normal policies and
procedures.
All class room assignments must be done outside normal working hours and
attendance for classes should not conflict with normal working hours.
Exceptional cases must be approved by the employee’s supervisor and by the
Office of Human Resources.
Full-time employees are eligible for 100% benefit for graduate and
undergraduate courses up to six credit hours per semester. All hours in excess
of six credit hours must be approved by the employee’s supervisor and the Vice
President or Associate Provost. Part-time employees are granted pro-rated

Page 1 of 5

Policy 4.03

Section 4: Compensation & Benefits

Policy: 4.03 Tuition Remission

remission for the tuition charged up to six credit hours. Tuition remission is
available upon employment.
Tuition remission covers tuition for regularly scheduled courses only, payable to
Xavier University, and does not apply to room, board, or fees.
If the employee terminates employment during a semester in which courses are
being taken, full tuition remission will revert to partial tuition remission according
to the refund schedule published in Xavier University’s catalogue.
In the event of retirement, disability, or death of a full-time employee who has
completed seven years of service, tuition remission is extended to the spouse
and dependent children under the same condition as an active employee.
The Tuition Remission form, available from the Office of Human Resources, must
be completed by each employee eligible for tuition remission, for each semester
during which tuition will be remitted. The employee should obtain the
supervisor’s approval and then submit the form to the Office of Human
Resources prior to the beginning of the academic term. Credit will then be
applied to the employee’s account.
Spouses and Dependents (Undergraduate): After completion of one year of
service by a full-time employee, spouses and dependents are eligible for 90%
undergraduate tuition remission. No other form of Xavier University-based
financial aid is available beyond this remission. Enrollment may be restricted for
undergraduate programs with class size limits to space available basis. This
tuition remission benefit applies to all course work taken at the undergraduate
level as a part-time or full-time student.
Tuition remission is available for eligible dependents of Xavier University
employees; tuition remission covers tuition only, payable to Xavier University (to
the extent that the employee is eligible) and does not apply to room, board, or
fees. If application has not been made through the Financial Aid Office for other
educational assistance that may be available, tuition remission will not be
granted. When both parents are employed by Xavier University, only one parent
may apply for tuition remission for a dependent child.
Part-time employees are eligible for tuition remission for spouses and
dependents on a pro-rated basis. Part-time employees must complete one year
of part-time service for eligibility.
Spouses and Dependents (Graduate): After completion of one year of service by
a full-time employee, spouses and dependents are eligible for 90% graduate
tuition remission. No other form of Xavier University-based financial aid is
Page 2 of 5

Policy 4.03

Section 4: Compensation & Benefits

Policy: 4.03 Tuition Remission

available beyond this remission. Enrollment may be restricted for graduate
programs with class size limits to a space available basis. This tuition remission
benefit applies to all course work taken at the graduate level as a part-time or
full-time student.
Part-time employees are eligible for tuition remission for spouses and
dependents on a pro-rated basis. Part-time employees must complete one year
of part-time service for eligibility.
Proration Benefit of Part-time Employees: For purposes of calculating the prorated
tuition remission benefit for part-time employees, full-time employment for
administrators and support staff shall be 37.5 hours per week and for faculty will be 12
hours of teaching assignment per semester. Employees hired prior to June 1, 1993
are grandfathered and will use 30 hours as full-time for the prorated calculation.
Prorated benefit shall be calculated by multiplying the tuition assessed times the ratio
of part-time assignment to full-time employment.
Example:
1. Spouse/dependent taking graduate courses whose sponsor works 15 hours per
week.
Remission = (tuition charged) x (90% benefit) x (15/37.5).
2. Spouse/dependent taking undergraduate courses whose sponsor is a part-time
faculty teaching 6 hours.
Remission -= (tuition charged) x (90% benefit) x (6/12).
Housing: Xavier University Housing will be available to dependents at the approved
room and board rates on a space available basis.
Tuition Exchange Programs: Tuition Exchange is a reciprocal ‘scholarship’ program
for children of faculty and staff employed at over 550 participating institutions. As a
member of the Tuition Exchange Program, dependents of Xavier employees who are
benefit eligible at Xavier are eligible to be considered for tuition exchange at any of the
participating colleges and universities in the United States. Tuition Exchange
“scholarships” are not an entitlement; they are competitive awards. Additional
information on this program can be accessed at http://www.xavier.edu/financialaid/docs/TE_Policy_Outgoing.pdf
FACHEX : FACHEX is an acronym for Faculty and Staff Children Exchange
Program. It is an undergraduate tuition remission program for children of full-time

Office of Human Resources, as well as the Application for Federal Student Aid and
return it to the Office of Financial Aid. These applications are available from the Office

the supervisor. Vacations are scheduled subject to the needs of each department as
determined by the supervisor.
2. Every effort must be made by employees to schedule their vacations in advance
in order to allow proper planning for their absence. However, supervisors have the
final authority to approve or disapprove vacation requests of the employees in their
departments, regardless of the amount of advance notice that is given.
3. Every effort will be made to schedule vacations as requested by staff members.
However, vacation time should be scheduled so that Xavier University needs and
departmental/office efficiency are maintained.
4. Should more than one employee from the same department/area request the
same vacation period at the same time; workflow needs may not permit both to be
off of work simultaneously. If the two employees are unable to resolve the matter
themselves, their supervisor will make the decision. In making such decisions, the
supervisor weighs the organization's business needs, the timeliness of the requests,
the employees' respective seniority and the recent history of prior vacation time
taken by each employee.
5. In accordance with Policy 2.14 (Overtime), vacation time is not counted in
determining whether an employee has worked over 40 hours and therefore eligible
for overtime.
6. Upon separation of employment, an employee will be paid for up to 30 days of
unused, accrued vacation if the employee has been employed for at least 6 months.

Page 1 of 3

Policy 4.06

Section 4: Compensation & Benefits

Policy: 4.06 Sick Leave

should leave a message and contact information. Failure to provide proper
notification is sufficient reason for not granting sick leave. A supervisor may
require a written statement from the employee’s physician before approving sick
leave.

2 weeks
4 weeks
8 weeks
13 weeks

absent from work, he/she may charge up to two days against accumulated sick
time for each such occurrence. During any twelve-month period, no more than
five days may be charged against sick leave benefits for such absences.
Employees should try to schedule medical and dental appointment outside
working hours. If an appointment occurs during working hours, the time may be
charged to sick leave.
The University will issue each July a bonus of $100 to each continuing nonexempt employee (full-time or part-time) who uses no sick leave during the
previous fiscal year (June 1 to May 31), and a bonus of $50 to each continuing
employee (full-time or part-time) who uses three days or less of sick leave during
that period. For continuing part-time employees, a day of sick leave is equal to
one-fifth of the standard work week. New employees are eligible for pro-rated
bonuses based on their length of service during the previous fiscal year.
Employees who retire at age 62 or later with at least 7 years of service will
receive a cash bonus of 10% of unused sick leave balance at the most recent
rate of pay.
If a University holiday falls during a period of sick leave, the day is not charged to
sick leave. All absences that are charged to sick leave should be recorded on
the appropriate pay form.
