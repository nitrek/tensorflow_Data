, AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
WASHINGTON, D. C.

"

INTRODUCTION

- . At the close of the fifth fiscal year since its creation, the Securities
and .~;ch~e
Commission was administering three statutes, ,the
Se~m.ri~,A~t_ of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Pub,lie U1Jlity.Holding Company Act of '1935, and had certain duties
under. Chapter X of the amended Bankruptcy Act.l
-. The 'full administration of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act was delayed in many respects' by the failure of a substantial
portion of the industry to register until after the decision of the
Supreme Court, ~m March 28, 1938, upholding the constitutionality
of the registration provisions. Thus, the Commission at the close
of.the. fiscal year had had only a year and three months of full administration of the .Act. The amended Bankruptcy Act was adopted by
Congress o~ June 22, 1938, so that the Commission had exercised its
duties with respect to corporate reorganizations under Chapter X
of theA ..ct for only slightly more than one year.
Proposed new issues of securities registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, thus making full data available to prospective investors,
had reached a 5-year total of over $14,500,000,000 by the end of the
fiscal year. Twenty securities exchanges were subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and data was available to investors" on
more than 4,000 securities listed on these exchanges. Nearly 7,000
~.I:'9k-ers
and dealers doing a business in the over-the-counter security
markets were registered with the Commission. Fifty-one public
utility holding company systems, comprising 142 registered holding
companies and including 1,542 separate holding, sub-holding, and
operating companies, were subject to the Commission's regulation.
i .A fifth statute; tlie Trust Indenture Act of 1939,was enacted Just after the close of the tlscal year. This
act adds a new title (Title III) to the Act of May Zl, 1933,as amended, Title I of which Is the 8ecurities
Act of 1933. Briefly, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939requfres that bonds, notes, debentures, and similar
BeCIIlitiespublicly irifered for sale, sold; or delivered 8fter sale through the malls or in Interstate commerce,
except as specifically exempted by the Act, be Issued under an Indenture which meets the requirements of
the Act and bas been dnly qualified with the CommlssIon. The provisions of these two Acts are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act of such seenrtrtes to be Issued under Btrust Indenture
shall not be permitted to become e1fectlve unless the Indenture conforms to the specific statutory require.
mllJlfs"expressed in the Trust Indenture Act. The Indenture Is Butomaticelly "qualified" when registration becomes effective as to the seourities themselves.

SECURITIES

AND

EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

During the year the Commission filed notices of appearance in
reorganization proceedings under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act
in cases involving 87 principal debtors and 18 subsidiary debtors.
In the enforcement of its laws during the past five years the Commission has stopped the issuance of 119 proposed security issues and
14 security issues have been delisted from stock exchanges as a result
of inability or unwillingness to make the required disclosure. Six
persons have been suspended from membership in national securities
exchanges for violations of the Securities Exchange Act oLI93:4,_and
two members have been ordered expelled. The registration '0(60
brokers and dealers in over-the-counter security markets has been
suspended or revoked.
The Commission has intensified its prosecution of fraudulent promoters, stock swindlers, bucket shop operators, and others who abuse
the confidence of the investing public and, during the past five fiscal
years, has brought 312 suits in the United States courts to prevent
violation of its laws. Of these, 288 had been concluded at the end of
the fiscal year and as a result 657 :firms and individuals had been
permanently enjoined from further violation of the law. In addition,
the Commission has referred 158 cases to the Department of Justice.
As a result, 403 defendants had been convicted at the end of the year.
The Commission's activities in the regulation of securities exchanges during the past year have been' directed principally towards
securing protection against avoidable financial risks for the customer
of stock exchange brokerage :firms. The Commission's report on its
investigation of the failure of Richard Wbitney & Company revealed
lax standards and recommended a broad program of measures designed
to protect customers' funds and securities.
Continuing its policy of
encouraging self-policing by securities exchanges-as
an alternative
to direct and detailed regulation by the Government-the
Commission
sought to have the exchanges effectuate, under their own rules, a
program for customer protection.
Although various plans and proposals had been discussed, at the end of the fiscal year adequate
measures for customer protection had not yet been put into effect by
the exchanges.
During the year the Commission continued its work with invest-.
ment bankers, dealers, and brokers to effectuate the system of cooperative regulation of the over-the-counter security markets envisioned
by the Maloney Amendment to the Securities Exchange Act (adopted
June 25, 1938). At the close of the fiscal year plans for the organi.-'zlition and registration. under the Act. of a .'namonal.t;8SS'oriat!on. of -

securities dealers were nearing maturity,"
t Shortly after the close of the fiscal year the National Association of 8ecarlties Dealers. Ine., registered
with the Commission under the Act.

FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT

3

Perhaps the most important single effect of the Public Utility
Holding- €ompany'Act has been on the security issues of the utility
companies. From December 1,1935, when the Act became effective,
until the close of the fiscal year, utility companies had issued over
$2,500,000,000 of securities, all of them sufficiently in harmony with
the aims and spirit of the law to permit their issuance. Of this
amount, $1,449,810,000 were issued during the past fiscal year.
In addition the Commission has passed on nearly every variety of
financial transaction covered by the statute.
With respect to the integration and simplification provisions of the
Act, six companies have had plans of simplification approved by the
Commission and eight companies had plans pending before the Commission at June 30, 1939.
On August 3, 1938, William O. Douglas, former Chairman of the
Commission, addressed a letter to the chief executives of all registered
holding companies requesting them to inform the Commission of their
tentative ideas as to how Section 11 (b) could be complied with. The
purpose of this request was to focus the attention of the industry
upon the steps needed-to comply with the statutes, and to assist the
Commission in determining the best means of securing such compliance, as well as to obtain both data and ideas that might prove helpful
to the Commission. With few exceptions the registered holding
companies submitted more or less elaborate statements in response
to this request. These have been carefully studied and analyzed
and have aided considerably in the formulation of working plans for
securing compliance 'with' the statute. The next step is the specific
and separate determination of each company's problem, a matter
which in each case must be based on the evidence produced, both
by the Commission and the company, at a public hearing.
:mIring the past fiscal year the Commission adopted 27 new rules
under its statutes and repealed 14 rules.
'Fhe courts' have almost invariably sustained the orders of the
Commission in cases where review has been sought. During the past
five years the Circuit Courts of Appeal have been asked to review
orders of the Commission in 49 cases. Thirty-nine of these petitions
were 'dismissed or withdrawn, in two cases the order of the Commission was affirmed and in only one case was the Commission's order
vacated. Seven cases were pending at the end of the year.
D.ym .the year a new chairman was elected when, on May 18, 1939,
Commi;;Sioner Jerome N. Frank succeeded Chairman William O.
Douglas, who resigned April 16, 1939 as Chairman and Commissioner
to accept an appointment as Justice of the United States Supreme
Court. On June 30, 1939, Commissioner Frank was reelected Chairman of the Commission, for the period ending June 30, 1940.

Part I
NEW DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION WITH RESPECT TO
CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF
THE BANKRUPTCY ACT. AS AMENDED
During the past fiscal year, the Commission inaugurated its functions
under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1938 (Public
No. 696, 75th Congress), relating to the reorganization of corporations and
superseding Section 77B of that Act.
Chapter X affords the appropriate machinery for the reorganization of
corporations (other than railroads) in the Federal courts under the Bankruptcy Act. The Commission's duties under the chapter are, first, at the
request or with the approval of the court, to act as a participant in proceedings thereunder in order to provide independent, expert assistance on
matters arising in such proceedings. Second, the Commission is empowered to prepare, for the benefit of the courts and investors, advisory
reports on plans of reorganization submitted in such proceedings.

COMMISSION FUNCTIONS UNDER CHAPTER X

The functions of the Commission as a participant in Chapter X
proceedings are governed by Section 208 of the Act. That section
provides that the Commission shall, if requested by the judge, and
may, upon its own motion if approved by the judge, file a notice of
its appearance in a proceeding under Chapter X. Upon the filing of
such notice, the Commission is deemed to be a party in interest and
has a right to be heard upon all matters arising in the proceeding.
However, it may not appeal or file any petition for appeal in the
proceeding.
The Commission's functions in connection with advisory reports
on reorganization plans are governed primarily by Section 172 of the
Act. That section provides that the judge shall, if the indebtedness
of the debtor exceeds $3,000,000, and may, if the indebtedness does
not exceed that amount, submit to the Commission for examination
and report any plan or plans of reorganization which the judge deems
worthy of consideration. Section 173 of the Act provides that the
judge may not approve any plan until the Commission has filed its
report or has notified the judge that it will not file a report, or unless
no report has been filed within the period fixed by the judge. Section
175 provides that upon the approval of any plan by the judge, the
Commission's report, if one has been filed or a summary prepared
189101-40--2

8

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

by the Commission, must be transmitted to creditors and stockholders
who are being asked to vote on the plan, along with certain other
material.
In general, the Commission's functions under Chapter X are advisory in nature, and are designed to make available to the courts
and security holders the expert and impartial assistance of the
Commission.
In order that its functions under Chapter X may be more effectively
and efficiently exercised, the Commission established the Reorganization Division in Washington and reorganization units in the several
regional offices. This decentralization was designed to meet the
needs of the courts and the parties involved and to avoid the delay
and expense that might have been occasioned by the exercise of all
the functions directly from Washington. It has been accomplished,
however, without the delegation by the Commission of any power of
decision.
PROCEEDINGS

IN WHICH THE COMMISSION

PARTICIPATED

The amended Act did not become fully effective until September
22,1938, but the provisions of Chapter X thereof were made applicable
in their entirety to proceedings in which the petition for reorganization
was approved within 3 months prior to that date. It was further
enacted that the provisions of Chapter X should apply, to the extent
that their application was deemed practicable by the judge, to proceedings in which the petition was approved more than 3 months
before September 22, 1938. Through the operations of these provisions, the Commission has therefore been active not only in cases
instituted since the enactment of Chapter X, but in numerous cases
which originated under the provisions of Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act.
In reaching the decision that it should seek to become a participant
in any case, the Commission has borne in mind the criterion that the
more important provisions now embodied in Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act were designed to assure greater protection for the interests
of the public investor. Accordingly, the Commission has concerned
itself with all cases involving a definite public interest, and, generally
speaking, has sought to participate in all cases involving more than
$250,000 face amount of securities outstanding in the hands of the
public. However, the Commission also has become a party to smaller
cases in which there were special factors which indicated the desirability of its participation, such as a questionable corporate history, or
the proposal of an improper plan of reorganization, or inadequate
representation for the public investors, or violations of various provisions of the new Act.

ANNUAL REPORT

During the period 'from September 2~, 1938 (the date on which
the amended Bankruptcy Act became fully effective), through June
30, 1939, the Commission filed its notice of appearance in 87 proceedings involving the reorganization of 105 corporations (87 principal
debtor corporations and 18 subsidiary debtors). Of these 87 proceedings, 38 were commenced under Chapter X,.while 49 originated
under Section 77B. In 53 proceedings the Commission filed its
notice of appearance at the request of the judge; while in the remaining
34 it became a party upon approval by the judge of its own motion
to participate.
In only one instance was the Commission's motion
to participate darned. _
The 105 debtors involved in the proceedings to which the Commission became a party showed aggregate assets of over $550,000,000
and aggregate indebtedness of over $440,000,000. These proceedings
embraced a wide variety of industries, as indicated by the following

ON REORGANIZATIONS

UNDER CHAPTER

X

In order to determine in which cases. its- participation would, in the
light of the public interest involved, be desirable and practicable, and
in order that it might be in a position to respond to the requests of
judges seeking its advice and assistance in connection with specific
cases, the Commission has endeavored to keep informed as to the
nature of all pending cases. Accordingly, the Commission has investigated or examined during t4.e fiac~l y~a.r a tot,al of 1,104 reorganizetion cases, including the cases in which it became a party.
Of this
number, 527 were proceedings commenced under Section 77B prior
to enactment of the Chandler Act, and the remaining 577 were instituted under the provisions of Chapter X of the amended Act.
As an aid to the Commission in the performance of its duties under
the Act, it was provided in Section 265a of Chapter X that the Clerks
of the various Federal District Conrts.shall-tmnsmit to the Commission copies of all petitions for reorga~~oD.diled
under that-Qhapter,
as well as copies of various other specified documents filed in the proceedings. Thus, the Commission possesses files or records of the more
important papers in all Chapter X cases and is in a position to make
available to many users information otherwise practically inaccessible
to them.

FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT

11

With a view to dissemination of this information, the Conunission
has inaugurated a series of statistical surveys presenting data on the
total number of proceedings under Chapter X and the aggregate
assets and indebtedness of the companies involved, classified according
to industry, location of principal assets, location of principal place
of business, Federal judicial district in which proceedings were instituted, amount of individual indebtedness, and type of petition filed.
The first of these statistical analyses, covering the period from September 22, 1938, to March 31, 1939, inclusive, was released on May 8,
i939. A statisticalaIialyms'ih"simi:J.'ar-fur,m <covering- the period from
June 22, 1938 to June 30, 1939, inclusive, is contained in Appendix
IX of this report.
THE COMMISSION

AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

In general, it may be said that the Commission's activities in reorganization proceedings in which it participates may be as extensive
as the issues arising in the proceedings and as varied in their scope.
As a party in interest, the Commission is represented at all important
hearings in the proceedings.
It participates in the discussions on all
major issues and on appropriate occasions 'files legal or factual memoranda in support of its views. In addition, its views with respect
to the fairness and feasibility of reorganization plans are fully discussed with all interested and proper parties, and proposals as to
plans are fully examined in connection with the Commission's views.
In many cases this has led to extensive amendment and improvement
in such proposals in advance of the hearings thereon before the court.
The range of matters with which the Commission has been concerned
is outlined in the following paragraphs.
The Commission has encountered a number of instances of violation of, and nonc()mplianee.with"the.proeedural
provisions of Chapter
X. In many cases where such situations came to the Commission's
attention, a conference with the parties was sufficient to dispose of
the matter.
In other cases, it was necessary to file a formal motion
in court.
Insuring Adequate Notice of Hearings to Security Holders.

Among the more important of such violations of the Act were those
connected with the provisions for notice which must be given of the
various hearings required by the statute.
Occasionally, for example,
the Commission has advised the parties of their failure to give notice
to the various parties entitled thereto, or of the inadequacy of the
notice even wIreD.'given;' as ieI8:ti'hg'tQ' the-hearings 'on the question of
continuance in possession of the debtor or the retention in office of
the trustee.
The Commission has similarly objected to failure to
give notice of the statutory hearings for the approval of a plan. In a

12

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

number of instances applications for interim allowances to the trustees.
and their counsel were made without the requisite hearing on notice
to all creditors, security holders, and parties.
In all of these instances
it was possible to accomplish a correction of the violations without
undertaking any formal court action. Many other examples of
procedural noncompliance with the statute could be adduced as to.
which the Commission has taken remedial aotion.. It is to be emphasized that these matters, though procedural in nature, are of significance to security holders in safeguarding their rights to be heard on
all matters arising in reorganization proceedings under the statute.
Securing Compliance With P ..ovisions Regarding Trustees.

"

A most important phase of the Commission's activity in discerning
and correcting noncompliance with the Act dealt with the appointment of independent trustees.
As an essential element in the proper
conduct of reorganizations, the statute prescribes certain standards of
disinterestedness which must' bei met- 'by trustees' appointed under
Chapter X. Wherever there was any doubt as to the qualificationsof the trustees, the Commission undertook thoroughgoing examinations into the facts. ' In three-cases, for example; sufficient evidence.
of conflicting interests was developed to warrant an appearance in
court for the purpose of urging the removal of trustees.
In one of
these cases, where it appeared that the trustee had been in charge of
the debtor's operations at the time of his appointment, the trusteeresigned after the Commission filed its motion and before testimony
was to be taken at the court hearing. In the second of these cases;
the court removed the trustee after hearing. In the third case, the
Commission was of the opinion that both the trustee and his attorney
were disqualified under the statute, but the court overruled its objection and continued them in office.
In a few cases, independent trustees were not appointed although
the indebtedness of each. of the several debtors was in excess .of
$250,000, the point above which the statute makes their appointment
mandatory.
However, in all such instances, the omission was promptly cured when attention was directed to the violation.
In other cases
questions arose concerning the powers of the disinterested trustee asdistinguished from those of the interested trustee.
Under the statute
the court can, in unusual cases, designate as an additional co-trustee
an officer, director, or employee of the debtor, 'but only for the purpose of assisting in the operation of the business. Accordingly, the
Commission objected to an order directing both the disinterested
trustee and the co-trustee..to prepare and file a plan. The Commission likewise objected to an order depriving the disinterested trustee
of the power to participate in the operation of the business and confining his functions to the formulation and submission of the plan.

- FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

13

In both instances, the Commission's views were approved and the
orders amended.
Securing Compliance With Provisions Regarding Protective Committees and
Indenture Trustees.

Another general phase of the Commission's efforts to remedy noncompliance with the provisions of Chapter X related to the activities
of protective committees and indenture trustees. The Commission
has constantly been alert to secure compliance with the provisions of
the statute which require disclosure by committees and indenture
trustees of relevant information concerning their appointment, affiliation's. and security holdings. .Considerable attention also has been
given to the controversial question whether formal intervention
should be granted to committees and indenture trustees in proceedings under Chapter X. The position advanced by the Commission
in the courts has been that, since the new statute affords committees
and indenture trustees an unqualified right to be heard, such intervention is unnecessary as a general rule. In only one of the many
cases dealing with the question was this view rejected.'
,
. Inconnection with the activities of protective committees, the Commission was also concerned with the problem of solicitation of the
assents of security holders to plans of reorganization prior to approval
of su~h plans by the courts. The provisions of Chapter X were
designed to assure to creditors and stockholders the information
essential to the exercise of an informed judgment concerning the plan
before their vote thereon is exercised, and also to remove from the
courts the pressure which customarily attended "support" of plans
that were frequently neither fair and equitable, nor feasible. Consistently with the purpose of these provisions, the Commission in a
number of cases objected to such solicitations prior to the court's
consideration and approval of the plan under consideration.
PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

UNDER CHAPTER X

Many of the more complex problems which confronted the Commission as a party in reorganization cases were concerned with the
failure of proposed reorganization plans to conform with the standards
of fairness and feasibility required by Chapter X. As a preliminary to
consideration of all plans of reorganization, it was necessary to assemble the essential information bearing on the physical and financial
condition of the company, the causes of its financial collapse, the
quality of its management, its past operating performance and future
prospects, and the reasonable value of its properties. Information ~n
1The numerous cases in which this view was upheld include T1u Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iro It
Co. case which was appealed to the ClrpuIt Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
The oplnfon of the
appellate oo~ In that case Is summarized Infra, pp. 20-21.

14

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

these matters was obtained through voluntary cooperation on the part
of the trustees and the parties; through examination by the Commission's accountants of the books and records of the companies involved;
and through the examination of witnesses in court. This information
was complemented by the independent research of the Commission's
analytical staff into general economic factors affecting the particular
company and competitive conditions in the particular industry.
Feasibility of Plans.

Although it is obviously difficult to design a pattern of feasibility
into which all cases will fall, a number of matters of concern-to the
Commission in this category may be summarized. Thus, the Commission found it necessary in a number of cases to direct attention to
the inadequacy of proposed working capital; to object to proposed
fixed charges which were either in excess of or were not sufficiently
covered by reasonably anticipated earnings; to object to proposed
funded debt or capital structures bearing no reasonable relationship
to property values; and, generally speaking, to point out the conditions essential to a sound financial basis from which to look forward
to successful operating results. As a typical instance of the latter,
the Commission was, in one case, concerned with a plan which provided for the issuance of large blocks of cumulative income bonds,
the charges on which would have been in excess of the earning power of
the company, even before making allowance for necessarily substantial
depreciation charges. It appeared likely that accumulations of interest would continually accrue and increase the debt of the company;
by the same token, there seemed little likelihood of any considerable retirement of the bonds during the life of the issue to counterbalance this increase in debt. As a consequence, at the maturity of the
bond issue, the company might well have been burdened with a larger
debt, while at the-sarue time the value of its .properties, against ..w,hich
no depreciation reserve was provided, would be considerably lower.
The Commission advised the interested parties that, in its opinion,
the plan would serve only as a prelude to another reorganization and
the plan was materially modified. A number of similar improvements
in plans were accomplished in this manner and through recommendations to the courts.
Fairness of Plans.

Perhaps the most controversial of the issues presented in the
course of the Commission's participation in reorganizations is the
question whether a proposed plan is "fair and equitable" as required
by the statute.
In appraising this aspect of. plans, the" O~on
has taken the position that, to be fair, plans must provide full recognition for claims in the order of their legal and contractual priority,
either in cash or new securities or both; and that junior claims may

FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT

15

participate in reorganizations only to the extent of the value remaining in the debtor's properties after the satisfaction of prior claims.
The Commission has not considered a plan as fair which accords
recognition to junior interests unless there is a residuum of value for
suoh-intereats or such recognition is based on a fresh contribution
made in money or money's worth.
The Commission's position in this regard was fully sustained by the
decision of the United States Supreme Court in Case v. Los Angdes
Lumber Products Oo., Ltd., decided November 6, 1939.2
Consistently with the foregoing, the Commission has considered a
determination' of the value' of the debtor's properties essential in
evaluating the fairness of reorganization plans. Its view in this regard was recently upheld in a significant decision of the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the Philadelphia &: Reading Ooal
&: Iron Co. case," in which the court held that solvency, and by that
token, value, is appropriately to be determined in advance of approval
of any plan of reorganization. It may be added, in connection with
the'oomplex,proWem-of-detennining value-for the purposes described,
that the Commission shares the view of financial experts generally
and of most courts, that an appropriate capitalization of reasonably
foreseeable earning power is the most reliable guide to value in reorganization cases.
Although limitations of space preclude any summary in this report
of the varying fact situations in which the question of the fairness of
plans has been presented to the Commission, a typical instance is
briefly outlined in the following paragraphs, which serves also as an
indication of the expedition with which the Commission must consider
and act upon these matters as presented.
In the case in question, the debtor owned and operated a cold storage warehouse and had outstanding $1,646,000 of first mortgage bonds,
$598,500 of second mortgage bonds, $470,000 of unsecured indebtedness, $550,000 of preferred stock, and 30,000 shares of common stock.
The reorganization proceedings had been pending before the court for
several years and several plans of reorganization had proved abortive.
In order to expedite the proceedings, the judge, on October 21, 1938,
ordered the trustees to file, on or before November 10 of that year, a
plan of reorganization or a report of their reasons why a plan could
not be effected, pursuant to Chapter X. It was further ordered that a
hearing on the plan should be-held on November 18. On November 2,
1938?the'judge entered an order, pursuant to Section 208 of Chapter
X, requesting the Commission to file a notice of its appearance.

16

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Members of the Commission's staff immediately began a study of the
company's books and records, and the assembling of information
from all other pertinent sources which would bear on the company's
history, its financial condition, and its future prospects.
In the
meantime, the trustees had :filed a proposed plan of reorganization
which had the support of representatives of holders of the various
classes of securities.
This plan provided for a bank loan to raise
money to pay accrued taxes and for the issuance of second mortgage
income bonds and common stock to the bondholders and other
claimants, and included substantial participation for the existing
stock.
After a study and analysis of the plan based on the data which had
been obtained concerning the company, the Commission was convinced
that no equity existed for any interests junior to the claims of first
mortgag-e bondholders.
This conclusion was founded principally on
an examination of past operating results of the debtor and on an
estimate of its prospective earning capacity,
In the light of this
conclusion, it was apparent that the substantial participation accorded
junior interests was unfair. Furthermore, the amount of the funded
debt proposed by the plan and the difficulty of amortizing the bond
issue in any substantial amounts before its specified maturity cast
doubt on the feasibility of the plan. These and other considerations
led the Commission to believe that the substitution of equity securities
would present a more feasible capital structure.
The Commission's views in these various respects were presented
to the interested parties at a conference held a few days prior to the
hearing, and again formally at the hearing on November 18. .As a
result of the Commission's suggestions, the plan was substantially
amended.
The amended plan was approved by the court on December
6, 1938, approximately one month after the Commission had entered
its appearance in the proceeding.
ADVISORY REPORTS ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

.As already noted, the second aspect of the Commission's functions
under Chapter X relates to the submission of advisory reports on
plans of reorganization.
The advisory report serves as an impartial
.survey and critique for the use of the judge in his consideration of
the plan. If the plan is approved by the judge, copies of the report
or summaries thereof prepared by the Commission are submitted
to all those affected by the plan, thus serving also as an aid to
creditors and stockholders in making their decision as to acceptance
or rejection of the plan.

FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

17

It has been noted already that in its capacity as a party the Commission may be actively concerned with every issue arising in a
reorganization proceeding under Chapter X. Throughout such proceeding, it lends assistance and advice as to legal and financial matters
to the court with respect to both the administration of the estate
and the working out of 8 fair, equitable, and feasible plan of reorganization. In this latter connection, the Commission's duties as a party
require it in effect to undertake in every case the same intensive legal
end financial studies which are necessary for-the preparation of formal
advisory reports. The Commission, therefore, seeks to become a
party in every case in which it is expected that plans will be referred
to it for such reports.
On the other hand, the Commission has become
a party in many other cases w.here such reports will be neither required
nor requested, but in which the burden of study and analysi- respecting
plans is in no wise lessened, since the Commission must be prepared
to comment thereon in any event in its capacity as a party.
In
effect, therefore, the Commission performs both of its functions in
all cases in which it participates.
During the past fiscal year, the Commission issued formal advisory
reports in 4 reorganization proceedings.
In 2 other cases during
this period, plans of reorganization were submitted to the Commission
for advisory reports, which reports were in the course of preparation
at the close of the fiscal year. In. more than 20 other cases, the
proceedings had not progressed to a point where the plans therein
could appropriately be referred to the Commission, but it was clear,
in the light of the amount of indebtedness involved, that these must
eventually be submitted for advisory reports.
The four proceedings in which the Commission submitted advisory
reports during the past fiscal year, .were all Section 77B proceedings to
which the judge deemed the application of the provisions of Chapter
X practicable.
Three of these cases involved indebtedness in excess
of $3~OOO,OOO. In the remaining case the indebtedness was less than
this figure and the Commission was requested to file its advisory
report.
There follows a brief discussion of these reports:
, Penn Timber Oompany.-The.I11an in this case provided for gradual
liquidation over a period of years of the debtor's assets, which consisted entirely of timberlands.
It provided for a lO-year extension of
the maturity date of the debtor's first mortgage bonds and, even
though the debtor was admittedly insolvent, for participation in the
new company by stockholders as well as junior creditors.
The Commission, in its report, took the position that the proposed plan was
not feasible because factors affecting the marketability of the timber
indicated that liquidation within the 10-year period could not rea-

18

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE OOMMISSION

sonably be anticipated.
As a consequence, further reorganization at
the expiration of that period appeared likely. The Commission
further pointed out that inasmuch as the probable net proceeds of the
sale of the assets would not exceed the principal and interest accrued
and to accrue on the bonds, any plan providing for participation by
interests junior to bondholders would be unfair. Therefore, the'
Commission concluded that the plan did not meet the statutory and
judicial requirements of fairness and feasibility, and that it should
not receive the approval of the court. At the close of the fiscal year,
the matter was still pending, the court having neither approved nor
disapproved the plan.
Detroit International Bridge Oompany.4-The
plan referred to the
Commission in this proceeding provided for the issuance of common.
stock to holders of bonds and debentures, 92.3 percent to be issued to.
bondholders and 7.7 percent to debenture holders. Although the'
value of the assets was less than the amount due on the first mortgage,
the Commission was of the opinion that the provisions of the plan,
allocating 7.7 percent of the.new comw9.nrstock~f6>debenture holders;
were not unreasonable, it appearing that, at the time the proceedings
were instituted, there was a substantial amount of cash on hand to
which the debenture holders had a claim.
In addition to the common stock to be issued, the plan provided
that present stockholders were to receive warrants entitling them to.
purchase approximately 2 ~
 percent of the common stock of the new
company at twice the anticipated market value of the stock as of the
time of reorganization.
The issuance of warrants was justified in
the plan on the ground that it was desirable to obtain the consent of
stockholders to amendments to the charter of the corporation so as
to avoid possible difficulties which. might arise through the transfer
of the bridge franchise to a new corporation.
It had been intimated,
moreover, that the warrants were of little; if any, value and, therefore; ,
that their issuance was unobjectionable.
The Commission questioned
the advisability of issuing such securities and suggested that if the
benefits to be derived from the issuance of the warrants justified their
inclusion in the plan, consideration be given to restricting their transferability.
The plan was approved by the court on March 27, 1939.

the court, that the debtor was insolvent. The trustees thereafter
filed an amended .plan of,reorgan.ization which provided for the issuance
of

in exchange for their claims. It appearing that the amended plan
was fair and feasible and that the management provisions were
-generally acceptable, the Commission reported favorably on the
amended plan. The plan was approved by the court on March 17,
1939, and thereafter accepted by creditors and confirmed.
(-;riess-Pfleger Tanning Oompany.-The plan in this case provided
for the issuance of $1,540,000 in capital income debentures and 9,240
shares of common stock, to holders.of the $1,540,000 principal amount
-of first'montgage'5l%"'perooli.tl,b0'n""'tl~tOtitStanding,
on which interest had

Holders of 9,875 shares of $100

were to receive 37,031 shares of common stock, and holders of 19,000
shares of $80 par common stock were to receive 4,222 shares of the
new common stock.
The capital income debentures proposed to be issued to first mortgage bondholders. were not to be a.lien on the assets of the new cor1l1~iIh'sof all creditors, present

.and future. The debentures were to mature in 1954, an extension of
15 years, and were to bear contingent interest at a rate varying from
1 percent to 5 percent. They were to be convertible into stock at
-any time in the ratio of one share of stock for each ten dollars of
-debentures.
Although no sinking fund was provided for, the debentures were to be redeemable under certain conditions. Holders of the
'issue, as a class, would be entitled to elect a varying majority of the
'board of directors so long as the amount outstanding exceeded
:$700,000, and a varying minority thereafter.
The Commission expressed the opinion that the debentures were in substance a preferred
stock and that they should be fraWdy labelled .as such. It was further
pointed out that such a security, practically unknown in the public
markets, was' unsound. and.' deceptive. and. would place the initial

The Commission concluded that, in its opinion, the plan was unfair
in that first mortgage bondholders, without being adequately compensated, were required to accept burdensome sacrifices, including
-elimination of accrued interest, reduction in future interest rates,
-elimination of their lien on the debtor's property, subordination of

APPEALS
In the event that appeals by other parties are taken in cases
which the Commission is participating, the Commission is entitled
to appear in the proceedings before the appellate courts. In four of
the cases in which the Commission has participated during the' past
fiscal year, questions were brought before the Circuit Courts of Appeals,
concerning which the Commission submitted briefs expressing its
views, and counsel for the Commission appeared in oral argument,
The appeals in two of the cases were disposed of on grounds which
did not deal directly with the substantive issues involved." In the
other two cases, the opinions of the courts adopted the views urged
by the Commission. Because of the signal importance in reorganization law of the propositions established in these cases,.there is included
below a brief summary of the opinions therein.'

Court indicated that it was following the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals in holding that the provisions of Chapter X should be applied
wherever practicable.
In another phase of this case the Commission participated in an
appeal involving principally the question whether the court could
properly pass upon a plan of reorganization prior to a determination
of solvency or insolvency. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
the decision of the district court and held that solvency or insolvency
must be determined before a plan can be considered. In its opinion
the Circuit Court also indicated its adherence to the "absolute priority" rule in judging the fairness of plans.
The Commission also opposed the granting of intervention in this
proceeding to the various committees participating in the reorganization. The district court denied intervention and such denial was
upheld by the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court held that by
the terms of Chapter X the rights which had previously been accorded only to interveners are now available generally to all parties
in the proceedings, and that therefore, in the absence of a showing of
cause other than a desire to appear generally and to participate in the
proceedings, such parties had no right to intervene.

.A.DMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to compel full and fair disclosure to
investors of material facts regarding securities publicly offered and sold
• in interstate commerce or through the mails. Its provisions are also
designed to prevent fraud in the sale of securities. Issuers of securities
to be publicly offered and sold in interstate commerce are required to file
regiskation statements with the Commission. These registration statements are required to contain specified information on the proposed
offering, and are available for public inspection.

REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
Nature and Effect of Registration.

The Securities Act of 1933 does not confer upon the Commission
the power to approve the merits or value of any security; instead, it
provides for the full and fair disclosure of material facts concerning
securities to be offered publicly for sale and the issuers thereof.
A security may be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 by
fili:Dg with the Commission, on an appropriate form, a registration
staternent meeting the requirements specified in that Act and the
rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
Registration forms have been prescribed by the Commission to meet
the requirements peculiar to various types of securities. In each
case, the form is designed to secure a fair disclosure of material facts
concerning the security proposed to be offered for sale or sold to the
public in order that the investor may be aided in appraising its desirability as an investment. There is filed with each registration statement a prospectus containing the more essential information set
forth in the registration statement.
No offering of the security or
delivery of it after sale may be made in interstate commerce or through
the mails unless accompanied or preceded by such a prospectus.
The registration statement becomes effective on the 20th day 1
after its filing with the Commission, except in certain cases specified
in the Act, so that an investor is thus given a 20-day period in which
to consider facts concerning the proposed security issue before it is
offered for sale. This period also gives a reasonable time for the
Commission to make an examination of the registra tion statement
I

The Commission

adopted,

effective on July 20, 1939, a revision

of Rule ll30 (b) of the General Roles and

Regulations under the l!ecuritles Act of 1933,providlng that such "twentieth day" shall begin immediately
upon the close of business at the Commission at .:30 p. m., Eastern Standard Time, after 19 days from the

for omissions, incomplete disclosures and inaccuracies.
Where an
amendment to a registration statement is filed prior to the effective
date of the registration statement, such amendment has the effect of
establishing a new filing date and starting a new 2o-day period running,
although the _Conu:njssion is given the power to relate the :filing of
the amendment back to the original filing date when such action is
not detrimental to the public interest."
Unless a registration statement under the Act is in effect as to a
security, the security may not (except where an exemption from regi.,tration provided by the Act is available) be publicly offered for sale
or sold in interstate commerce or through the mails. Yet it should
be emphasized that the Act provides that neither the fact that a
registration statement for a security has been filed or is in effect, nor
the fact that a stop order is not in effect with respect to that particular
statement, shall be deemed a finding by the Commission that the
registration statement is true and accurate on its face, .or that it does
not contain an untrue statement of material fact, or a material omission, or be held to mean that the Commission has in any way passed
upon the merits of, or given its approval to, the security.
The statute
makes it a criminal offense to represent otherwise to any prospective
purchaser.
Since the registration statement constitutes a record of
the representations made in connection with the offering, such registration statement serves, where any such representations are false, to
simplify the problem of proof in any legal proceedings which may
result.
Examination of Securities Act Registration Statements.

In an effort to achieve an intelligent and orderly administration of
the Securities Act of 1933 it seemed best, at the beginning, to adopt the
practice of sending to a registrant, whose registration statement upon
examination and analysis discloses any omission or incomplete statement of material facts, a so-called deficiency letter informing the

registrant of the weaknesses appearing in the statement.
come routine procedure, except in unusual cases, to send such let tel
or memorandum to the registrant within approximately 10 days after
the filing of the registration statement, thus affording the registrant
an opportunity to correct the statement by -amendment before the
indicated effective date and before the securities are offered for sale.
While in such cases the deficiency may be corrected ordinarily by the
filing of amendments, there may be instances where it may be necessary first to request the registrant to furnish additional information to
contribute to an understanding of a complicated situation- -In some
instances, discussions with the registrant-may iead. to a discoverg that,

the light of additional facts developed.
Clearly, however, the result
of the procedure of thus pointing out informally to the registrant what
appear to be material misrepresentations or omissions in the information filed with the Commission, rather than the alternative of allowing
the defective statement to become effective and then either having
the security sold upon such misrepresentations
or instituting stop
order proceedings, constitutes not only fair treatment of the registrants, but also serves the main purpose of the Act which is to insure
that investors have the opportunity of exercising intelligent judgment
based upon fair disclosure of the facts concerning the enterprise.
The same procedure followed in the examination and analysis of
registration statements is used for amendments to registration statements and annual reports supplemental thereto filed by registrants
subject to the Securities Act of 1933 under the conditions specified in
Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Disclosures Resulting from Examination.

The following brief summaries of a few actual cases will give some
indication of the nature of typical fair disclosures of material information resulting from the Commission's examination of registration
statements:
(1) Intangible assets reduced by $250,OOO.-The total assets shown
on the balance sheet of a registrant engaged in manufacturing aggregated $776,626 of which $708,589 was shown under the caption
"Intangibles" in an account titled "Development of Aviation Devices
and Licenses."
An investigation of this intangible item disclosed
that approximately $425,000 only had been expended by the registrant
and its predecessor on such devices and licenses and that an attempt
had been made to capitalize approximately $150,000 spent by the
United States Government in the late 1920's, that is, long before the
formation of the registrant's predecessor.
Furthermore, an attempt
had been made to capitalize approximately $130,000 which represented work orders given the registrant's predecessor by the United
States Government.
The propriety of capitalizing expenditures by
others on devices similar to those of the registrant and of capitalizing
orders for products was questioned, and, as a result, the registrant
reduced its assets $250,000 by reducing the intangible account by
such amount and at the same time decreased the amount of capital
stock issued to its predecessor from 150,000 to 100,000 shares.
(2) Property depreciation increased by 1825,OOO.-The registeation
statement filed by an oil and gas producing company included a report
by an independent oil expert in which it was stated that the depreciation provisions in respect of intangible drilling costs were inadequate
to amortize such costs over the useful life of the property. The
income account reflected charges of approximately $186,000, $339,00@,
and $329,000 during the years 1936, 1937, and 1938, respeetinly.,

26

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

relating to property dismantled and retired and against which depreciation had not been provided.
In a conference with the registrant's representatives
and the independent oil expert, the latter
indicated the rate which he considered would be adequate for the
purpose of computing depreciation.
As a result of this conference,
the registrant amended its balance sheet and income statements to
reflect an additional provision of $825,000 for depreciation.
Of this
amount, approximately $424,000 was charged to earned surplus as
at the beginning of the 3-year period and approximately $116,500,
$131,000, and $144,000 was provided out of income for the years
1936, 1937, and 1938, respectively.

(3) Item of $1,277,088.34 bond discount eliminated.-From

an ex-

amination of the registration statement filed under the Securities
Act of 1933 by a utility company, it appeared that the property
accounts included an amount of $1,277,083.34, representing the discount on the sale to an affiliate of certain bonds which the registrant
had issued to the affiliate for certain physical properties.
The bonds
had been redistributed by the affiliated company at the abovementioned discount.
There appeared to be no justification for carrying this discount in the property accounts and the registrant was
so advised. The registrant amended its balance sheet to eliminate
the amount involved from the property accounts and to charge off
against earned surplus at the beginning of the three-year period, and
against inco;me for each of the three annual periods under review, a
pro rata amount of the discount in question.
The unamortized
portion of the discount at the balance sheet date, namely $893,958.34,
was shown as a separate item and appropriately
captioned and
classified on the amended balance sheet.
(4) Hazards oj enterprise disclos6d.-A registrant, which with its
predecessor had been engaged in the manufacture of automobiles
over 20 years, filed a registration statement covering an offering of
$600,000 of stock, accompanied by a prospectus which failed to disclose clearly certain important features of the company's future plans.
After an investigation, during the course of which an engineer and
an attorney of the Commission inspected the registrant's plant and
physical assets and examined its future plans, substantial amendments were made. The amended prospectus reveals under a caption
entitled "Present Hazards of the Enterprise" that, due to circumstances beyond the control of the issuer, it is possible the necessary
working capital will not be procured, that future production of cars
for the latter and other reasons might be considerably hampered, that
the future of the company is wholly dependent on the ability of the
management successfully to manufacture and.sell a different type of
car from that made by it in the past, and with its limited resources
the comp~y will be unable to conduct any extensive advertising

FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

27

campaign for the sale of this new type of car. The facing sheet of
the amended prospectus contains a statement that the shares are
offered "solely as a speculation."
(5) Implication oj continued gold production eliminated.-In a registration statement .filed by a mining company, it was stated, in effect,
that (1) the company was engaged in prospecting, exploration, and
development; (2) the mine workings consisted of workings on several
levels down to the 600-foot level; (3) the property was equipped with
a mill'capable of treating 100 tons of ore per day; and (4) gold bullion
was being recovered at the rate of about $25,000 per month, it being
the hope of the management to maintain this rate of production.
Upon examination of the maps and other information supplied with
the registration statement, it appeared that the nature of the undertaking was not accurately reflected in the statement and the registrant was notified of the particular items of the statement which
appeared to be deficient or misleading.
The registrant thereupon amended its registration statement to
show that (1) the mineral values became progressively impoverished
with depth below the 200 foot level, the veins being non-commercial
where exposed on the bottom level; (2) "The construction of the mill
may not have been warranted by the extent of the known ore, and
may not be warranted by the amounts of ore presently indicated;"
and (3) "* * * the registrant feels that it may have no reasonable
ground to believe that the recent rate of production can be maintained over a substantial period."
(6) Dim profit possibilities revealed-Investors wouldjurnish 93% oj
cash capital jor 11% oj voting rights.-A registration statement, as
originally filed by a mining company, proposed the public sale of
stock amounting to approximately $1,650,000 for the purchase and
operation of a gold placer mining dredge. It was stated that preliminary results, according to the company's officials and engineers, indicated the existence of vast deposits of gold bearing material from
which exceptional profits would be realized. Upon examination of
the registration statement, it appeared that substantial amendments
and clarifications were required, and the deficiencies noted were
pointed out to the registrant in conferences and by correspondence.
The registration statement, as subsequently amended, states that
success for the undertaking involves the successful completion of two
stages: (1) the exploration for and discovery of adequate gold deposits
of commercial value, and (2) if and when such deposits are developed,
the provision of extractive equipment and operating capital of an
estimated cost in excess of $1,000,000. It was also disclosed that no
deposits of substantial value had yet been discovered, and that actual
operations involved numerous difficulties because of the physicallocation of the property. The first stage of the undertaking was stated

28

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

to require a minimum expenditure of approximately $155,000, at
which time the investing public would have contributed about 93
percent of the cash capital in return for 11 percent of the entire voting
rights. If substantial deposits were not discovered by the expenditure of such funds and the venture was terminated, it appeared that
"all funds put into the project.would be lost." The second stage,
contingent upon the discoveries of the first, would involve the public
contribution of approximately 98 percent of the cash capital in
return for 38 percent of the voting rights. The remainder or 62 percent of control would be vested entirely with the promoters. Further
disclosure was made that, according to preliminary indications at the
present time, approximately 27 years of commercial operations would be
required to repay the original offering price of shares to an investor.
Statistics of Securities Registered.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, there were 3,740 registration
statements on file, of which 2,9433 were effective, 153 were under
stop or refusal order, and 578 had been withdrawn, while 66 3 were
under examination or held pending the receipt of amendments.
During the period July 1, 1938, to June 30, 1939, inclusive, 375
registration statements were filed, and there were 359 registration
statements which became effective during the period (of which all
but 25 were fully effective) j a total of 3,249 statements were effective
at the end of the period, 53 of those effective at the beginning of the
period or during the period having been either withdrawn or placed
under stop order.
The net number of registration statements withdrawn increased
by 69 to a total of 647 on June 30, 1939. The net number of stop or
refusal orders increased during the period by 6, a total of 159 of such
orders being in effect on June 30, 1939. As of June 30, 1939, there
were 60 registration statements in the process of examination or

Appendix III identifies by name the registrant and indicates the
aggregate dollar amount of the proposed offering involved in the case
of each registration statement as to which stop orders, consent refusal
orders, and withdrawal orders were issued during the year.
A total of 1,275 amendments t-o registration statements were also
filed during the past fiscal year requiring examination by the Commission.' The corresponding number of amendments filed during
the 1938 fiscal year was 1,815.5
There were also filed during the year a total of 172 annual reports
and 66 amendments thereto by certain registrants pursuant to Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, re-quiring examination. These figures compare with figures for the previous fiscal year of 150 6 reports and 62 amendments to reports.
In addition, the following figures show the volume of certain supplemental prospectus material filed during the past fiscal year under
the Securities Act of 1933: (1) 328 prospectuses were filed pursuant
to Rule 800 (b) which requires the filing of such information within
-5 days after the commencement of the public offering; (2) 244 sets of
supplemental prospectus material were filed by registrants to show
material changes occurring after the commencement of the offering;
.and (3) 413 sets of so-called 13-month prospectuses were filed purauant to Section 10 (b) (1) of the Act. Thus during the past fiscal
year there were filed in the aggregate 985 additional prospectuses of
these 3 classes.
At the same time, 259 supplementary statements of actual offering
price were filed as required by Rule 970; and there were 41 instances
where registrants voluntarily filed supplemental financial data.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939, registrations for $2,494,000,000 of securities 7 became effective under the Securities Act of
1933. This compares with a total of $1,912,000,000 for the previous
fiscal year and $4,687,000,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1937.
Of the total of $2,494,000,000 of securities registered during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1939, $2,052,000,000 was proposed for sale
by issuers. Approximately one-half, or $1,008,000,000, of this
.amount represented issues of electric and gas utility companies.
Manufacturing companies with $575,000,000, or 28 percent of the
total, were next in importance. Securities of financial and investment companies totalled $309,000,000, or 15 percent of the total.

In the preceding fiscal year registrations of reorganization and exchange securities covered securities valued
.at $193.000,000as well as the guarantee of one issue.

30

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Approximately three-fourths of the effectively registered securities
proposed for sale by issuers consisted of fixed interest-bearing securities which aggregated $1,581,000,000. Included in this total were$907,000,000 of secured bonds, or 44 percent of the-total, and $674,000,000 of debentures and short term notes, or 33 percent of thetotal. Common stock ranked next in importance among the various.
types of securities with $191,000,000, or 9 percent of the total, followed by certificates of participation with $168,000,000, or 8 percent,
and preferred stock with $112,000,000, or almost 6 percent. Thus all
equity financing combined amounted to slightly less than one-fourth
of total registrations.
A detailed breakdown of the registration statistics for the fiscal yearended June 30, 1939 shows that 316 statements for 487 issues became
effective in the gross amount of $2,494,000,000. Of this total, however, $442,000,000 represented securities not proposed for sale by
issuers. Among the larger items representing securities not proposed
for sale by issuers were $215,000,000 of securities reserved for conversion, $101,000,000 of securities to be issued in exchange for othersecurities, $68,000,000 of securities registered for account of others,.
$47,000,000 of securities reserved for other subsequent issuance, and
$10,000,000 of securities reserved for exercise of options. The remaining amount of $1,000,000 consisted of securities to be issued
against claims, for other assets and as compensation for selling and
distributing services.
There remained after these various deduction items $2,052,000,000
of securities proposed for sale by issuers. The total compensation to
he paid underwriters and agents on these securities was $61,000,000,.
or approximately 2.9 percent of expected gross proceeds. Otherselling and distributing expenses aggregated $13,000,000, or 0.6 percent
of gross proceeds.
Indicated net proceeds to accrue to issuers after all selling and
distributing expenses amounted to $1,978,000,000. Some 62 percent
of these net proceeds was'to be applied for repayment of indebtedness
and retirement of preferred stock. Repayment of indebtedness alone
amounted to $1,135,000,000, or 57 percent of net proceeds, and retirement of preferred stock to $105,000,000, or 5 percent. Net proceeds
to be applied for expenditures for plant and equipment totalled
$264,000,000, or 13 percent of the total, and for increase of working
capital $153,000,000, or 8 percent. Therefore, indicated expenditures
for these new money purposes aggregated slightly more than one-fifth
of total net proceeds. The amount to he expended for purchase of
securities for investment was $265,000,000, or 13 percent of net
proceeds.

The great bulk of effectively registered securities proposed for sale
by issuers was to be offered through underwriters.
A total of
$1,580,000,000, or 77 percent of the total, was to be offered through
underwriters, as compared with $390,000,000, or 19 percent, to be
offered through agents, and $82,000,000, or 4 percent, to be offered
directly by issuers. The amount of securities to be offered to the
public aggregated $1,695,000,000, or 83 percent of the total, with
offerings to security holders amounting to $251,000,000, or 12 percent,
and offerings to all others $106,000,000, or 5 percent.

quoted above, it should be kept in mind that these statistics are based
solely on the registration statements filed by the registrants with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Therefore, all the data refer
to the registrants' intentions and estimates as they appear in the

represent statistics of intentions to sell securities rather than statistics
of actual sales of securities,"

registrations reflect only registrants' intentions to sell securities, the
statistics of new offerings include only actual offerings. Comprehensive statistics of new cash offerings of securities for the period
July 1, 1934, through June 30, 1939, are presented in tables 10 and 11
of Appendix V. The tables show the estimated gross proceeds of
issues offered for sale, classified by type of offering, type of security r
and type of issuer,"
In general, the data cover only such issues over $100,000 in amount,
and (for debt issues) of a maturity of 1 year or over at date of issuance'
as were reported as offered for cash in the financial press, in documents:
filed with the Commission, or in other available sources. The statistics include offerings irrespective of whether the issues were publicly
or privately placed, and regardless of whether or not they wereregistered under the Securities Act of 1933. The statistics of new
offerings thus embrace certain corporate and non-corporate issuinggroups exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933either by virtue of the nature of the transaction or issuer, chiefly
securities of common carriers, most issues placed privately, and
Federal, State, and local governmental issues.
According to these tables, $6,919,000,000 of new issues of securities.
was offered for cash during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939, compared to $3,484,000,000 during the preceding year, $7,639,000,000 in
the fiscal year ended June 30,1937, $11,265,000,000 in the fiscal yearended June 30, 1936, and $3,768,000,000 in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1935. Of the $6,919,000,000 issues floated during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1939, $2,552,000,000 was issued by corporations,
$2,939,000,000 by the United States Government and, Agencies,
$1,326,000,000 by states and municipalities, $83,000,000 by foreign
governments (sold in this country), and $19,000,000 by eleemosynary
institutions.
Of the corporate securities offered, public utility
companies were the largest issuers, comprising 59 percent of the total,
The principal instrument of flotation was the fixed-interest-bearingsecurity, 97 percent of total securities (corporate and non-corporate)
having the form of bonds, notes, or debentures.
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS

Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, authorizes
the Commission to provide by rules and regulations conditional
exemptions from the registration requirements under that Act for
certain small issues. Specifically, these exemptions may be provided
only where the public offering does not involve an aggregate amount of
more than $100,000. Acting, under this authority, the Commission

has adopted Regulation A, governing such exemptions other than
those relating to oil and gas interests; Regulation B, covering exemptions pertaining to fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights;
and Regulation B-T, providing exemptions of interests in an oil
royalty trust or similar type of trust or unincorporated association.
During the past fiscal year there were received and examined a total
of 179 prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 202 of Regulation A.
These prospectuses related to exempted issues (exclusive of oil and
gas offerings), which represented mainly stocks and involved a total
offering price of $13,352,323. The individual issues ranged in
aggregate offering price from a low amount of $10,000 to the maximum
possible amount of $100,000. The decline in the filing of these prospectuses, compared with the number received during the 1938 fiscal
year (353 prospectuses involving a grand total offering price of
$26,827,793) appears to be due largely to the greater use being made
of the newer exemption available under Rule 210 of Regulation A.
Also, during the past fiscal year, there were filed with the Commission, under Rules 202,203, and 210 of Regulation A, 52 prospectuses
and numerous amendments to correct deficiencies in the prospectuses
as originally filed, relating to exempted issues of oil and gas offerings.
The aggregate offering, as disclosed by the prospectuses, amounted
to $3,427,816.
As one of several measures adopted temporarily by the Commission
to aid small business enterprises in raising capital, Rule 210 of Regulation A was, on February 25, 1939, continued in effect until further
action by the Commission. This indefinite extension will afford the
Commission further opportunity to study the results of the operation
of this rule in the light of a proposed complete revision of all exemptions provided under Regulation A. The Commission received and
examined under Rule 210 during the year a total of 284 letters of
notification for issues involving a total amount of $20,958,450, the
aggregate amount of individual issues ranging from $7,000 to the
maximum possible amount of $100,000.
In addition to the indefinite extension of Rule 210 and work on
the proposed complete revision of all exemptions provided u'nder
Regulation A, the Commission took other steps during the year in
its effort to ascertain how the requirements may be revised so that
particularly the small business enterprises will find the raising of
new capital easier and less expensive. These additional measures
include an indefinite extension of Amendment No. 32 to the Instruction Book for Form A-2, which amendment, originally adopted at
the same time as Rule 210 during the latter part of the 1938 fiscal
year, widens the scope of Form A-2 and permits the omission of
certain financial data in specified instances. Also, the work of the

34

,

special unit, created in the Registration Division to aid prospective
registrants and advise them and their representatives on any problems
which may arise in connection with their registration statements, has
been continued throughout the year and is being extended indefinitely.
As before stated, Regulation B of the General Rules and Regulations
under 'the Securities Act of 1933, pertains to exemptions relating to
fractlonal undivided interests ill oil or gas rights. During the past
fiscal year, 1,607 offering sheets, as well as 633 amendments thereto,
were :filed with the Commission pursuant to Regulation B and examined. The aggregate offering' price of the securities described
thereunder was approximately $25,000,000. The following statistics

"Efforts to Improve the Disciplinary Procedure of the New York Stock Exchange
and the Business Practices of its Members.
'

On March 8, 1938, Richard Whitney & Company, a member firm
of the New York Stock Exchange, was suspended from membership
on that Exchange because of insolvency.' This Commission hnmediately instituted a preliminary investigation. On April 6, '1938, the
Commission commenced public hearings to determine the facts and
circumstances antecedent to, and culminating in, the failure of that
firm. The hearings in In the matter of Richard Whitney et 01., continued
until June 29, 1938.
At the very outset of the Commission's investigation into the
Whitney failure, it became apparent that fundamental revision 6f
out-moded brokerage practices and a clear reversal of the traditional
viewpoint of certain reactionary but important elements of the
financial community must be immediately brought about if there
were to be even partial assurance that such a catastrophe would not
again occur. This need for increased protection to customers, and the
equally important need that the New York Stock Exchange should no
longer be managed and regarded as a private club but as a public
institution with important public obligations, became. increasingly
apparent as the shocking circumstances of the Whitney failure were
unfolded during the hearings.
Therefore, the Commission and the new management of the New
York Stock Exchange undertook a joint reappraisal of the whole problam of increasing protection to customers' funds and securities. In
partioular, this study sought definite remedies for the shortcomings of

with William McC. Martin, Jr., president of the New York Stock
Exchange, and certain other representatives of that Exchange.
These conferences, begun in June of 1938, were continued at frequent
intervals during the summer and fall of the past year. Although the
statutory powers of the Commission were also reexamined in the light
of the Whitney case, these discussions primarily emphasized the need
for self-regulatory steps which the Exchange itself might take, rather
than direct intervention by the Commission under its rules and regulations. Thus, insofar as possible, the Commission continued to play
its residual regulatory role and to encourage self-re'form within the
Exchange.
Reorganization of the New York Stock.Exchange and the New York Curb Exchange.

During the preceding fiscal year, which ended June 30, 1938, all
of the more important phases of reorganization of the New York
Stock Exchange proceeded." This improvement of the administration
of that Exchange was the outcome of the recommendations made by
an independent committee appointed for the purpose of making a
study and report on the need for such a reorganization, which was
headed by Carle C. Conway, Chairman of the Board of Directors of
the Continental Can Company. During the past fiscal year, the Commission has continued its collaboration with the new management of
the New York Stock Exchange, installed in the spring of 1938, in
carrying out some of the remaining details of the reorganization
program recommended by. the so-called "Conway Committee."
.Among important steps which were taken was the amendment of the
Exchange's Constitution on January 1, 1939, classifying as "allied
members" all general partners of member firms who do not individually
hold seats on the Exchange. This measure resulted in an extension
of the direct disciplinary powers of the Exchange, formerly limited to
individual members, to all general partners of its member firms. On
September 28, 1938, the N ew York Stock Exchange, in accordance with
its revised constitution, elected Messrs. Carle C. Conway, Robert E.
Wood and Robert M. Hutchins to serve on its Board of Governors
until May, 1939, as representatives of the general public:'

The New York Curb Exchange also found itself faced with sub-

stantielly the same problems that had confronted the N ew York Stock
Exchange. Accordingly, during the past fiscal year, that Exchange
was likewise encouraged to address itself to the need for internal
reorganization for the purpose of more properly performing its
obligations to the investing public. On August 31; 1938, a Special
Committee on Organization and Administration rendered its final
report recommending certain moderate revisions in the organization
'Of the New York Curb Exchange. These recommendations were
considered inadequate and on October 4, 1938, and subsequent to a
series of conferences between certain of its representatives and
officials of the Commission, the Board of Governors of the N ew York
Curb Exchange adopted a plan of reorganization considerably more
far reaching than had been the earlier proposals of its Special Committee. The reorganization, as advocated by the Board of Governors
and adopted with but one dissenting vote, effective February 23,1939,
reclessified the constituency of the Board and altered the nominating
procedure so as to give a more equitable representation to members
-and partners of member firms doing business directly with the public,
to out-of-town firms, and to the public itself. Under this reorganization the constitution of the N ew York Curb Exchange, like the new
constitution of the N ew York Stock Exchange, provided for three
non-member governors to sit as representatives of the general public.
Among other things, the Board of Governors also proposed and rec-ommended the study of a central trust institution or brokerage bank
to protect the securities and funds of customers through the assumption of the banking and custodial functions now performed by brokers
in connection with the brokerage business. On April 20, 1939,
George P. Rea was elected president of the New York Curb Exchange.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1939, officials of the Commis-sion have also conferred with representatives of certain other national
securities exchanges in an effort to assist in a reconstruction of their
internal organizations in the interests of more efficient supervision of
their members' practices and the better protection of the investing
public.
Self-Policing by National Securities Exchanges-The Whitney Report.

In the administration of those phases of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, which affect the internal functioning of securities ex-changes and the business practices of their members, the Commission
-eontinued the polioy of encouraging self-policing by the brokerage
.and investment banking industries during the past fiscal year.
, National securities exchanges already have disciplinary machinery
which can be very. useful in protecting the public interest, particularly
with respect to activities not ,directly regulated by statute.
The

38

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Commission continuously has urged the exchanges to exercise their
disciplinary powers in a way to provide. adequate protection of the
investing public with respect to these matters outside of our statutory
standards of conduct.
There are many fields of activity which, under the statute, the
Commission may police by or through the promulgation of its own
rules and regulations. With respect to many of these areas, the Commission has sought to playa residual role with the thought,.thtW:~
exchanges would adopt and enforce adequate self-regulatory and selfdisciplinary measures. To the extent that the exchanges do not
foster such protection to the public, the Commission will, of course,
be forced itself to take direct remedial steps. With respect to those
aspects of the securities business which by law the Commission is
directed to supervise and regulate, we have in many instances assumed
our primary role and obligations in the enforcement of the Act. In
other instances the Commissionis proceedingwith its studies and with
discussionswith the industry to the end of promulgating rules which
will be practicable as well as efficaciousin their operation.
In the past, the organization and administration of securities
exchanges have not always been conducive to adequate protection of
the investing public. In fact, it was the failure of the financial
community to recognize its paramount public obligations which
necessitated first the Securities Act of 1933,and later the creation of
this Commissionfor the purpose of administering that Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other federal legislation relating to
financial matters.
Since the two major exchanges have adopted the framework of
reorganization, the Commission through periodic conferenceswith
exchange officialshas sought to carry forward the program of selfdiscipline the necessity for which was indicated so clearly by the
failure of Richard Whitney & Company in 1938.
As noted, the conferences of the summer and fall of 1938 between
the Commissionand representatives of the New York Stock Exchange
sought methods of preventing other brokerage failures similar to the
Whitney case. This joint study of the problem of adequately protecting brokers' customers gave rise to the recommendations set
forth in Part II of the Commission'sreport on its investigation in the
matter of Richard Whitney et al. This particular portion of that
report presents immediate remedial measures which both the Exchange
and the Commission proposed to adopt in a joint effort to control
the major sources of danger to customers' funds and securities. Accordingly, on October 26, 1938,a thirteen-point program of immediate
safeguards was adopted and announced by the Board of Governors
of the New York Stock Exchange, in cooperation With this Commission, and the text thereof included in Part II of the Whitney Report.

FIFTH

39

ANNUAL REPORT' ,

Briefly, the .New York Stock Exchange Program: of October 26,
1938,~ proposed to permit and encourage' its member firms to organize
"affiliated companies" which would carry on dealer and 'underwriting
activities separately from brokerage activities in order to reduce the
risks to customers inherent in the present combination of the brokerage
with the dealer business within the same organization.'
This program
9180 provided
for an-increase in the number of members' periodic
financial'statements
and for-en ennual-audit 'by independent accountants of all member :firms doing business with the public. The extent
and frequency of the Exchange's surprise examinations of its member
:firms and partners were to be increased.
The minimum capital
requirements to be met by member :firms were to be strengthened and
methods were to be studied whereby, to some extent at least, customers
might be insulated against the risks incident to the dealer business
conducted by many brokerage :firms for their own' account.
This
program further provided that all members, member firms, and
partners, with certain exceptions, must report to: the Exchange all
substantial loans. Furthermore, with but minor exceptions, all loans
by and between officials of the Exchange and its members were to be
prohibited.
Weekly information as to underwriting positions was
also to be filed with the Exchange by its members.
Finally, the
Exchange undertook to study the feasibility of a central securities
depository which the President of the Exchange had then anticipated
could serve as the first step toward the ultimate formation of a
"Central Trust Institution" or "Brokerage Bank."
Such a brokerage
bank would constitute a depository into which customers' credit
balances and securities could be placed and thus be wholly removed
from the hazards of brokerage involvences to which they are now
subjected by the present fusion of brokerage with banking functions.
Progress of the New York Stock Exchange's Program of October '26, 1938.

The series of conferences which had culminated in the New York
Stock Exchange's self-regulatory Program of October 26, 1938, were
continued throughout the past fiscal year in order that this program
could be achieved through discussion of appropriate enabling rules
of the Exchange.
Various aspects of the proposal to insulate brokerage :firms and their customers from the financial risks of the dealer and
underwriting businesses were also discussed at length.
During the
late spring of 1939, the Exchange held open hearings upon the proposal to permit, and eventually: to require, the formation of affiliated
limited liability corporations which would take,,,over the trading,
dealer, and underwriting activities from brokerage :firms with a con• ThIs program appears verbatlm,ln Appendix

sequent lessening of the'danger to brokerage customers.
Other than
this, however, by the close of the past fiscal year, the Exchange had
taken no steps -to permit, or to encourage, the formation of such
affiliated dealer corporations.
The revised capital requirements which, under the program, were
to limit members' aggregate indebtedness. to an amount not in excess
of 1,500 percent of the firm's net capital were discussed also and the
many technical. problems and differences of opinion were ironed out
ultimately in the course of a series of round table conferences. The
Exchange's new capital requirements, including technical definitions
of.the terms "aggregate indebtedness" and "net capital," were adopted
by the Exchange, effective April 1, 1939. The technical and accounting phases of the Exchange's requirements are similar in most fundamentals to the tentative drafts of rules under Section 8 (b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relating to brokerage solvency which
were then under study by the Commission. Thus, the operation of the
Exchange's capital requirements has afforded, and will continue to
afford, a valuable basis of actual experience in the light of which the
Commission can estimate accurately the practical operation of certain
of the fundamental principles which it believes should be embodied
in its own rules directed toward preservation of brokerage solvency,
Another difficult problem which was eventually solved at these
continuing conferences was that of effectuating the principle that
neither brokerage firms nor general partners thereof who do business
with the public should be permitted to trade in securities on margin.
On June 28, 1939, the Board of Governors of the New York Stock
Exchange adopted Rule 616 which, with certain exceptions, prevents
margin trading by those serving the public as fiduciaries. The ban
against margin trading seeks to mitigate, so far as possible, the risks
to customers which in the past were created by speculation of brokerage firms and their partners.
The remaining items of the Program
of October 26 were likewise effectuated only after conferences between
the Commission and the Exchange had worked out the many inevitable technical difficulties.
Brokerage Banks.

The Commission's increasing realization of the dangers to customers
inherent in the present combination' of brokerage with banking
functions, the possibilities of which were so tellingly illustrated by
the failure of Richard Whitney & Company, brought it to the conclusion that full protection to customers necessitated either the complete separation of these functions or the imposition of safeguards
upon the broker's banking function .comparable to those wliiCli"apply
to banks. Rules which do no more than prohibit misconduct or
practices jeopardizing the funds and securities of cUljlto!llel'Scal}-repre-

sent no more than an imperfect approach toward that measure of
protection which the Commission feels to be both necessary and
"feasible. Rules and regulations, like the law, can always be violated.
'The science of detection is as yet far from an exact science, as shown
not only by the Whitney case but, more recently, by the Elfast Frisk &
Company case 6 with its disclosure of the mishandling of accounts.
Therefore, the Commission believes that the complete safeguard to
customers' credit balances and securities must lie either in the sep.aration of banking risks from the brokerage business or some equally
effective assurance of the safety of customers' cash deposits and
securities.
As stated by the Commission in Part II of the Whitney Report, the
banking business done by brokers involves customers' funds and
securities estimated as totalling more than three billion dollars. Notwithstanding the recent increase in the regulation which the New
York Stock Exchange has imposed upon its own members the banking
business of the broker, with its concomitant use of customers' credit
balances and repledging of customers' securities by brokers, is still
unsupervised as a banking business by the State or Federal Government. Following close upon the disclosures in the "Whitney case, in
May 1938, William O. Douglas, then Chairman of the Commission,
proposed to the brokerage fraternity the establishment of a "Central
Trust Institution" which would take over from brokers all the banking and credit functions which they now exercise. It was antieipated that the establishment of such a trust institution would result
in substantial economies to the industry as a whole through centralized bookkeeping and the clearance and settlement of transactions
by bookkeeping entry rather than by physical delivery. But it is
most important to note that such an institution, by its very assumption of the banking activities of the broker, would wholly isolate customers from the varied hazards of brokerage insolvency. Therefore,
in Part II of the Whitney Report, the establishment of such trust institutions or "brokerage banks" was unequivocally advocated. Again,
on June 23, 1939, Jerome N. Frank, present Chairman of the Commission, publicly urged that the problem of establishing "brokerage
banks" or providing equally effective substitute safeguards for customers be immediately attacked and solved by the financial community.
It was then the sincere hope of the Commission that prompt progress
would, be made by the New York Stock Exchange and other representatives of brokerage interests towards the establishment of "brok. 'The expU\SionoUlenry C. ElfBStfrom membership on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 1939,

All such amendments were promptly examined

FIFTH

'relevant legislation and regulations, but also to the end that appropriate comments and suggestionscould be addressed to the exchanges
.concerned in order to facilitate the performance of their public
.obligations.
REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934 PRIMARILY DIRECTED TO NATIONAL SECURITIES
EXCHANGES, THEIR MEMBERS, OR NON-MEMBER BROKERS AND
DEALERS TRANSACTING A BUSINESS IN SECURITIES THROUGH
THE MEDIUM OF SUCH MEMBERS
Ffnanclal Safeguards.

In general, Section 8 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
provides for the adoption by the Commiss1onof rules which will
increase the margin of solvency which must at all times be maintained
by brokers and dealers, whether members of national securities ex-changes or nonmembers transacting business through the medium of
exchange members. More specifically, the statute authorizes the
Oornmission to :fix a maximum ratio between a broker's aggregate
indebtedness and his net capital, which in any event cannot exceed
'20 to L Subsection (c) of Section 8 of the statute further authorizes
the Commission to promulgate rules and regulations governing the
'COmminglingand the hypothecation of customers' securities. Section
17 of the Act authorizes the promulgation of rules governing the character and extent of books and records which must be maintained and
kept by members and other brokers and dealers. Rules and regulations which may be promulgated under these three portions of the
Act would constitute an integrated body of regulation directed toward
the preservation of the solvency of brokerage houses and the safeguarding, in other respects, of customers' securities and credit balances
carried by brokerage houses.
Although the Commission has exhaustively studied the problems
which exist in the effectuation of these basic provisions of the statute
and has considered numerous drafts of rules which might be promulgated thereunder, the situation prevailing during the past fiscal
year made promulgation of such rules inappropriate. As previously
stated, the Commission, in June of 1938, was engaged in joint consideration with officialsof the New York Stock Exchange to determine
those respects in which the Exchange might itself take appropriate
protective measures to safeguard customers of its member firms.
This consideration resulted in the program of reforms adopted by
that Exchange on October 26, 1938, and embodied in Part II of the
Commission's report in the matter of Richard Whitney et al, Thereafter, the general principles enunciated in the Exchange's Program
remained to be 'put in effective operation. Consequently, the joint
consideration by the Commission and officials of the Exchange was

44

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

continued in order to solve the additional problems-more
detailed,
more technical, but nevertheless difficult-which were involved in thedrafting of definite Exchange rules. The joint efforts of the Commission and the Exchange to effectuate the latter's program thus
entailed negotiations and conferences which extended to the close of
the past fiscal year.
The New York Stock Exchange's program of October 26, 1938, and,
the rules which it has adopted thereunder, constitute at least an
interim approach toward these objectives of customer protection.
With this evidence of a liberal approach by brokerage and exchange
interests toward the problem of better protection of customers, the
Commission has withheld its own rules and regulations in the hopethat the financial community would itself undertake thorough-going
measures to achieve with greater flexibility and, if possible, to B;
greater extent those objectives to which Sections 8 (b), 8 (c), and 17
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are directed. .As of the closeof the past fiscal year, the proposal for the establishment of a central
trust institution or of some equally adequate alternative for safeguarding customers' funds and securities was still pending. However,
unless an adequate solution is otherwise reached, eliminating wholly
or satisfactorily mitigating the present risks to customers, the Com-mission will be forced to act through the exercise of its own regulatory
powers. Tentative drafts of the Commission's rules and regulationshave already been discussed informally with representatives of theindustry in order that, when necessary, such rules and regulations.
may be promulgated promptly.
Short Selling Rules.

During the past year, upon the recommendation of the New York:
Stock Exchange and following conferences with its President, William
McC. Martin, Jr., and other officials, the Commission modified its,
rules governing short selling on national securities exchanges. It
was the view of the Exchange that the amendment would providegreater freedom of market action in accumulating short positions.
when market trends were generally upward, but nevertheless would
retain effective restraints on short selling.
.
The Commission's short selling rules originally in effect had permitted a short sale of a security at a price above its last sale price.
The amendment, however, permits short sales at the price of the last
sale, provided that the last sale price was itself higher than the last
different price which preceded it.
In order to determine whether international arbitrage transactions
should be exempted from the Commission's short selling rule, a study
of international arbitrage operations in their relation to short selling
was undertaken during the course of the year. Mter considering the
report submitted as a result of this study, the Commission also added

. FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

45

an exemption applicable to certain short sales made in the course of
international arbitrage which are of a true arbitrage nature, that is,
transactions in which a short position is taken on one exchange which
is to be immediately covered on a foreign market. Thus the' exemption is available only where the market effect of a.domestic short sale
is intended to be immediately neutralized by the covering purchase
on a different market.
From time to time, members of the Commission's staff have dis.
cussed with representatives of the exchanges rumors that the Commission's short selling rules were being evaded by persons placing their
orders through European correspondents of domestic brokers. As a
result of these discussions, the N ew York Stock Exchange presently
requires its members to report periodically any transactions of this
nature which come to their attention.
The Commission also created an exemption applicable in certain
types of situations where a short sale was made, because of a bona
fide error.
Pegging, Fixing, and Stabilizing of Security Prices.

On July 1, 1938, the Commission sent to various groups of the
financial community a draft of comprehensive rules under Section
9 (a) (6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, regulating the pegging,
fixing, and stabilizing of prices of registered securities to facilitate distributions of the same or related securities. During the summer and
fall of the past fiscal year, the Commission continued discussion of this
draft and several subsequent drafts of these rules with representativesof the underwriting and brokerage interests. The later drafts embraced stabilizing of unregistered securities to facilitate public offerings
of over-the-counter issues as well as stabilization of securities registered on national securities exchanges. However, the series of conferences held with respect to the tentative drafts of such inclusive
rules indicated the existence of difficult fundamental problems some
of which arose from the many differences between trading on exchanges
and, trading in the over-the-counter markets as maintained by thevarious security dealers and trading houses, and the inability of the
two groups to' reconcile their differences up to the present time.
The Commissiori then determined that before taking further steps
it would be de'sirable to acquire additional detailed knowledge of the
varied practices and techniques employed to stabilize unregistered as
well as registered securities to facilitate their distribution, knowledge
of the precise interrelationships between stabilization and the success
or failure of the accompanying distribution, and knowledge of the
price characteristics and market behavior of stabilized issues under
varying circumstances. On February 9,1939, the Commission adopted
two related rules for the several purposes of.acquiring this data, aiding

46

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

in the enforcement of the anti-manipulation
sections of the ,Acts, and
affording greater protection rto the investing public by requiring
unequivocal disclosure of an intention to stabilize. The first, Rule
827 under the Securities Act of 1933, provides that where stabilization is contemplated there must be included in the prospectus a simple
statement that it is intended to stabilize security prices to facilitate
the distribution in respect of which a registration statement is filed
under that Act. : The second, Rule X -17 A-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, in effect requires that any underwriter of the
issue or any other broker or dealer who stabilizes in aid of a distribution as to which a Securities Act registration statement is filed, must
submit daily reports to the Commission showing all transactions
effected during-the period of stabilization and distribution of the issue.
These rules, and the forms for reports prescribed by Rule X-17A-2,
became effective on March 15, 1939.
Rules 827 and X""""17A-2do not purport to regulate market operations effected. for the purpose of pegging, fixing, or stabilizing security
prices. Consequently they are not, and are not intended to be, a
substitute for regulation pursuant to Section 9 (a) (6) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.' Furthermore, the disclosure and reporting
requirements of p;iese rules in no wise limit the applicability or operation of those provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the
Securities Act of 1933 which prohibit manipulative
or fradulent
practices.'
-

All daily reports of stabilizing are analyzed as received, On the
basis of the information supplied by these reports, price charts are
kept current which show the market behavior of the stabilized security
in relation to the movement of market averages of comparable securities. In addition, statistical summaries and analytical studies are
prepared with respect to all stabilizing operations subject to the rules.
In the 3M months' period from March 15 to June.Btl, 1939, 142
registration statements were filed under the Securities Act of 1933, of
which 83 contained a statement that it was intended to stabilize the
issue. Of these, 56 became effective prior to June 30, 1939. Stabilizing operations were conducted to facilitate 21 of the offerings, aggregating $208,459,041, to which these effective statements related.
Eleven of these stabilizing operations were completed prior to June 30.
and 10 were still in progress as of the close of the past fiscal year.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Nature and Effect of Registration of Securities on Exchanges.

Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides that an
issuer may obtain the registration of a security on a national securities exchange by filing with the Commission and the exchange an
application containing certain specified information.
Section 13

FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

47

of that Act provides for the subsequent filing of certain annual and
other periodic reports in order to keep the basic information up to
date. Thus, one of the chief purposes of the Act, that is, to make
available to investors reliable, comprehensive, and current information as to the affairs of the issuers of securities listed and registered
on a national securities exchange, is accomplished.
The information which is required to be submitted in an application for registration must be prepared on the form prescribed by the
Commission as appropriate to the particular type of issuer or security
involved.
In general, the Act provides that an application for registration
shall become effective 30 days after the receipt by the Commission
of the Exchange's certification of approval thereof, except where the
Commission determines it may become effective within a shorter
period of time. It is unlawful under the statute for any member,
broker, or dealer to effect any transaction in any security (other
than an exempted security) on any national securities exchange unless
a registration is effective as to the security for such exchange.
An annual report is required to be filed with the Commission and
the exchange within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year 7 of
the registrant, except where an extension of time is granted in a.
particular case under the conditions specified in the Commission's
rules and regulations. Approximately 10 percent of the registrants
subject to the filing of annual reports sought, during the past year,
such an extension of time in their particular cases. It may be noted
that the reason most frequently stated for seeking such an extension
is that the accountants of the registrant will be unable to complete
within the prescribed time the preparation of the necessary financial
statements because of the pressure of their work arising particularly
from -the fact that a majority of the registrants have an identical
fiscal year, coinciding with the calendar year. Another reason frequently, stated by certain registrants with foreign subsidiaries is the
considerable delay after the close of the fiscal year in the receipt by
the registrant of the accounts of its subsidiaries.
Examination of Data Filed Under Sections 12 and 13.

The applications and reports filed under Sections 12 and 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are examined by the Commission for
the purpose of determining whether they contain full and adequate
disclosure of. the information required by the Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. This examination does not
involve an appraisal of and is not concerned with the merits of the
registrant's securities. When the examination discloses that generr Approximately 80 percent of registrants have fiscal years ending on or about December 31, 5 percent on
or about lune 30, and the remaining 15 perrent on other dates.

-48

'SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMl\USSION

.ally accepted accounting principles and procedures have not been
followed in the preparation and presentation of financial statements,
'Or that any material information has not been fully disclosed in ac-cordance with the requirements, the registrant is so advised, either
by sending it a so-called deficiency letter or through the medium of
a conference held with its representatives, and necessary amendments are obtained. These amendments in turn are examined in
the same manner as the original application or report. That this
-examination procedure, together with the policy of releasing opinions
of the Chief Accountant with respect to certain accounting practices
which are of general in,terest to registrants, has led to a greater under-standing of the requirements for the proper preparation of the application and periodic reports is suggested by the fact that a total of
4,493 amendments to applications and annual and current reports
were filed during the previous, fiscal year, as compared with 3,210
'such amendments filed during the past fiscal year.
"RegistrationsTerminated Under Section 19 (a) (2).

Under Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the Commission, if in its opinion such action is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors, has the power to deny, delay,
-suspend, or withdraw the registration of a security if an issuer fails
to file any required data. During the past fiscal year, the Commis-sion instituted action under Section 19 (a) (2) against 16 registrants,
based upon their alleged failure.to comply with Sections 12 and 13 of
the Act and rules and regulations thereunder, in order to determine
whether to suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months or to with-draw the registration of their securities. At the beginning of the
fiscal year, 3 such cases were pending, making a total of 19 cases
pending during the year. Seven of these proceedings were disposed
of during the year, 2 by dismissal and 5 by orders of the Commission
withdrawing the registration; and 12 were pending at the close of the
year. Four such actions were instituted in the case of foreign private
issuers who subsequently filed certain delinquent reports in question
(including three cases where such reports were filed after the close of
the year).
Statistics of Securities Registered or Exempt From Registration on Exchanges.

At the close of the past fiscal year, securities of 2,449 issuers were
registered on national securities exchanges. These registrants include
most of the leading nationally known commercial and industrial
-enterprises in the United States as well as many others with activities -oonfined largely to a particular region or locality. They also
include a number of foreign private issuers, governments and political
subdivisions.

Withdrawal or Striking of Securities from Listing and Registration on Exchlll'ges •.

During the preceding fiscal year, which ended June 30, 1938, the
N ew York Stock Exchange developed a policy of removing from its
list of securities eligible for trading those issues which, fer one reason
or another, had become' no longer suited to trading in. the auction
market which It maintains.
During the past fiscal year, that Exchange continued this policy by seeking to remove from listing and
registration those issues which, because of inadequate public distribution, inactivity, or the reduced market value of public holdings, it
considered to be no longer properly included Within its security list.
In carrying forward this program to improve the quality of its stock
and bond lists, that Exchange filed 22 applications for' withdrawal
or striking of securities from listing and registIation in accordanceWith the requirements' of Section 12 (d) ot the- Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, of which 15 were granted and 7 "were-pending- as' of the.

SECURITJ.!!}S AND EXCHANGE.

COMMISSION

In all, 54 .applications were filed with the Commission during the
past fiscal year eeeking the delisting and striking from registration of
securities fully listed and registered on national securities exchanges.
AB of June 30, 1938, 21 such applications were pending.
Of this
combined total of 75 applications, 60 were granted and 15 were
pending as of June 30, 1939.
The Commission also received during the past "fiscal year 154
certifieations, med in accordance- with the Commission's rules, from
exchanges which had stricken securities from listing -
and, registration
because of then: payment, redemption, or retirement.
Applications for the Granting, Extension,: and Termination of Unlisted Trading
Pri\'imges on Exchanges.

Pursuant to the amendment of May 27, 1936 to Section 12 (f) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, national securities exchanges
may extend unlisted trading privileges to securities as to which corporate information comparable to that available in the case of securities fully listed and registered is contained in registration statements
filed With the Commission.
Since the provisions of this amendment
became effective, a considerable reduction has occurred in the number of securities which continued to enjoy unlisted trading privileges
by reason of their admission to such trading privileges prior to March
1, 1934. At the time of the passage of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, there were 2,685 stock and 1,288 bond issues dealt in on an
unlisted basis and as to which unlisted trading privileges were automatically continued by the original, as well as the amended, Section
12 (f) of that Act. By June 30, 1939, there were but 1,531 stock and
409 bond issues so admitted to unlisted trading privileges, a total
decline of 2,033 issues. During the past fiscal year, the Commission
was notified, in accordance with its rules, of the removal for various
reasons of 121 securities from unlisted trading privileges ..
On June 30, 1938, 13 national securities exchanges had facilities
for permitting trading in securities on their floors on an unlisted basis.
During the past fiscal year, the Cleveland Stock ~xchange and the
Cincinnati Stock Exchange revised their practices so as to permit this
type of trading, thus bringing the/total number of exchanges affording
facilities for unlisted trading to 15. Of these exchanges, 5, permitted
unlisted trading in .both stocks and bonds, and 10 in stocks only.
At the end of the previous fiscal year, the number of-stock and bond
issues admitted to unlisted trading privileges on registered exchanges
was 1,603 and 514, respectively, a combined total of 2,U7 issues.
On June 30, 1939, the number of stock and bond issues so admitted
was 1,639 and 426, respectively.ra
combined total, of 2,065 'issues.
Thus, during the year" there was p. net decline of 5~,~ues dealt in on

an unlis~d basis on.registered.exehangesf

• The figures in tbJa paragraph include some sIlght duplication because of the fact, that certain securlt1

FIFTH

ANNUAL

55

REPORT

.Ai; of June 30, 1939, 5 exempted exchanges permitted unlisted
trading in 157 stock and 12 bond issues. As of the close of the fiscal
year, one exempted exchange had pending before the Commission an
application to extend unlisted trading privileges to a security on the
ground that it is listed and registered on a national securities exchange.
Clause 2 of Section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, provides that the Commission, upon application by a
national securities exchange, may extend unlisted trading privileges
to any security duly listed and registered on any other national
securities exchange. Clause 3 of Section 12 (f) permits the Commission, upon application by a national securities exchange, to extend
unlisted trading privileges to securities, in respect of which there is
available from a registration statement and periodic reports or other
data filed pursuant to rules or regulations of the Commission adopted
under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, information substantially equivalent to that required in respect
of a security duly listed and registered on a national securities
exchange.
-

The work of the Commission in administering the provisions of
Section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, relating to the
extension of unlisted trading privileges, is summarized in the following
tables:

Proposals for the Registration

ANNUAL REPORT

57

of the Securities of "Unlisted Issuers."

On November 22, 1938, the Board of Governors of the New York
Stock Exchange adopted a report which, among other things, took the
position that it would be in the public interest if all of the major
corporations whose securities, although widely distributed in public
hands, are not registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
but, on the contrary, are traded only on an unlisted basis or in the
over-the-counter market, were subjected t-o corporate information and
reporting requirements comparable to those which now apply to
issuers of registered securities. The Commission has undertaken a
study of the legislative, economic, and market problems which are
raised by a proposal for the registration of all issues in which the
investing public has a substantial interest. Although circumstances
prevented any major progress towards this objective during the past
fiscal year, the Commission has nevertheless continued its study of
the problem and of the mechanisms whereby the investing public may
most easily be afforded the protection of corporate information, proxy
regulation, and the prevention of speculation by corporate "insiders"
with respect to all securities which enjoy an interstate trading market
and not, as is now the situation, only with respect to those securities
which are listed and registered on national securities exchanges.
OVER-THE-COUNTER

MARKETS

Formation of National and Affiliated Securities Associations Pursuant
15 (a) of the Seeurltles Bxehange Act of 1934, as Amended.

to Section

In the over-the-counter securities markets, the, Commission, during
the period covered by ibis 'report, has 'continued to administer the
program inaugurated by the Maloney Amendment to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Public, No. 719, 75th Congress), approved
by the President on June 25, 1938. This amendment, in its essentials, provides for a system of regulation in the over-the-counter
markets through the formation of one or more voluntary associations
of investme-nt 'bankers. brokers, and' dealers doing business in these
markets under appropriate governmental supervision.
In furtherance of this program of voluntary regulation among
brokers and dealers, it was deemed advisable to have the new legislation and the policies of the Commission thereunder explained in
detail to as large a number of firms and individuals conducting an
over-the-counter securities business as possible. Furthermore, from
the outset it was the 'desire of the Commission to obtain the views
with respect to the' formation of effective voluntary associations of as
many such brokers and dealers as might wish to express themselves.
To accomplish these objectives, members of the Commission and of its
staff conducted conferences, open to all interested persons, in financial
communities situated in the various sections of the country. This

58

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

work was deemed to be an essential preliminary to the registration
with the Commission of any national or affiliated securities association.
To facilitate this work and to assist brokers and dealers in the
formation of associations, the Commission created a special unit,
designated as the Securities Association Unit, within its Trading and
Exchange Division.
This unit has conducted a large number of
informal round table conferences with committees of the Investment
Bankers Conference, Inc., their counsel, and other interested groups
and individuals.
During the course of such conferences, the principal
objective has been to be of all possible assistance to the representatives
of the securities business in their work of creating an organization
designed to secure the approval and support of the better element of
brokers and dealers throughout the country and to be effective in the
regulation of the business conduct of members.
The very scope of this program, together with the fact that it is
without precedent in the over-the-counter
securities markets, has
made the task of organization a necessarily protracted one. However,
as of the close of the past fiscal year, there was every indication that
the Investment Bankers Conference, Inc., reconstituted as the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and provided with a duly amended
constitution, by-laws and rules of fair practice, would file an application
for registration with the Commission in the reasonably near future,"
Membership in this new association will be open to all brokers and
dealers conducting business in the over-the-counter markets, except
those who have disqualified themselves by their previous conduct and,
as a result, are laboring under certain disabilities set forth in the
statute.
However, both the Commission and the Conference have
expressed themselves as favoring the grouping of those brokers and
dealers who transact business in the more specialized types of securities, oil royalties, for example, in affiliated associations to be formed
subsequent to the registration of a national association.
In order that every reasonable opportunity may be afforded such
association or associations as may become registered with the Commission to exercise as broad a regulatory function as possible, the Commission has refrained from any substantial amplification of its own
rules for regulation of over-the-counter
markets.
However, the
Commission recognizes its duty under the law to eliminate by direct
regulation such abuses and undesirable practices as may be found by
experience to be beyond the reach of registered securities associations.
In this connection it should be stated that at conferences preliminary to
the registration of an association it was definitely indicated that many
of the regulatory measures intended by the Maloney Act which could
have been assumed by such an association would not be so assumed.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMl\HSSIOS

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS
UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

On August 11, 1938, the Commission published a complete revision
of its rules and regulations under Section 14 (a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, relating to the solicitation of proxies, oonsents, and authorizations in respect of securities registered on national
securities exchanges. These revised rules and regulations, designated as "Regulation X-14," became effective October 1, 1938, and
supplanted the LA proxy rules under which the Commission operated
for approximately 3 years.
Regulation X-14, like the LA rules, is a "disclosure" regulation
and requires that persons from whom proxies, consents, or authorizations are solicited be furnished with information pertinent to the
matters in respect of which the solicitation is made and to the
interest of the persons who make it. Whereas the LA rules, in
addition to certain items of general information, merely called for ll.
brief descnption of the matters in respect of which the proxy, consent,
or authorization was solicited, Regulation X-14 specifies in some detail
the types of information to be furnished the persons solicited, the specifications varying according to the character of the matters involved.
During the fiscal year, 1,595 original filings and 557 supplemental
filings of proxy, consent or authorization soliciting material were
examined for compliance with Regulation X-14 and the LA rules.
On innumerable occasions, the staff considered drafts of soliciting
material end had conferences with persons proposing to solicit proxies,
consents, or authorizations, or with counsel for such persons. In
cases in which definitive soliciting literature was materially deficient
(in failing to respond to the express requirements of Regulation X-14,
or to respond adequately, or in containing false or misleading statements), supplemental corrective material was., at the suggestion of the
Commission, sent to security holders. In such cases, depending upon
the nature of the Commission's objections to the soliciting material,
action pursuant to the proxies, consents, or authorizations obtained
from the use of the deficient soliciting material was deferred until the
proxies, consents, or authorizations had been confirmed by the security
holders on the basis of literature complying with Regulation X-14,
or until, on the basis of similar literature, the security holders had
been afforded a reasonable opportunity to revoke the proxies, consents,
or authorizations which they had given.
In one case, the management of an investment company solicited
proxies for the reelection of directors, two of whom were originally
selected by persons who later became involved in lawsuits based upon
alleged fraudulent transactions with the company. It was charged

FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT

61

that the proxy soliciting material falsely stated that the original designation of the two candidates for reelection to the directorate originated with the board of directors. It was further alleged that the
annual report to stockholders which accompanied the proxy soliciting
material was designed to mislead the stockholders as to the true condition of the company. It labelled the company's deficit as "earned
surplus," and then relied upon scarcely distinguishable italicized
figures to correct the misnomer. Moreover, the balance sheet on
its face stated a "Quoted Market Value" for the company's securities,
whereas approximately 70 percent of the amount shown as quoted
market value represented the cost of a security which had no quoted
market value and which had been acquired otherwise than in an arm's
length transaction; furthermore, the right of the issuer of such security
in the underlying assets appeared to be precarious. There was also
included in the proxy soliciting material a message by the president
of the company which dealt in part with the above mentioned lawsuits, but which omitted to state that he and one other candidate for
reelection to the directorate were defendants in one of the suits. As a
result of the position of the Commission that by reason of these deficiencies the proxy soliciting material failed to comply with Regulation
X-14, the management agreed to defer use of the proxies obtained
from the solicitation until they had been confirmed on the basis of a
further communication to stockholders fully complying with Regulation X-14. Upon the filing of revised soliciting material, it was
noted that the two directors, concerning whose original designation
objectionable statements had appeared in the original soliciting
material, had resigned as directors and officers and had been replaced
by other persons having the approval of a State court, which, as of a
date prior to the original solicitation, had appointed a custodial
receiver of the company's assets.
In another case, the management of a corporation submitted to the
Commission a draft of the material proposed to be used by it in
soliciting proxies for a special meeting of common stockholders to
amend the by-laws of the corporation so that 33}kpercent (rather than
50 percent) of the stock entitled to vote would constitute a quorum at
any meeting of stockholders. After examination of its files, the
Commission found that the president of the corporation, who was also
a director thereof, owned approximately 38 percent of the common
stock. The management was requested by the Commission to state
these facts in its proxy soliciting material and to indicate therein that
the president of the corporation could, if the proposed by-law amendment were adopted, assure a quorum solely by use of his own stock at
any meeting at which the preferred stock of the corporation had no
vote. The management agreed to make these disclosures but, at a
later date, gave up the proposed plan as not being feasible.

62

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE' COMMISSION

In a further case, the management of a corporation filed with the
Commission proxy soliciting material containing the following statement: HOne of the purposes of said Meeting is the election of five
directors, each for a term of 3 years. Other matters may properly
be brought before said Meeting by stockholders, but proxies in such
form will confer authority only with respect to the election of directors
and will not confer any authority with respect to any such other matters." Prior to the preparation of the management's proxy soliciting
material, a stockholder of the corporation had advised the president
that he proposed to offer at the annual meeting certain amendments to
the by-laws of the corporation, one of which would change the place
of the stockholders' meeting and another of which provided for the
election of independent auditors by the stockholders instead of their
being appointed by the management.
The Commission took the
view that, since the proposed amendments pertained to matters to
which the stockholders might properly address themselves, and since
the management was advised of the proposed amendments prior to
the time its proxy soliciting material was prepared and sent to stockholders, and since the proxies were apparently to be used for purposes
of a quorum supporting action upon the proposed amendments, the
omission from the proxy soliciting material of information concerning
such amendments rendered the above quoted statement of the
management misleading within the meaning of Regulation X-14.
Thereupon, the management of the corporation sent to stockholders a
further communication fully apprising them of the two proposed
amendments, in the meantime adjourning the meeting two weeks in
order to give the stockholders an opportunity on the basis of the supplemental information, to revoke the proxies which they had given.
The Commission has received the support of a Federal court in its
administration of Regulation X-14. An injunction was granted in
the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
against one party to a proxy contest who, it was alleged, had violated
the provisions of such regulation by the use of false and misleading
statements and otherwise. The injunction restrained the defendants, from using those proxies which the court determined were obtained in contravention of the Commission's proxy regulations, and
further restrained them, in future solicitations of proxies in respect
of the common stock of the corporation, from using false and misleading statements, particularly in specified respects. The complaint
in the case was the first one :filed by the Commission to enjoin violation of its proxy rules.

Part IV
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935

The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 is designed to
eliminate abuses and to provide a greater degree of protection for investors
and consumers in the field of public utility holding company finance and
operation.
In addition to requiring full and fair disclosure of financial
transactions, the Act provides for Commission supervision of security
transactions by holding companies and subsidiaries; supervision of acquisitions of securities, utility assets, and other interests by holding companies
and their subsidiaries; and supervision of dividends, proxies, intercompany
loans, and service, sales, and construction contracts. The Act also calls for
simplification of uneconomic holding company structures.

REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANIES

The past fiscal year has been the first full year in the administration
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. It will be recalled that a substantial percentage of holding companies delayed
registration under the Act until after the decision of the Supreme
Court of the United States on March 2~, 1938, upholding the constitutionality of the registration provisions of the Act. Thereupon, however, all companies affected by the Act, with the exception of such
companies as claimed exemption, registered and are now subject to
the regulatory provisions of the Act. At the end of this fiscal year,
the registered holding companies represented 51 separate public
utility systems, comprising 142 registered holding companies 1 and
including 1,524 individual holding, subholding and operating companies. The total approximate consolidated assets of these companies
"at book" amount to approximately $14,097,000,000.
During the time the Act has been in effect, the Commission has had
before it applications, declarations, and proceedings under almost all
of the provisions of the Act. In both numbers and amounts involved,
those relating to the issuance of securities lead the rest.
SECURITY ISSUES

Since the effective date of the Act approximately $2,637,718,000 of
securities have been issued in accordance with the provisions thereof,
all of them complying sufficiently with the statutory standards to
permit their issuance. Of this amount, $1,449,810,000 of securities
I

AppendJx VII contains a complete list of the holding companies which were registered as of 1une 30, 19391

63

64

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

were issued during the past fiscal year. Moreover, at the close of this
fiscal year, there were pending before the Commission 60 applications
and declarations relating to securities amounting to over $592,723,000.
Each security issue to be considered by the Commission under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, unless exempt, must
meet the-statutory standards of Section 7 of that Act. That section
prohibits the Commission from permitting the issuance of preferred
stock or unsecured obligations by holding companies except in the
case of certain refinancing, refunding, or reorganization operations
or in cases where the issuance is necessary for urgent corporate purposes and a more rigid standard would impose an unreasonable financial burden upon the company. The section further requires, in the
case of operating as well as holding companies, that the security be
reasonably adapted to the security structure of the company and
the system and to the earning power of the issuer; that the financing
involved be appropriate to the economical and efficient operation of a
business in which the applicant is lawfully engaged or has an interest;
that the fees, commissions, and other remuneration paid in connection
with the issue or sale or distribution of the security be reasonable;
and that the terms and conditions of the issue or sale be not detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.
The determination of whether a particular security issue meets the
standards of the Act demands accounting, engineering, and legal
skills, together with an expert knowledge of public utility financing.
The Commission, while insisting at all times upon adherence to the
standards of the Act, does not approach security issues with a rigid
preconceived set of requirements applicable to all situations, nor does
it measure its effectiveness by the number of issues stopped.
It
considers one of its major functions to be that of helping companies
to meet the requirements of the Act. For example, where the terms
of a proposed security issue, as initially filed with the Commission,
fail to meet one or more of the statutory standards, the Commission
does not simply refuse to permit to become effective the declaration
concerning the issue, but seeks to strengthen the terms of the issue
to the point where investors and consumers receive the protection
afforded by the safeguards of the Act. This work is done largely
over the conference table and in informal meetings with the company's
officials and its financial and legal advisors.
In a great number of cases, conferences precede the formal filing
of the issue with the Commission and here, in its embryonic stage,
the company and the Commission build up the terms of the issue to
meet the requirements of the Act. For example, changes such as
more adequate maintenance and depreciation charges, restrictions on
dividends, greater voting rights, limitations as to the future issuance

FIFTH

65

of securities having a preference over the proposed issue, elimination
of conflicts of interest of indenture trustees, restatement of certain
accounting items, and similar matters, have been worked out informally, both before and after filing. In several instances, it has been
possible to promote the rehabilitation of a weak company and to
convert a speculative issue into one more conservative.
In those
cases where the conference method is not used fully or where it fails
to produce an agreement, the Commission's order permitting the
declaration to become effective has often been conditioned upon the
company's amending the terms of the security or the underlying
indenture so as to comply with the standards of the Act.
For all its flexibility, the Commission has required strict adherence
to the standards of the Act. As a result, securities issued under tho
Act have been in many respects of a considerably higher grade than
those not so issued. For example, in the case of preferred stock, the
Commission has insisted that such shares carry fair voting rights.
Incertain cases provision has been made that preferred stock normally
carry the right to elect a number of directors as a class, and, in the
event of a stated number of dividend defaults, the right to elect the
majority of the board,"
In certain cases where the proposed issue has already been approved
by a State commission, the issue is exempt and the jurisdiction of the
Securities and Exchange Commission is limited to attaching, for the
protection of investors and consumers, terms and conditions to its
order of exemption. It has been the Commission's practice to communicate with the State commission which has approved the security,
to discuss the problems raised by the issue. Where differences of
opinion have arisen, they have been settled cooperatively and to the
mutual satisfaction of both commissions.
The Commission has attempted to avoid every unnecessary delay
in the issuance of its order permitting a declaration to become effective. The financing by The North' American Oompany 8 furnishes a
striking example of this.
On December 31, 1938, The North American Oompany (the top
company in a system with consolidated assets of approximately
$1,247,000,000) and North American Edison Oompany filed a joint
application pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Act, for the approval of
a plan for partial simplification of the corporate structure of the North
American system. In connection with the plan, and for purposes of

a refinancing program of its own, The North American Company
proposed to amend its certificate of incorporation so as to change
various provisions of its outstanding preferred and common stock; to
issue 696,580 additional preferred shares, $50 par value; and to call
its outstanding debentures and issue new debentures in the .principal
amount of $70,000,000. The plan involved the elimination of North
American Edison Company, one of the principal intermediate holding
companies in the North American system, by having The North
American Company acquire its assets. This was to be done by
retiring the outstanding debentures and preferred stock of North
American Edison Company out of proceeds of the issuance and sale
of debentures and preferred stock of The North American Company.
The proposal involved the largest financing under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 to that time.
The magnitude of the issue, and a renewal of the threat of war in
Europe, emphasized the importance of the prompt offering of the
securities, provided they complied with the standards of the Act.
Within 23 days of the filing of the application, voluminous supplementary material had been gathered and analyzed and preparations
made for a hearing, which was held on January 24 and 25, 1939, on
all phases of the plan, except the offering price of the securities. The
findings, which included provision for various conditions deemed to be
essential, were prepared in time for the Commission to issue on Monday, January 30, 1939, its order authorizing the proposed alteration
of the rights of outstanding securities, so that the proposed changes
might be voted on by the stockholders at a special meeting called for
later that day. The changes were approved, and on the following day
the final hearing was held as to the public offering prices of the new
securities. On the afternoon of that day, the Commission issued its
supplemental findings and the necessary orders for the authorization
of all undisposed matters, and the securities were offered in a very
favorable market the next morning, February 1, 1939.

ALTERATION OF RIGHTS OF AN OUTSTANDING SECURITY

Apart from its duties in regard to the issuance or sale of the securities of companies subject to its jurisdiction, the Commission is also
called upon to regulate the exercise of any privilege or right to alter
the priorities, preferences, voting power, or other rights of the holders
of outstanding securities of such companies. Under Section 7 (e)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Commission
may Dot permit the exercise of any such privilege or right where it
would result in an unfair or inequitable distribution of voting power,
or would be otherwise detrimental to the public interest or the interest
of investors or consumers.
One type of situation, in particular, has arisen a number of times
during the past fiscal year. Some companies were willing to restate
their property accounts downward so as to eliminate questionable
items, such as those arising from revaluations and intra-system profits.
But since charging such write downs to earned surplus account would
in the usual case create a deficit in that account, and thereby prevent
the payment of dividends, it was desired to make the charges to capital
surplus account. In a number of instances, those write downs were
so substantial as far to exceed both the earned and the capital surplus
accounts of such companies. Therefore, in such cases, it was sought
to reduce the par or stated value of the common stock in order to
create a capital surplus against which to charge the amount of such
write downs.
Undoubtedly, the immediate effect of such a procedure would be
beneficial, to the extent that it would make more trustworthy the
balance sheets of such companies. But it would be far from an unmixed blessing so far as preferred stockholders are concerned, for it
would permit the payment of dividends to common stockholders as
well as to preferred instead of having that money go to build up the
equity junior to the preferred stock! Another result would be to
leave the preferred stock in a poorer condition to weather any future
storm.
The Commission has sought to achieve the good and guard against
the evil by permitting the outlined procedure, but attaching conditions
to its order designed to protect perferred stockholders.
The Columbia
Gas & Electric Oorporation case is a particularly interesting example,
because of the amounts involved. The capital represented by the
common stock was to be reduced from $194,349,005.62 to
$12,304,282.00-a total of $182,044,723.62, to be set up in a separate

account designated "Special Capital Surplus." The Commission
permitted the company's declaration to become effective, subject to
the following conditions."
(a) That the proposed restatement of common capital account
be submitted to a class vote of the preferred and preference stockholders, and receive the approval of a majority of the stock of
each class voted at the meeting called for such purpose;
(b) That no charge be made to "Special Capital Surplus"
without giving 30 days' prior notice to the Commission. The
Commission reserved jurisdiction to disapprove such charge after
notice to the company and opportunity for hearing;
(c) That, unless the time be extended by application to the
Commission and order thereon, any balance remaining in "Special
Capital Surplus" on December 31, 1942, be restored to the common capital stock account as of the date last mentioned.

In addition, the Commission reserved broad jurisdiction over dividends and surplus, including jurisdiction to prevent the payment of
dividends on common stock unless, after the declaration thereof and
making provision for all existing dividend requirements on the preferred and preference stocks, there would remain consolidated "Earned
Surplus Since December 31, 1937," equal to the requirements for six
quarterly dividends on the preferred and preference stock of the
company. Moreover, the Commission required that all published
balance sheets of the company indicate, by appropriate footnotes, the
conditions and limitations imposed by the Commission's order.
ACQUISITIONS

OF SECURITIES, UTILITY ASSETS, AND OTHER
INTERESTS

Acquisitions by registered holding companies or their subsidiaries
of securities, utility assets, or any other interest in any business also
come under the scrutiny of the Commission. Since the Act requires
holding company systems to be reduced to integrated systems, it was
obviously desirable that the Commission have power to control their
growth in the meanwhile. Also, the Commission can prevent the
pyramiding of control through many layers of holding companies,
which was one of the evils principally complained of with respect to
holding companies.
Application must be made for approval of an acquisition, and the
procedure in passing on it is closely parallel to that used in connection
with security issues. Among the standards by which the Commission
must be guided in approving acquisitions is a requirement that no

69

FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT

acquisition shall be approved unless the Commission finds that it will
serve the public interest by tending toward the economical and
efficient development of an integrated public utility system. The
Commission must also deny an application if it will tend toward
interlocking relations or the concentration of control of public utility
companies in a manner detrimental to the public interest or the
interest of investors or consumers; if the consideration to be paid is
not reasonable; if the acquisition will unduly complicate the capital
structure of the system; or if it will otherwise be detrimental to the
public interest or the interest of investors or consumers or the proper
functioning of the system.
Here, too, as in the case of security issues, in determining whether
these conditions are satisfied, an examination is made not only by
financial experts and lawyers, but also, in appropriate instances, by
engineers. Again, as in the case of security issues, the Commission
does not regard it as its duty mechanically to deny those applications
which do not, as first filed, comply with the statutory requirements.
Wherever possible, modifications and conditions which make the
transaction acceptable are suggested and worked out with company
officials and counsel.

INTEGRATION AND CORPORATE SIMPLIFICATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS

Section 11 (b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
imposes upon the Commission certain duties with regard to the
integration and corporate simplification of public utility holding
company systems. The Commission is directed to require every
registered holding company to take such action as the Commission
shall find necessary to limit the operations of its system to those of
a single integrated public utility system and to such other businesses
as are reasonably, incidentally, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operation thereof. However, the Commission must
permit one holding company to control more than one integrated
system if it shall be proved that each such additional system cannot

70

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

be operated independently without the loss of substantial economies,
that all of such additional systems are located in one State or in
adjoining States or in a contiguous foreign country, and that the
continued combination of such systems under the control 01 the one
holding company is not so large (considering the state of the art and
the area or region affected) as to impair the advantages of localized
management, efficient operation, or the effectiveness of regulation.
The Commission must also cause the companies under its jurisdiction to bring about a simplification of holding company structures
so as to eliminate unnecessary complications or unfair distributions
of voting power. This must include elimination of holding companies
beyond the second degree.
Instead of waiting for the Commission to bring action, registered
holding companies or subsidiaries may invoke the aid of the Commission in carrying out voluntary reorganizations designed to satisfy

the integration and corporate simplification requirements.
hearing, the Commission finds such a plan necessary to effectuate
the provisions of Section 11 (b), and fair and equitable to the persons
affected by the plan, the Commission is directed to issue. an order
approving the plan.
/
On .August 3, 1938, William O. Douglas, former Chairman of the
Commission, addressed a letter to the chief executives of all registered
holding companies, requesting them to inform the Commission as to
their tentative plans for compliance with Section 11 (b). Since
publication of such tentative plans might be misleading, the Commission stated that they would be treated as informal and confidential. The purpose of this request was to focus the attention of
the industry upon the steps needed to comply with the statute, and
to assist the Commission in determining the best procedure to secure
such compliance, as well as to obtain both data and ideas that might
prove helpful to the Commission. With few exceptions, the registered holding companies submitted more or less elaborate statements
in response to this request. These have been carefully studied and
analyzed, and have aided considerably in the formulation of working
plans for securing compliance with the statute.
The next step is
the specific and separate determination of each company's problem,
a matter which in each case must be based on the evidence produced,
both by the Commission and the company, at a public hearing.
Turning now to the specific accomplishments of the last fiscal year,
on July 20, 1938, the Commission instituted its first proceeding
under Section 11 (b) (1). On January 4, 1937, Utilities 'Power &
Light Oorporation; a holding company owning securities of widely
scattered utility and non-utility subsidiaries, filed It petition for reorganization under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy .Act in the United

FIFTH

REPORT

States District Court for the Northern District of lllinois. In view
of the non-integrated character of the properties, and the need of
reorganization apart from the provisions of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, the Commission considered it appropriate to
require attention to the integration provisions in the course of the
reorganization. The plan of reorganization now pending," filed by
Atlas Corporation, principal creditor of Utilities Power & Light Corporation, provides for the conversion of Utilities Power & Light Corporation into an investment company through the disposal of assets,
the reorganized corporation not to own 5% or more of the voting
securities of any public utility holding or operating company. The
new company is to submit to this Commission, within 30 days after
completion of the reorganization, a plan under Section 11 (e) for the
divestment of control of securities or other assets, for the purpose of
enabling the new company and its subsidiaries to comply with Section
11 (b) of the Act. The proposed 11 (e) plan is to provide that such
divestment of control be accomplished within two years from the date
filed and shall also provide that, if the plan is not consummated
within such time limit, the Commission may apply to a court for the
appointment of a trustee to carry out the terms and conditions of the
plan. The procedure provided for in the amended plan of reorganization was worked out in the hope of making it unnecessary for the
Commission to continue with the Section 11 (b) (1) proceeding by
reason of the voluntary compliance with the integration provisions of
the Act.
On October 28, 1938, the Commission approved a plan filed under
Section 11 (e) by Republic Electric Power Oorporation 7 providing for
reorganization and simplification in conformity with the provisions of
Section 11 (b). Republic Electric Power Corporation, a Delaware
holding company, controlled four utility companies operating in California and Oregon, a small natural gas distribution system in Oklahoma (Apache Gas Company) and two non-utility subsidiaries (Gas
Transport Company and Needles Steam Laundry). The plan provided for the merger of the California and Oregon utility companies,
the disposition by Republic Electric Power Corporation to third persons, other than the present management of Republic Electric Power
Corporation, of its interest in Apache Gas Company and Gas Transport
Company, and the dissolution, within one year, of the Republic
Electric Power Corporation through distribution of its stock holdings
in the surviving operating company to its stockholders .

REORGANIZATION OF REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANIES
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES THEREOF

AND

Sections 11 (f) and 11 (g) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 give the Commission extensive powers over the reorganization of companies subject to its jurisdiction. Briefly, these may be
summarized as a right to be heard concerning the appointment of
trustees or receivers; a veto power over plans, plus the privilege to
propose plans; and regulatory jurisdiction over protective committees
and solicitation practices, including claims for fees and expenses.
In passing upon reorganization plans, the Commission has insisted
upon adherence to the principle, usually associated with the Boyd
case," that the assets of an estate must be divided among security
holders, as far as they will go, in accordance with their contract rights
• This step was taken in connection with the plan of International

and priorities."
During this past fiscal year, the Commission has
approved three plans, those of The United Telephone and Electric
Oompany, West Ohio Gas Oompany, and Mountain States Power
Oompany.ll Each one of these indicates the Commission's concern
with that equitable and democratic principle. They also show the
Commission's concern with the feasibility of the plan, to the end of
avoiding the waste and hardship involved in repeated failures.
Undoubtedly, the focal point of most reorganization proceedings
is a proper valuation of the enterprise. The Commission has relied
upon reasonably foreseeable earning power as a paramount consideration, while endeavoring to give due weight to other factors and to the
many varying considerations which may be present. In arriving at
a conclusion, the Commission has been guided by the consideration
that, from the standpoint of investors, the commercial value of the
enterprise is the dominant consideration.
The Commission approved the plan of The United Telephone and
Electric Oompany, allowing the old common stock a participation of
2.8 percent of the new stock, largely on the ground that "a substantial
amount of the common stock is held by operating men employed by
the company's subsidiaries, and that their participation in the plan
involves an element of goodwill, which may be of importance to the
senior security holders." The opinion makes it clear, however, that
even that would not have been a ground for allowing the old common
stock to participate, were it not for the small amount involved.
Not only does Section 11 (f) empower the Commission to pass upon
plans before they may be submitted to a court, but, also, it gives the
Commission jurisdiction over reorganization fees and expenses. A
number of such applications, for interim allowances, have been
approved, although in some cases it was found that unreasonably
high allowances were being sought and that the interest of investors
required a modification. In passing upon these applications, the
Commission has considered the following to be some of the relevant
factors: past experience in reorganization; time devoted, both from
point of view of length of time spent and of whether other activities
were carried on currently; extent and nature of services rendered;
additional expenses incurred in rendering the services, e. g., appointment of attorneys or engineers as assistants; itemized schedule of outof-pocket expenses; interest in companies for whose benefit the services
were rendered; and division of fees or arrangements therefor.
\. Many attempts have been made to distingnlsh on legalistic grounds the BOlId case and Its related cases.
The Commission has consistently refused to adopt such arguments, and Its position in that respect has
reoontly been clearly vindicated by the Supreme Court of the United States in Ccue v. Loa AflQelu Lumber
P.!'odud, C'ompatlS', Ltd., decided on November 6, 1939. The opinion in that case clearly and definitely
reaffirmed the BOlId doctrine.

With regard to solicitation practices, the Commission has been
given express jurisdiction in respect of any reorganization or recapitalization plan of a registered holding company or a subsidiary company
thereof. The Commission's rules on this subject are designed to
accomplish the following things, generally speaking:
(a) To prevent solicitation of consents to any plan unless
such solicitation is accompanied by an analysis of the plan by
the Commission;
(b) To prevent protective committees or others from obtaining a deposit of securities unless it can be demonstrated that
such deposit is necessary for purposes which cannot adequately
be serv-ed by proxies;
(c) To permit solicitation in any event only after disclosure
has been made of the interests and affiliations of the persons who
are soliciting or are causing the solicitation to he made;
(d) To assure to security holders the right to revoke their
authorerization.

The maintenance of these standards was well illustrated during the
past fiscal year by two instances 12 in which permission to solicit the
deposit of bonds was refused. Each of these cases arose in connection
with the 77B proceedings of Utilities Elkhorn Coal Company, a
subsidiary of Utilities Power & Light Corporation. IS The major
asset of Utilities Elkhorn was a contract with Utilities Power & Light.
The stated purpose of the petitioning bondholders' committee, in each
case, was to enforce that contract-it
was part of their claim that the
Trustee, under the corporate deed of trust, was without power or
authority to enforce it. In the first of these cases, the deposit agreement filed with the Commission indicated that the committee sought

to acquire the following authority over the securities to be deposited:
Power to approve or disapprove any plan of reorganization for Utilities
Elkhorn, although to date no plan had been formulated; power to act
without the necessity of reporting to the bondholders or of furnishing
any intermediate report; and power to limit the right of withdrawal
of securities. Also, the committee members reserved full power to
deal in the securities affected by, and to participate in any underwriting connected with, the reorganization.
The Commission found that the powers sought by the committee
were far too broad and, indeed, were in violation of express provisions
of the Act and the rules thereunder. It further found that the applicants had not demonstrated the necessity for obtaining the deposit of
bonds under any circumstances. The Commission considered that
the Trustee, under the deed of trust, had the primary duty to enforce
the rights of the bondholders and that should the Trustee fail to perform that duty, there was the further possibility of a class suit by a
bondholder. However, the Commission indicated that it would be
proper to renew the application for permission to solicit deposits (on
modified terms) should subsequent developments indicate the necessity therefor.
Sometime later, another committee sought permission to solicit the
deposit of those same bonds. This time there were not the objectionable features in the deposit agreement. Nevertheless, the Commission again denied permission on the ground that there had still been
no showing of the necessity for deposits, with the expense necessarily
attendant thereon, which expense must ultimately be borne by the
security holders.
In addition to working on the questions presented by those particular cases in which applications relating to reorganizations and
recapitalizations have been filed, serious attention has been given to
the problem of clearing up the existence of huge arrearages of preferred
stock dividends. That is now one of the most pressing tasks facing
the public utility industry. Not only is there the obvious investor
interest in the payment of arrears and in the resumption of current
dividends, but, also, the present situation is unquestionably an
impediment to new equity financing, needed for maintenance and
expansion purposes, even by companies which do not have such
arrears. A drastic financial reorganization of some holding companies,
particularly those which cannot reasonably expect to clear up the
situation in the near future, seems inevitable.
The following table indicates the number of applications under
Sections 11 (f) and 11 (g) relating to plans for the reorganization and
simplification of registered holding companies or subsidiaries of registered holding companies, received and disposed of during the past
fiscal year:

SERVICE COMPANIES

Another important area of public utility activity which it is the
duty of the Commission to regulate pursuant to Section 13, is the
performance of service, sales, and construction contracts.
In the
main, that section, enacted to prevent excessive or unearned fees and
other charges which holding companies or their controlled service
subsidiaries have exacted from operating companies in the past,
makes illegal the performance of any service, sale, or construction
contract by any registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof, except in compliance with rules, regulations, or orders of
the Commission. The rules are designed to insure that such contracts are performed economically and efficiently for the benefit of
such associate companies at cost fairly and equitably allocated among
such companies. Generally speaking, it is necessary for subsidiary
companies to show that they are qualified before they perform services
for associates. Provision is also made for the qualification of "mutual
service companies," which are owned by the companies served thereby,
so-called member companies. These companies, too, must service
associates at cost, although any profit would of necessity go back to
the serviced companies in their capacity of stockholders.
The administration of Section 13 tends to fall into two parts. The
first of these may be termed organizational and it involves the qualification of mutual and subsidiary service companies. The Commission will not find that a company is qualified unless it can find,
after detailed investigation and public hearing, that the company is
so organized as to make it likely that the standards of the .Act will be
met. Moreover, the Commission has followed the practice of conditioning its finding that a company is qualified, reserving jurisdiction
to make retroactive adjustments to assure compliance with the
standards of the .Act. This work is of necessity preliminary and has
virtually been completed.
The Commission is now well into the second and more important
aspect of service company regulation. This involves a painstaking
study of what is actually being done by these qualified companies to

FIFTH

AJrNUAL REPORT

77

determine whether or not the objectives of the Act are being achieved.
The Act does not establish merely a standard of service at cost, but
in addition requires that services be performed economically and efficiently, that they be for the benefit of the companies serviced, and
that charges be fairly allocated among the various companies. To
do that job properly requires careful and detailed work in the field,
for, in the last analysis, the enforcement of such aims as the prevention of duplication in servicing (merely one item in the broader aim
that the services be for the benefit of the serviced company) and the
proper allocation of costs depends on a careful study of actual records
of a detailed character. However, even at this early stage the field
investigations that have been conducted by the staff have indicated
abuses that require correction, and far more important, have supplied
a wealth of information and experience which will be of immeasurable
benefit in the administration of such statutory provisions in the future.
Aside from (or, more realistically, as part of) this general and
steady progress towards the achievement of efficient and economical
intra-system servicing, this past year witnessed many individual benefits of the administration of the provisions of Section 13. To take
one case, the statutory requirement of economical and efficient servicing influenced one large holding company to take action which
brought about a reduction of approximately $400,000 in the annual
expenses of one service company, an amount which represented 30
percent of the total servicing costs of that particular company. In
another case, annual rent was reduced $65,000. In the case of many
service companies qualified during the past year, substantial reductions were effected in the capitalization of such companies, often
resulting in reduced expenses to all the companies affected.
The task of compelling a proper allocation of costs deserves special
mention, for it has become particularly important in the light of the
prohibition against profits on these intra-system contracts. Preliminary investigations pose the question whether some holding companies are seeking to profit indirectly by shifting holding company
expenses upon the operating companies through the medium of controlled service companies, and otherwise.
In large part, the Commission's practice of compelling direct
charges to a specific company for a specific transaction, insofar as
practicable, does much to prevent this abuse. Where the Commission finds that expenses which do not readily lend themselves to the
method of direct charges are allocated on an unfair basis, it compels
a reallocation. The Commission is also inquiring into other practices which would tend to have the same effect, with a view to corrective measures.

EXEMPTION FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF
1935

Sections 2 and 3 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 grant authority to the Commission to exempt by regulation or
order certain types of companies from the obligations, duties, and
liabilities imposed by the Act. The form such exemption may take
varies considerably.
Thus, a company may be declared not to be a
"holding company" as that term is defined in Section 2 (a) (7) of the
Act; or a company may be declared not to be a subsidiary of a specified
holding company pursuant to Section 2 (a) (8); or a holding company
may be exempted from the requirements of the Act if it falls into one
of the categories specified in Section 3 (a) of the Act. Sections 3 (b)
and 3 (d) further authorize the Commission to exempt subsidiary
companies of registered holding companies under certain circumstances.
Whether a company is entitled to exemption under the statute depends ultimately on the determination of matters of fact. In some
instances, the Commission has been able to reach broad general conclusions about whole groups of companies, and has granted total or
partial exemption by rule and regulation.
For example, all companies
in a system whose total annual gross revenues from utility business
are less than $350,000 have been exempted.
In other cases, a more
individualized consideration is necessary and questions such as those
of control, the predominant nature of the company's business, whether
or not it is a holding company only temporarily and how it came to be
such, and similar factual matters are decisive. In such cases, the
Commission has felt that a proper disposition of the issues requires
thorough and painstaking investigation.
Nor has any applicant been
prejudiced by the time required for such thorough treatment, for the
Act grants a temporary exemption to those companies whose applications for exemption, filed in good faith, are pending. Although at the
end of the fiscal 'year a number of cases were still pending," they were
If

receiving active attention and there was every indication that the
Commission's duties in this matter were close to completion .
.Among the applications for exemption which were disposed of by
the Commission during the past fiscal year, several are of more than
usual interest. Prior to filing its application for exemption, International Paper and Power Oompany controlled International HydroElectric System and through it, Gatineau Power Company, an important public utility company in Canada, and New England Power
Association, a large public utility system in the New England States,
as well as two other public utility companies doing businesss in New
York and in some of the New England States. International Paper
and Power Company segregated its utility holdings by conveying them
to liquidating trustees with instructions to dispose of them within a
period which, at the option of the Commission, may extend to January
31, 1943. H, at the end of the period, the liquidation is not completed,
the Commission may go into court and request the appointment of
court trustees to consummate the liquidation.
The liquidating trustees submitted to the Commission the steps that had been taken
effectually to divorce the operations of the public utility companies
from control by International Paper and Power Company, pending
the sale of the properties. On these facts, the Commission granted
to International Paper and Power Company exemption as a holding
eompany."
Another case, involving the question of control of one company
over another, was that of the application of AUied Chemical &: Dye
Oorporation 16 for an order declaring it not to be a holding company
within the meaning of Section 2 (a) (7) (A) of the Act. This corporation
owns more than 10 percent of the voting securities of American Light
and Traction Company, a registered holding company, which investment is divided between the preferred and common stock. More than
51 percent of the voting securities of American Light and Traction
Company is owned by, and a majority of its officers and directors are
also officers and directors of, United Light and Power Company.
Although the investment of Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation in
the common stock of American Light and Traction Company is small,
that in the preferred stock represented 43 percent of the total number
of shares of that class of stock outstanding. Thus, Allied Chemical
& Dye Corporation, since it owns more than one-third of the preferred
stock of American Light and Traction Company, has what amounts to
a veto power over certain corporate actions of that company because
of the provisions of Section 27 of the General Corporation Act of
New Jersey. The evidence in this case disclosed that on one occasion
only had the so-called veto power been used by Allied Chemical &
Dye Corporation. In 1926, Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation eoII

SECURITms AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

quired sufficient of the preferred stock of American Light and Traction
Company for the purpose of preventing the issuance of a new class of
preferred stock which would have been senior to that then outstanding.
There were other relationships between the subsidiaries of Allied
Chemical & Dye Corporation and those of American Light and
Traction Company which were also considered by the Commission in
reaching its decision in this case. Nevertheless, the Commission was
of the opinion that the business transactions between such companies
were not such as to prevent it from making the findings required by
Section 2 (a) (7) of the Act and that the possible veto power held by
Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation over certain of the corporate
actions of American Light and Traction Company, could be exercised
only in such rare and extraordinary circumstances that "control" or
"controlling influence" as contemplated by Section 2 (a) (7) of the
Act was absent. The order declaring Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation not to be a holding company, however, imposed certain conditions
which would control, at least to a limited extent, relationships between
Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation and American Light and Traction
Company or among subsidiaries of those companies.
Among the applications filed under Section 2 (a) (8) of the Act for
orders declaring applicants not to be subsidiaries of specified holding
companies, those filed by Northern Natural Gas Company 17 for orders
declaring that company not to be a subsidiary of Lone Star Gas
Corporation, The United Light and Railways Company and United
Light and Power Company, and North American Light and Power
Company, and The North American Company are of rather peculiar
interest. The voting stock of Northern Natural Gas Company is
held by the three above named holding company systems; 35 percent
by The North American Company system; 35 percent by the United
Light and Power system; and 30 percent by Lone Star Gas Corporation. The record in the case disclosed that Northern Natural Gas
Company was organized by these three interests; that officers and
representatives of the proprietary companies had served as officers
and directors of The Northern Natural Gas Company from the time
of its organization to the present; that Northern Natural Gas Company had until quite recently been financed either through sale of
common stock to the proprietary companies or through advances
made by the proprietary companies to Northern Natural Gas Company; and that, in general, it might be said that the three proprietary
companies acted in a manner similar to a partnership in supervising
the affairs of Northern Natural Gas Company. In order for the
Commission to grant these applications filed by the Northern Natural
Gas Company, Section 2 (a) (8) requires, in general, that the Commission find (1) that the Northern Natural Gas Company is not
17

ANNUAL REPORT

controlled by any of the proprietary companies; (2) that Northern
Natural Gas Company is not a company through which the proprietary companies controlled another company; and (3) that Northern
Natural Gas Company is not subject to such a controlling influence
as to make it necessary in the public interest that it be subject to the
provisions of the Act applicable to the subsidiaries of a registered
holding company. In its opinion, the Commission found that
Northern Natural Gas Company was subject to a controlling influence
by the proprietary companies in such a way as to make it necessary
that that company be subject to the provisions of the Act applicable
to it as a subsidiary of registered holding companies. The applications
of Northern Natural Gas Company were therefore denied.

SALE OF PUBLIC UTILITY SECURITIES AND UTILITY ASSETS

Pursuant to Sections 12 (d) and 12 (f) of the Act, the Commission
has adopted rules regulating the sale of public utility securities and
utility assets by a registered holding company or, when the sale is to
an associate or an affiliate, by either a registered holding company or
a subsidiary company thereof. The selling company must :file an
application, and a public hearing must be held to enable the Commission to determine whether the statutory safeguards are being met.
The Commission may approve the sale only if it finds that the terms
and conditions of such sale with respect to the consideration to be
received, maintenance of competitive conditions, fees, and commissions, disclosure of interest, and similar matters, are not detrimental
to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers, and
will not tend to circumvent the provisions of the Act, or any rules,
regulations, or orders of the Commission thereunder.
There have been a number of sales in which the purchasing company
also has been required to :filean application in respect to the acquisition.
Insuch cases duplication has been avoided wherever possible by having
a consolidated hearing on both applications. This is a procedure that
will probably be used with increasing frequency to keep pace with the
revamping of holding company systems, pursuant to the mandate of
Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act.

FEES

The Commission has adopted Rule U-12F-2, based on Section 12 (f)
and other provisions of the Act, controlling the payment of fees to
underwriters and "finders" who may be in a position, by reason of
stock ownership or other relationship, to gain an unfair advantage
in bargaining for such fees. Persons affected by the rule are substantially those falling within the statutory definition of "affiliate" in
Section 2 (a) (11) of the Act, which includes, in addition to officers,
directors, and persons having specified stock ownership, any person
whom the Commission finds to stand in such a relation to the issuing
company "that there is liable to be such an absence of arm's-length
in transactions between them as to make it necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers
that such person be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities"
imposed upon affiliates. The rule, like the statutory provision which
it parallels, recognizes the impossibility of precisely defining the facts
which make for absence of arm's-length bargaining, and permits the
disposition of each case in the light of the evidence therein developed.
No fee may be paid, unless on the basis of competitive bidding, to
underwriters or "finders" subject to the rule, unless the justification
is clear or unless such person merely has a participation of not more
than 5% and the fee is the same as that paid to non-affiliated underwriters. The Commission has not taken a position insisting on com..
petitive bidding generally but merely provides through its rules that
where the sale is through an affiliate the participation must be limited
as described above when the issue has not been sold by competitive
bidding.
POLITICAL

CONTRIBUTIONS

Section 12 (h) of the Act makes it unlawful for any registered holding company or any subsidiary company thereof to make any contribution in connection with any political offiee:« -The cGommission has

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
STATEMENTS

REQUIRED

PURSUANT

TO SECTION

12 (i)

Section 12 (i) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
requires the filing of statements by persons who represent registered
holding companies or their subsidiaries before the Congress or any
member or committee thereof, or before the Securities and Exchange
Commission or the Federal Power Commission, or any member,
officer, or employee of either such Commission, in such form and detail
as the Securlties and Exchange Commission shall prescribe. The
information reqifired to be contained in these statements pertains to
the nature and character of such representation, and the amount of
compensation received or to be received, directly or indirectly, in connection therewith.
Effective August 1, 1938, the Commission rescinded Form
U-12 (i)-I, the form of statement to be made pursuant to Section
12 (i) of the Act and, in lieu thereof, adopted Forms U-12 (I)-A and
U-12 (I)-B. Form U-12 (I)-A is the form of statement to be made
by a person who presents, advocates, or opposes any matter before
any of the above-mentioned bodies or persons and Form U-12 (I)-B
is the form of annual statement to be used by a person who is regularly
employed or retained by a registered holding company or subsidiary
company thereof. This annual statement relieves such regularly
employed or retained persons, who frequently represent such companies, from the necessity of filing numerous reports on Form U-12
(I)-A.
During the past fiscal year, 64 statements on Form U-12 (i)-I, 181
statements on Form U-12 (I)-A, and 112' s'tll:t~imts on Form
U-12 (I)-B were filed with the Commission.
INTERLOCKING

DIRECTORSHIPS

Section 17 (c) of the Act forbids registered holding companies to
have persons with financial connections as officers or directors, except
in such cases as rules prescribed by the Commission iJlUl.Y
p,ennit lJ,S not
adversely affecting the public interest or the interest of investors or
consumers. These rules of exemption were completely revised during
this past year, such revision being largely based on the Commission's
experience in the administration of the provisions of this section.
REPORTS

In examining the various periodic reports that are required to be
filed by companies and persons subject to the Act, and comparing
them with other available data, the Commission considers the
accuracy and completeness of the information filed, cites deficiencies,
and requests the filing of amendments and supplements for correction

of such deficiencies. In addition, the various phases of transactions
are examined to determine whether or not the successive steps in particular transactions are exempt under the Act and, if not, whether an
application or declaration has been filed. This work not only assures
adequate and accurate public information, but also is an important
function in the administration of the Act. An important benefit is
that the knowledge so obtained makes possible more speedy and
intelligent disposition of the applications to the Commission with
respect to matters under its jurisdiction.
During the fiscal year ended June 30,1939, the Commission received
102 annual reports by registered holding companies and 177 annual
supplements to registration statements.
RULES, REGULATIONS, AND FORMS

The Commission is constantly studying the rules, regulations, and
forms adopted under the Act with a view towards achieving the
simplest requirements consistent with a vigorous administration of
the .Act. During the past fiscal year, the Commission adopted 13 new
rules and repealed 14 rules. The Commission also adopted 24 amendments to 17 existing rules. In many instances, proposed rules are discussed with, and critically examined by, companies and persons
affected thereby and suggestions or objections voiced by those groups
are given thorough consideration by the Commission.

VARIOUS STATUTES
,-

UNDER THE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES
Prohibition Against Manipulation in the Securities Markets.

During the past fiscal.year, the Commission's efforts to protect the
securities markets from manipulation and fraud were vigorously continued. Almost five years of experience has enabled the Commission
to improve substantially its techniques of detection and enforcement .
.It has become increasingly evident that if the public is to receive
adequate protection the Commission's enforcement activities, so far
as possible, must be preventive rather than punitive. Thus, the
periodic inspection of offices of registered brokers and dealers has
been extended. The Commission's. representatives, in addition to
checking on compliance with the law, also endeavor to educate the
trade in the requirements of the statutes and rules, to suggest the
installation of proper financial controls and to bring about improvement in the ethical standards of the securities business. Such inspections also permit the detection of hopelessly weakened financial conditions at a time when there is still enough left to payoff customers
and other creditors.
Manipulation is detected in many ways. Complaints, although
frequent, are not always a trustworthy source of information. For
instance, a person who had sold short 2,000 shares of a security once
tried to show that a manipulation was in progress, in the hope that
he could induce the Commission to take action which would depress
the market price of that security, thus enabling him to cover his short
position at a profit. Furthermore, many complaints, although well
intentioned, prove upon investigation to be wholly baseless. N evertheless, all complaints are carefully analyzed and considered since,
from time to time, complaints from the public have resulted in the
detection of real manipulations.
However, the Oommission cannot perform its duties merely by
waiting for complaints. Normally these are received only after the
public has been injured. When price rises are due to manipulation,
Complaints are seldom received until after manipulation is finished
and "the plug has been pulled" to the loss of innocent purchasers.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Therefore, the Commission endeavors to maintain a day to day
scrutiny of the trading on security markets. The "ticker tape" is
also under constant observation, both in Washington and in New
York. To the same end, a section bas been established in the Commission to analyze possible reasons in the business of corporations
concerned which may explain unusual price fluctuations in their
securities and to determine what fluctuations are apparently the
result of manipulation. This type of market surveillance often results
in informal inquiries of the officers of exchanges and others who can
assist, in determining reasons for such movements.
Because many manipulations begin by a gradual increase in the
tempo of trading, it is not always possible to detect immediately the
possible illegality of trading by current "tape" observation and market
analysis. However, as soon as there is reason to suspect the character
of the market for a security, the Commission has been quick to inquire.
As a matter of fact, in some instances the Commission has been able
to prevent manipulation by taking action before the market has shown
any response at all to efforts to manipulate. 1 In other C88es, the
Commission has been able to commence its inquiry while the manipulation was still incipient, with the result that the investing public waS.
spared the losses attendant upon purchases of large blocks of stock at
artificial and manipulated prices. Thus, in one case, the Commission's.
prompt investigation stopped a manipulation when its sponsors had
been able to unload but 150 out of 10,000shares which they had under
option. In the Richards case," which involved trading in the common
stock of Simplicity Pattern Co., Inc. on the New York Curb Exchange,
the Commission's rapidity of action ended a manipulation being
engineered from England before any of the 40,000 shares under option.
could be sold. In still another instance, prompt action forestalled a
manipulation designed to facilitate the distribution of 375,000 shares.
by English underwriters.
Examples could be multiplied of instances in which the Commission
has been able to suppress manipulation at its inception. Many of
these cases never come to the attention of the public because the
promptness of the Commission's investigation stops the manipulation
at a time when insufficient proof exists to justify punitive or other

formal proceedings. In such cases the Commission refuses to give the
manipulators the rope necessary to hang themselves, but instead
chooses to protect the public by beginning its investigation before
unwitting investors have been drawn into an artificial market. Needless to say, manipulations almost invariably cease as soon as the
Commission's representatives appear on the scene.
Particular vigilance is required to forestall manipulation from
abroad. Although frequently lacking jurisdiction over the individuals
responsible and thus being unable to take punitive action against
them, the Commission has been able to deal with manipulations having
their origin in Canada due to the cooperation of various official and
semi-official bodies in the Canadian provinces. The ability of the
Commission to cope with manipulations which are international in
character was demonstrated publicly not only in the Richards case,
but even more saliently by the successful prosecution in June 1939,
of the individuals responsible for the artificial market created in the
Philippine Railway Bonds in January and February 1938.3
Although trading investigations are instituted primarily in order to
detect violations of the anti-manipulative sections of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, the Commission is alert to uncover other violations of the Jaw. To this end, the Commission seeks to achieve constant flexibility in its attack on manipulation. If proceedings may
be instituted more conveniently and with a greater probability of
success under statutes other than those administered by the Commission, the policy of cooperating with other branches of the Federal
Government and also of the State Governments for that purpose is
followed. Thus, the Philippine Railway Bond case, which led to the
convictions of William Buckner, William Gillespie, and Felipe Buencamino in New York in June 1939, was prosecuted under the mail
fraud statute after it has been determined that that statute offered
the best means of attack.
As in the past, trading investigations have disclosed violations by
exchange members or their employees of the rules of the various
national securities exchanges. In these instances, of which there were
many during the past fiscal year, the Commission referred the matter
to the appropriate exchange and, as a result, the exchange applied its
own sanctions.
Margin Regulations.

As mentioned in previous annual reports, Congress made this Commission responsible for the enforcement of Regulation T promulgated
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Commission has continued to make such margin inspections of brokerage
firms as were permitted by the limited personnel available for this
work.
• See Iflfra. p. 93.

SEOURITIES

AND EXOHA:NGE OOMMISSION

In previous years, most of the margin inspection activity was coneentrated on firms which were members of national securities exchanges, but during this last fiscal year more emphasis was placed on
the inspection of non-member firms. Margin inspection, particularly
among non-member firms, 'has been made part of a broader effort
undertaken to assure proper compliance on the part of brokers with
the applicable rules and regulations.
Inspection of cash and margin
accounts of 69 member and non-member firms were completed during
the year. .As usual, the results of these inspections bearing upon
compliance' with Regulation T have been made available to the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and in some' cases 'the
Oommission has submitted certain results of these inspections to' the
appropriate national securities exchanges for disciplinary action'. The
Washington (D.O.) Field Office is now equipped to carryon margin
inspections on a limited scale. Thus, insofar as available personnel
permits, the New York, Boston, Ohicago, and San Francisco Regional
Offices and the Washington Field Office of the Commission carry on
margin inspection 'work.
Market Surveillance.

The systematic surveillance of volume and price movements in
securities on exchange markets has been continued and extended.
The number of issues, including duplications on the various exchanges,
under continual observation at the close of the past fiscal year amounted
to 3,410 as compared with 3,133 at the close of the previous fiscal year.
Rationalization of deviations in price or volume is sought, and in cases
where the explanation for appreciable price or volume fluctuations is
not apparent, further study and inquiry is made. Rationalization of
movements in the price or volume of trading in particular soourity
issues involves not only investigation of the market situation in such
securities, but the continuing analysis of balance sheets, income statements and other current data with respect to both the particular issuer
and the general market.
Regular review is made of the terms of offering of all issues for which
registration statements are :filed under the Securities Act of 1933,
pertaining to securities traded on national securities exchanges or
convertible into or bearing warrants for the purchase of securities
traded on these exchanges. In those instances in which securities
registered are subject to options, the related security traded on -the
exchange has been placed under observation for the life of the option.
As of June 30, 1939, a total of 311 companies were under special observation due to the existence of options or warrants.
Continuing studies have been made of secondary distributions; and
trading in the issues subject to such distributions; both preceding and
during the period of offering, has been closely scrutinized.

.FIFTH. ANNUAL 'REPO~

.

91

_ The systematic recording and examining of all reports filed under
Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, pertaining to
changes in beneficial ownership of equity securities by all persons required to report such changes, has been continued. Reports of transactions in issues of an average of 832 companies per month have been
so recorded and examined.
Studies have been made of the effect upon price and volume fluctuations of publicity releases in the financial press, various so-called "tipster sheets," and other sources.
Extensive research has been conducted in both specific and over-all
characteristics of the exchange markets, the strictly over-the-counter
markets, and that middle ground consisting of issues traded in both
markets.
Trading Investigations.

Trading investigations are primarily conducted to ascertain if transactions by any person in a security registered or admitted to unlisted
trading privileges on any national securities exchange are effected in
violation of Section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, such investigations may also develop facts and circumstances
indicating violations of other sections of that Act, or sections of the
Securities Act of 1933, as well as violations of the rules of national
securities exchanges.
During the past fiscal year, the volume of cases reviewed increased
substantially, a total of 222 cases having been reviewed, compared
with 119 cases the previous year. As of June 30, 1939, 53 cases were
in progress, compared with 65 on June 30, 1938. The use of flying
quizzes (preliminary, informal, and substantially contemporaneous
inquiries into the causes for unusual market behavior) has enabled
the enforcement staff substantially to increase the scope of its activity
and reduce the time element involved in conducting investigations.
The use of these rapid fire check-ups of suspicious market activity
has also been extended to the Commission's Regional Officesthroughout the country. As the result of trading investigations, four cases
were referred to the Department of Justice during the year for criminal
prosecution, six persons were enjoined from continuing manipulative
activity, four cases involving transactions by the members of the
New York Stock Exchange and New York Curb Exchange were
referred to those Exchanges for consideration and action, and proceedings were instituted in one case for the suspension or expulsion
of a member of a national securities exchange and in three cases for
the revocation of broker-dealer registrations.

Record of Public Action Taken in Connection with Proceedings Brought to
Enforce the Anti-Manipulative Provisions of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.

During the past year, the Commission has taken formal public
action in the course of 11 proceedings to enforce the anti-manipulative
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The nature of
these proceedings and their status as of the close of the year are
briefly described below.
On February 15,1939, the Commission instituted proceedings under
Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to determine
whether the registration of Callahan Zinc-Lead Company common
stock $1 par value, a registered security on the New York Stock
Exchange, should be suspended or withdrawn. This action resulted
from an investigation into the trading in the stock of this company,
and was also based on a preliminary investigation which indicated
that reports filed by this company pursuant to Section 12 and Section
13 of such Act contained false and misleading statements of material
facts. On the same date, the Commission also authorized stop order
proceedings under Section 8 (d) of the Securities Act of 1933 to determine whether or not the effectiveness of registration statements filed
by this company should be suspended. At the close of the fiscal year,
both of these proceedings were pending.
On October 26, 1938, Norman W. Minuse, Joseph E. H. Pelletier,
and Russell Van Wyck Stuart were indicted by the Federal Grand
Jury of New York charged with conspiracy to violate Sections 9
(a) (1) and 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by the
manipulation of the Class A common stock of 'I'astyeast, Inc. listed

FIFTH

on the New York Curb Exchange. This action resulted from the
reference by the Commission to the Department of Justice of its files
on the investigation of transactions effected by these persons during
1935 and 1936. .As of June 30, 1939, the proceedings were still
pending.
On December 19, 1938, Harry J. Weisbaum, Edward J. Weisbaum,
and Otto Leudeking consented to being permanently enjoined by the
u. S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio from further
violation of Section 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This action resulted from an investigation of market transactions
effected by these persons during August 1938, in Weisbaum Bros.
Brower Co. common stock listed on the New York Curb Exchange.
On December 30, 1938, William P. Buckner, Jr., and William J.
Gillespie were indicted by the Federal Grand Jury for the Southern
District of New York, charged with mail fraud and conspiracy violations. This action resulted from an investigation of the activities
and transactions of these persons in Philippine Railway Co. 4%
bonds during 1938 and the reference of such case by the Commission
to the Department of Justice on November 21, 1938, for prosecution.
Following their conviction on June 30,1939, Federal Judge Henry W.
Goddard sentenced Buckner and Gillespie to 2 years and to 18 months,
respectively, in prison, and fined each of them $2,500. Felipe
Bueneamino, member of the Philippine Assembly, convicted on
conspiracy charges, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined
$5,000.'

On January 14, 1939, H. Walter Blumenthal consented to the issuance of a permanent injunction by the U. S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York against his further violating any
provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This action resulted from an investigation of his transactions during
1937 in Red Bank Oil Co. common stock listed on the New York
Curb Exchange.
On January 23, 1939, Klopstock & Co., Inc., of New York City
withdrew its registration as an over-the-counter broker and dealer.
The withdrawal occurred subsequent to the institution of proceedings
by the Commission to determine whether such registration should be
revoked or suspended. The proceedings were based on alleged violations of both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, which included alleged violations involved in the market
operations undertaken by Klopstock & Co., Inc., to facilitate the
underwriting and distribution of Austin Silver Mining Co. common
stock in 1936 and 1937. On January 13, 1938, the Commission
issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration

statement filed on February 8, 1937, by the Austin Silver Mining Co.
under the Securities Act of 1933. This action was based on proceedings under Section 8 (d) of the Securities Act of 1933 and upon preliminary facts obtained in ~
 trading investigation. This stop order
was lifted August 30, 1938.
On February 11, 1939, David' A. Schulte consented to being permanently enjoined by the U. S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York from further violations of Sections 9 (a) (1), (b)
and (c) and 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This
action resulted from an investigation of accounts maintained and
guaranteed by David A. Schulte and transactions by such accounts
during 1935, 1936, and 1937 in Schulte Retail Stores Co., Dunhill
International, Inc., Park & Tilford, and Phillip Morris, Ltd., Inc.,
securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Huylers of
Delaware, Inc., preferred stock listed on the New :York Curb Exchange.
On March 4, 1939, William E. Hutton, II, a partner of W. E.
Hutton & Co. and as such a member of the New York Stock Exchange, New York Curb Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Exchange,
Detroit Stock Exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange, Baltimore Stock
Exchange, Cincinnati Stock Exchange, and the Board of Trade of the
City of Chica:go, was suspended from membership on such exchanges
for a period of three months from March 15, 1939, and H. H. Michels,
a partner of William Cavalier & Co. and as such a member of the
N ew York Stock Exchange, New York Curb Exchange, San Francisco
Stock Exchange, Los Angeles Stock Exchange and the Board of
Trade of the City of Chicago, was suspended for one month commencing on March 15, 1939. These actions resulted from the institution of proceedings by the Commission under Section 19 (a) (3) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on November 13, 1936, based
upon an investigation of transactions by these persons in violation of
Sections 9 (a) (1) and 9 (a) (2) of that Act during 1935 and 1936 in
Atlas Tack Corporation common stock listed on the N ew York Stock
Exchange.
On March 24,1939, Junius A. Richards, a partner of Smith, Barney
& Co. and as such a member of the New York Stock Exchange, New
York Curb Exchange, Baltimore Stock Exchange, Chicago Stock
Exchange, Board of Trade of the City of Chieage, Boston Stock
Exchange, and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, was suspended from
membership on such exchanges for a period of 10 days from March
27 to April 5, 1939, inclusive. This action resulted from the institution of proceedings by the Commission on March 2, 1939, under
Section 19 (a) (3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based upon

an investigation of transactions effected by Richards during 1938 in
Simplicity Pattern Co., Inc., common stock listed on the New York
Curb Exchange for persons whom it was charged he had reason to
believe were violating provisions of Sections 9 (a) (1) and 9 (a) (2)
of that Act.
On May 19, 1939, J. J. Maschuch, President of Breeze Corporations,
Incorporated, and Douglas C. Hoff, an associate, were arrested and
subsequently indicted for perjury. This action, which was still pending on June 30, 1939, resulted from an investigation of the activities
and transactions of such persons in Breeze Corporations, Incorporated,
common stock listed on the N ew York Curb Exchange in connection
with which it was alleged false testimony was given.
On July 1, 1939, Robert R. Selembier, Jr., consented to being permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 9 (a) (1), 9
(a) (2) and 9 (a) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 following
a complaint entered on June 30, 1939, in the U. S. District Court for
the Southern. District of N ew York. This action resulted from an
investigation of the transactions and activities of Selembier during
1938 in the common and preferred stocks of Crystal Oil Refining
Corporation and H. C. Bohack, Inc., the Class B common stock of
Durham Hosiery Mills, Inc., and Ludlow Valve Manufacturing Co.
common stock, all listed on the New York Curb Exchange.
Complaints and Investigations.

The Commission, in its effort to protect investors, has continued
to use its facilities, directly and through public and private agencies,
to call attention t-o the many fraudulent and illegal devices too often
employed to defraud the investing public, and has encouraged the
filing of complaints by investors who feel they have been defrauded.
Most of the complaints are received by the Commission and its
regional offices directly from investors. However, many complaints
are submitted to the Commission through State Securities CQmmissions, State and Federal officials, and voluntary agencies, such as
Better Business Bureaus and Chambers of Commerce. A reply is
made to every complainant and, to the extent that the Commission's
p-owers and the subject matter permit, every complaint is investigated and every complainant given all possible assistance, together
with all available public information,"
At the beginning of the past :fiscal year 735 investigation and legal
cases, under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, were pending. During the year, 768 new cases have
been set up. Of these 1,503 cases, 730 were disposed of during the

In conjunction with the investigation of complaints the Commission
has established, through its Securities Violations Files, a vast amount
of information concerning fraudulent securities transactions by individuals and corporations.
These :files have been enlarged during
the past fiscal year by the addition of 6,257 items of information pertaining to existing :files, and the addition of 4,184 new names to such
:files. As of June 30, 1939, the Commission had assembled data concerning 32,660 persons or corporations against whom State or Federal
action had been taken in connection with the sale of securities.
Civil Proceedings.

During the past :fiscal year the Commission instituted 76 civil proceedings under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
Since its creation, the Commission has initiated 312 such proceedings
and disposed of 288. Of the 312 such proceedings, 288 were injunctive
actions, as a result of which 657 firms and individuals have been permanently enjoined. During the :fiscal year, 69 such actions were instituted against 186 persons. The 67 cases disposed of during the :fiscal
year resulted in injunctions against 155 persons.
While a number of the injunctions secured by the Commission were
issued upon consent of the defendants, many others were issued only
after a trial of the facts. With the exception of the case of Securities
and Exchange Oommission v. Gold Hub Mines Oompany (infra, p. 104),
the Commission was successful in every injunctive action prosecuted
by it during the fiscal year.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

A brief description and the status of the civil cases filed or pending
during the year ended June 30, 1939, are outlined in the tables com':'
prising Appendix VI of this report. A more detailed description of
some of the more important cases is set forth below.
Oklahoma-Texas Tnut v. Securities and Exchange Commission.On January 5, 1939, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Tenth Circuit unanimously affirmed a stop order issued by the
Commission suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement
filed by Oklahoma-Texas Trust covering an offering of 107,000
participating interests having a face value of $10 each. The order
reviewed was issued on September 23,1938, under Section 8 (d) of the
Securities Act, and is so far the only such order in the history of the
Commission to be reviewed on the merits by any court.
The court, in its opinion (100 F. (2d) 888), upheld the constitutionality of the statute, rejected the registrant's contention that a
stop order could not be entered after all of the securities sought to be
registered had been sold, and affirmed the action of the Commission
in refusing to permit the registrant to withdraw its registration statement. The court also affirmed the Commission's :findings that one
who instigated and had a substantial interest in the outcome of the
organization of a corporation was a promotor, even though not a
participant in the mechanics of organization; that the registrant did
not, as stated, intend to render quarterly reports to security holders;
that certain pending litigation had not been disclosed; that engineers'
reports included in the registration statement were inaccurate and
misleading; and that the present revenues from the properties to be
acquired by the Trust had been misstated.

Securit.ies and Exchange Commission v: O'Hara Be-Election Committee et al.-Dn June 16,1939, the Commission commenced an action
in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
seeking to restrain the so-called O'Hara Re-Election (or Proxy)
Committee, Walter E. O'Hara, William A. Needham, George Cohen,
and Nelson Warren Moore from violating Section 14 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 by using the mails to solicit proxies from stockholders of Narragansett Racing Association, Inc., by means of letters
of solicitation which did not comply with rules promulgated by the
Commission under authority of the statute, and from exercising
proxies thus obtained at the annual meeting of the Association.
On June 27, 1939, the court, after hearing, issued a preliminary
injunction granting the relief prayed for and restraining the Association from holding its annual meeting before a specified date in order
to afford time to obtain new proxies.
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Associated Gas &: Electric
Company et al.-In the course of the administration of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act, it came to the attention of the Com-

FIFTH

mission that the Associated Gas & Electric Company was engaged in
requesting holders of its 5~% Investment Certificates, due November
15, 1938, to extend the maturity of those certificates to November
15, 1939, or November 15, 1943, the indueemeats being an increased
interest rate or part payment of the principal. No attempt was made
by the Company to register the securities under the Securities Act of
1933 or to file a declaration under Section 7 of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935.
The Commission commenced an action in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York to enjoin the extension
of the maturity of these notes under these circumstances, alleging
that such extension involved the sale of a new security to the same
extent as an exchange of new bonds for old. The complaint charged
Violation of the Securities Act and of various provisions of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act. The court, on August 29, 1938,
granted a preliminary injunction based on Section 6 (a) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act, enjoining the extensions as the issuance and sale of securities of a registered holding company unless the
Company first complied with Section 7 of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act. On appeal to the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit, this was the sole issue, and the position of the Commission was again sustained. By stipulation, the
injunction was made permanent.
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. WiUiam P. Lawson.-Qn
August 19, 1938, William P. Lawson of Baltimore, Maryland, a
securities broker and dealer, doing business as William P. Lawson &
Company, was enjoined by the United States District Court for the
District of Maryland from continuing to engage in acts and practices
violating the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
insolvency provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The court stated in its opinion (24 F. Supp. 360) that what Lawson
did
<1* ... ... was from time to time to sell securities of some of his customers
which he had purchased for thcm (and for which they had in many cases fully
paid) or which he was otherwise holding for their accounts not in default, without
due authority, and to keep them in ignorance of the fact that he had done so;
and to convert the proceeds of the sale of the securities to his own use, while he
was insolvent. This he did from time to time over a period of eight months with
respect to the securities of numerous customers. At the time of filing the bill of
complaint, he had sold or hypothecated securities of his customers and was short
on securities which he should have had in his possession for delivery to them
to the amount in value of $78,716.38. The proof shows that in one or more
instances after the securities had been sold, the customer was required to deposit
furthee-sums of money as margin on his account, and in one or more instances
dividends were forwarded as having been paid on securities which had previously
been sold."

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Seeuriiie« and Exchange Oommission

v. Timetrust,

Incorporated,

et al.-On April 5, 1939, the Commission brought an action for an
injunction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to restrain Timetrust, Incorporated, Bank of
America National Trust & Savings Association, Meredith Parker,
Ralph W. Wood, H. E. Blanchett, A. P. Giannini, L. Mario Giannini,
and John M. Grant from continuing to violate Section 17 (a) (2) of
the Securities Act of 1933 by engaging in alleged fraudulent acts and
practices in the sale of Timetrust certificates and Bank of America
stock. Each of the defendants moved to dismiss, for a more definite
statement or bill of particulars, and to strike alleged redundant and
immaterial matter from the Commission's complaint.
On June 10, 1939, the court held on these motions that Timetrust
certificates were securities as defined in the statute; that Section 17
applied to fraudulent sales of securities by use .of the mails wholly
within one State; that the Commission's complaint conformed fully
with the new Rules of Civil Procedure; that the allegations charging
the defendants Grant, A. P. Giannini, L. Mario Giannini, and Bank
of America with aiding and abetting the actions of Timetrust were
not defective; and that since a simple and expeditious method of discovery was provided by the new Rules of Civil Procedure, a more
definite statement or bill of particulars, which would delay trial,
should be denied.
Seeurisiee and Exchange Oommission. v. Univer8al Service A88ociation
et al.-Qn June 23, 1939, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit unanimously affirmed an order of the District
Court for the Northern District of illinois enjoining Universal Service
Association and certain individuals from violating the registration
and fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the sale of subscriptions and memberships in the Association and in the Universal
Order of Plenoorats," A petition for rehearing is pending.
While the appeal was pending, the defendants continued their activities, and on June 22, 1939, in proceedings instigated by the Commission, the Association was adjudged in contempt of court and was
fined $1,000, and C. Franklin Davis, one of the promoters, was sentenced to serve six months in jail. From this judgment an appeal
is pending before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit.
Resources Oorporation International v. Securities and Exchange Oommi88ion.-Qn July 5, 1938, Resources Corporation International, a
Delaware corporation controlling other corporations owning, leasing,
and selling timber and ranch lands in Mexico, brought an action in
the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to

enjoin the Commission from holding further hearings or taking other
action in a proceeding instituted by it on March 21, 1938, to determine
whether a stop order should issue suspending the effectiveness of a
registration statement filed by the plaintiff on February 28, 1938,
and from engaging in alleged unlawful activity which the plaintiff
claimed was injuring its business. The plaintiff also prayed that a
mandatory injunction issue requiring the Commission to vacate an
order, issued in the course of the stop order proceeding, denying
plaintiff leave to withdraw its registration statement, and that an
order issue directing the Commission to return the plaintiff's records.
In a memorandum opinion filed on July 19, 1938 (24 F. Supp. 580),
the court dismissed the complaint, holding that the Commission's
action in denying plaintiff leave to withdraw was interlocutory, that
it could avail itself of a method of review provided by the Securities
Act of 1933 when a final order issued and that the statutory method
of review was exclusive," From this ruling the plaintiff appealed .
.On February 27, 1939, the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia affirmed the order of the trial court (103 F.
(2d) 929). In so doing the court distinguished the case from Jones v.
Securities and Exchange Oommission (298 U. S. 1), and held that the
plaintiff did not have an unqualified right to withdraw after its
registration statement became effective, and that the Commission
could properly find that withdrawal would not be consistent with the
public interest, notwithstanding the fact that the stock covered by the
registration statement constituted only a small part of the total issue
and that none had been sold prior to the filing of the application
for withdrawal.
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Cultivated Oyster Farms Oorporation et al.-Qn March 22, 1939, Judge Louie W. Strum of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida signed an
order permanently enjoining Cultivated Oyster Farms Corporation
and William Lee Popham from violating the registration and fraud
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the sale of interests in a
project, the alleged object of which was the cultivation and marketing
of oysters. The court found the defendant's promises of profit were
so exaggerated that they were prima facie fraudulent.
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Fidelity Investment Association. On December 14, 1938, the Commission commenced an action
for an injunction in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan in Detroit against Fidelity Investment Association of Wheeling, West Virginia, alleging that the defendant had
engaged in fraudulent practices in violation of the Securities Act of

1933 in connection with the sale of investment contract certificates
sold on a deferred payment plan. The complaint alleged that the
defendant, operating through 58 district offices, had sold approximatelY$600,000,000 face amount of certificates throughout the country,.
on which some 60,000 persons were then making monthly payments.
Acting upon the Commission's verified complaint, accompanying
affidavits, and the defendant's consent to the entry of a final judgment,.
the court, on December 22, 1938, permanently enjoined the defendant,
its officers, directors, and employees, in selling the contracts, from
depositing with West Virginia or any other State insufficient securities.
or securities which did not meet deposit requirements; failing to segregate and maintain suflicient statutory deposits against appropriate liabilities; failing to create and maintain separate contract reserve funds orpermitting cash overdrafts between various funds; failing to maintain
cash reserves; transferring to defendant's general fund gains belonging
to contract funds, or transferring securities from one fund to another;
paying dividends except from earned surplus; purchasing securities.
to the personal benefit of anyone connected wth the defendant; and
maintaining subsidiaries to conceal the nature or amount of indebtedness or investments.
In addition, the defendant was enjoined from making false or
misleading statements with respect to its financial statements, the.
extent or availability of its reserves or assets, the cost of its portfoliosecurities, the rating and liquidity of its investments, its earnings orfinancial condition, its method of meeting maturities, the costs of thecontract certificates to investors, the amounts payable to or withdrawable by investors, and the yield to investors.
Bank of America National, Trust & Savings Association v. William
O. Douglas et al.-Qn January 16, 1939, the Bank of America National
Trust & Savings Association, a national banking association, brought
an action in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia against individual members of the Commission and certain of its officers. The action was an outgrowth of a proceeding
instituted by the Commission on November 22, 1938, under Section
19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to determine
whether it was necessary or appropriate for the protection of in-vestors to suspend or withdraw the registration of the $2 par value.
stock of Transamerica Corporation, which corporation, during the.
years 1934-1936, owned all of the capital stock of the plaintiff bank.
The purpose of the action was to restrain the defendants from investigating its affairs, attempting by subpena to secure its books and
records, and from publicizing information concerning the plaintiff"
contained in a national bank examiner's reports made ava1l8.ble to.

the Commission by the Secretary of the Treasury. The plaintiff
also sought a declaratory judgment that neither the Federal Reserve
Act, the National Bank Act, nor the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
authorized the release or publication of the bank examiner's reports.
The defendants moved to dismiss the action, asserting that the court
was without jurisdiction and that neither the action of the- Secretary
of the Treasury nor the Commission was contrary to law.
On January 31, 1939, the court, after hearing, held that it had
jurisdiction and that the action was not prematurely brought; that
although the Commission intended to make an appraisal and valuation of a substantial portion of the plaintiff's assets and to investigate its reserves, such action did not constitute the exercise of any
visitorial power over the bank; that even if it were visitorial, it was
not unlawful; and that the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized
to furnish the reports to the Commission for its official use. Judgment was accordingly entered dismissing the complaint, from which
the plaintiff took an appeal.
On May 8, 1939, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia handed down an opinion, in part affirming and in
part reversing the decision of the District Court. The Court of
Appeals held that the delivery to the Commission by the Secretary
of the Treasury of the Examiner's reports was authorized and legal;
that their use in proceedings to obtain the necessary facts and information whereby to carry out the investigatory function of the Commission was proper; that except to the extent necessary to carry out
the purpose mentioned, the reports should be treated as confidential;
and that the subpenas were unreasonable and should not be enforced,
since they required the plaintiff to remove so many of its books and
records from San Francisco to Washington that compliance therewith
would "for all practical purposes, close the Bank." The cause was
remanded to the District Court with directions to vacate the decree
dismissing the complaint, but with instructions that, since the subpenas had expired, no injunction need issue.
In re Verser-Olay 00. et al.-On August 31,1938, the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed an order (98 F.
(2d) 859) of the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma
directing E. C. Clay, as President of Verser-Clay Company and the
Mid-Continent Crude Oil Purchasing Company, to appear before an
officer of the Commission and produce certain books, records, and
documents of those companies which he had refused to produce in
obedience to subpoenas duces tecum issued on November 18, 1935,
in an investigation of alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933.
The basis of the respondent's refusal to produce the records of

189101-40--8

104

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the companies was that they were being sought for use in a pending
criminal proceeding in the District of Columbia in which he was a
defendant, and that they might incriminate him. To this argument
the Circuit Court of Appeals replied:

"* * * Clay can not claim the constitutional privilege for the acts of the
corporations.
(citing cases) It may be true that there is something in the corporate books and documents that shows personal acts of Clay that tend to incriminate him. If so, he had an opportunity to present them to the District Judge
and ask that he be protected in his constitutional right, but he sought no protection
in that respect.
It is not claimed that when he was on the witness stand any
question was asked the answer to which would tend to incriminate him. Clearly
the privilege asserted by him does not extend to the two corporations.

* * *"

Securities and Exchange Oommission v, Gold Hub Mines Oompany et

al.-On January 9, 1939, the Commission instituted an action for
injunction in the United States District Court for the District of
Colorado against Gold Hub Mines Company and others, alleging
that the defendants, in violation of Section 17 (a) of ~he Securities
Act of 1933, were inducing sales of Gold Hub stock by means of
untrue and misleading statements concerning the value and extent
of certain gold and tungsten deposits, the need for erecting a mill, and
the reason for abandoning certain mining operations.
On January 26, 1939, the court, after hearing much expert testimony on both sides, dismissed the complaint, holding in substance
that since the experts differed as to the character of the deposits, and
since the statements made by the defendants were, according to his
views, very largely expressions of opinion not entirely without justification, the Commission had not proved its case.
Secuiities and Exchange Oommission v, Edward A. Sloane

et al.-

On April 15, 1939, Edward A. Sloane and Edward P. Tuber consented
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
lllinois to the entry of a judgment restraining them individually and
as co-partners, doing business under the name of A. D. Lowe & Associates, from effecting over-the-counter transactions in securities
without having registered under the broker-dealer provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and from inducing their customers,
by means of deceptive and fraudulent devices and contrivances, to sell
securities which they owned and apply the proceeds to the purchase
of whiskey warehouse receipts. The Commission's complaint charged
that the defendants misrepresented the value of the securities delivered
to them for sale and the value of the whiskey warehouse receipts
purchased.
Seeuriiie« and Exchange Oommission v. E. 8. Hansberger.-Qn
March 2, 1939, the Commission instituted an action in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging

FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

105

that E. S. Hansberger, individually and as trustee, was engaged in
selling securities, entitled "Founder Member Certificates, Producers
Finance Corporation, in Process of Organization," through the mails
without the same having been registered under the Securities Act of
1933, and requested the issuance of an injunction restraining further
sales.
The defendant contended that the securities were exempt from
registration under Rule 200 of the Commission's General Rules and
Regulations under the Securities Act of 1933, which rule in general
exempts offerings under $30,000. In rejecting this contention and
'granting the injunction, the court, on April 28, 1939, held that the
securities represented interests or rights of participation in a trust, a
substantial portion of the assets of which consisted of oil and gas
leasehold interests and rights, and that subparagraph (5) of Rule 200
specifically excluded from the application of the Rule securities of
this type (27 F. Supp. 846).
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. James R. Macon et al.-Qn
February 1, 1939, the United States District Court for the District
of Colorado, in an action instituted by the Commission on November
1, 1938, to enjoin violations of Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of
1933 in the sale of Butler Oil & Refining Company common stock,
handed down an opinion granting an injunction restraining James R.
Macon, Eric Schley, H. G. Bartholomew, Butler Oil & Refining Company, and Macon & Company, Inc., from making untrue and misleading statements in the sale of the stock concerning the likelihood
of a new gusher being discovered on defendant's property, the results
of tests thereon, the quantity of oil and gas discovered, and arrangements made with a purchasing company to pipe the same.
Securities and Euhange Oommission v, R. H. Oarleton et al.-In
this case, a companion case to 8ecurities and Exchange Oommission v,
James R. Macon et al., instituted by the Commission on the same
day (November 1, 1938), the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado, on February 3, 1939, handed down an opinion
granting an injunction restraining R. H. Carleton and Davenport &
Company, Inc., from violating Section 17 (a) (2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, in the sale of Butler Oil & Refining Company common
stock by making untrue and misleading statements similar in character to some of those involved in the Macon case.
Boise Petroleum Oorporation and O. 8. Hassler.-on June 7, 1937,
Boise Petroleum Corporation and its sales manager, C. S. Hassler,
were fined $500 and $300, respectively, in the United States District
Court for the District of Idaho for criminal contempt arising out of

106

SECURITIES AND EXOHANGE COMMISSION

a failure to observe a decree restraining them from violating the
registration and fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the
sale of certain oil and gas leasehold interests and from acting as
brokers or dealers in securities unless registered as such under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.8
On October 8, 1938, the defendants were again found guilty of
contempt by the same court. For this second offense Hassler was
sentenced to serve six months in jail and :fined $500; Boise Petroleum
Corporation and C. S. Hassler, Inc., were :fined $250 each; and John
T. Glass was fined $500.
John Lawless, Jr. v. Securities and Exchange Oommission et al.-Qn
April 11, 1939, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit handed down the first decision reviewing action of the
Commission under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.9
International Paper and Power Company had filed with the Commission an application asking for (1) a report "in the manner provided
in Section 11 (g) (2) of said Act" upon a plan for change in capitalization which the company desired to propose for the approval and authorization of its shareholders, and (2) for an order exempting the company
from the provisions of Sections 4 (a) and 6 (a) and all other sections of
the Act applicable to the proposed plan. On September H, 1937,1°
John Lawless, Jr., a stockholder of International Paper and Power
Company who had appeared before the Commission in opposition to
the application, filed his petition for review of the action of the Commission in issuing the report and order applied for.
At the time International Paper and Power Company filed its
application with regard to the plan for change in capitalization, and
at the time of the Commission's report and order thereon, there were
pending before the Commission two other applications by the company, one for exemption under Section 3 (a) (5) of the Act, and the
other for an order under Section 2 (a) (8) of the Act declaring that
certain other companies were not its subsidiaries. The pendency of
these applications, if filed in good faith, served under the statute to
afford the company a temporary exemption from the requirements of
the Act. At the times in question, therefore, the company had neither
registered as a holding company nor been declared not to be a holding
company. 11

In the proceedings for review it was contended, as it had been
before the Commission, that the company, although an unregistered
holding company, was justified in seeking Commission action with
regard to the plan for change in capitalization because of the fact that
if the temporary exemption which the company claimed to enjoy
should be terminated after the plan had become effective and after
the change in securities had been completed, doubt would be cast
upon the legality of the securities proposed to be issued under the
plan. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that
"unregistered companies" are not entitled to the benefits conferred
by the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and that therefore the Commission was without power or authority to issue the
order in question.
Accordingly, the court vacated the Commission's
order and remanded the cause to the Commission for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion."
Austin Silver Mining Oompany v. Securities and Exchange Oommission.-Dn July 13, 1938, the Commission issued an order under
Section 8 (d) of the Securities Act of 1933 suspending the effectiveness
of a registration statement filed by Austin Silver Mining Company.
Thereafter, on August 6 and 26, 1938, the company filed amendments designed to eliminate. the deficiencies upon which the Commission's order was based, and on August 30, 1938, the Commission
declared that the registration statement had been amended in accordance with the stop order and directed that the stop order should
cease to be effective.
After the stop order had thus been lifted, the company, on September 10, 1938, filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia for review of the record, order, and
proceedings before the Commission.
The Commission moved to
dismiss the petition for review on the ground that since the stop order
had been lifted prior to the filing of the petition for review the
questions raised by the petition for review had become moot. The
question whether a stop order which has been lifted following the
. filing of amendments can nevertheless be reviewed by an appellate
court was thus presented for the first time in any court.
On March 4, 1939, the Court of Appeals denied the motion to
dismiss without opinion. The Commission then filed a memorandum
requesting the Court to issue an opinion setting forth its reasons
for so ruling. On May 24, 1939, the court set aside its earlier order,
and granted the motion to dismiss the petition for review, stating:
Upon re-examination and reconsideration of the Commission's petition to
dismiss, we are of the opinion that the action of the Commissionin annulling its

\

Houston Naiural Gas Oorporaiion v, Securities and Exchange Oommission.-0n
November 10, 1938, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals
dismissed a petition by the Houston Natural Gas Corporation to
review an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission denying
the petitioner an exemption as a holding company from the provisions
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The court held
that the order of the Commission is " ...
negative in form and substance" and that under applicable cases decided by the United States
Supreme Court, orders of this character are not subject to review
(100 F. 2d 5). The petitioner did not appeal from the decision of
the Circuit Court of Appeals. Subsequently, in cases involving the
Federal Power Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, the United States Supreme Court overruled the "negative
order" doctrine, and held that such orders are now reviewable.
Criminal Proceedings

Up to July 1, 1939, 1096 persons had been indicted in 158 cases
which had been referred by the Commission to the Department of
Justice for criminal prosecution. During the fiscal year, 46 indictments were returned against 285 persons. Fifty-one additional
cases were referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. In 98 cases disposed of before the close of the fiscal year, 403
defendants were convicted. In 39 cases which had been referred to
the Department of Justice, 95 persons were convicted during the past
fiscal year.
In addition to the foregoing, seven persons were indicted during the
past fiscal year for perjury alleged to have been committed in the
course of Commission investigations; one case involving one of these
defendants was disposed of during the fiscal year and resulted in a
conviction. 13
Up to July 1, 1939, the Commission had secured the citation of 19
defendants in 5 proceedings for contempt of injunctions which had
been secured by the Commission. Nine of these defendants were
found guilty of contempt of court and sentenced; three were found
guilty during the past fiscal year.
A brief description and the status of the criminal cases filed or pending during the year ended June 30, 1939, are outlined in the tables
comprising Appendix VI of this report. A more detailed description
of some of the more important cases follows.

Kopald-Quinn &: Oompany et 01. v. United States.-Dn February 16,
1939, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the
conviction of four defendants, Joseph R. Mendelson, Leonard I. Sutterman, Joseph N. Sherman, and Kopald-Quinn & Company, for violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and conspiracy to violate that Act.
The petitions for certiorari were denied by the Supreme Court of the
United States on May 15, 1939. Sherman, Mendelson, and Sutterman had been sentenced to serve 5 years on 1 count and 2 years on
another count, to run concurrently,
Kopald-Quinn & Company
was fined $5,000 on each of 11 counts in the indictment.
The sentences of two other defendants, Joseph Rieebaum and
Gould & Company, were affirmed in part and reversed in part. Ricebaum had been sentenced to serve 3 years on count 1 and 2 years on
count 15, to run concurrently. Gould & Company had been fined
$5,000 on both counts 1 and 15. The convictions of Ricebaum and
Gould & Company were reversed as to count 1, but affirmed as to
count 15.
The defendants had been charged with employment of a scheme to
defraud, involving the sale of securities through various investment
firms and corporations by means of false representations and manipulative activities. The use of the mails, charged in the indictment,
was the mailing of confirmation slips. The defendants argued that
these slips were not used "in the sale" of the securities and were not
fraudulent per se and consequently the mailing was not sufficient to
bring the transactions within the scope of Section 17 of the Securities
Act of 1933. The Court of Appeals held that such a construction
unduly narrowed the language used in the Securities Act and unduly
limited its scope and effect.
Troutman et 01. v, United States.-Dn December 8, 1938, the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the conviction of
Percival H. Troutman, President of the Union Trust Company of
Denver, Colorado, and Ralph L. Young, President of the Bankers
National Securities Corporation. Petitions for certiorari were denied
by the Supreme Court of the United States on March 13,1939.
Troutman had been sentenced to serve five years in Leavenworth
and fined $2,500. Young was sentenced to serve 15 months for
conspiracy. The indictment charged that the defendants had made
false representations in the sale of stock agreements and that operations of the companies under the control of the defandants were largely
carried on by means of the so-called "sell and switch" device, by means
of which large numbers of persons in many states were induced to
switch out of one kind of trust unit into another unit or stock of
corporations affiliated with the Union Trust Company.
The defendants contended that the count charging violation of the
Securities Act of 1933 was faulty in that it accused the defendants of

110

SECURITmS

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

violating all three sub-paragraphs of Section 17 (a) of that Act. The
court held that where the statute denounces several acts as a crime
they may be charged in one indictment or a single count if connected
in the conjunctive. The court also held that it was proper to admit
evidence of the failure of the Union Deposit Company to forward
to the trustee for safekeeping monies collected from investors as it
was required to do by the terms of the trust indentures. The court
held that such evidence was clearly admissible for the purpose of
shedding light upon the good or bad faith with which the plan to
sell the stock was formed.
United.States v. Norman Berry et al.-Eight officers and salesmen
of Norman Berry & Company of Detroit, Michigan, were convicted
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan of violations of the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
On December 30, 1938, and January 5, 1939, the defendants were
sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from one to seven years,
and six of the defendants received fines of $1,000 each. An additional
defendant, Samuel Lachman, pleaded nolo contendere and was sentenced to serve three years imprisonment.
It was charged in the indictment that the customers of Norman
Berry & Company were persuaded by means of misrepresentations
to purchase well known securities listed on the N ew York Stock
Exchange and other national securities exchanges through that
company, pay one-half of the purchase price in cash-and arrange to
pay the balance through a loan agreement with United Acceptance
Corporation, an affiliate which was insolvent. The securities were
then pledged with United Acceptance Corporation as collateral for
the loan and, without the .knowledge or consent of the customer,
were sold out and the proceeds converted by the defendants. The
indictment also charged that many of the customers' orders were
"bucketed," that is, the customers' orders were accepted but never
executed, and the money paid in by the customers kept by the
defendants.
McKesson &: Robbins, Inc.-Qn December 15, 1938, the notorious
Musica brothers, together with McKesson & Robbins, Inc., were
indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York, for violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in
connection with false and misleading statements made in annual
reports filed with the N ew York Stock Exchange and the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The statements were charged to be
false in that they reflected fictitious assets, consisting of large items
of inventory and accounts receivable, which did not exist. Philip
Musiea, alias F. Donald Coster, president of the company, committed suicide. George Musics, alias George Dietrich, secretary of

FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT-

111

the company, and Arthur Musics, alias George Bernard, pleaded
guilty.
On March 30, ,1939, another indictment was returned charging John
H. McGloon, Vice-President, Horace B. Merwin, Director and Treasurer, Rowley W. Phillips, Director, Benjamin Simon, Leonard Jenkins,
John O. Jenkins and the Musioa brothers with violations of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, conspiracy, and mail fraud. This
indictment charged that the defendants planned and conspired to
inflate the assets of McKesson and Robbins and affiliated corporations
by means of fictitious purchases and sales, and that they fraudulently
caused the companies to payout
fees and commissions to various
other companies for services which were not performed.
It was further charged that the defendants caused to be paid dividends and pre-tended that these dividends were being paid out of earnings and
profits, when, in fact, the earnings were in whole or in part fictitious,
and that the defendants participated in the :filing of financial reports
which included fictitious items of inventory, accounts receivable,
cash in banks, sales, earnings, and profits, all for the purpose of
deceiving the security holders of the company.
United States v. Parkinson.-On March 29, 1939, J. B. Parkinson
of Dallas, Texas, was sentenced in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Texas to serve 2 years in the Southwestern
Reformatory for violation of the fraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933. Parkinson pleaded guilty to a 10 count indictment
which charged that the defendant operated a "bucket shop" in the
city of Houston, Texas. The indictment charged that the defendant
represented that he was in the legitimate securities brokerage business,
sent out confirmations of the execution of orders, and credited customers with dividends, when, in fact, he never executed the orders and
never purchased any stock for the customers.
Parkinson also operated
branch offices at Austin, San Antonio, Port Arthur, Beaumont, and
Luling, Texas.
United States v. Gage.-On February 16, 1939, E. P. Gage was
convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for a violation of the Mail Fraud Statute in an indictment which charged him with engaging in the "advance fee" or "front
money" racket.
Gage held himself out as a specialist in the raising
of capital for small businesses by the sale of stock and the registering
of such stock issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
He was sentenced to serve a year and a day and placed on probation
for 5 years.
United States v. Whealton et al.-After
a trial lasting more than
2 months, M. F. Whealton, Philip L. Coffin, Jr., Whealton Company,
Inc., and Commonwealth Trust Company were convicted in the
United States District Court for New Jersey of using the mails to

112

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISS:rtm.

defraud in the sale of oil royalty trust certificates. The defendants
formed a trust, put oil properties into it at large secret profits to
themselves, and supplied the trustee with funds not earned by the
trust so as to permit payment by the trustee of monthly dividends,
reports of which were disseminated to certificate holders. Sentences
were imposed as follows: Whealton, 2~ years; Coffin, 1 year and a
day; Whealton Company, Inc., $10,000 fine; and Commonwealth
Trust Company, $4,000 fine. An appeal has been taken from these
sentences.
United States v. Rogers et al.-On March 23, 1939, Nathan Rogers,
William W. Rogers, Landry P. Locke, and Ralph A. Buchele pleaded
guilty, and Albert G. Kleinschmidt pleaded nolo contendere, to an
indictment charging them with violations of the Securities Act of
1933 and of the Mail Fraud Statute in the conduct of the business
of N. L. Rogers and Company, Inc., a brokerage company of Peoria,
lllinois. The indictment charged them with "bucketing" customers'
orders and the conversion of customers' securities to their own benefit.
Rogers was sentenced to a 5-year term and the other defendants
were placed on probation for 3 years.
United States v. Jefferson et al.-Qn December 10, 1938, Robert J.
Jefferson, Perry R. Smith, Kenneth C. Neierdiercks, and Skyring
Thorne Smith were sentenced in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York following their pleas of guilty to an
indictment charging them with violations of the fraud section of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Mail Fraud Statute. The indictment
charged them with the fraudulent sale of the stock of the Carnation
Gold Mining Company, Ltd. Jefferson was sentenced to serve 1 year
and 1 day and placed on probation for 3 years; Perry R. Smith was
sentenced to serve 1 year and 1 day and placed on probation for 5

probation for 5 years; and Skyring Thorne Smith was sentenced to
serve 6 months, which sentence was suspended, and he was placed on
probation for 3 years.

T. Stone and Harold F. Stone, of New York City, and John G.
Anderson, E. T. Shaw, and Sam G. Kennedy, of Knoxville, 'I'enn.,
were convicted of violations of the Securities Act of 1933, after 7
weeks of trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Tennessee. All defendants were sentenced to 7 years
imprisonment. The defendants were charged with making false
representations in connection with the sale of stock of Television and
Electric Corporation of America and Television and Projector Corporation. The Stones were underwriters for the stock and the other
three defendants were dealers or sub-distributors. The dealers sold
the stock to a large number of investors in 26 states. The indictment

FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

113

charged that the defendants falsely represented that the Company
was on an earning basis, had developed a receiving set for general
home use, and that the stock was to be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.
The defendants have :filed a notice of appeal.
United States v. Buckner et al.-William
P. Buckner, Jr., Felipe
Buencamino, and William J. Gillespie were found guilty in New
York of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the operations
of a committee for the protection of holders of Philippine Railway
Company bonds."
Two other defendants, C. Wesley Turner and
John Stewart Hyde, were acquitted.
The indictment charged that
the defendants represented to the public that they would negotiate
for the redemption of the bonds at or about their face value, and
received contributions from holders of the bonds which were to be
used for the payment of the necessary committee expenses, when, in
fact, it was planned on the part of the defendants to convert these
contributions, and to conceal from the holders of the bonds the true
status of the negotiations for the redemption of the securities. At the
trial it was shown that Buckner had spent large sums of money,
contributed by the bondholders, in lobbying activities and in attempts
improperly to influence action by the Philippine Government.
United States v. Raubay et al.-8even
officers and employees of
Acceptance and Exchange Corporation and Comanche Mining and
Reduction Company were convicted in the United States District

Exchange Corporation.
Paul B. Roubay, Treasurer, was sentenced
to a total of 6* years imprisonment, and M. E. Waggoner was given
a term of 4 years imprisonment.
The other defendants found guilty
were placed on probation for 2 years. The indictment charged that
the defendants falsely represented that the Comanche Mining and
Reduction Company had on deposit gold and silver bullion of great
value available as collateral for trade acceptances, which had been
issued by the defendants in the face amount of $1,169,000, that the
trade acceptances were amply secured by the indemnity bonds, that
Acceptance and Exchange Corporation had a net worth of over $19,000,000, and that Comanche Mining had a net worth of over $9,000,000. It was further charged that defendants would pretend to make
loans to members of the public which they never intended to fulfill,
and that they procured and misappropriated
an advance fee of 10
percent of the loans. Roubay and Waggoner have taken appeals.

SECURITms

AND "EXCHANGE COMMISSION

was improperly held by the United States Commissioner for removal
and trial under an indictment in the District Court for the Western
District of Pennsylvania.
The writ was accompanied by a petition
for a writ of certiorari to review the removal proceedings. The
Government contended that Platt had waived his right to review the
ruling of the Commissioner by electing to give bail for his appearance
and trial in the Pennsylvania District Court, which position was
sustained by the court. The court went on to consider the evidence
submitted to the Commissioner and held that such proof justified the
order of removal.
The indictment, returned February 22, 1938, charged Platt and
six others with violations of the Securities Act of 1933, in connection
with the sale of the stock of the Backbone Gold Mining Company
by means of representation with respect to the rising price of that
stock in the over-the-counter market and omissions to state the extent
of the influence of the defendants on the market price of that stock.
On June 15, 1939, Platt, together with John J. McKee, former
aeeountant-investigator with the Securities and Exchange Commission, were indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States of and
concerning its governmental function of administering the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The indictment
charged that the conspiracy involved the acceptance by McKee from
Platt of sums of money and other presents, rewards, and loans during
the period of McKee's employment with the Commission, and that,
in return, McKee would counsel and advise Platt with respect to
ways and means of defeating an investigation to determine whether
Platt and others had violated the provisions of the Securities Act of
1933.

RULES AND REGULATIONS

. During the fiscal year ended June 30., 1939, the Commission continued work on the revision of its rules, regulations, and forms pert~
to the registration of securities and periodic reports by issuers
under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted 3 new rules

116

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and 4 amendments to 3 existing rules under the Securities Act of 1933
and adopted 11 new rules and 7 amendments to 6 existing rules under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The new accounting handbook, referred to in the Commission's
Fourth Annual Report, governing the form and content of financial
statements :filedwith registration statements, applications and reports
under both Acts, was virtually completed. Substantial progress also
was made in the revision of the forms for registration and reporting.
Drafts of three forms for registration of securities under the Securities
Act of 1933were transmitted to a considerable number of accountants,
lawyers, investment bankers, security analysts, and other interested
persons for criticism. One of these forms is designed for registration
of oil or gas interests or rights, one for securities of fixed investment
trusts, and one for securities of recently organized issuers. These
proposed forms were being re-examined at the end of the fiscal year in
the light of the criticisms received thereon.
It might be well to recall that the first registration form employed
under the Securities Act of 1933 was devised in consultation with
some of the country's most experienced lawyers and accountants who
for years had been counsel to issuers and underwriters. Since it was
early recognized that attention had to be given to the specialized
requirements of different classes of issuers inasmuch as, for example,
questions designed to elicit useful information from a long-established
manufacturing company would scarcely be adaptable to a new promotional mining enterprise, experts in particular industries were likewise drafted to assist in the preparation of initial forms and rules
which would be suited to the special needs of their respective fields.
The continuation of this practice of utilizing the assistance of all such
experts in the Commission's work on the substantial revision of the
whole schedule of forms is calculated to make the prospective revisions
most serviceable both to investors and registrants, and in the end it
will sharpen questions used therein to the conditions of particular
types of investors. The entire structure of forms and related rules
and regulations is designed to secure a fair and, at the same time,
business-like presentation of material information required under
the statutes.
On November 21, 1938, the Commission adopted a new ru1e (Rule
522) authorizing the omission from registration statements :filedunder
the Securities Act of 1933, and from prospectuses relating to securities
so registered, of the details of any tentative plan relating to Section
11 (b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 which was
submitted informally to the Commission by the registrant or ~ny of
its parents or subsidiaries prior to December 1, 1938, pursuant to the
Commission's request of .August 3, 1938. The purpose of the rule isto relieve registrants of the additional burden ~f thus setting forth_

FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

117

the details of such tentative plans, permitting them in such cases
instead to make merely an appropriate reference in the registration
statement and the prospectus to the provisions of Section 11 (b) and
a statement to the effect that such tentative plan has been, or was to
be, so submitted.
On February 9, 1939, the Commission adopted a new rule (Rule
827) under the Securities Act of 1933, requiring prospectuses relating
to securities registered for public sale to contain a statement of intention to stabilize the price of the securities, where the issuer or any
of the underwriters has grounds to believe that stabilization is contemplated. This rule was adopted concurrently with Rule X-17A-2,
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires certain
daily reports regarding stabilizing activities, and which is discussed
elsewhere in this report.»
During the fiscal year, a few other changes were made in the existing
rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 193~relating to the registration of securities on exchanges and reports by issuers
of such securities. One of these changes resulted from the necessity
of prescribing the appropriate form for registration of securities of
motor carriers making annual reports to the Interstate Commerce
Commission pursuant to Section 220 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935.
ACTIVITms OF THE COMMISSION IN THE FIELD OF ACCOUNTING
AND AUDITING

Events during the past fiscal year, such as the McKesson & Robbins
scandal and the Transamerica investigation, have added materially
to the problems confronting the Commission on matters pertaining to
accounting and auditing.
Until recently, the Commission's interest in accounting has been
directed toward the improvement of corporate reporting of financial
data and the standardization of accounting principles. At the time
when the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 became law, accounting had developed to such a point that it
was believed feasible to prescribe forms that in large part asked only
for disclosure of some of the more significant principles upon which the
financial statements were based and for disclosure of a certain amount
of information believed to be of particular importance to investors.
The form of presentation, the method of description, the inclusion of
information beyond the minimum, and the fundamental responsibility
for the quality of the statements were problems left on the shoulders

of the issuer and its officers. In addition, it was required that independent accountants make a review -snd express their opinion of the
accounting principles followed and the statements presented. However, at the same time the Commission established a policy of administrative review of financial statements :filedwhich led to discussions of
accounting problems with issuers and their accountants, to the preparation of memoranda of deficiencies observed, and in some cases to the
issuance of stop order, delisting, or accounting opinions. Experience
gained in this way has demonstrated a considerable diversity of views
on matters of accounting principle. The Commission first endeavored
to overcome this situation by enlisting the cooperation of numerous
organizations interested in accounting, by conducting research, and
by consulting with registrants. In addition, on some accounting
matters the Commission has taken a positive position in published
opinions or in its rules governing financial statements required to be
filed. More recently j steps have been taken to enforce the observance
of generally accepted accounting principles by adopting a policy of presuming financial statements to be misleading in cases in which such
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles for
which there is no substantial authoritative support despite disclosure
of the matters involved in the accountant's certificate or in footnotes
to the statements.
While the policy of the Commission with respect to accounting
principles has developed in this manner through an evolutionary
period, reliance has continued to be placed upon independent accountants for assuring the adequacy of audits. It was believed that
professional accounting organizations had developed high standards
in auditing practices and techniques and that dependence could be
placed upon financial facts developed through the application of such
auditing methods even though the principles followed in reporting
such facts were in some instances unsatisfactory. However, recent
events have cast doubt upon the adequacy of the methods and techniques employed in auditing.
Inthe matter of Monroe Loan Society, a case in which a defalcation,
which apparently amounted to $458,000, was discovered some time
after a registration statement upon Form A-2 had become effective
under the. Securities Act of 1933, a stop order hearing was held under
Section 8 (d) of that Act and it was determined that during all of the
jears between the registrant's inception in 1927 and November 30,
1937, no representative of the auditors visited any branch officeof the
registrant for audit purposes; no. notes or applications pertaining
thereto held at the branch officeswere examined by the auditors; and
that no branch office loans were verified by direct confirmation with
the borrowers by the auditors. In its formal opinion the Commission
held that the omission of an adequate examination constituted so com-

FIFTH

plete a disregard of recognized auditing practice as to invalidate the
accountant's original audit certificate and to impugn the integrity of
the financial statements contained-in the registration statement as it
became effective.
In the matter of Interstate Hosiery Mills, Inc., a case in which the
registrant filed false financial statements, overstating its earnings and
its assets approximately $900,000, a hearing was held under Section
19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to determine whether
the registrant's securities should be delisted. At the hearing it was
determined that the author of these falsifications was an employee of
Since there was no evidence of
the certifying :firm of accountants.
complicity with this employee by any of the officers, directors, or employees of the registrant, or by any partners or employees of Homes &
Davis, the issues developed at the hearing were principally whether
Homes & Davis exercised due care in employing this accountant and
in reviewing his work. The record in this case, including testimony of
expert witnesses for the registrant, failed to show that the review made
by Homes & Davis was less extensive than that ordinarily made by
accounting firms. In its opinion the Commission indicated that it was
satisfied that an adequate review would have exposed the irregularities
in this case and that if the views of the registrant's expert witnesses be
accepted as to the usual practice followed by independent public accountants in reviewing the work of those responsible for the actual
carrying out of the audit procedures, such practice required thorough
revision.
While the foregoing cases evidenced some inadequacy in the procedures and practices followed in auditing, they hardly foreshadowed
the McKesson & Robbins scandal. The first intimation of these irregularities was received on December 5,1938, when the appointment
of a receiver for the company was sought. It was subsequently determined by representatives of the Commission that the company's inventories and accounts receivable were overstated in amounts aggregating
appr.oximately $20,000,000. In view. of the false and misleading
information set forth in the financial-statements
certified by Price,
Waterhouse & Co., and included in the application for registration
and annual reports filed by McKesson & Robbins with the Commission
and the New York Stock Exchange, and on the basis-of its preliminary
investigation into the auditing phases of the case, the Commission,
on December 29, 1938, entered an order directing that public hearings
be held to determine (1) the character, detail, and scope of the audit
procedure f,ollowed by Price, Waterhouse & Co., in the preparation
of the said financial statements; (2) the extent to which prevailing and
generally accepted .sttmdards -~nd..requirements of audit procedure
were adhered to and applied. in the preparation of the said financial
statements; and (3) the adequacy of the safeguards inhering in the
'89101-40--9

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

said generally accepted practices and principles of audit procedure
to assure reliability and accuracy of financial statements.
Since the discovery of the falsification of McKesson & Robbins"
financial statements, various organizations interested in accounting
matters have sponsored or participated in forums on auditing theory
and practice. The .American Institute of Accountants has published
a report entitled "Extensions of Auditing Procedure" which contains.
recommendations relating to the examination of inventories and
receivables by auditors, the appointment of independent certified
public accountants, and the form of independent certified public
accountants' report. Numerous State societies of certified public
accountants, the Controllers Institute of .America, and the N ational
Association of Manufacturers have expressed their approval of the
principles outlined in this report.
The Commission nevertheless continued its hearings in In the
matter of McKesson &1 Robbins, Incorporated, and its inquiry intothe adequacy of present day auditing methods. In connection with
these hearings, which have now been completed, the Commission
examined 43 witnesses, including'representatives
of Price, Waterhouse & Co., employees and directors of the company, members of
12 representative accounting firms and several other expert witnesses.
The transcript of testimony of the expert witnesses is to be published 18 in the near future since it is felt to be of immediate general
interest to the public as well as of permanent value to practitioners
and students of auditing and since it may assist in the further development of auditing procedures. It is also planned that a report covering the entire investigation will be published in the near future.
Hearings have also been held under Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to determine whether the registration of
the securities of the Associated Gas and Electric Company, Missouri
Pacific Railroad Company, and Transamerica Corporation should besuspended or withdrawn, there being reasons to suspect that the applications for registration, the annual reports, and the amendments
thereto, including financial statements, filed by such registrants contain false and misleading statements of material facts. At this time,
no decision on these charges has been made and opinions in these
cases have not been issued."
In connection with the hearings In the matter of Transamerica
Oorporation, the Commission has caused an examination to be madeof the books and accounts of the registrant at its officesin San Francisco.
While numerous auditing investigations have been made of brokers
and dealers charged with violating the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, this is the first case. of any magnitude in which the Commission

bas made an independent investigation of the affairs of a company
having securities listed on a national securities exchange. It has
entailed the audit of approximately 40 companies for a period of
several years and has required the services of a number of members
of the Commission's staff for more than 6 months.
This, together
with the protracted litigation described later in this volume, has
necessarily delayed the progress of the case.
During the fiscal year conferences and consultations with registrants, their representatives, and others on accounting and auditing
matters have increased greatly in volume. Research work completed
during the past year has resulted in the publication of two accounting
opinions and several internal releases on accounting questions of
major importance.
In continuing the program of accounting research it has come to b6
recognized that one of the underlying problems stems from the fact
that accounting has grown up with the needs of management in mind
and with relatively little consideration given to the needs of investors.
For this reason, it becomes increasingly clear that it is imperative to
reexamine practically every accounting assumption and practice in
the light of its meaning to investors and of its effect upon the action
of investors.
The philosophy of the Commission's present and
prospective activities in accounting matters may be recapitulated by
quoting from a statement issued by Jerome N. Frank at the time he
took office as Chairman:
"One of the most important functions of the Commission is to maintain and
improve the standards of accounting practices. Recent events make it clear that
we face a pressing problem in this field. Accounting is the language in which the
corporation talks to its existing stockholders and to prospective investors. We
want to be sure that the public never has reason to lose faith in the reports of
public accountants. To this end, the independence of the public accountant
must be preserved and strengthened and standards of thoroughness and accuracy
protected. I understand that certain groups in the profession are moving ahead
in good stride. They will get all the help we can give them so long as they
conscientiously attempt that task. That's definite: But if we find that they are
Unwillingor unable, perhaps, because of fhe influence of some of their clients, to
do the job thoroughly, we won't hesitate to step in to the full extent of our statutory
powers."
STUDY OF INVESTMENT TRUSTS AND INVESTMENT COMPANIES

During the past fiscal year, the Commission continued the transmittal of the various chapters of its report on the results of its study
of investment trusts and investment companies (conducted pursuant
til Section 30 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935)
to the Congress. This study and the preparation of the reports have
been under the' general supervision of Commissioner Robert E.
Healy, with Paul. P. Gourrioh, Technical Adviser to the
Commission,
,

122

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

as Director of the Study, the late William R. Spratt, Jr., as Chief of
the Study, David Schenker as Counsel, and L. M. C. Smith as Associate Counsel, Mr. Spratt, who died on June 20, 1938, and Mr.
Gourrich, whose resignation from the Commission was submitted on
March 31, 1939, did not participate in the preparation or consideration of those parts of the report which were submitted to the Congress
subsequent to those dates. The current functions of the study are
under the direct supervision of Mr. Schenker.
Part Two of the over-all report (Statistical Survey of Investment
Trusts and Investment Companies) was submitted to the Congress
during the past fiscal year. This part, consisting -o-f eight chapters,
contains detailed statistical analyses of various aspects and activities
of investment trusts and investment companies and covers the follow..
ing items: (1) A preface to the statistics; (2) data on the growth of
total assets and a survey of the financial statements of investment
trusts and investment companies in this country from 1927 to 1936;
(3) sales and repurchases of their own security issues; (4) trading in
their own security issues; (5) the ownership and control of investment
trusts and investment companies; (6) the performance of large management investment companies proper from 1927 to 1937; (7) the
investors' experience in investment trusts and investment companies;
and (8) the portfolio investments of investment trusts and investment
companies.
On May 3, 1939, the Commission transmitted to the Congress the
first portion of Part Three of its report on investment trusts and investment companies, which treats with the abuses and deficiencies in the
organization and operation of investment trusts and investment companies. Chapter I of Part Three discusses the background of the
investment companies in relation to these abuses and deficiencies.
Those portions of Chapter II which were transmitted set forth in
detail the history of the following investment companies: Iroquois
Share Corporation; Seaboard Utilities Shares Corporation, Railroad
Shares Corporation, and Utilities Hydro & ll.A.il~ Sh~esCo1'Roration,;

Universal Shares, Ltd., and a number of fixed and semi-fixed trusts.
On June 26, 1939, the Commission sent to the Congress the first of
its supplemental reports, which deals with investment trusts in Great
Britain.
MONOPOLY STUDY CONDUCTED FOR THE TEMPORARY NATIONAL
ECONOMIC COMMITTEE
Organization of Study.

The Temporary National Economic Committee was established by
Public Resolution No. 113, 75th Congress (approved by the President
on June 16, 1938), for the purpose of (1) making a full and complete
study and investigation with respect to the matters referred to in the
President's message of April 29, 1938, to the Congress, on monopoly
and the concentration of economic power in and financial control over
production and distribution of goods and services, and (2) making
recommendations to the Congress with respect to legislation upon the
foregoing subjects.
This resolution provided that the Committee be composed of six
members of the Congress and one representative from each of six
specified executive departments and independent agencies, among
which was included the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Former Chairman Douglas served on the Committee as the Commission's representative until his resignation as Chairman and member of the Commission, and Commissioner Frank served as alternate.
On May 23, 1939, Chairman Frank was named as the Commission's
representative on the Committee, and Commissioner Henderson was
designated as alternate.
The Commission was instructed by the Committee to carry on investigations and studies concerning the functioning of the capital and
securities markets and the significance of the present financial organization in relation to the control of industry.
In carrying out the
duties assigned to it, the Commission established a separate division,
which was named the S. E. C. Monopoly Study Division.
The investigations and studies assigned to the Commission were
divided into three major parts, viz, insurance, investment banking,
and corporate practices.
Insurance.

The study of insurance has been confined during the year to legal
reserve life insurance companies. The scope of this study becomes
apparent when it is recognized that over 300 legal reserve companies

'"1.'24

SECURITIES

AND EXCHA"NGE COMMISSION

are operating in the United States. These companies are estimated
to have assets in excess of $27,000,000,000, and have approximately
64,000,000 policyholders.
Materials secured by a study of the public records, questionnaires
to the companies, and field interviews have been presented in public
hearings held before the Temporary National Economic Committee.
These materials showed, first, the size and scope of the business, with
particular reference to the accumulation and concentration of insurance assets. Testimony was then presented to demonstrate the
extent to which the large mutual life insurance companies are in fact
controlled by their policyholders. It was demonstrated that the
directors of such companies are practically self-perpetuating groups,
and that it was virtually impossible for the policyholders to elect a
director who had not been selected by the existing management.
Testimony with respect to interlocking directorships was also presented and it was shown that, in some cases, directors of insurance
companies used their influence to bring the patronage of the insurance
companies, of which they were directors, to law firms, banks, and
other business enterprises with which they were connected.
The extent and character of systematic efforts of large insurance
companies to control State legislation was demonstrated by testimony.
I~ was shown that one of the Nation-wide organizations of life insurance companies, the Association of Life Insurance Presidents, has
been an effective instrument in influencing State legislation of interest
to the companies.
Testimony demonstrated that insurance companies have entered
into anti-competitive agreements and understandings.
Efforts of
companies to fix group insurance rates, non-participating rates for
ordinary insurance, uniform annuity rates, and to establish uniform
settlement option agreements and uniform surrender value programs,
were explored.
Testimony was also presented to show the character and amount
of terminations of life insurance policies. During the 10-year period
from 1928 to 1937, over $133,000,000,000 of insurance was terminated,
of which $65,388,000,000 was terminated by lapse. Lapse is of
particular consequence in the field of industrial insurance (small
policies sold on a weekly or monthly payment plan). During the
period from 1928 to 1937, over 168,000,000 new industrial policies
were issued. Over 70 percent of the policies terminating during this
same period terminated by lapse. At the end of the lO-year period,
there was a gain of only 6,500,000 policies in force although there
were the issuance and renewal of over 193,000,000 policies. In the
case of one company selling industrial insurance, it was shown that
over 97 percent of the terminations experienced during the period from

FIFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

125

1924 to 1938 were terminations by lapse. Most striking of all is the
fact that only 4.45 percent of the industrial policies terminating during this period terminated by death. The experience in ordinary
life insurance was shown to be but slightly better.
Investment Banking.

Materials dealing with the problems of savings and investment,
.snd the financing of small businesses, were also presented in public
hearing before the Temporary National Economic Committee.
The testimony showed relative importance of expenditures for
'Capital goods in producing the national income. While the well-being
of the public is represented primarily by expenditures for consumers'
goods, in order to maintain a high level of production of these goods
it is necessary to maintain the plant, equipment, and organization
of private business enterprises and government activities. Certain
major changes were shown to have taken place during the last decade
which indicate that probably a smaller proportion of the national
production must be in the form of capital equipment than was true
prior to the last decade.
The analysis of the railroads, public utilities, manufacturing and
.mining industries, and the construction industry (residential, commercial, and public) showed where capital funds have been used,
where expansion and contraction took place, and the fields in which
there are apparent continuing needs for expansion. The most important gap in expenditures was found in the residential and commercial
segments of the construction industry. The railroads also were
shown to have failed to maintain their previous rates of expenditures.
The principal source of savings for use by industry was shown to
be the savings of individuals and savings of corporations. These
savings were used to a minor extent by individuals and to a major
extent by corporations and governments, Federal, State, and local.
It was demonstrated that corporations to a great extent secured a
large percentage of their funds from depreciation and depletion
accounts, as well as from retained earnings. Many large businesses
were shown to have become independent of the securities markets
and public sources for capital funds.
The voluntary savings of millions of individuals are made available
largely through the instrumentality of the great savings institutions,
such as life insurance companies, savings banks, savings deposits in
commeroial banks, building and loan associations, trust funds, postal
savings, and government pension retirement, and trust funds. Heavy
concentration of the control of the investment of these funds was
shown to reside on the Eastern seaboard.
While both private enterprise and government undertakings provide outlets for the use of these savings, private enterprise is the

126

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

more important of the two. However, the necessity of continuing
study of these government outlets for public works was shown to
be great.
The field investigation brought together materials, concerning the
problems of financing small businesses, from cities as widely separated
as Fall River, Mass.; Scranton, -Pa.: Dallas, Tex.; Denver, Colo.;
Omaha, Nebr.; and Seattle, Wash. The necessity of distinguishing
between the short-time credit needs of small businesses and the
longer time capital requirements of small businesses was emphasized.
Weaknesses of commercial banking organization for supplying shorttime credit needs of small businesses were demonstrated.
Corporate Practices.

The study of corporate practices has involved problems related
generally to the broad subjects of the control of corporations and the
protection of investors.
A comparative study was made of the provisions of the Securities
Act, the Securities Exchange Act, the Public Utility Holding Company
Act, the Cole-Barkley Bill for the regulation of trust indentures, 18
the Lea Bill for the regulation of proxy solicitations, the Glass Bank
Holding Company Bill, and other proposed legislation, to determine
their effect on a number of specific corporate problems classified under
the following general categories: registration and reporting requirements ;
the ability of a majority of equity security holders to have a voice in
the management; financial devices, like holding companies and strategic minority interests; banker control of industry; the rights of
security holders to receive dividends and their rights on liquidation;
mergers, consolidations, acquisitions, reorganizations,
recapitalizations, and liquidations; the control of capital structure; and the 'preferential treatment of insiders.
Preliminary studies were made concerning legislation requiring
Federal incorporation and suggesting corporate problems that might
be dealt with by such legislation.
An investigation was undertaken of the extent of holdings by officers
and directors of equity securities of the companies with which they
were affiliated. For this purpose, the relevant data concerning the
200 largest non-financial corporations are being analyzed.
The certificates of incorporation and the by-laws of these 200
corporations are being studied, particular attention being given to the
provisions affecting the calling of meetings and their conduct, the
issuance of securities, alterations in the capital structure, directors and
their contracts with the corporation, the power to write and alter
by-laws, voting rights, the rights of stockholders to inspect books,
preemptive rights, and several types of corporate action.

REPORTS OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND PRINCIPAL
STOCKHOLDERS
General Purpose and Scope of Reporting Requirements.

In order to make available information as to the amount of securities owned by persons closely identified with the management or control of enterprises, and changes occurring in their holdings, every
person who is an officer, director, or principal stockholder (i. e., a
person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10%
of any class of registered equity security) of an issuer having any
class of equity security listed and registered on any national securities exchange is required, under Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to file with the Commission and the exchange
an initial report showing his direct and indirect beneficial ownership;
of, and a report for each month thereafter in which any change in:
such ownership occurs disclosing his transactions in, all classes of
equity security of the issuer. Similarly, under Section 17 (a) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, every person who is an
officer or a director of a registered holding company is required to file
reports disclosing his holdings of, and transactions in, all securities of
the registered holding company and its subsidiary companies.
Volume of Reports.

The number of reports filed under these requirements and examined
by the Commission during each of the past two fiscal years is presented on a comparative basis below:

Where any report shows upon examination any material incompleteness, inconsistency, or inaccuracy, an amended report is required
to be filed and is examined in the same manner as the original report.
Filing of Initial Reports.

Most of these reports are filed on Form 4 which reflects purchases
and sales and other changes in beneficial ownership of securities.
Such monthly reports of transactions on the part of persons who had
previously established active files of reports accounted for 13,681 of
the so-called original, as distinct from amended, reports filed during
the year.under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The remaining
2,394 were initial reports required either on Form 6 from persons
(2,008) who, during the year, became officers, directors, or principal

128

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

stockholders, or on Form 5 from persons '(386)' who had any such
relationship to an issuer whose equity security first became registered
during the year. A majority of the persons required for either of
these reasons to commence the filing of reports do so without any
action on the part of the Commission. Thus, 1,344 of these initial
reports were so filed during the year. However, it was necessary to
call the reporting requirements to the attention of the remaining
1,050 persons who filed initial reports, principally on Form 6, during
the same period. Information as to the identity of additional persons who become subject to the duty to file these reports is currently
obtained from various sources, including not only annual reports
filed by, and correspondence with, issuers but also the publications
of certain financial services.
Publication of Security Ownership Reports.

The actual reports made by officers, directors, and principal stockholders on Forms 4,5,6, U-17-1, and U-17-2, are available for public
inspection at the offices of the Commission in Washington, D.O.,
and the reports on Forms 4, 5, and 6 may also be inspected at the
particular exchange with which an additional copy of reports relating
to the issuer concerned must be filed. In order to make the information contained in these reports more readily available to the public,
the Commission compiles and publishes such information in a semimonthly Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings
which is widely distributed among individual investors, newspaper
correspondents, and other interested persons. Copies of these summaries are also available at each regional office of the Commission
and each national securities exchange. The demand for this summary, particularly on the part of investors, is so great that its circulation has increased more than 600 percent from the close of the 1935
fiscal year to the close of the past fiscal year.
To facilitate the use of the summary, the Commission added,
commencing with the calendar year 1938, an index in each separate
number, and inaugurated an annual index covering all numbers of the
summary released during the calendar year.
CONFIDENTIAL

TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS,
DOCUMENTS

REPORTS,

OR

The Commission is empowered by Section 24 (b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, to grant or deny applications for the confidential treatment of information contained in applications, reports,
and documents filed with it pursuant to various provisions of that
Act. Under the provisions of Rule X-24B-2 of the Commission's
General Rules and Regulations under the Act, persons who object
to the public disclosure of information contained in such applications,

129
reports, or documents filed by them, may submit the portion of such
material considered confidential to the Chairman of the Commission,
together with an application stating the grounds upon which the
objection to public disclosure is based. The courts have ruled that
disposition of these matters by the Commission is a quasi-judicial
function and that the decisions of the Commissions may be reviewed.
During the past fiscal year, 101 applications were submitted for
the confidential treatment of information, filed pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, involving a total of 133
separate items of information, principally in connection with the
annual reports of issuers filed with the Commission pursuant to Section
13 of that Act. Material filed by 57 issuers, involving 104 items of
information (including applications pending at the beginning of the
fiscal year) was made available for public inspection during the year,
pursuant to Rule X-24B-2, the Commission having determined that
disclosure of such information is in the public interest or the applicants having withdrawn their objections to its public disclosure.
During the year, 75 items of information confidentially filed by 41
issuers (including several pending from the previous year) were
granted confidential treatment by the Commission. Pursuant to the
requests of various applicants, 16 private hearings (on applications for
confidential treatment) were held during the year.
The Securities Act of 1933, as amended (paragraph (30) of Schedule
A) authorizes confidential treatment by the Commission of material
contracts filed in connection with registration statements, if disclosure
of such contracts would impair their value and would not be necessary
for the protection of investors. During the year, 21 applications for
confidential treatment of material contracts, or portions thereof, were
filed pursuant to Rule 580 under that Act. Of these applications,
together with 2 pending at the beginning of the year, 19 were granted,
1 was withdrawn, and 3 were pending as of June 30, 1939.
The Commission is also empowered to act on applications for confidential treatment of information contained in registration statements, applications, declarations, reports, or other documents filed
pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, under
authority granted by Section 22 (b) of that statute.
During the
year, 16 applications were received, of which 1 was granted, and 15
were pending on June 30, 1939.
At the beginning of the past fiscal year, there were pending in the
several United States Circuit Courts of Appeal or the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, 10 petitions filed by
issuers seeking to review determinations by the Commission denying

being made available for public inspection.
The only new petitions
for judicial- review' of such determinations filed during, the fiscal
year, were filed by issuers which had petitions for judicial review of
similar matters covering earlier years pending before the particular
Circuit Courts of Appeal. Appendix VI, Table V, contains a summary
of all confidential treatment cases pending in the Courts during the
past fiscal year and their status as of June 30, 1939.
STATISTICS ON SECURITIES AND ON EXCHANGE MARKETS

Between May and July 1939, the Commission released a series of
reports entitled "Selected Statistics on Securities and on Exchange
Markets" submitted to it by the Research and Statistics Section of
the Trading and Exchange Division. Ingeneral, these reports covered
the period from 1933 or 1935 to June 30, 1938, and dealt mainly with
new issues and retirements of securities; changes in ownership of outstanding securities; the number and rough size distribution of common
stock holdings of a group of 1,509 corporations; sales of small and
unseasoned issues registered under the Securities Act of 1933; brokers
and dealers registered under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934; the participation of investment banking firms in the underwriting of issues registered under the Securities Act of 1933; private
placings of securities; the classified volume and estimated value of
trading on securities exchanges; and the flow of stock trading on the
N ew York Stock Exchange and New York Curb Exchange as reflected
in the trading of exchange members, odd and full lot customers, foreign
customers, investment companies and the so-called corporate insiders
reporting under Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
These reports consist of 70 statistical tables and an accompanying
explanatory text of approximately 100 pages. Tables bringing down
the data to June 30, 1939, will be found in Appendix V hereto in
most instances where current figures were shown in these reports.
SURVEY OF AMERICAN LISTED CORPORATIONS

registration of securities on national securities exchanges and annual

and supervised by this Commission.
During the fiscal year ended

NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE PROGRAM
(TEXT OF PROGRAM ADOPTED BY BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THY'
NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE OCTOBER 26, 1938)

The following is a general summary of a program which has been
worked out with a view to affording additional protection to the
members of the public in their brokerage dealings with Member
Firms of the N ew York Stock Exchange.
SEPARATION OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN FIRMS' AND PARTNERS"
UNDERWRITING, SECURITY AND COMMODITY POSITIONS, ANDCOMMITMENTS

A review of past failures of member firms indicates that the overextension of security and commodity positions for firm and partners'
account has been an important factor. With a view to affording
additional protection to the members of the public in their brokerage
dealings with member firms of the N ew York Stock Exchange, the
Exchange proposes to permit member firms to organize separate
corporations, to be known as affiliated companies, for the purpose of
carrying underwriting, security and commodity positions for the
company's own account and for the account of the member firm's
general partners. When the details of the program for the formation and operation of such affiliated companies have been determined upon, the Exchange proposes to increase the capital requirements applicable to member firms in such a way as to encourage
member firms to conduct their underwriting and trading operations
through the medium of such separate companies.
An outline of the remaining portions of the program is enumerated
below:
I. REVISED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Effective January 1, 1939, no member firm, doing a general business with the public, except those subject to supervision by State or
Federal banking authorities, shall permit, in the ordinary course of
business as a broker, its aggregate indebtedness to all other persons
to exceed 1,500 per centum of the member firm's net capital. In computing the net capital and aggregate indebtedness of such a member
firm the Exchange proposes to delimit further the type of assets and
securities which may be included in net capital by requiring speeifie
deductions in the comp rtation of capital.

LOANS

Without the prior written approval of the Committee on Member
Firms, no governor, member of a committee, officer, or employee of
the Exchange shall make any loan of money or securities to or obtain any such loan from any member, member firm, or partner of a
member:firm, unless such loan be (a) fully secured by readily marketable collateral, or (b) made by a governor or committee member to or
obtained by a governor or committee member from the member firm
of which he is p. partner, or a partner of such fum.
nr, DISQUALIFICATION OF GOVERNORS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS

No governor or member of a committee shall participate in the
investigation or consideration of any matter relating to any member or member firm with knowledge that such member or firm is
indebted to such governor or committee member, or to any of his
partners or to the firm of which he is a partner, or that he, his fum,
or any of his partners is indebted to such member or fum, excluding,
however, any indebtedness arising in the ordinary course of business
out of transactions on any exchange, out of transactions in the overthe-counter markets, or out of the lending and borrowing of
securities.
IV. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Committee on Member Firms will call for at least the following financial statements from all member firms:
(a) .An answer to a "long form" questionnaire at least once
in each year. This "long form" questionnaire will be in substantially the form heretofore used by member firms carrying
margin accounts which calls for a detailed financial statement.
(b) An answer to a special "short form" questionnaire at
approximately quarterly intervals between the calls for answers
to "long form" questionnaires.
v. INDEPENDENT AUDITS

The. Committee on Member Firms will require all member firms
doing any securities business with others than members or member
firms to have an audit of their books, records, and accounts made by
independent public accountants at least once in each year. The scope
of the audit is now the subject of a study being made by the Exchange
in conjunction with committees representing the American Institute
of Accountants and the N ew York State Society of Certified Public
Accountants.
The Committee on Member Firms will prescribe audit regulations
when the scope of the audit has been decided upon

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

VI. EXCHANGE AUDITING

The scope and frequency of the supervisory audits, examinations,
and inspections made of member firms' offices by the Exchange will
be increased. The audits, examinations, and inspections are being
made at irregular intervals and without prior warning and include
a test or spot check of safekeeping securities and segregated securities
representing excess margin.
VII. REPORT OF MEMBER BORROWINGS

Every member, member firm, and general partner of a member firm
will be required to report forthwith to the Exchange the following:
(a) Each loan in the amount of $2,500 or more, whether of
cash or securities heretofore obtained (and now outstanding)
or hereafter obtained;
(b) Each loan in the amount of $2,500 or more, whether of
cash or securities heretofore made (and now outstanding) or
hereafter made to any member, member firm, or general partner of a member finn;
provided, however, that no report shall be required with respect to:
(1) Any loan fully secured at all times by readily marketable
collateral ;
(2) Any loan of securities made by the borrower for the
purpose of effecting delivery against a sale where money payment equivalent to the market value of the securities is made
to the lender and such contract is marked approximately to
the market;
(3) Any loan on a life insurance policy which is not in excess
of the cash surrender value of such policy;
(4) Any loan obtained from a bank, trust company, monied
corporation, or fiduciary on the security of real estate;
(5) Any loan transaction between general partners of the
same firm.
VID. MARGIN ACCOUNTS

After April 1, 1939, no member firm carrying margin accounts for
others than members of a national securities exchange or registered
brokers or dealers, as the terms "member" and registered "broker"
and "dealer" are defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
no general partner of any such firm, shall trade in margin accounts
with their own firm or with any other member firm. This prohibition
will not prevent the obtaining of bank loans with which to purchase
or carry securities nor embrace such activities as underwritings, etc.
Appropriate exemptions to the rule will be considered for certain
types of transactions by members on the floor.

APPENDIX IX
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF REORGANIZATION PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS
AMENDED, DURJNG THE PERIOD FROM JUNE 22, 1938 TO JUNE 30,
1939, INCLUSIVE

Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, became effective on
September 22, 1900. However, Section 276c (1) of Chapter X provides that if a petition for reorganization was approved within three
months prior to the effective date of the amendatory Act, the provisions of Chapter X shall apply in their entirety to such proceedings.
For statistical purposes, all cases in which petitions were filed or
approved on or after June 22, 1938, are included in these compilations.'
The following statistical analysis covers the period from June 22,
1938 to June 30, 1939, inclusive, thereby including a short interval
during the 1938 fiscal year. The information has been derived
mainly from schedules, balance sheets, and allegations found in the
petitions, and other verified documents filed with the Federal District
Courts in reorganization proceedings. No independent check was
made by the Commission as to the accuracy of the information.
With one exception, the data reflect the number of proceedings instituted, and do not make allowances for proceedings dismissed,"
Total N1i.mber of Companies and Their Aggregate Assets and Indebtedness.

During the period from June 22, 1938 to June 30, 1939, inclusive,
petitions under Chapter X were filed by or against 577 companies.
The largest number of petitions was filed during the months of July
and August 1938, when proceedings in 70 and 79 cases, respectively,
were instituted.
The total assets of these 577 companies amounted
to approximately $527,000,000 (book value), while the corresponding
indebtedness aggregated $385,000,000.3
J In 12 cases the petlUons
were filed prior to lune 22, 1938 but were approved on or after that date.
As
8tBted above, thesn cases are Included In thls analysis Bince under Section 2760 (1) of Chapter X, the prov!Blons of Chapter X are applicable In their entirety to these cases.
I The exception
Is the case of a very large pnblic ntility holding company with alleged unconsolidated
assets of about $150,000,000. The proceedings against thls company were instituted
by creditors during
Novembar
1938. In lan08l'Y 1939, the proceedings were dismissed by the court on the ground that the
petition had not been 1IIed In good faith.
This case has been eliminated from all aggregates In this analysis.
I As stated above, the tIgnres for assets and Indebtedness
In almost all eases were taken from balance sheets,
schedules, and allegations found In the petiilons and other documents filed In reorganization
proceedings.
Estimates were mede of the assets of 39 companies and the Indebtedness
of 4 companies, figures for which
were not available from these sources.

Industrial Classification.

Of the 577 companies, the largest number, 197, were engaged in
manufacturing.
Real estate companies 4 were next with 121, while
merchandising concerns accounted for 106. Measured by aggregate
assets, the 197 manufacturing companies led with a figure of approximately $137,000,000 or 26% of the total, followed closely by 18 transportation and communication companies whose assets totaled approximately $133,000,000, 25% of the total for all companies. The third
largest figure was shown by the 121 real estate companies, whose aggregate assets of $87,000,000 accounted for 16% of the total. Measured
by aggregate indebtedness, however, the order was real estate companies, $86,000,000 or 22%, transportation and communication companies, $85,000,000 or 22%, and manufacturing companies, $78,000,000 or 20% of the total indebtedness for all 577 companies.

and principal place of business were Illinois and New York," The
former state was alleged to be the location of the principal assets of 79
companies, whose total assets aggregated $147,000,000 6 or 28% of
the total for all companies. In 87 cases, showing combined assets
of about $100,000,0007 or 19% of all assets, the principal assets were

principal place of business in N ew York accounted for assets of
$101,000,000 or 19% of the total assets, and indebtedness of $68,000,000, 18% of the total indebtedness.
The Federal District Court of the Northern District of illinois
handled the great bulk of cases in that state and led all districts in
the country in number of companies, total assets, and total indebtedness. Petitions were filed in that district by or against 74 companies
with combined assets of approximately $147,000,000 or 28% of the
assets in all Federal Judicial Districts and aggregate indebtedness of
about $95,000,000, 25% of the indebtedness of all 577 companies.
The 37 cases in the Southern District of New York involved assets of
$86,000,000 and indebtedness of $56,000,000, 16% and 14% of the

In 435 cases, three-fourths of the total of 577 cases, the indebtedness of the debtor was less than $250,000,8 but these cases accounted
for only 9% of the $385,000,000 indebtedness of all companies. Companies with indebtedness of at least $250,000, but less than $3,000,000,
were 125 in number, their indebtedness aggregating $93,000,000 or
24% of the indebtedness of all 577 companies. The remaining 67%
