ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-12400
In the Matter of
PRUDENTIAL EQUITY GROUP,
LLC, formerly known as
PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES INC.,

ORDER UNDER RULE 602(e) OF
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
GRANTING A WAIVER OF THE
DISQUALIFICATION PROVISION OF
RULE 602(c)(3)

Respondent.

Prudential Equity Group, LLC, formerly known as Prudential Securities Inc.
(“Respondent”) has submitted a letter, dated August 8, 2006, requesting a waiver of the Rule
602(c)(3) disqualification from the exemption under Regulation E under the Securities Act of
1933 (“Securities Act”) arising from the settlement of an administrative proceeding commenced
by the Commission. On August 28, 2006, 2006, pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement,
the Commission instituted an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“OIP”) against Respondent.
The OIP finds that some registered representatives formerly employed by Respondent
used deceptive practices to conceal their identities, and those of their customers, to evade mutual
funds’ prospectus limitations on market timing. By engaging in such conduct, Respondent
willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 17(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5, 17a-3, and 17a-4 thereunder. The
OIP also requires Respondent to pay disgorgement of $270 million and to comply with certain
undertakings.
Regulation E provides an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, subject to
certain conditions, for securities issued by certain small business investment companies and
business development companies. The Regulation E exemption is not available for the securities
of an issuer if, among other things, any investment adviser or underwriter for the securities to be

offered is subject to an order of the Commission entered pursuant to Section 15(b) of the
Exchange Act. See Rule 602(c)(3) under the Securities Act. The Commission may waive the
disqualification upon a showing of good cause. See Rule 602(e) under the Securities Act.
Based on the representations set forth in Respondent’s August 8, 2006 request, the Commission
has determined that, pursuant to Rule 602(e), a showing of good cause has been made and that
the request for a waiver of the disqualification should be granted.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 602(e) under the Securities Act, that a
waiver of the disqualification provision of Rule 602(c)(3) under the Securities Act resulting from
the entry of the OIP is hereby granted.
By the Commission.
