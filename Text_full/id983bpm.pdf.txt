In the Matter of
EASYLINK INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. INITIAL DECISION ON DEFAULT
March 23, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge

On December 23, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(g) and is delinquent in its required periodic filings. On January 19, 2016, I held a
telephonic prehearing conference at which only the Division of Enforcement appeared and the
status of service of the OIP was discussed but not yet established. Easylink Info. Tech. Co.,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3574, 2016 SEC LEXIS 385 (ALJ Feb. 3, 2016).
Respondent was served with the OIP on February 15, 2016, and its answer was due
February 29, 2016. Easylink Info. Tech. Co., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3661, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 792 (ALJ Mar. 2, 2016). On March 2, I ordered Respondent to show cause by March 14
why the registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an
answer or otherwise defend the proceeding. Id. I warned that if Respondent failed to respond to
the show cause order, I would deem it in default, determine the proceeding against it, and revoke
the registration of its securities. Id.
To date, Respondent has not filed an answer or responded to the show cause order. Thus,
Respondent is in default. See OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as
authorized by Rule of Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following allegations in
the OIP to be true.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Easylink Information Technology Co., Ltd., Central Index Key No. 1158687, is a
dissolved British Virgin Islands corporation located in Hsin Chu, Taiwan, with a class of

securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The
company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic
reports since it filed a Form 8-A12G registration statement on October 30, 2001.
In addition to its repeated failure to file timely periodic reports, Respondent failed to heed
a delinquency letter sent to it by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with its periodic filing obligations, or, through its failure to maintain a valid address
on file with the Commission, did not receive the letter.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1 require issuers of securities registered with
the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current and
accurate information in annual reports, even if the registration is voluntary under Exchange Act
Section 12(g). 15 U.S.C. § 78m(a); 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-1. “Compliance with those
requirements is mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s
Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22,
2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007).
Scienter is not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and rules
thereunder. See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F.
Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). By failing to timely file required periodic reports, Respondent
violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1.
SANCTION
Exchange Act Section 12(j) authorizes the Commission, “as it deems necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend the
registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity
for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the
Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondent’s failure to file required periodic reports is serious because it violates a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondent’s violation is recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic reports.
See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at
*20 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS
1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008).

Respondent is culpable because it knew, or should have known, of its obligation to file
periodic reports. See 17 C.F.R. § 249.310 (Commission Form 10-K); China-Biotics, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding
that scienter is not necessary to establish grounds for revocation); Robert L. Burns, Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3260, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2722, at *41 n.60 (Aug. 5, 2011)
(stating that the Commission has “repeatedly held that ignorance of the securities laws is not a
defense to liability thereunder”). By not participating in this proceeding, Respondent forfeited
an opportunity to show it has made efforts to remedy its past violations and to offer assurances
against further violations.
On these facts, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke the
registration of each class of Respondent’s registered securities.
Order
I ORDER that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registration of each class of registered securities of Easylink Information Technology Co., Ltd.,
is REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule of Practice 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, I FURTHER ORDER
that a party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twelve days after service
of the initial decision. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(b). A party may also file a motion to correct a
manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule of Practice 111. 17
C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party
shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the order resolving such
motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The initial decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party.
In addition, a respondent has the right to file a motion to set aside a default within a
reasonable time, stating the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specifying the nature of
the proposed defense. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). The Commission can set aside a default at any time
for good cause. Id.
