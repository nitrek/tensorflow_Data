MOINES, IOWA,

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND
A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the
Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), against City of West Des Moines, Iowa
(“Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth
below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds 1 that:

1

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

Summary
1.
This matter involves material misstatements by Respondent in the sale of
municipal securities. Specifically, in certain official statements for municipal securities,
Respondent affirmatively misstated that it had materially complied with prior agreements to
provide continuing disclosure. Respondent was an issuer responsible for making the continuing
disclosure and for the material misstatements in the official statements. As a result of the
conduct described herein, Respondent violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
2.
The violations discussed in this Order were self-reported by Respondent to the
Commission pursuant to the Division of Enforcement’s (the “Division”) Municipalities
Continuing Disclosure Cooperation Initiative. 2 Accordingly, this Order and Respondent’s Offer
are based on information self-reported by the Respondent.
Respondent
3.
Respondent, located in the State of Iowa, is governed under a mayor-council form
of government which provides, by ordinance, for a city manager to be appointed by the council.
Prior Continuing Disclosure Agreements
4.
Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) generally
prohibits any underwriter from purchasing or selling municipal securities unless it has reasonably
determined that the municipal issuer or other obligated person 3 has undertaken in a written
agreement to provide annual financial information and, if not included in the annual financial
information, audited financial statements when and if available, to the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board’s (“MSRB”) Electronic Municipal Market Access system (“EMMA”). 4 In
addition, the agreement, sometimes referred to as a continuing disclosure agreement, must
include an undertaking by the municipal issuer or obligated person to provide timely notice of
certain specified events pertaining to the municipal securities being offered and timely notice of
any failure to submit annual financial information on or before the date specified in the
continuing disclosure agreement.
5.
In securities offerings which preceded the offerings at issue in this matter,
Respondent executed continuing disclosure agreements, for the benefit of investors in those

See Div. of Enforcement, U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation
Initiative, http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/municipalities-continuing-disclosure-cooperation-initiative.shtml
(last modified Nov. 13, 2014).

An “obligated person” generally means any person or entity that is committed by contract or other arrangement to
support payment of all or part of the obligations on the municipal securities being offered. See 17 C.F.R. §
240.15c2-12(f)(10).
4

Previously, Rule 15c2-12 required such information to be provided to the appropriate nationally recognized
municipal securities information repositories. In December 2008, Rule 15c2-12 was amended to designate EMMA
as the central repository for ongoing disclosures by municipal issuers and obligated persons, effective July 1, 2009.

earlier offerings. In those agreements, Respondent agreed to, among other things, submit annual
financial information to the appropriate repositories within certain timeframes, as well as timely
notices of certain specified events pertaining to the municipal securities being offered.
Respondent agreed to submit notices in the event it was unable to provide the contractually
required annual reports. Respondent also agreed to provide audited annual financial statements
within certain timeframes.
6.
Despite executing these continuing disclosure agreements, Respondent failed to
comply in all material respects with its commitment to provide certain types of continuing
disclosure within the timeframes set forth in the continuing disclosure agreements.
Misstatements About Compliance with Continuing
Disclosure Agreements in Subsequent Municipal Securities Offerings
7.
After these material failures to comply with prior continuing disclosure
agreements, Respondent issued new municipal securities. As part of those new issuances,
Respondent again undertook to make continuing disclosure for the benefit of investors and
disseminated final official statements in connection with the new offerings.
8.
In the official statements for the new municipal securities, Respondent made
materially false and/or misleading statements about its prior compliance with its earlier
continuing disclosure agreements, as follows:
•

A 2011 competitive offering in which the final official statement read, in relevant
part: “[t]he City inadvertently failed to comply with a previous continuing
disclosure undertaking in accordance with the reporting requirements of
paragraph (f)(3) of [Rule 15c2-12]. While the required tables were provided in
accordance to [Rule 15c2-12] (within 210 days after the end of the fiscal year
2010), the audited financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2009 and
2010 were not timely filed. On June 4, 2010 the City’s audited financial
statements for the year ending June 30, 2009 were posted to EMMA as Appendix
B of the Official Statement for the City’s $7,000,000 General Obligation Bonds,
Series 2010C. On July 28, 2011, the City filed the audited financial statements
for the year ending June 30, 2009 as a separate continuing disclosure document.
On June 15, 2011, the City filed the outstanding audited financial statements for
the year ending June 30, 2010 in accordance with [Rule 15c2-12]. The City is
now compliant and has taken steps to assure future compliance with its Disclosure
Covenants.” This was false and/or misleading because Respondent filed its
audited financial statements for fiscal years 2006 - 2008 late by approximately
four months, three months, and two months, respectively. Respondent also failed
to timely file required notices of late filings in each case;

•

A 2012 competitive offering in which the final official statement read, in relevant
part: “[t]he City inadvertently failed to comply with a previous continuing
disclosure undertaking in accordance with the reporting requirements of
paragraph (f)(3) of [Rule 15c2-12]. While the required tables were provided in
3

accordance to [Rule 15c2-12] (within 210 days after the end of the fiscal year
2010), the audited financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2010 were not
timely filed. On June 15, 2011, the City filed the outstanding audited financial
statements for the year ending June 30, 2010 in accordance with [Rule 15c2-12]
and is now compliant.” This was false and/or misleading because Respondent
filed its audited financial statements for fiscal years 2007 - 2009 late by
approximately three months, two months, and 18 months, respectively.
Respondent also failed to timely file required notices of late filings in each case;

9.

•

A second competitive offering in 2012 in which the final official statement read,
in relevant part: “[t]he City inadvertently failed to comply with a previous
continuing disclosure undertaking in accordance with the reporting requirements
of paragraph (f)(3) of [Rule 15c2-12]. While the required tables were provided in
accordance to [Rule 15c2-12] (within 210 days after the end of the fiscal year),
the audited financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2009 and June 30,
2010 were not timely filed. On June 4, 2010, the outstanding audited financial
statements for the year ending June 30, 2009 were filed in the final official
statement for the $7,000,000 General Obligation Bonds, Series 2010C, dated June
4, 2010; and on June 15, 2011, the City filed the outstanding audited financial
statements for the year ending June 30, 2010, in accordance with [Rule 15c2-12]
and is now compliant.” This was false and/or misleading because Respondent
filed its audited financial statements for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 late by
approximately three months and two months, respectively. Respondent also
failed to provide within EMMA a cross-reference to the previously filed final
official statement for its $7,000,000 General Obligation Bonds, Series 2010C,
dated June 4, 2010, containing the audited financial statements for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2009, and Respondent did not file such audited financial
statements as a separate continuing disclosure document until July 28, 2011,
approximately 18 months after the statements were due. Respondent also failed
to timely file required notices of late filings in each case; and

•

A 2013 competitive offering in which the final official statement read, in relevant
part: “[t]he City inadvertently failed to comply with a previous continuing
disclosure undertaking in accordance with the reporting requirements of
paragraph (f)(3) of [Rule 15c2-12]. While the required tables were provided in
accordance to [Rule 15c2-12] (within 210 days after the end of the fiscal year),
the audited financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2009 and June 30,
2010 were not timely filed. On June 15, 2011, the City filed the outstanding
audited financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2010 in accordance with
[Rule 15c2-12] and is now compliant.” This was false and/or misleading because
Respondent filed its audited financial statements for fiscal year 2008 late by
approximately two months. Respondent also failed to timely file a required notice
of late filing.
Respondent knew or should have known that these statements were untrue.

Legal Discussion
10.
Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act makes it unlawful “in the offer or sale of
any securities . . . directly or indirectly . . . to obtain money or property by means of any untrue
statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.”
15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2) (2012). Negligence is sufficient to establish a violation of Section
17(a)(2). See Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 696-97 (1980). A misrepresentation or omission is
material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important
in making an investment decision. See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988).
11.
Rule 15c2-12 was adopted in an effort to improve the quality and timeliness of
disclosures to investors in municipal securities. In recognition of the fact that the disclosure of
sound financial information is critical to the integrity of not just the primary market, but also the
secondary markets for municipal securities, Rule 15c2-12 requires an underwriter to obtain a
written agreement, for the benefit of the holders of the securities, in which the issuer or obligated
person undertakes, among other things, to annually submit certain financial information. See 17
C.F.R. § 240.15c2-12(b)(5)(i); Municipal Securities Disclosure, Exchange Act Release No.
34961, 59 Fed. Reg. 59590, 59592 (Nov. 17, 1994).
12.
In addition, it is important for investors and the market to know the scope of any
ongoing disclosure undertakings, and the type of information provided. See id. at 59594. Rule
15c2-12 therefore requires that undertakings provided pursuant to Rule 15c2-12 be described in
the final official statement. Moreover, critical to any evaluation of an undertaking to make
disclosures is the likelihood that the issuer or obligated person will abide by the undertaking.
See id. Therefore, Rule 15c2-12(f)(3) requires that a final official statement set forth any
instances in the previous five years in which an issuer of municipal securities, or obligated
person, failed to comply in all material respects with any previous continuing disclosure
undertakings. The requirements of Rule 15c2-12 allow underwriters, investors, and others to
assess the reliability of the disclosure representations. See id. at 59595.
13.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent violated Section 17(a)(2)
of the Securities Act.

14.
In determining to accept Respondent’s offer, the Commission considered the
cooperation of Respondent in self-reporting the violations.

settlement in any final official statement for an offering by Respondent within

above. The certification shall identify the undertakings, provide written evidence
of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient
to demonstrate compliance. The Commission staff may make reasonable requests
for further evidence of compliance, and Respondent agrees to provide such
evidence. The certification and supporting material shall be submitted to LeeAnn

Commission, 33 Arch Street, 23rd Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1424, with a copy to
the Office of Chief Counsel of the Division, no later than the one-year anniversary
of the institution of these proceedings.
f.
Cooperate with any subsequent investigation by the Division
regarding the false statement(s) and/or material omission(s), including the roles of
individuals and/or other parties involved.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.

6

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
