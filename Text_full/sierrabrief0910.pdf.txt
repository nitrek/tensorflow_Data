	 ACTS .............................................................................................................10 

1. 	

Tsai forms MAS – one of Tsai’s 101 shell companies – in 

order to issue shares that would purportedly become 

publicly tradeable, and then he effects a reverse merger 

with a private company seeking to go public. .............................10 


2. 	

Tsai transfers shares to five purported “directors,” but these 

individuals never performed any services as directors, never 

attended shareholder meetings, did not receive stock 

certificates, and gave Tsai blank stock powers. ..........................11 


3. 	

Tsai transfers shares from the five individuals to an 

additional 28 people, in an effort to expand the number of 

MAS’s shareholders. .......................................................................13

Tsai signs a reverse merger agreement between MAS and 

Bluepoint. .........................................................................................16

A.

T
	 sai’s undisputed control over both MAS and the 33 

shareholders shows that the shareholders were under 

common control with the issuer, and therefore defeats 

exemption under Section 4(1) and Rule 144(k)............................23

D. 	

Tsai’s remaining arguments concerning “industry custom,” 

NASD approval of a Form 211, and an NASD letter are 

without merit and do not otherwise provide exemption 

from registration. ............................................................................34

	 HERE WAS NO PREJUDICIAL VARIANCE BETWEEN 

THE SECTION 5 CLAIM ALLEGED IN THE COMMISSION’S COMPLAINT AND 

THE SECTION 5 CLAIM ON WHICH THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED 

SUMMARY JUDGMENT. ................................................................................37 

A. 	

Because fraud is not an element of a violation of Section 5, 

there is no basis for Tsai’s distinction between “fraud”-based 

and “non-fraud”- based violations of Section 5. ........................37

Tsai was not surprised or prejudiced by the entry of 

summary judgment based on a non-fraud claim. .....................44

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This civil law enforcement action brought by the Securities and
Exchange Commission arises from the sale of securities to the public in an
unregistered distribution in violation of the registration requirements of
Section 5 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77e. The familiar but illegal
method used by defendant-appellant Aaron Tsai in this case to convert a
privately-held business into a publicly-held company without registration
is well known to the Commission and the courts. A shell company (a
company with no assets or business), which purports to have shares that
may be traded publicly, engages in a merger, acquiring a private company
that seeks to become a publicly-held company without registration. The
Commission and the courts have concluded that participants in such
activities have been liable for violating Section 5.
The district court in this case properly found that Tsai, who created
and controlled more than 100 shell companies as well as MAS Capital (a
broker-dealer), violated Section 5 when he used one of the shell companies
he controlled to effect a merger with a privately-held company, and
transferred shares ostensibly owned by the shell company’s shareholders –
but whom Tsai likewise controlled – to people who immediately sold those
shares in the public market in unregistered transactions.
Just as the Commission and the courts are no stranger to activities
designed to avoid registration in this manner, so too is Tsai, thus
warranting relief against him in this case, including an injunction against
further violations of Section 5. Tsai has already consented to a Section 5
injunction in a prior case involving one of his other shell companies. See
1


SEC v. Surgilight Inc., SEC Litig.Rel.No. 19169, 2005 WL 770873 (Apr. 6,
2005) (M.D.Fla. No. 6:02-CV-431).
And as Judge Easterbrook recently noted, in a breach-of-contract case
brought by Tsai involving another shell company, Tsai has a “large stable”
of shell companies that he uses to provide “services designed to evade the
requirements that the Securities Act of 1933 imposes on companies that go
public.” MAS Capital, Inc. v. Biodelivery Sciences Intern., Inc., 524 F.3d 831
(7th Cir.2008). Judge Easterbrook, writing for the Seventh Circuit panel,
explained Tsai’s modus operandi as follows:
[MAS Capital] incorporated a shell company, MAS Acquisition
XXIII, that it represented had tradeable securities; then it
arranged for Biodelivery to merge with MAS Acquisition XXIII,
which changed its name to Biodelivery Sciences International.
Voilà! Stock in Biodelivery now can be bought and sold by the
general public. No muss, no fuss, no registration statements,
no prospectuses, no waiting periods-none of the expense, delay,
and disclosure required by the securities laws. The SEC takes
the position that this two-step, known as going public by the
back door, which sounds too good to be true, is not lawful. It
has commenced several administrative proceedings against
MAS Capital and Aaron Tsai, its president and sole director.
(Perhaps this is why Tsai has left the country.)
Id. at 833-34. The Seventh Circuit concluded that “Tsai and his
corporations take the law, and their promises, entirely too lightly,” and the
court determined to “send copies of [its] opinion to NASDAQ and the SEC
so that they may judge for themselves, in their ongoing administrative
proceedings, whether Tsai’s promises are credible.” Id.

COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES
1. Whether the district court properly granted summary judgment in
favor of the Commission on its Section 5 registration claim against
appellant, where appellant was a direct or indirect participant in the public
sale of a company’s unregistered securities that did not qualify for the Rule
144(k) safe harbor for satisfying the Section 4(1) exemption from
registration, because the company and its shareholders were under
appellant’s common control, and shares of the company were acquired
from these shareholders and resold almost immediately to the public
without registration.
2. Whether there was an impermissible variance between the
complaint and summary judgment, where the complaint pled a non-fraud­
based Section 5 claim and the district court granted summary judgment on
that claim.
3. Whether the district court properly granted summary judgment in
favor of the Commission on its claims that appellant violated the
shareholder reporting provisions of the Exchange Act and related rules,
where appellant was the beneficial owner of shares ostensibly held by
other shareholders, and appellant failed to report his beneficial ownership
of these shares.
4. Whether the district court acted within its discretion in ordering
disgorgement of appellant’s unlawful gains, and in ordering injunctive
relief where appellant has numerous opportunities for future violations
and has been previously enjoined from committing violations.

COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE

A.

NATURE OF THE CASE

This Commission action arises from the distribution of securities to

the public in unregistered transactions in violation of Section 5 of the
Securities Act. The district court granted summary judgment for the
Commission, concluding that defendants, including Tsai, violated Sections
5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act by offering and selling unregistered stock
to the public. The court also concluded that Tsai violated the shareholder
reporting provisions of Section 13(d), 15 U.S.C. 78m(d), and Section 16(a),
15 U.S.C. 78p(a), of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13d-1(a), 17 C.F.R. 240.13d­
1(a), and Rule 16a-3, 17 C.F.R. 240.16a-3, thereunder, when he failed to
disclose his beneficial ownership of securities. The district court enjoined
Tsai from committing further violations, and ordered him to disgorge
$250,000 in illegally-obtained profits, plus prejudgment interest.
B.

STATUTORY AND REGULATORY SCHEME
1.

Section 5 of the Securities Act

The registration provisions of the Securities Act contemplate that the
offer and sale of securities to the public must be accompanied by the “full
and fair disclosure” afforded by registration with the Commission and
delivery of a statutory prospectus containing information necessary to
enable prospective purchasers to make an informed investment decision.
SEC v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 124 (1953). Registration entails
disclosure of detailed information bearing on the value of publicly-traded
securities, including the issuer’s financial condition, investment risks, the

4


identity and background of management, and the price and amount of
securities to be offered. See 15 U.S.C. 77g and 77aa; SEC v. Manor Nursing
Ctrs., Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1098 (2d Cir.1972). The registration statement is
“central to the Act’s comprehensive scheme for protecting public
investors.” SEC v. Aaron, 605 F.2d 612, 618 (2d Cir.1979), vacated on other
grounds, 446 U.S. 680 (1980).
To establish a prima facie violation of Section 5, the Commission must
show that the securities were offered or sold in unregistered transactions
and that the mails or interstate means were used in the offer or sale. See 15
U.S.C. 77e(a) & (c); Swenson v. Engelstad, 626 F.2d 421, 424 (5th Cir.1980).
The Commission need not prove scienter, i.e., an intent to deceive. See SEC
v. Universal Major Industries Corp., 546 F.2d 1044, 1047 (2d Cir.1976).
The burden then shifts to the defendant to prove that the offer and
sale transactions were exempt from the registration requirements. Ralston
Purina., 346 U.S. at 126; SEC v. Cavanagh, 155 F.3d at 133 (2d Cir.1998).
“Registration exemptions are construed strictly to promote full disclosure
of information for the protection of the investing public.” SEC v. Cavanagh,
445 F.3d 105, 115 (2d Cir.2006); see also SEC v. Kern, 425 F.3d 143, 153 (2d
Cir.2005).

The Section 4(1) exemption from registration

Section 5, by its terms, is all embracing; it prohibits the offer or sale of
unregistered securities. Through exemptive provisions, however,
Congress distinguished between (1) non-exempt distributions of securities
to the public by the issuer of the securities or from persons in a control
relationship with the issuer, which violate Section 5, and (2) exempt trading
5


transactions in the market between investors. See SEC v. Chinese Consol.
Benev. Ass’n, 120 F.2d 738, 741 (2d Cir.1941).
In drawing this distinction between distributions and trading,
Congress not only required registration where securities are sold to the
public by the issuer, but all when an intermediary, or “underwriter,” has
bought the security from the issuer or control person with a view to public
resale, or where an intermediary sells for the issuer or control person.
Intermediaries’ transactions were covered in order to require registration
where distributions originate from control persons, and to prevent evasion
of the registration requirements by the use of intermediaries. See Berckeley
Inv. Group, Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 214 (3d Cir.2006); Chinese Consol.,
120 F.2d at 741.
In order to require registration for public distributions of securities
by the issuer, its control persons and intermediaries, and at the same time
exempt trading transactions, Congress exempted from the registration
provisions “transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter or
dealer,” Section 4(1), and “transactions by an issuer not involving any
public offering,” Section 4(2). 15 U.S.C. 77d(1), (2). These provisions
exempt transactions, not persons. Thus, for example, if any person
involved in a transaction is an “underwriter,” none of the persons involved
may claim exemption for the transaction under Section 4(1). See Kern, 425
F.3d at 152; Zacharias v. SEC, 569 F.3d 458, 463 (D.C. Cir.2009).
“Underwriter,” as defined in Section 2(a)(11), was the statutory
device by which Congress subjected the control persons’ and

6


intermediaries’ transactions to registration. Section 2(a)(11) broadly
defines “underwriter” to mean:
any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or
offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of any
security, or participates or has a direct or indirect participation in any
such undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the direct
or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking * * *. As used in
this paragraph the term “issuer” shall include, in addition to an
issuer, any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by
the issuer, or any person under direct or indirect common control
with the issuer.
15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(11).
A “distribution” as that term is used in Section 2(a)(11) is a public
offering of securities. Gilligan, Will & Co. v. SEC, 267 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.1959).
It refers “to the entire process in a public offering through which a block of
securities is disbursed and ultimately comes to rest in the hand of the
investing public.” Geiger v. SEC, 363 F.3d 481, 487 (D.C. Cir.2004).
3.

Commission Rule 144(k)

During the relevant period in this case, Commission Rule 144(k), the
exemption provision relied on by Tsai in this appeal, provided a safe
harbor for satisfying the Section 4(1) exemption. See 17 C.F.R. 230.144(k).
The Commission adopted Rule 144 to provide greater certainty for persons
who acquire “restricted securities” (securities that have never been publicly
sold) from the issuer or from control persons (referred to as “affiliates” in
the Rule) and later seek to resell those securities in public transactions
without registration. Such persons, in the absence of a safe harbor, may be
seen as acquiring securities “with a view to distribution,” and thus be

7


considered underwriters when they seek to resell. A person satisfying all
conditions of the Rule 144(k) safe harbor was deemed not to be engaged in
a distribution of the securities and therefore not an underwriter of the
securities for purposes of Section 2(a)(11). See 17 C.F.R. 230.144
(Preliminary Note). Rule 144 was designed to be a means of satisfying the
Section 4(1) exemption, but not the exclusive means. See Rule 144(j).1
For a sale of restricted securities to satisfy Rule 144(k), a seller had to
meet two conditions. Kern, 425 F.3d at 148-49. First, the person selling the
restricted securities could not have been an affiliate of the issuer at the time
of the sale, and during the preceding three months. Second, at least two
years must have elapsed since the securities were last acquired from an
issuer or affiliate of the issuer. Only this second condition is at issue in this
appeal. 2
If a defendant asserting a Rule 144(k) exemption failed to
demonstrate either of these requirements, he was not entitled to claim the
safe harbor in Section 144(k). Conversely, if both conditions of Rule 144(k)
were met, a seller who acquired stock from an affiliate or issuer could sell
Rule 144(k) has since been removed, and the conditions that non-affiliates
are required to meet for the sale of their securities under Rule 144 are now
in Rule 144(b).
1

Rule 144(k) applied to sales of securities:
sold for the account of a person who is not an affiliate of the
issuer at the time of the sale and has not been an affiliate during
the preceding three months, provided a period of at least two
years has elapsed since the later of the date the securities were
acquired from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer.
17 C.F.R. 230.144(k).

his stock in reliance on the safe harbor and not be deemed an underwriter.
See 17 C.F.R. 230.144(k) & Preliminary Note; Kern, 425 F.3d at 148-49.
In Rule 144 the term “affiliate,” which refers to a control person, is
described, in language almost identical to that in Section 2(a)(11), as a
person that “directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,
controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.”
17 C.F.R. 230.144(a)(1); Kern, 425 F.3d at 148-49. While Rule 144 does not
define “control,” Rule 405 of Regulation C (containing an identical
definition of “affiliate”), defines “control” as “the possession, direct or
indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management
and policies of a person whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract, or otherwise.” 17 C.F.R. 230.405; see also Kern, 425
F.3d at 149 (applying definition of “control” under Rule 405 to define
“control” under Rule 144(k)).

	 ACTS
1. 	

Tsai forms MAS – one of Tsai’s 101 shell companies – in order
to issue shares that would purportedly become publicly
tradeable, and then he effects a reverse merger with a private
company seeking to go public.

From 1996 through 2000, Tsai formed 101 shell companies. Dkt.121,
(“Tsai.2004”) 25:8-26:9; Dkt.125, Exh.2 at 6-8. This case concerns MAS
Acquisition XI Corporation, formed on October 7, 1996 – shell company
number eleven in Tsai’s MAS Acquisition line of shell companies. Dkt.125,
Exh.21 (“Form 10-SB”) at 26; Tsai.2004 47:9-48:6, 49:2-6. Like Tsai’s other
shell companies, MAS had no business operations, revenue, or earnings,
and was formed for the “sole purpose” of issuing purported publiclytrading shares, thereby making MAS “an attractive candidate for a
prospective merger with a private company desiring to go public,” a so­
10


called reverse merger. Tsai.Decl. ¶¶5-6, 8-9, 11 (MAS “shares were
essentially worthless unless and until a merger ultimately took place”); see
also Tsai.2004 26:13-27:10; Tsai.2002 30:19-22.3
2. 	

Tsai transfers shares to five purported “directors,” but these
individuals never performed any services as directors, never
attended shareholder meetings, did not receive stock
certificates, and gave Tsai blank stock powers.

After forming MAS and issuing 8.5 million shares of MAS’s common
stock to himself, Tsai then issued 1,250 of MAS’s common stock shares –
500 on January 1, 1997, and 750 on September 30, 1998 – to five individuals.
Tsai reported in SEC filings (a Form 10-SB filed by MAS) that these shares
were issued “to former directors of [MAS] as compensation for their
services.” Form 10-SB at 26; Dkt.125, Exh.22 (“Form 10-SB/A”) at 27;
Tsai.2004 47:9-48:6, 49:2-6.4 On January 1, 1997, Tsai also transferred 50,000
of his shares to each of these five purported directors. Form 10-SB/A at 27.

In a “reverse merger” a private company is acquired by a publicly-held,
or purportedly publicly-held, shell company. The shell company has
minimal assets and no operations, but has publicly-trading shares. The
shell company exchanges its stock for the private company’s assets. After a
reverse merger, the new company assumes the corporate identity,
management, and name of the former private company. Thus, in a reverse
merger, it is intended that a private corporation be transformed into a
publicly-traded company. See Cavanagh, 445 F.3d at 108n.4; SEC v. M & A
West, Inc., 538 F.3d 1043, 1046 (9th Cir.2008).

A Form 10-SB, required to register a class of securities of a small business
under the Exchange Act, may be voluntarily filed. See 15 U.S.C. 78l(g), 17
C.F.R. 240.12b-2. Tsai prepared and voluntarily filed MAS’s Form 10-SB on
April 16, 1999, and an amended Form 10-SB on June 22, 1999. Tsai.2002

Tsai made these and later transfers of MAS shares “to increase the number
of shareholders,” in an effort to make MAS’s shares publicly traded.
Tsai.Decl. ¶9.
Although, as noted, MAS reported in Commission filings that these
five individuals received shares as “compensation” for their services as
“directors,” none of them performed any services for MAS (Tsai.2004 92:12­
17), and Tsai has since called them “honorary directors” (Br.55, Tsai.Decl.
¶16), or “five of his friends” (Br.29, Tsai.Decl. ¶9). Tsai concedes that
MAS’s filings with the Commission contained this and the following other
inaccuracies: 5
•	 Although MAS reported that its board of directors “consists of three
members,” (Form 10-SB/A at 44 ¶3.02), Tsai admitted that this
statement was “inaccurate” because he was the only director.
Tsai.2004 51:11-52:18.
•	 Although MAS reported that annual shareholder meetings were
required to be held, and directors elected at these meetings (Form 10­
SB/A at 41 ¶2.02), Tsai held these meetings and elected directors by
himself. Tsai.2004 181:4-182:9.
•	 Although MAS reported that notice of shareholder meetings “shall be
delivered” to shareholders (Form 10-SB/A at 41-43 ¶¶2.04, 2.10), Tsai
could not recall ever providing such notice. Tsai.2004 182:10-184:15.
•	 Although MAS reported that stock certificates “shall be delivered” to
MAS’s shareholders (Form 10-SB/A at 51-52 ¶7.01), they were not in
fact delivered. Tsai.2004 65:8-66:13.

These filings are not the basis of Tsai’s reporting violations, see Argument
III.

In addition, Tsai had these five individuals sign blank stock powers
when they became shareholders.6 Tsai.2004 43:20-44:15; e.g., Dkt.101
(Hemmer) 19:12-21:13 & Exh.2; Dkt.114 (“Lee”) 29:7-31:6 & Exh.27. Here,
the stock powers were blank forms that did not contain the name of the
transferee or the number of shares involved. Id. Tsai “had them sign,” and
he could later “go back to type in the information.” Tsai.2002 159:18-24.
Tsai explained that these blank stock powers enabled him to transfer, at
will, the stock issued in the names of these individuals. Tsai.2004 41:7­
42:8.7
3. 	

Tsai transfers shares from the five individuals to an
additional 28 people, in an effort to expand the number of
MAS’s shareholders.

From July through December 1999, Tsai endeavored to get the stock
held by the five purported directors cleared for public trading by the
NASD. Tsai.Decl. ¶9. To that end, on July 14, 1999 a broker-dealer firm
retained by Tsai, Kensington Capital Corporation, filed a Form 211 with the

A “stock power” is “a power of attorney permitting a person, other than
the owner, to transfer ownership of a security to a third party.” Black’s Law
Dictionary (8th ed.2004).

One of the five individuals to whom Tsai initially transferred shares
included a mentally-disabled shareholder referred to as “April C.”
Tsai.Decl. at 4 ¶9; Dkt.125, Exh.28; Dkt.125, Exh.23 (Hawkins) at 9:2-10:10,
22:1-18, 24:1-20. As her caretaker testified, April C. would not be able to
understand what a corporate director is, what shares of stock are worth,
what legal documents mean, and April C.’s limitations would be obvious
to anyone interacting with her. Hawkins 33:24-35:24; Dkt.125, Exh.27 at 47
(April C. stock power).

13


NASD. Dkt.125, Exh.25 (Form 211, July 1999).8 On July 26, 1999, the NASD
rejected the Form 211 as “deficient,” because the proposed tradeable shares
of MAS were “being held by 5 shareholders” – the purported directors –
which was an unacceptably high “concentration” of holdings. Dkt.125,
Exh.26 (NASD rejection letter).
In response to the NASD’s rejection of the Form 211, Tsai “found
more shareholders” by transferring shares he had provided to the five
purported directors to 28 additional shareholders. Tsai.2004 104:24-105:22;
Tsai.Decl. ¶9 (“I arranged for the transfer of most of [the five individuals’]
shares to 28 additional friends, acquaintances or associates.”). The purpose
of Tsai’s transfers was to reduce the concentration of shares by spreading
them among a total of 33 individuals, thereby allaying the NASD’s
concerns, and advancing his goal of making MAS an attractive merger
candidate with publicly-trading shares. Tsai.2004 110:11-17, 111:3-14.
Tsai transferred these shares using the blank stock powers that he
previously had the five purported directors sign, and Tsai chose which of
Pursuant to NASD Rule 6740, before a broker-dealer firm quotes a
security on the Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Bulletin Board, it submits a
Form 211 to the NASD to demonstrate satisfaction of Commission Rule
15c2-11, 17 C.F.R. 240.15c2-11 (directing a broker-dealer to maintain in its
files current information about the issuer). Dkt.129 (“McClarin”) 33:3-5.
As part of the Form 211 application, it is not uncommon for broker-dealers
to submit an attorney letter opining, based on information provided by the
issuer, that the shares are available for quotation, but confirming that
quotation is not being solicited by issuers or control persons. According to
the NASD files in this case, it received an unsigned attorney opinion to that
effect (Dkt.125, Exh.28 at 179-80), and the attorney whose name appears
later denied authorizing its transmittal to the NASD (Dkt.145 at 4).

the five shareholders would make a transfer to a particular transferee, and
the amount of shares to transfer, on a “more or less arbitrary” basis.
Tsai.2004 108:8-110:6; see also id. 112:10-20, 41:7-44:15; Tsai.2002 159:18-24;
Dkt.101 at Exh.2; Dkt.125, Exh. 28. Tsai transferred the shares without
providing any compensation to the five purported directors. Dkt.125,
Exh.28. Tsai also obtained additional blank stock powers from the 28 new
shareholders. Tsai.2002 72:10-74:12; Tsai.Decl. ¶15; Dkt.125, Exh.27; Br.7;
e.g., Lee 29:7-31:6 (“I signed the stock powers without anything written on
it”). Tsai did not issue them stock certificates. Tsai.2004 222:22-223:18,
64:2-17; Tsai.2002 108:2-12.
On September 1, 1999, after these additional transfers were complete,
Kensington Capital resubmitted to the NASD the expanded list of 33 MAS
shareholders. Dkt.125, Exh.28 at 178; Tsai.Decl. ¶9. On December 13, 1999,
the NASD approved MAS’s Form 211, and cleared these MAS shares for
public trading on the OTC Bulletin Board. Dkt.125, Exh.29. Tsai testified
that after the Form 211 process was completed, these shares became more
liquid, and therefore more valuable. Tsai.2004 228:3-20. Although the
Form 211 process was designed to allow shareholders to sell shares in the
public market (this is what Tsai intended when he sought to make MAS
shares “tradeable”), Tsai conceded that neither the five purported directors
nor the 28 additional shareholders knew that the Form 211 process had
been completed. Tsai.2004 227:20-228:2.

Tsai signs a reverse merger agreement between MAS and
Bluepoint.

Now that Tsai’s shell company had shares cleared for public trading,
it was time to find a private company that wanted to become public.
Markow, one of the promoters, contacted Tsai about a merger between
MAS and Bluepoint, a Chinese company, formerly known as Shenzhen
Sinx Software Technology Corporation, that claimed to have developed a
Chinese version of the Linux computer operating system. Dkt.113 (Yang)
42:19-43:5, 51:11-23, 65:13-25; Tsai.2002 at 16:12-15. Between December 1999
and January 2000, Tsai began negotiating with Bluepoint. Tsai.2004 186:25­
195; Tsai.2002 16:12-25; Dkt.125, Exh.30.
As a preliminary step to the reverse merger, on January 5, 2000 Tsai
cancelled over 8.2 million of the MAS shares that he had issued to himself
on MAS’s date of incorporation, retaining 453,000 of these shares. Dkt.125,
Exh.32 (Form 8-K filed February 18, 2000) at 2; Dkt.125, Exh.1
(“Helpingstine”) ¶10. Two days later, on January 7, MAS effected a 15-for­
1 stock split. Dkt.125, Exh.32 at 2. As a result of the stock split, the 250,000
shares held in the names of the 33 shareholders (that had been cleared for
trading by the NASD) became 3.75 million shares. Id.
On the same day as the stock split, Tsai signed, as president of MAS,
a reverse merger agreement between MAS and Bluepoint. Dkt.125, Exh.30
(Agreement); Tsai.2004 196:2-18.

Tsai transfers the 33 MAS shareholders’ shares to the
promoters.

At the same time that the reverse merger agreement was signed, the
promoters began the process of purchasing from Tsai the purported
publicly-tradeable shares held in the names of the 33 MAS shareholders.
Tsai.2004 222:13-224:17. On January 7, 2000, the promoters were notified
that the purchase price for all of the 33 MAS shareholders’ shares was
$250,000 (Goelo told Yang, Yang notified Luo). Dkt.125, Exh.33; Dkt.113 at
218:7-19. On January 20 and February 7, 2000, three of the promoters each
sent wire transfers to Markow totalling $249,980 (one bank deducted a wire
fee). Dkt.125, Exh.34; Dkt.125, Exh.6 (“Markow”) 67:3-68:4, 80:21-82:10-25.
On February 8, 2000, the day after receiving the last of these wire transfers,
Markow sent Tsai a cashier’s check for $250,000. Dkt.125, Exh.35.
In return, Tsai for the first time created stock certificates for the 33
shareholders’ shares, and mailed Markow the 33 shareholders’ stock
powers and stock certificates. Tsai.2004 222:22-223:18, 64:2-17; Tsai.2002
108:2-12. The 33 shareholders never saw the stock certificates. Id. On
February 14, 2000, Markow sent each of the 33 shareholders a check for
$100, regardless of whether 15,000 or 135,000 of their shares (the range of
the shareholders’ holdings) were sold. Dkt.125, Exh.37; Tsai.2004 218:23­
220:6; Dkt.125, Exh.28 at 178. Several shareholders testified that they did
not know that they had sold their shares. E.g., Dkt.103 31:2-8; Dkt.105 34:1­
14, 41:3-4. Tsai understood that the merger agreement made the shares
more valuable, yet the 33 shareholders did not know that a merger
agreement had been signed. Tsai.2004 227:11-228:20.
17


The reverse merger was executed on February 17, 2000; MAS
acquired Bluepoint, and MAS changed its name to “Bluepoint.” Dkt.125,
Exh.39; Tsai.2002 143:1-144:15. On February 22, 2000, Markow cancelled all
of the 33 shareholders’ stock certificates, and new certificates in the
promoters’ names were issued. Dkt.125, Exh.41; Markow 52:13-53:19.
6. 	

Within weeks of acquiring their shares, the promoters sell
them in public transactions to investors who lacked
important information about the company.

The promoters touted Bluepoint stock on the internet and through a
press release. Dkt.118, Exh.70 (internet postings); Dkt.139, Exh.6; Dkt.125,
Exh.55 (press release). Less than a month after the promoters acquired the
stock, on March 6, 2000, Bluepoint began publicly trading on the OTC
Bulletin Board. Dkt.125, Exh.55. The promoters, who sold Bluepoint stock
on the first days of trading, sold their stock for a profit totalling more than
$3.8 million. Helpingstine ¶¶19, 28, 36, 44. They were able to do so
because on the first day of trading the price of Bluepoint shot up from $6
per share to peak at $21 per share. Dkt.274, Exh. 9. By June 2000, however,
Bluepoint was selling at only $3 per share and never rose above $5 per
share thereafter. Dkt.275, Exh. 2. Because the promoters’ distribution was
not registered, and because the post-merger company did not file with the
Commission the information that would have been in a registration
statement until over one month after the distribution began, investors who
purchased Bluepoint during this time were denied the important

18


information about the new company that would have been included in a
registration statement.9
E.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
The Commission instituted this action on April 11, 2003, alleging that

Tsai and the promoters violated the registration provisions of the Securities
Act, and violated the shareholder reporting provisions under the Exchange
Act. The complaint also charged the promoters, but not Tsai, with
violating the antifraud provisions in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15
U.S.C. 77q(a), and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), and
Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5, promulgated thereunder. The Commission
sought permanent injunctions against future violations, disgorgement of
the proceeds obtained as a result of these violations, and civil monetary
penalties. Dkt.1.
Thereafter, the Commission moved for summary judgment against
Tsai on the registration and reporting violations, Tsai cross-moved for
summary judgment on these claims, and the district court denied Tsai’s

Prior to the distribution, Tsai and the promoters – but not investors –
reviewed Bluepoint’s business plan and financial statements, which
contained a detailed description of Bluepoint’s product, risks, and financial
projections, and showed that Bluepoint did not have any significant
revenue. Dkt.125, Exh.31 at 224-226, 228-237; Tsai.2004 188:16-192:24.
Bluepoint filed a Form 8-K/A containing financial statements on April 18,
2000.

19


motion and granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission.10 The
district court concluded that the Commission demonstrated Tsai’s prima
facie violation of Section 5 (Dkt.221 (“Op.”) at 26-32); the public sales by the
promoters were not exempt under Section 4(1) because the promoters
acquired shares from affiliates (the 33 shareholders) that they sold in a
public distribution (i.e., were underwriters) (Op.41-47); the safe harbor
under Rule 144(k) was unavailable because the promoters sold their shares
without holding for two years after they purchased their shares from
affiliates of the issuer (Op.33-41). The district court rejected Tsai’s
argument that he did not have notice of the non-fraud nature of the
Commission’s Section 5 claim. Op.47-51. The district court also concluded
that Tsai violated the reporting provisions by underreporting his beneficial
ownership of MAS shares. Op.53-55.
The district court permanently enjoined Tsai against committing
future violations, and ordered him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment
interest totaling $351,987. Op.84-85.11

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the
Commission against the other defendants on the Section 5 claims, and
denied the promoter defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the
fraud claims.

The district court reserved the issue whether Tsai should pay civil
penalties, and the Commission will move for civil penalties in the event
that this Court affirms the district court’s March 1, 2009 judgment. Dkt.244.
(Judgment was entered under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), giving this Court
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1291 or 1292(a)(1)). The Commission has
also instituted an administrative proceeding against Tsai, based on the
violations found in this case. See In re Aaron Tsai, No. 3-13835.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Undisputed facts demonstrate that Tsai controlled MAS and its 33
shareholders who held purportedly tradeable shares. Tsai admits that he
controlled MAS, and Tsai likewise controlled its shareholders by using
blank stock powers to transfer their shares at will, and by refusing to
observe the most basic principles of corporate governance.
As alleged in the complaint and demonstrated on summary
judgment, Tsai’s control renders him liable for violations of the registration
provisions and the shareholder reporting provisions. Because MAS and
the 33 shareholders were under Tsai’s common control, the promoters
acquired their shares from affiliates of the issuer, making Rule 144(k)’s safe
harbor for satisfying the Section 4(1) registration exemption unavailable
when these shares were immediately resold to the public without
registration. Tsai’s control over these shares also demonstrates that Tsai
was their beneficial owner, which he never disclosed as required by the
shareholder reporting provisions. Because Tsai’s control of 100 other shell
companies makes his future violation of these provisions likely, and Tsai
has been previously enjoined, ordering relief here was appropriate.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
This Court reviews a district court’s grant or denial of summary
judgment de novo. Seaway Food Town, Inc. v. Medical Mutual, 347 F.3d 610,
616 (6th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate if “there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Although in
reviewing a district court’s grant or denial of summary judgment evidence

21


is viewed “in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,” the
evidence offered by the nonmoving party must be “significantly
probative.” Macy v. Hopkins, 484 F.3d 357, 363 (6th Cir.2007). This Court
will uphold a grant of summary judgment “where the record as a whole
could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.”
Cummings v. Akron, 418 F.3d 676, 682 (6th Cir.2005).
The district court’s order of disgorgement and injunctive relief is
reviewed for an abuse of discretion. SEC v. Youmans, 729 F.2d 413, 415 (6th
Cir.1984).

ARGUMENT
I.

	 SAI VIOLATED THE REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5 BY
T
PARTICIPATING IN SECURITIES SALES FOR WHICH NO EXEMPTION WAS
AVAILABLE.
Undisputed facts demonstrate that Tsai violated Section 5 because he

directly or indirectly participated in the promoters’ sales of securities in an
unregistered distribution. On appeal, Tsai argues that the promoters’ sales
were exempt from registration under Rule 144(k), Br.27-47, but he cannot
sustain his burden. The promoters’ public sales were not exempt because
the stock they sold was acquired from affiliates – control persons – of the
issuer.12

Many of the issues addressed in the district court’s comprehensive
opinion are not at issue in this appeal. For example, the district court
rejected arguments that Tsai’s distributions of securities to the 33
shareholders leading up to the reverse merger did not violate Section 5.
Op.26-32.
12

22


A. 	

Tsai’s undisputed control over both MAS and the 33
shareholders shows that the shareholders were under
common control with the issuer, and therefore defeats
exemption under Section 4(1) and Rule 144(k).

Exemption under both Section 4(1) and Rule 144(k) here depends on
whether and when shares were acquired from persons in a control
relationship with the issuer. A control person, or affiliate, is any person
that directly or indirectly “controls,” or is “controlled by,” or is under
“common control” with, the issuer. 17 C.F.R. 230.144(a)(1). As
demonstrated below, Tsai controlled MAS and Tsai also controlled the 33
shareholders. Therefore, MAS and the shareholders were under Tsai’s
“common control.”
When the promoters acquired shares in February 2000 – whether the
shares are seen as having been acquired from the 33 shareholders or from
Tsai – the promoters acquired from affiliates of the issuer. If the promoters
are viewed as having acquired from the shareholders, the promoters
acquired from persons under “common control” with the issuer.
Alternatively, because of the extent of Tsai’s control over MAS and the
shareholders, the promoters’ February 2000 purchase can also be viewed as
a purchase from Tsai, who was at all times “controlling” the issuer.
Under either alternative, it cannot be seriously disputed that the
promoters acquired these shares with “a view” to their distribution, as
specified in the Section 2(a)(11) definition of “underwriter.” The promoters
purchased the shares in order to profit from a public distribution on the
OTC Bulletin Board, and the promoters indeed began selling their shares to
the public for enormous profits less than one month later.
23


Because the promoters acquired the stock in February 2000 from
control persons with a view to public distribution, they were
“underwriters” when they sold their stock. Because the public sales
involved underwriters, and Section 4(1) is unavailable if any person
involved in a transaction is an underwriter (Kern, 425 F.3d at 152, Zacharias,
569 F.3d at 463), exemption under 4(1) is also unavailable to Tsai,
regardless of whether Tsai himself was an underwriter.
The safe harbor in Rule 144(k) is similarly not available because in
February 2000 the promoters acquired securities from affiliates, and sold
those shares to the public in March 2000 – far less than two years after this
acquisition. See Cavanagh, 445 F.3d at 110-13 (affirming summary judgment
where sellers “were ‘affiliates’ of an ‘issuer’ when the challenged
transactions occurred”). This is true whether the promoters are viewed as
having acquired from the 33 shareholders or Tsai. Under either view, Tsai
cannot satisfy the necessary two-year holding period in Rule 144(k), and
accordingly no safe harbor was available. See Kern, 425 F.3d at 148-49.
Tsai argues that the safe harbor is satisfied because his transfer of
shares to five purported directors on January 1, 1997, and the transfer of
shares from the five shareholders to 28 additional shareholders, were
“gifts,” and therefore that the 33 shareholders held their shares for more
than two years prior to the February 2000 sales to the promoters. Br.28-33.
Presumably Tsai’s argument is an attempt to show that the promoters
satisfied the Rule’s two-year holding period by tacking their holding
period to the shareholders’ holding period (which Tsai contends was at

24


least 34 months). Br.31-33 (discussing Rule 144(d)(3)(v), 17 C.F.R.
230.144(d)(3)(v) (determination of holding period for “gifts”)).
However, this argument fails because even if the transfers between
shareholders were “gifts,” no one argues that the shareholders “gifted” their
shares to the promoters in February 2000. The tacking provision cited by
Tsai provides that where there is a gift of securities by an affiliate donor,
the donor’s holding period can be tacked-on to the donee’s holding period.
Here, because the shareholders made no gift to the promoters, the
shareholders were not donors and the promoters were not donees, and this
tacking provision does not apply.
Here, the promoters purchased shares from affiliates, and the
promoters did not hold the shares for two years before reselling them to the
public; therefore it does not matter how long those affiliates had held their
shares. Rule 144(k)’s two-year holding period by its terms begins to run
anew every time restricted securities are purchased from an affiliate. Every
purchase from an affiliate restarts the two-year clock, no matter how long
the restricted securities had previously been held. See Resales of Securities,
Release No. 6032 (March 5, 1979).
Furthermore, the undisputed record precludes Tsai’s argument that
his transfer of shares to the five purported directors was a bona fide gift. As
we discuss below, Tsai retained such sweeping control over these five
shareholders’ shares that Tsai was able to later “re-gift” these same shares
to 28 people, and transfer the shares as he pleased. There was plainly no
gift.

25


B. 	

Tsai’s control over MAS and the 33 shareholders cannot be
disputed.

As described above, if Tsai controlled MAS and the 33 shareholders,
no exemption is available. Tsai concedes that he controlled MAS, but
argues that he had only “limited authority” to control the 33 shareholders.
Br.33-41. The undisputed record, including Tsai’s own testimony and
documentary evidence, devastates his argument.
Contrary to Tsai’s contentions (Br.36), Congress wanted control to be
“broad[ly]” defined (Kern, 425 F.3d at 150n.3), based on “the realities of the
situation” (SEC v. Intern’l Chem. Dev. Corp., 469 F.2d 20, 28 (10th Cir.1972)).
See also H.R.Rep.No. 1383, 73d Cong, 2d Sess. 26 (1934) (Congress wanted
control broadly defined because it is “difficult if not impossible to
enumerate or to anticipate the many ways in which actual control may be
exerted”). Accordingly, contrary to Tsai’s suggestion (Br.41), courts of
appeals are not shy to affirm summary judgment where the undisputed
facts demonstrate control. E.g., Kern, 425 F.3d at 148-50; Cavanagh, 445 F.3d
at 111-16; M & A West, 538 F.3d at 1051-53.
1. 	

Tsai controlled MAS.

Tsai’s control over MAS is beyond dispute. Tsai was MAS’s
chairman, president, chief executive officer, treasurer, and “controlling
shareholder” from the time of its incorporation until its reverse merger
with Bluepoint. Tsai.2002 23:3-12; Tsai.Decl. ¶7.
In addition, Tsai’s ability to single-handedly execute MAS’s reverse
merger demonstrates his control over MAS. See Kern, 425 F.3d at 148-50;

26


M & A West, 538 F.3d at 1051n.9 (“The authority to transfer ownership of
the company” establishes control); Dkt.125, Exh.30 ¶1.02.13
Furthermore, Tsai’s failure to observe the corporate formalities
required by MAS’s bylaws – e.g., he was the only member of MAS’s board
of directors, and held annual shareholder meetings by himself and without
notice – likewise demonstrated Tsai’s control over MAS. See Kern, 425 F.3d
at 149.
Tsai distinguishes Kern, arguing that the control persons in that case
had transferred shares to their friends, and then “reacquired” a 90% stake
from these friends, whereas he did not “reacquire” stock from the
shareholders. Br.34-37. This is a pointless distinction in light of the fact
that Tsai maintained a continuous, and larger, 95% controlling interest in
MAS (Dkt.142 at 25), and therefore did not have to go through the trouble
of reacquiring any shares from the 33 shareholders. In any event, to
establish control the Commission need not demonstrate that Tsai did
exactly “what the control persons did in Kern.” Br.34-37.
Tsai also asserts that a “key factor” determinative of control is
whether a person has the power to “cause the issuer to prepare and file a
registration statement” (Br.46), which is a power that Tsai surely wielded,
but withheld from exercising here. Tsai argues that none of the 33
shareholders had the power to cause MAS to prepare and file a registration
Tsai repeatedly insists that the $250,000 he received was not payment for
the 33 shareholders’ shares but was Tsai’s “fee” for “bringing about the
reverse merger.” Br.8-9, 12, 19. Even accepting Tsai’s “fee”
characterization, its payment demonstrates that Tsai controlled the reverse
merger transaction.

13

27


statement (Br.46), but Tsai – not the 33 shareholders – controlled MAS, and
the 33 shareholders were affiliates not because they controlled MAS, but
because they were under Tsai’s common control.
2.

Tsai controlled the shareholders.

Contrary to Tsai’s assertion that he had “limited authority” over the
shareholders (Br.33-41), the record demonstrates that Tsai’s control over
them was expansive.
Tsai controlled the shareholders’ ownership interests through his
use of blank stock powers and his failure to issue stock certificates. See
Kern, 425 F.3d at 149 (power over ownership interests demonstrates
control); M & A West, 538 F.3d at 1052-54. Tsai’s use of blank stock powers
and his failure to issue stock certificates gave Tsai control to decide whether
to transfer the shareholders’ shares, the identity of the transferee, the timing
of the transfer, the amount to transfer, and the price (if any) of the transfer.
Tsai concedes that he had all 33 shareholders sign blank stock powers
so he could later “go back to type in the information” about the name of the
transferee or the number of shares involved. Tsai.2002 159:18-24, 72:10­
74:11; Dkt.125, Exh.27 (stock powers); Br.7. That the shareholders “signed
the stock powers” and Tsai “explained” their purpose (Br.38-40) did not
limit the control that Tsai was able to exercise with them. Tsai obtained a
blank stock power from a shareholder who was mentally disabled and
lacked the capacity to contract (Op.8), and Tsai was able to exercise the
same level of authority over all the other shareholders through blank stock
powers. Dkt.125, Exh.23.

28


Tsai also controlled all the shareholders’ stock certificates. Although
MAS’s bylaws required stock certificates to be delivered to all 33
shareholders (Form 10-SB/A at 51-52 ¶7.01), Tsai never sent them.
Tsai.2004 65:8-66:13, 222:22-223:18; Tsai.2002 108:2-12. When he so desired,
Tsai was able to deliver the stock certificates directly to himself, and then
Tsai sent them to Markow (along with a sheaf of stock powers), as part of
the transfer of all of the shareholders’ shares to the promoters. Id.; Dkt.125,
Exh.27.
The combination of Tsai’s blank stock powers and his ability to
orchestrate when and how to issue stock certificates gave Tsai complete
authority, rather than “limited authority,” over the shareholders. The blank
stock powers “rendered the certificates fully negotiable and freely
transferable,” and were “bearer instruments.” In re Legel, Braswell Gov. Sec.
Corp., 648 F.2d 321, 324, 327 & n.11 (5th Cir.1981); see also In re Legel Braswell
Gov. Sec. Corp., 695 F.2d 506, 513 (11th Cir.1983) (same). Therefore, Tsai
literally had a blank check to control the shareholders with respect to their
shares.
Tsai argues that there is a factual dispute about what he subjectively
“believed that each shareholder understood” based on their purported
“confusion or lack of understanding or problems of recollection” regarding
what Tsai said (Br.37-40), but the documentary evidence and Tsai’s own
testimony, as cited above, demonstrate that he had objective control over
the shareholders’ stock interests.

29


Tsai exercised control over the shareholders by transferring their
shares at will. See Kern, 425 F.3d at 149 (orchestrating share transfers
indicates control); M & A West, 538 F.3d at 1052-54. Contrary to Tsai’s
assertion in his brief that he “did not arrange for transfers of the MAS XI
shares from any shareholder unless the shareholder did so,” (Br.7, 39), Tsai
admitted in his testimony that he was able to choose whether to transfer
shares and the timing of the transfers at will. Tsai.2004 41:7-42:8, 147:15-20;
Tsai.2002 159:18-24.
In fact, when Tsai used stock powers to transfer shares from the five
individuals to an additional 28 people (Tsai.2004 112:10-14, 41:7-44:15), Tsai
admits that he was able to choose the transferee and the amount of shares
to transfer on a “more or less arbitrary” basis. Tsai.2004 108:8-110:6
(emphasis added); see also Tsai.2002 159:18-24. Likewise, Tsai transferred to
the promoters in February 2000 all of the shareholders’ stock powers and
their stock certificates, certificates that the shareholders had never received
and had been given directly to Tsai. Tsai.2004 222:22-223:18; Tsai.2002
72:10-74:11.
That the shareholders received $100 for their shares does not nullify
Tsai’s control, notwithstanding his claim that this was “the going market
rate” for the shares. Br.37, 42. Rather, Tsai demonstrated his control
because he decided to sell their shares at this price, and it was not a
“market rate” determined at arms’ length. Previously, Tsai had decided to
transfer shares to the 28 additional shareholders without providing any
compensation to the five purported directors. Dkt.125, Exh.28 at 177.
Furthermore, the “market rate” characterization is also incoherent because
30


the shareholders were not compensated on a pro rata basis – every
shareholder received $100, regardless of whether 15,000 or 135,000 of their
shares were sold; therefore Tsai’s purported “market price” inexplicably
varied from $0.0067 to $0.0007. Helpingstine ¶13; Dkt.125, Exh.28 at 178;
Tsai.2004 218:23-220:6. In addition, Tsai conceded that, when their shares
were sold, the shareholders were unaware that the Form 211 process was
complete or that a reverse merger agreement had been signed, and that
both of these events had made their shares more valuable. Tsai.2004
227:11-228:20; Br.9. Finally, the price differential between the $250,000 that
the promoters paid for the shareholders’ shares on February 8, 2000
(Dkt.125, Exhs.33, 34, Dkt.113 218:7-19), and the $3,300 Tsai determined
that the shareholders would receive less than one week later on February 14,
2000 (Dkt.125, Exh.37, Tsai.2004 218-23:220:6) is proof of Tsai’s control. Cf.
Kern, 425 F.3d at 150.
For the same reasons, there is no merit to Tsai’s argument that he did
not exercise control because each of the shareholders “kept or spent” the
$100 for “his or her own use.” Br.6, 8, 38. That Tsai did not control how
the 33 individuals spent their money after Tsai sold and delivered their
shares to the promoters does not diminish the control that Tsai exerted
while they were shareholders. And even if the shareholders had torn the
$100 checks into pieces, the share transfers that Tsai had orchestrated
would still have been completed. See Legel, 648 F.2d at 324, 327 & n.11
(blank stock powers render stock certificates “bearer instruments”).
Tsai’s reliance on Pennaluna & Co. v. SEC, 410 F.2d 861 (9th Cir.1969)
is misplaced. Contrary to Tsai’s assertion (Br.45-46), the person who
31


controlled the shares in an escrow account had not yet become a
controlling person of the issuer at the relevant time. Id. at 865-67 (accepting
appellants’ contention that although “he later occupied a position of
control,” he “was not in such a position * * * when the stock” at issue “was
sold”). Tsai also relies on two inapposite Commission staff no-action
letters (Br.43-45) – one dealing with a bona fide gift, and the other with an
employee retirement plan, neither of which is present here – that in any
event lack precedential effect. See Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576,
587 (2000); Federal Election Commission v. National Rifle Association, 254 F.3d
173, 186 (D.C. Cir.2001); Op.41n.24.
Tsai’s ability to dominate MAS, sell MAS, and ignore MAS’s
corporate formalities demonstrates that Tsai controlled the 33 minority
shareholders. See Kern, 425 F.3d at 148-50. Tsai was able to “dominate the
limited affairs pertinent to” MAS’s shareholders (id.) because he: held
every one of MAS’s corporate offices; was MAS’s controlling shareholder;
sold a controlling interest in MAS through the reverse merger without the
shareholders’ awareness (Tsai.2004 227:11-228:20); and short-circuited the
very components of MAS’s corporate governance system (board of
directors, shareholder meetings) that were designed to attenuate a control­
person’s power over minority shareholders. See generally, American Law
Institute, Principles of Corporate Governance (1994).
C.

Tsai is liable for violating Section 5.

Tsai’s control over MAS and the shareholders defeats exemption
under Section 4(1), and makes the safe harbor under Rule 144(k)

32


unavailable. In the absence of any recognized exemption, this Court
should affirm summary judgment against Tsai for violating Section 5.
It is of no moment that Tsai himself did not sell the securities on the
OTC Bulletin Board to the public. To hold that direct sales to the public is
necessary would “be to ignore and render meaningless the language of
section 5, which prohibits any person from ‘directly or indirectly’ engaging
in the offer or sale of unregistered securities.” SEC v. Holschuh, 694 F.2d
130, 139-40 (7th Cir.1982); see also Geiger, 363 F.3d at 487 (culpable
defendant “did not have to be involved in the final step of the
distribution”). Tsai is liable because he was indisputably a “necessary
participant” and “substantial factor” in the ultimate public distribution.
SEC v. Murphy, 626 F.2d 633, 649-52 (9th Cir.1980); Holschuh, 694 F.2d at
139-40. As the district court explained, Tsai’s transfers expanding the
number of MAS shareholders were “preliminary links in the daisy-chain of
Tsai’s overall plan to seek a profit from his shell company by securing
public trading status and arranging a reverse merger which could
inevitably lead to a public distribution.” Op.43.
Indeed, Tsai testified that his “sole purpose” in creating MAS and
issuing shares to himself and others was to generate publicly-trading
shares, thereby making MAS “an attractive candidate for a prospective
merger with a private company desiring to go public.” Tsai.Decl. ¶¶8-9
(emphasis added); M & A West, 538 F.3d at 1052-53 (where the “express
purpose” of multiple transactions was “to transform a private corporation
into a corporation selling stock shares to the public,” there is “a single
actual transaction with multiple stages”). Tsai accomplished this goal by
33


carefully orchestrating the various transfers between MAS’s shareholders,
transferring their shares to the promoters, and then executing the reverse
merger. Like the defendant found liable in Holschuh – who also formed the
issuer, served as its president, and signed the key contracts on the issuer’s
behalf – the record shows that Tsai’s actions “intimately involved him in
the details of numerous stages of a greater plan, of which he had in fact
been a designer.” Holschuh, 694 F.2d at 140; see also SEC v. Phan, 500 F.3d
895, 905-07 (9th Cir.2007) (affirming summary judgment against defendant
who “directed” transactions but did not “participate” or “benefit” from
sales to the public).
D. 	 Tsai’s remaining arguments concerning “industry custom,”
NASD approval of a Form 211, and an NASD letter are
without merit and do not otherwise provide exemption from
registration.
Tsai repeatedly asserts that he followed the “normal and customary
procedure in the industry” with respect to reverse mergers, as if that fact,
even if true, is significant to his Section 5 liability. Br.8-9, 12, 19, 38n.4, 53.
However, as the district court correctly found, “[t]here is no ‘industry
custom’ exemption to the registration requirement or to satisfying the
required elements of the Rule 144(k) exemption.” Op.39n.22. Reverse
mergers, finders’ fees, and modest payments to shell company
shareholders are not per se unlawful, but here Tsai used these activities to
violate Section 5. Indeed, one or more of these “customary procedures”
were also used by the defendants whose Section 5 liability was affirmed in
M & A West, Cavanagh, and Kern. Cf., Ganino v. Citizens Utilities Co., 228
F.3d 154 (2d Cir.2000) (even customary industry practices can be unlawful).
34


Nor is there any merit to Tsai’s argument that the NASD’s approval
of MAS’s Form 211 demonstrates that the sale of securities without
registration here was “reasonable.” Br.11-12, 25-27. As the NASD has
made clear, and Tsai has conceded, in approving a Form 211 the “NASD
does not make findings of fact or law as to whether the shares are exempt from
registration,” and the “NASD does not ‘ultimately’ decide whether the
shares are freely tradeable.” Br.26 (emphasis added). Indeed, the NASD’s
approval letter specifically gave Tsai “fair warning” (Br.25) that it had
made no determination regarding compliance with Section 5 or Rule
144(k):
Please be advised that in clearing [Kensington Capital]’s filing
it should not be assumed that any federal, state, or selfregulatory requirements other than Rule 6740 and Rule 15c2-11
have been considered.
Dkt.125, Exh.29 (emphasis added). The examiner who reviewed this
particular application and signed this approval letter (McClarin 21:21-22:7,
8:8-21) confirmed that the NASD “would not have arrived at any actual
conclusion” as to whether or not an exemption was available because “the
Form 211 process is not a merit review,” therefore “there was not a
decision made by myself or anyone else regarding that issue.” McClarin
66:20-68:8, 77:14-78:3. Furthermore, Tsai’s misrepresentations in the filings
that were the basis of NASD’s approval precludes any reliance on that

35


approval.14 Accordingly, as the district court correctly concluded (Op.82­
83), the NASD’s approval of the Form 211 has no bearing on the
availability of an exemption under Rule 144(k) or the reasonableness of
Tsai’s actions. Indeed, Tsai’s reliance on the NASD’s approval of the Form
211 as an exemption to registration was affirmatively unreasonable.
Finally, Tsai asserts that a letter sent from a staff member at the
NASD to a staff member at the Commission asking for guidance about the
treatment of “gifted shares” demonstrates that the NASD was generally
“uncertain” about how to treat “gifted” shares of shell companies. Br.10­
12, 54 (citing NASD Regulation, Inc., SEC No-Action Letter, 2000 SEC NoAct. LEXIS 42 (January 21, 2000)). However, as explained above, Tsai’s
claimed “gifting” is irrelevant to his registration violation. Furthermore,
because exemptions are narrowly construed, any purported “uncertainty”
in determining the scope of exemption should be strictly construed against
Tsai. See Cavanagh, 445 F.3d at 115; Kern, 425 F.3d at 153. In any event, this
staff letter bound neither the NASD nor the Commission, and lacks the
force of law. See Christensen, 529 U.S. at 587; FEC v. NRA, 254 F.3d at 186.

The NASD “assume[s]” that the information presented to it is accurate
(Br.26-27, McClarin 77:14-78:3); Tsai concedes that what he submitted to the
NASD about MAS’s compliance with corporate formalities was inaccurate.
See supra at 12; Dkt.125, Exh.25 at 3 (Form 211 included Form 10-SB/A).

II.

	THERE WAS NO PREJUDICIAL VARIANCE BETWEEN THE SECTION 5 CLAIM
ALLEGED IN THE COMMISSION’S COMPLAINT AND THE SECTION 5
CLAIM ON WHICH THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED SUMMARY
JUDGMENT.
Tsai asserts that the Commission’s complaint stated a claim against

him under Section 5 on “fraud”-based allegations and the district court
improperly granted summary judgment against him on “non-fraud”
allegations. See Br.16-27, 4-5. In Tsai’s view, this amounted to a
constructive amendment to the complaint, he lacked notice of this
amendment, and he was entitled to additional discovery. Tsai’s argument
is meritless.
A. 	

Because fraud is not an element of a violation of Section 5,
there is no basis for Tsai’s distinction between “fraud”-based
and “non-fraud”-based violations of Section 5.

As the district court correctly concluded, there is no “legal distinction
between a ‘fraud violation of Section 5’ and a ‘non-fraud violation of
Section 5,’” therefore Tsai’s “argument is not well taken.” Op.48. None of
the elements of a Section 5 violation require fraud. See Swenson, 626 F.2d at
424; SEC v. Calvo, 378 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.2004). For example, courts
uniformly agree that Section 5 does not have any scienter requirement,15
and Tsai concedes that “fraud or scienter is not a necessary element” of a
Section 5 violation. Br.18n.1. This reflects the purpose of Section 5, which
is to protect investors from even non-fraudulent conduct. See Ralston
See SEC v. North American Research and Development Corp., 424 F.2d 63, 81­
82 (2d Cir.1970); Swenson, 626 F.2d at 424 (5th); SEC v. Ross, 504 F.3d 1130,
1137 (9th Cir.2007); SEC v. Pearson, 426 F.2d 1339, 1343 (10th Cir.1970);
Calvo, 378 F.3d at 1215 (11th).

Purina., 346 U.S. at 124, 126-27 (“The design of [Section 5] is to protect
investors by promoting full disclosure of information thought necessary to
informed investment decisions”); Thomas Lee Hazen, 1 Law Sec. Reg. 2.2
(6th ed.2010) (“[S]ection 5 is not based on common law fraud.”). To the
extent that Tsai seeks to include such an element by inventing a distinct
“fraud”-based Section 5 violation, his argument would subvert the
legislative intent to prohibit all unregistered sales of securities.
B.	

The Commission’s complaint provided Tsai notice of its
claim that Tsai violated Section 5, irrespective of fraud.

Tsai argues that the Commission’s complaint did not provide
adequate notice because the complaint was “completely devoid” of
allegations supporting a non-fraud claim against him based on his control.
Br.4-5, 16-17, 24. Under the Federal Rules’ liberal pleading requirements, a
complaint need only provide “a short and plain statement of the claim”
that gives a defendant “fair notice of what the * * * claim is and the grounds
upon which it rests.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)
(quoting Fed.R Civ.P. 8(a)(2)). Here, the district court correctly concluded
that the complaint “more than adequately” provided Tsai with notice of a
non-fraud claim. Op.48.
The first count of the complaint sufficiently alleged a claim against
Tsai for violating “Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act” (Dkt.1 at 18):
Defendant[] Tsai * * * made use of the means or instruments of
transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the
mails to offer and sell securities through the use or medium of a
prospectus or otherwise when no registration statement has been
filed or was in effect as to such securities * * *.

38


Dkt.1 at 18 & ¶78; see also id. at 3 ¶10; compare with Swenson, 626 F.2d at 424.
The complaint also described Tsai’s role in “orchestrat[ing]”
transactions to “funnel[] stock into the public trading market without a
registration statement” (Dkt.1 at 18-19 ¶¶78-80), specifically that Tsai
“formed MAS,” transferred MAS stock to “approximately thirty
shareholders,” “arranged” a reverse merger, and that Tsai “retained control
of the stock” before transferring it to the promoters (Dkt.1 at 2 ¶¶2-4, 11
¶¶37-38). These are “direct or inferential allegations respecting all the
material elements to sustain a recovery” on the Commission’s non-fraud
claim. In re Commonwealth Institutional Securities, Inc., 394 F.3d 401, 405-06
(6th Cir.2005).
Notwithstanding the complaint’s plain language, Tsai asserts that
fraud was the “core of the claim” alleged against him, and summary
judgment on a non-fraud claim constitutes an impermissible variance from
the complaint. Br.18. An impermissible variance, or “shift in the thrust of
the case,” occurs when there is a prejudicial difference between the claim in
the complaint and the claim subject to summary judgment. See Colonial
Refrigerated Transp., Inc. v. Worsham, 705 F.2d 821, 825 (6th Cir.1983); Aro
Equipment Corp. v. Natkin & Co., 201 F.2d 160 (6th Cir.1952). For example, a
variance may occur where a complaint “only” asserts a claim under the
Fourteenth Amendment and a district court grants summary judgment on a
First Amendment claim (Summe v. Kenton County Clerk’s Office, 604 F.3d
257, 271 (6th Cir.2010)), or where a complaint contains allegations of a
federal fraud claim, but “no allegation” regarding a state fraud claim, and a
district court grants a form of relief available only under the state claim
39


(Hail v. Heyman-Christiansen, Inc., 536 F.2d 908, 909 & n. 2 (10th Cir.1976),
cited in Worsham).
Here, the Commission pled and proved Tsai’s violation of Section 5;
it is not as if the Commission charged Tsai only with fraud under Section
10(b), but sought summary judgment against him under Section 5. Indeed,
the complaint charged ten other defendants – but not Tsai – with fraud in
counts under Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a)(1). See Dkt.1 at
19-20 ¶¶81-85, 21-22 ¶¶90-94.
Contrary to his contention, the complaint’s Section 5 claim is not
converted into a fraud claim simply because the complaint refers to Tsai’s
role in a “scheme.” The Commission alleged, and later demonstrated, that
Tsai was a necessary participant and substantial factor in the overall
scheme to distribute unregistered securities, not a scheme to defraud. See
Dkt.1 at 2 ¶¶2-4, 3 ¶10, 11 ¶¶37-38, 18-19 ¶78-80. And violations of Section
5 often coexist with fraudulent schemes, just like the pump-and-dump
scheme perpetrated by the other defendants in this case. E.g., Calvo, 378
F.3d at 1213-15 (affirming judgment on Section 5 claims against Calvo and
Section 10(b) claims against Diversified, where the complaint alleged they
both “engaged in a ‘pump and dump’ scheme,” and “Calvo’s liability was
predicated on strict liability whereas Diversified’s liability was predicated
on fraud”) (emphasis added); see also SEC v. Diversified Corporate Consulting
Group, 378 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir.2004).
Likewise, allegations that MAS’s shareholders were Tsai’s
“nominees” whom Tsai “duped” through “sham” stock transfers does not
transform the complaint’s Section 5 claim into a fraud claim. Br.16-20, 3-4;
40


see also Dkt.1 at 2 ¶2, 10-11 ¶¶33-36. Although these words can be used in a
fraud claim, their use is not so limited. Scienter allegations would be
relevant for purposes of granting relief under Section 5. See Universal Major,
546 F.2d 1044 (injunction); Kern, 425 F.3d at 153 (civil penalties). In any
event, the inclusion of “superfluous” words in a pleading is not grounds
for variance, “at most” they are “harmless surplusage.” U.S. v. Autorino,
381 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir.2004).
Moreover, from the outset the complaint repeatedly allged that even
if Tsai may not have had title to the stock, Tsai “retained control of the stock
during all relevant times.” Dkt.1 at 2 ¶2 (emphasis added); see also id. at 10
¶34 (Tsai had “control of the shares”), at 11 ¶36 (“Tsai controlled the
stock”), ¶38 (Tsai “effectively controlled” the shareholders’ shares). And
although these allegations, if proven, would defeat exemptions to
registration (see Argument I), the Commission was not, contrary to Tsai’s
misconception (Br.20), required to allege such facts; Tsai had the burden to
plead and prove an exemption. See Ralston Purina, 346 U.S. at 126; American
Postal Workers Union v. Memphis, 361 F.3d 898, 902 (6th Cir.2004).
Likewise, contrary to Tsai’s assertions (Br.20-23), the Commission’s
interrogatory answers explained that Tsai controlled the issuance of shares,
controlled the transfer or shares through blank stock powers that enabled
him to “transfer the shares at will,” and that “Tsai controlled the stock”
ostensibly owned by the 33 shareholders. See Dkt.117, Att. 9, Exh.F
(Responses to Tsai) ¶¶1(d), 2(d); id. at Exh.G (Responses to Goelo), at 4-5,
7-8; id. at Exh.H (Responses to Markow) at 4-5, 7, 13-14). Tsai was therefore
on notice that his control over these shareholders was at issue in this case.
41


Finally, the Commission notes that Tsai’s own answer to the
complaint also demonstrates that he was on notice that no fraud claims
were leveled against him. See Pratt v. Tarr, 464 F.3d 730, 732 (7th Cir.2006)
(“responsive pleadings” demonstrate notice). Tsai’s answer acknowledged
that the fraud claims against other defendants under Section 10(b), Rule
10b-5, and Section 17(a)(1) do “not purport to state a claim for relief against
Tsai.” In contrast, Tsai affirmatively denied the Section 5 claim alleged
against him. Dkt.18 ¶¶7-15. And Tsai did not plead any affirmative
defense based on scienter, but rather, pled that the transactions were
“exempt from registration under the federal securities laws and rules,”
thereby demonstrating his notice. Dkt.18 ¶¶29-30.
In any event, even if the Commission’s complaint is construed to
include some “fraud-based” claim against Tsai, the Commission is entitled
to also plead a non-fraud claim under Section 5 in the alternative
(Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(d)(2) & (3)), and obtain summary judgment solely on its
non-fraud claim (Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a), (c)). E.g., SEC v. Rubera, 350 F.3d 1084,
1089, 1093-96 (9th Cir.2003) (affirming judgment under Section 5, but
declining judgment on alternative fraud claim); SEC v. Phan, 500 F.3d 895
(same).
Tsai disagrees with this basic principle of federal pleading, arguing
that the Commission is “precluded” from pleading both fraud and a nonfraud Section 5 claim in the alternative. Br.17-18. Tsai’s argument is based
on the “‘theory of the pleadings’ doctrine, under which a plaintiff must
succeed on those theories that are pleaded or not at all,” a doctrine which
this Court holds “has been effectively abolished under the federal rules.”
42


Worsham, 705 F.2d at 825, quoted at Op.48; see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct.
1937, 1950 (2009) (the Federal Rules depart “from the hyper-technical, codepleading regime of a prior era”).
Tsai cites inapposite cases concerning the dismissal of claims under
Rule 9(b) for failing to plead fraud with particularity, where, unlike here,
the complaints were “completely devoid of any” non-fraud allegations. E.g.,
CALPERS v. Chubb Corp., 394 F.3d 126, 161 (3d Cir.2004) (emphasis added).
Furthermore, these cases concern claims under Section 11 of the Securities
Act (15 U.S.C. 77k(a)), under which some courts have distinguished
between a fraud claim and a non-fraud claim (but see In re NationsMart
Corp., 130 F.3d 309, 315 (8th Cir.1997)), while courts of appeals uniformly
characterize Section 5 claims as non-fraud claims. Tsai’s cases also
recognize that his proposed “theory of the pleadings” doctrine has been
abolished. E.g., Lone Star Ladies Inv. Club v. Schlotzky’s Inc., 238 F.3d 363,
368 (5th Cir.2001) (“Where averments of fraud are made in a claim in which

43


fraud is not an element, an inadequate averment of fraud does not mean
that no claim has been stated”).16
C. 	

Tsai was not surprised or prejudiced by the entry of summary
judgment based on a non-fraud claim.

Even if there was a variance, however, this Court should affirm
summary judgment because Tsai did not suffer prejudice. See SEC v. Happ,
392 F.3d 12, 20-21 & n.3 (1st Cir.2004); cf., U.S. v. Mills, 366 F.2d 512, 514
(6th Cir.1966). The Commission’s non-fraud Section 5 claim – as well as
Tsai’s control of MAS and the 33 shareholders – was alleged in the
complaint and explored during discovery. Tsai had notice, but his efforts
to provide “conflicting evidence” that he had only “limited authority”
simply failed. Br.40-41.
Tsai argues that had he known that the Commission’s claim against
him was not based on fraud, he would have sought additional discovery
regarding the industry custom for reverse mergers, the NASD’s Form 211
approval process, and whether his position that shares were exempt from
registration was a “reasonable interpretation of the law.” Br.24-25.
Tsai proposes that this Court should, under Rule 9(b), “dismiss the
SEC’s complaint against Tsai” in its entirety (Br.57), but the cases he cites
explain that “non-fraud allegations” do not have to “be stated with
particularity merely because they appear in a complaint alongside fraud
averments.” Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 317 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir.2003). In
any event, Tsai waived this argument by filing an answer to the
Commission’s complaint that did not raise a Rule 9(b) objection. See
Dkt.18; Michaels Building Co. v. Ameritrust Co., 848 F.2d 674, 679 (6th
Cir.1988); see also Chubb, 394 F.3d at 163-66 (affirming dismissal and denial
of leave to amend only where the plaintiff had two opportunities to amend
its complaint).
16

44


However, as explained in Argument I-D above, these subjects cannot
demonstrate an exemption from registration, and none rebut Tsai’s control.
Furthermore, Tsai already conducted discovery on these inconsequential
topics. See Br.9-10, 53 (“the report of defendants’ expert Robert Rosen
addressed common practices in the reverse merger industry”) Dkt.120,
Exh.4 (Rosen’s expert report) at 2-16; Dkt.129 (Defendants’ deposition of
McClarin). Finally, the “reasonableness” of Tsai’s interpretation of the law
is not a proper subject for factual discovery. See Molecular Technology Corp.
v. Valentine, 925 F.2d 910, 918-19 (6th Cir.1991).
D.

T
	 he Commission’s pursuit of the crime-fraud exception to
Tsai’s assertion of the attorney-client privilege was not
inconsistent with finding Tsai liable for a non-fraud Section 5
violation.

Tsai points to the extensive briefing during discovery over whether
certain evidence was admissible under the crime-fraud exception to the
attorney-client privilege. After the complaint was filed, and during
discovery, the NASD provided to the Commission an unsigned letter from
an attorney sent to the NASD opining, based on information provided by
Tsai, on the propriety of Form 211 approval. Dkt.125, Exh.28 at 179-80;
Dkt.145 (District court’s crime-fraud opinion) at 3-4. The NASD relied on
this letter in approving MAS’s Form 211. Id.; Dkt.125, Exh.29. When the
Commission subpoenaed the attorney, who denied authorizing that letter
for transmittal to the NASD, Tsai and other defendants claimed that the
letter was protected by the attorney-client privilege. Dkt.69 (brief by
Markow); Dkt.87 (brief by Tsai). The Commission argued that the crimefraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applied to the letter and
45


related communications. Dkt.89. The district court affirmed the
magistrate’s order that the crime-fraud exception applied. Dkt.145. Tsai
does not challenge that decision in this appeal.
Tsai reasons that because the Commission argued that the crimefraud exception applied, the Commission thereby limited its Section 5
liability claims to a so-called “fraud-based” Section 5 violation. Br.23n.2.
However, admissibility of evidence here had nothing to do with the
elements of a cause of action. The Commission’s pursuit of the crime-fraud
exception during discovery did not alter or foreclose the non-fraud claim in
its complaint. The Commission’s crime-fraud argument was not based on
any fraud allegation in the complaint. See Dkt.145 at 1-5, Dkt.89. Indeed,
mere allegations of fraud “are not sufficient to make a prima facie showing
that the crime-fraud exception applies.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 419 F.3d
329, 336 (5th Cir.2005); see also U.S. v. Chen, 99 F.3d 1495, 1503 (9th Cir.1996)
(same). Nor does the Commission’s success in establishing the crime-fraud
exception mean that the Commission “prove[d]” that Tsai committed
fraud. In re Antitrust Grand Jury, 805 F.2d 155, 165-166 (6th Cir.1986). And
even if the Commission had, in the course of establishing a crime-fraud
exception, demonstrated that Tsai committed fraud, there is no support for

46


the proposition that the Commission would be foreclosed from
demonstrating that Tsai was liable for a non-fraud Section 5 violation.17
Furthermore, Tsai’s argument is disingenuous because both Tsai and
the Commission (Dkt.89 at 6) acknowledged in the crime-fraud briefing
below that the Commission’s complaint did not allege a fraud claim against
Tsai. Indeed, Tsai argued that the crime-fraud exception could not apply
because “scienter is not an element of a § 5 violation.” Dkt.87 at 3. The
district court correctly concluded that the crime-fraud briefing provided
Tsai “notice of the basis of the SEC’s Section 5 claims.” Op.50.
III.

	TSAI VIOLATED THE SHAREHOLDER REPORTING PROVISIONS OF
SECTION 13(D), SECTION 16(A), AND RELATED RULES.
The district court correctly concluded that Tsai violated the Exchange

Act’s shareholder reporting provisions (Section 13(d)(1) and Rule 13d-1(a),
and Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-3), because none of Tsai’s filings with the
Commission under the reporting provisions disclosed that Tsai was the
“beneficial owner” of the shares held by 33 of MAS’s shareholders. Dkt.244
at 1; Op.51-55.
A. 	

Section 13(d) and Rule 13d-1(a)

Section 13(d)(1) and Rule 13d-1(a) require the beneficial owner of
more than 5% of a company’s securities to disclose his direct or indirect
“beneficial ownership” of any shares by filing with the Commission a
The Commission sought the letter not to establish Tsai’s liability for
violating Section 5, but to provide added support for equitable relief, by
showing that “Tsai acted willfully when he violated Section 5” (Dkt.89 at 7­
10), and to explore Tsai’s role, if any, in furthering the other defendants’
alleged fraudulent scheme (Dkt.145 at 12-14).
17

47


Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G. See 15 U.S.C. 78m(d)(1)(D); 17 C.F.R.
240.13d-1(a).
Under these shareholder reporting provisions, Tsai was required to
report his beneficial ownership of any shares over which he “directly or
indirectly” had “voting power” or “investment power”:
(1) Voting power which includes the power to vote, or to direct
the voting of, such security; and/or,
(2) Investment power which includes the power to dispose, or
to direct the disposition of, such security.
17 C.F.R. 240.13d-3(a).
Although Tsai had investment power and voting power over the five
purported directors’ shares, Tsai failed to report his beneficial ownership of
these shares in his April 22, 1999 Schedule 13D. Dkt.125, Exh.1 ¶10, &
decl.exh.E.
Tsai argues that he was not a beneficial owner of these shares because
he had “limited authority” over the shares. Br.47-51. However, the same
undisputed facts demonstrating that Tsai “controlled” these shares for
purposes of defeating any exemption from registration (see Argument I),
also demonstrate Tsai’s direct or indirect “beneficial ownership” of these
shares under the reporting provisions: blank stock powers and failure to
issue stock certificates gave Tsai the “power to dispose” of these shares;
Tsai’s ability to transfer the shares to additional MAS shareholders and to
the promoters demonstrates Tsai’s power “to direct the disposition” of
these shares; Tsai was the only member of MAS’s board, held annual
shareholder meetings by himself, and held shareholder meetings without

48


notice, therefore Tsai had the power to “direct the voting” of these
securities.
Tsai also argues that because he reported his ownership of 8 million
shares, Tsai was relieved of his obligation to report that he was also the
beneficial owner of these shareholders’ shares. Br.47-48, 50-51. However,
Tsai’s personal opinion that investors had sufficient information is
irrelevant, as he violated the express terms of Section 13(d), which required
Tsai, as the beneficial owner of more than 5% of MAS’s securities, to
disclose any shares that he beneficially owned. Tsai misled investors by
falsely underreporting the extent of his beneficial ownership, thereby
subverting these reporting provisions’ purpose. See GAF Corp. v. Milstein,
453 F.2d 709, 720-21 (2d Cir.1971) (“a false filing may be more detrimental
to the informed operation of the securities markets than no filing at all”).
Finally, rehashing his variance argument, Tsai asserts that the
Commission should be precluded from summary judgment on this
reporting provision claim because it is part of a “non-fraud theory of
liability,” i.e., it is based on the proposition “that Tsai had sufficient
‘control’ over the shares to render him liable.” Br.51. However, the
complaint gave sufficient notice of the Commission’s claims against Tsai
under the reporting provisions (Dkt.1 at 25 ¶108, 26-27 ¶119), and
repeatedly alleged Tsai’s “control” over the shares (see Argument II-B). In
any event, scienter is not an element of a violation of these reporting
provisions. See SEC v. Savoy Ind., 587 F.2d 1149, 1167 (D.C. Cir.1978).

49


B.

Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-3

Similarly, Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-3 require the beneficial owner of
more than 10% of a company’s securities to disclose whether he is a direct
or indirect “beneficial owner” of any shares by filing with the Commission
a Form 3, and disclosing changes in beneficial ownership, whether by
acquisition or disposition, in a Form 4. See 15 U.S.C. 78p(a); 17 C.F.R.
240.16a-3.
Under these shareholder reporting provisions, Tsai was required to
report his beneficial ownership of any shares in which he directly or
indirectly had a “pecuniary interest,” meaning:
the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any
profit derived from a transaction in the subject securities.
17 C.F.R. 240.16a-1(a)(2)(i) (emphasis added).
“Pecuniary interest” is defined broadly enough to embrace the
$250,000 Tsai received here, whether the $250,000 is viewed as his direct
payment for the 33 shareholders’ shares, or merely his “fee” for his role in
bringing about the reverse merger, without which these shares “were
essentially worthless.” Tsai.Decl. ¶11; see also Br.9 (“the shares were
valueless unless a reverse merger occurred”). Tsai nonetheless filed a Form
3 on April 21, 1999 (Dkt.125, Exh.1 ¶10 & decl.exh.D) that failed to disclose
his beneficial ownership of the shares held by the five purported directors,
and another Form 3 on September 30, 1999 (id. & decl.exh.F) that failed to
disclose his beneficial ownership of the shares (then held by 33
shareholders). And because Tsai failed to ever report his beneficial
ownership of the 33 shareholders’ shares, the Form 4 he filed on February

50


29, 2000 (id. & decl.exh.J) did not report the disposition of that beneficial
ownership when the 33 shareholders’ shares were sold.
Tsai asserts that the 33 shareholders received “the entire amount” of
the profit from the sales of their stock (Br.48), but the district court was
correct that the fact that “Tsai ultimately realized a $250,000 profit in
connection with a disposition of the 250,000 shares warrants the conclusion
that he had a pecuniary interest in those shares.” Op.53-54. Indeed, the
definition of “pecuniary interest” broadly includes “any profit derived from
a transaction.”
Tsai also asserts that “the time of the alleged reporting violation” was
in April 1999, and at that time his pecuniary interest in the reverse merger
was “speculative.” Br.49-50. However, Tsai transferred these shares to
additional persons for the express purpose of making MAS “an attractive
candidate for a prospective merger” (Tsai.Decl. ¶9), which under these
reporting provisions constituted an “opportunity” for his direct or indirect
profit. Furthermore, even after Tsai received his $250,000 on February 8,
2000 (Dkt.125, Exh.35), Tsai failed to update the status of his beneficial
ownership as required in the Form 4 he filed on February 29, 2000.
IV.

	THE REMEDIES ORDERED BY THE DISTRICT COURT WERE NOT AN ABUSE
OF DISCRETION.
A.	

Disgorgement

Despite passing references (Br.2, 57), Tsai does not and cannot
seriously contest the district court’s broad discretion to order disgorgement
of $250,000 plus prejudgment interest, which represents Tsai’s unlawful
profits from his participation in the securities law violations here. See
51


Dkt.244; Op.73-76; 15 U.S.C. 78u(d)(5); Calvo, 378 F.3d at 1217 (affirming
disgorgement).
B.

Permanent injunction against future violations

Because Tsai violated the registration and reporting provisions of the
securities laws, and there is “a substantial likelihood of future violation,”
the district court acted within its broad discretion in ordering a permanent
injunction. Youmans, 729 F.2d at 415; 15 U.S.C. 77t(b), 78u(d); Dkt.244.
Contrary to Tsai’s argument (Br.51-57), the factors this Court finds relevant
support injunctive relief. See Youmans, 729 F.2d at 415; Op.79-83.
First and foremost in this case, Tsai’s “occupation will present
opportunities” for “future violations.” Youmans, 729 F.2d at 415; see also
Swift & Co. v. U.S., 276 U.S. 311, 326 (1928) (injunctions deal “primarily”
with a “threatened future” violation). As the facts here demonstrate, in
accord with the Seventh Circuit’s characterization, Tsai is in the business of
providing “services designed to evade the requirements that the Securities Act of
1933 imposes on companies that go public.” MAS Capital v. Biodelivery, 524
F.3d at 833-34 (emphasis added).
The shell company Tsai used here is one of 101 shell companies that
Tsai has at his disposal for future violations. Tsai.2004 25:8-26:9; Dkt.125,
Exh.2. In a Wall Street Journal article titled “Tsai Cashes In on ‘Blank
Check’ Firms Whenever Others Use Them to Go Public” (attached to
Markow’s declaration, Dkt.69, Exh.A), Tsai is quoted as bragging that he
has “been very busy” starting public shell companies, and the article noted
that Tsai has many shell companies “waiting in the wings.” Tsai’s website
boasts that he has a “team of international specialists” to advise how to “go
52


public in the U.S. via reverse merger.” See http://www.mascapital.com/.
Accordingly, reversing the injunction here would enable Tsai to use these
companies to commit future violations.
The “egregiousness” of Tsai’s violations here (Youmans, 729 F.2d at
415) is demonstrated by his having been previously enjoined in SEC v.
Surgilight, where, based on the Commission’s allegation that Tsai violated
Section 5 by participating in a public distribution using yet another one of
his shell companies, a Florida district court entered a consent judgment
against Tsai ordering disgorgement, civil penalties, and an injunction
against Tsai’s violating Section 5 in the future. See SEC v. Surgilight Inc.,
SEC Litig.Rel.No. 17469, 2002 WL 535370 (Apr. 11, 2002); SEC v. Surgilight
Inc., SEC Litig.Rel.No. 19169, 2005 WL 770873. Tsai argues that Surgilight is
irrelevant because Tsai “consented” to the injunction “without Tsai
admitting or denying the allegations of registration violations.” Br.53.
However, because Tsai violated Section 5 here, his conduct was also a
violation of the injunction entered in Surgilight, even if the Surgilight
injunction was by consent. Accordingly, taking judicial notice of this
previous consent judgment against Tsai was appropriate to “justify the
permanent injunction” here. CFTC v. Co Petro Marketing Group, Inc., 680
F.2d 573, 583-84 & n.16 (9th Cir.1982). Furthermore, the previous
injunction shows Tsai’s “familiarity” with the securities laws, and
“rebut[s]” Tsai’s contention that “his actions were, at worst, innocent,
technical violations.” Id.
Although scienter is not an element of a violation of Section 5, Tsai’s
recklessness in committing his violations also supports injunctive relief
53


here. See Universal Major, 546 F.2d 1044; Youmans, 729 F.2d at 415. As the
district court properly determined, Tsai was at least “reckless in
committing his violations,” given that Tsai “lied” in his filings with both
the Commission and the NASD. Op.81. The Form 10-SB that Tsai filed
with the Commission, and made part of the Form 211 submitted to the
NASD, contained several statements that Tsai concedes were inaccurate.
See supra at 12. Tsai asserts that one of these conceded inaccuracies – that
the five individuals did not receive “compensation” for their services as
“directors” but performed no services and were “five of his friends” (see
Form 10-SB/A at 27; Br.29; Tsai.Decl. ¶9) – does not demonstrate his
scienter because these particular 1,250 shares, in contrast to the 250,000
shares he transferred to these five individuals, were not distributed to the
public. Br.55. However, based on this misrepresentation, among the
others contained in Tsai’s filings, the NASD approved the Form 211 that
permitted the listing of all the shares that were eventually distributed to the
public. See McClarin 77:14-78:3. Tsai also argues that he honestly spoke to
his friends about serving as “honorary directors” (Br.55-56), but Tsai lied to
regulators by reporting that they were bona fide directors.
Tsai also argues that the NASD’s approval of Kensington Capital’s
Form 211 and regulatory “uncertainty” somehow nullify his scienter
(Br.53-54), but it was unreasonable for Tsai to view these as justification for
his violations (see Argument I-D), especially where Tsai’s consent to the
judgment in Surgilight shows that his violation of Section 5 here was not
“an innocent stumbling into an unintended transgression,” because the
previous injunction “laid down a specific admonitory prescription to guide
54


[his] future course.” U.S. v. Custer Channel Wing Corp., 376 F.2d 675, 682
(4th Cir.1967); see also Co Petro, 680 F.2d at 584.
In any event, Tsai is incorrect that “absent scienter, there is simply no
basis for an injunction in this case.” Br.53. Where, as here, scienter is not
“an element of the substantive violation sought to be enjoined” (Aaron, 446
U.S. at 701), scienter “is not a prerequisite to injunctive relief” (Calvo, 378
F.3d at 1216). See Youmans, 729 F.2d at 415 (“the courts have taken care to
stress that no one factor is determinative”).
All the other relevant factors likewise support the district court’s
discretion in granting injunctive relief here. See Youmans, 729 F.2d at 415.
Tsai has not provided any “assurances that [he] will not offend in [the]
future,” nor has Tsai “acknowledged in any way the wrongful nature of
[his] conduct.” Op.80. Tsai’s “age and health” – he is in his early forties
(Dkt.125, Exh.2) – also indicate Tsai is not lacking in vitality to commit
future violations. Youmans, 729 F.2d at 415.

STATUTORY ADDENDUM

A.

Registration Provisions

Section 5, 15 U.S.C. 77e (2000) 

Prohibitions relating to interstate commerce and the mails 

(a) Sale or delivery after sale of unregistered securities. Unless a
registration statement is in effect as to a security, it shall be unlawful for
any person, directly or indirectly-(1) to make use of any means or instruments of transportation or
communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell such
security through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise;
or
(2) to carry or cause to be carried through the mails or in interstate
commerce, by any means or instruments of transportation, any such
security for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale.
(b) Necessity of prospectus meeting requirements of § 10 of this Act. It
shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly-(1) to make use of any means or instruments of transportation or
communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to carry or
transmit any prospectus relating to any security with respect to
which a registration statement has been filed under this title [15
USCS §§ 77a et seq.], unless such prospectus meets the requirements
of section 10 [15 USCS § 77j]; or
(2) to carry or cause to be carried through the mails or in interstate
commerce any such security for the purpose of sale or for delivery
after sale, unless accompanied or preceded by a prospectus that
meets the requirements of subsection (a) of section 10 [15 USCS §
77j(a)].

63


(c) Necessity of filing registration statement. It shall be unlawful for any
person, directly or indirectly, to make use of any means or instruments
of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the
mails to offer to sell or offer to buy through the use or medium of any
prospectus or otherwise any security, unless a registration statement has
been filed as to such security, or while the registration statement is the
subject of a refusal order or stop order or (prior to the effective date of
the registration statement) any public proceeding or examination under
section 8 [15 USCS § 77h].
Section 4(1), 15 U.S.C. 77d (2000)
§ 77d. Exempted transactions
The provisions of section 5 [15 USCS § 77e] shall not apply to-(1) transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.
Section 2(a)(11), 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(11) (2000)
(11)The term “underwriter” means any person who has purchased from an
issuer with a view to, or offers or sells for an issuer in connection with,
the distribution of any security, or participates or has a direct or
indirect participation in any such undertaking, or participates or has a
participation in the direct or indirect underwriting of any such
undertaking; but such term shall not include a person whose interest is
limited to a commission from an underwriter or dealer not in excess of
the usual and customary distributors’ or sellers’ commission. As used
in this paragraph the term “issuer” shall include, in addition to an
issuer, any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the
issuer, or any person under direct or indirect common control with the
issuer.

64


Rule 144, 17 C.F.R. 230.144 (2000)
Persons deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not
underwriters.
PRELIMINARY NOTE Rule 144 is designed to implement the fundamental
purposes of the Act, as expressed in its preamble, To provide full and fair
disclosure of the character of the securities sold in interstate commerce and
through the mails, and to prevent fraud in the sale thereof * * * The rule is
designed to prohibit the creation of public markets in securities of issuers
concerning which adequate current information is not available to the
public. At the same time, where adequate current information concerning
the issuer is available to the public, the rule permits the public sale in
ordinary trading transactions of limited amounts of securities owned by
persons controlling, controlled by or under common control with the issuer
and by persons who have acquired restricted securities of the issuer.
Certain basic principles are essential to an understanding of the
requirement of registration in the Act:
1. If any person utilizes the jurisdictional means to sell any nonexempt
security to any other person, the security must be registered unless a
statutory exemption can be found for the transaction.
2. In addition to the exemptions found in section 3, four exemptions
applicable to transactions in securities are contained in section 4. Three
of these section 4 exemptions are clearly not available to anyone acting
as an underwriter of securities. (The fourth, found in section 4(4), is
available only to those who act as brokers under certain limited
circumstances.) An understanding of the term underwriter is therefore
important to anyone who wishes to determine whether or not an
exemption from registration is available for his sale of securities.
The term underwriter is broadly defined in section 2(11) of the Act to
mean any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or
offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of any
security, or participates, or has a direct or indirect participation in any such
undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the direct or indirect
underwriting of any such undertaking. The interpretation of this definition
has traditionally focused on the words with a view to in the phrase
purchased from an issuer with a view to * * * distribution. Thus, an
65


investment banking firm which arranges with an issuer for the public sale
of its securities is clearly an underwriter under that section. Individual
investors who are not professionals in the securities business may also be
underwriters within the meaning of that term as used in the Act if they act
as links in a chain of transactions through which securities move from an
issuer to the public. Since it is difficult to ascertain the mental state of the
purchaser at the time of his acquisition, subsequent acts and circumstances
have been considered to determine whether such person took with a view
to distribution at the time of his acquisition. Emphasis has been placed on
factors such as the length of time the person has held the securities and
whether there has been an unforeseeable change in circumstances of the
holder. Experience has shown, however, that reliance upon such factors as
the above has not assured adequate protection of investors through the
maintenance of informed trading markets and has led to uncertainty in the
application of the registration provisions of the Act.
It should be noted that the statutory language of section 2(11) is in the
disjunctive. Thus, it is insufficient to conclude that a person is not an
underwriter solely because he did not purchase securities from an issuer
with a view to their distribution. It must also be established that the person
is not offering or selling for an issuer in connection with the distribution of
the securities, does not participate or have a direct or indirect participation
in any such undertaking, and does not participate or have a participation in
the direct or indirect underwriting of such an undertaking.
In determining when a person is deemed not to be engaged in a
distribution several factors must be considered.
First, the purpose and underlying policy of the Act to protect investors
requires that there be adequate current information concerning the issuer,
whether the resales of securities by persons result in a distribution or are
effected in trading transactions. Accordingly, the availability of the rule is
conditioned on the existence of adequate current public information.
Secondly, a holding period prior to resale is essential, among other
reasons, to assure that those persons who buy under a claim of a section
4(2) exemption have assumed the economic risks of investment, and
therefore are not acting as conduits for sale to the public of unregistered
securities, directly or indirectly, on behalf of an issuer. It should be noted

66


that there is nothing in section 2(11) which places a time limit on a person’s
status as an underwriter. The public has the same need for protection
afforded by registration whether the securities are distributed shortly after
their purchase or after a considerable length of time.
A third factor, which must be considered in determining what is
deemed not to constitute a distribution, is the impact of the particular
transaction or transactions on the trading markets. Section 4(1) was
intended to exempt only routine trading transactions between individual
investors with respect to securities already issued and not to exempt
distributions by issuers or acts of other individuals who engage in steps
necessary to such distributions. Therefore, a person reselling securities
under section 4(1) of the Act must sell the securities in such limited
quantities and in such a manner as not to disrupt the trading markets. The
larger the amount of securities involved, the more likely it is that such
resales may involve methods of offering and amounts of compensation
usually associated with a distribution rather than routine trading
transactions. Thus, solicitation of buy orders or the payment of extra
compensation are not permitted by the rule.
In summary, if the sale in question is made in accordance with all of the
provisions of the section as set forth below, any person who sells restricted
securities shall be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of such
securities and therefore not an underwriter thereof. The rule also provides
thatany person who sells restricted or other securities on behalf of a person
in a control relationship with the issuer shall be deemed not to be engaged
in a distribution of such securities and therefore not to be an underwriter
thereof, if the sale is made in accordance with all the conditions of the
section.
(a)Definitions. The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of
this section.
(1) An affiliate of an issuer is a person that directly, or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or
is under common control with, such issuer.

67


(2) The term person when used with reference to a person for whose
account securities are to be sold in reliance upon this section includes,
in addition to such person, all of the following persons:
(i) Any relative or spouse of such person, or any relative of such
spouse, any one of whom has the same home as such person;
(ii) Any trust or estate in which such person or any of the persons
specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section collectively own 10
percent or more of the total beneficial interest or of which any of such
persons serve as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity; and
(iii) Any corporation or other organization (other than the issuer) in
which such person or any of the persons specified in paragraph
(a)(2)(i) of this section are the beneficial owners collectively of 10
percent or more of any class of equity securities or 10 percent or more
of the equity interest.
(3) The term restricted securities means:
(i) Securities acquired directly or indirectly from the issuer, or from
an affiliate of the issuer, in a transaction or chain of transactions not
involving any public offering;
(ii) Securities acquired from the issuer that are subject to the resale
limitations of § 230.502(d) under Regulation D or § 230.701(c);
(iii) Securities acquired in a transaction or chain of transactions 

meeting the requirements of § 230.144A; 

(iv) Securities acquired from the issuer in a transaction subject to the
conditions of Regulation CE (§ 230.1001);
(v) Equity securities of domestic issuers acquired in a transaction or
chain of transactions subject to the conditions of § 230.901 or §
230.903 under Regulation S (§ 230.901 through § 230.905, and 

Preliminary Notes); 

(vi) Securities acquired in a transaction made under § 230.801 to the
same extent and proportion that the securities held by the security
holder of the class with respect to which the rights offering was made
were as of the record date for the rights offering “restricted
securities” within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(3); and

68


(vii) Securities acquired in a transaction made under § 230.802 to the
same extent and proportion that the securities that were tendered or
exchanged in the exchange offer or business combination were
“restricted securities” within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(3).
(b)Conditions to be met. Any affiliate or other person who sells restricted
securities of an issuer for his own account, or any person who sells
restricted or any other securities for the account of an affiliate of the
issuer of such securities, shall be deemed not to be engaged in a
distribution of such securities and therefore not to be an underwriter
thereof within the meaning of section 2(11) of the Act if all of the
conditions of this section are met.
(c) Current public information. There shall be available adequate current
public information with respect to the issuer of the securities. Such
information shall be deemed to be available only if either of the
following conditions is met:
(1) Filing of reports. The issuer has securities registered pursuant to
section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, has been subject to
the reporting requirements of section 13 of that Act for a period of at
least 90 days immediately preceding the sale of the securities and has
filed all the reports required to be filed thereunder during the 12
months preceding such sale (or for such shorter period that the issuer
was required to file such reports); or has securities registered
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, has been subject to the
reporting requirements of section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 for a period of at least 90 days immediately preceding the
sale of the securities and has filed all the reports required to be filed
thereunder during the 12 months preceding such sale (or for such
shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports). The
person for whose account the securities are to be sold shall be entitled
to rely upon a statement in whichever is the most recent report,
quarterly or annual, required to be filed and filed by the issuer that
such issuer has filed all reports required to be filed by section 13 or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12
months (or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file
such reports) and has been subject to such filing requirements for the
past 90 days, unless he knows or has reason to believe that the issuer
69


has not complied with such requirements. Such person shall also be
entitled to rely upon a written statement from the issuer that it has
complied with such reporting requirements unless he knows or has
reasons to believe that the issuer has not complied with such
requirements.
(2) Other public information. If the issuer is not subject to section 13 or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, there is publicly
available the information concerning the issuer specified in
paragraphs (a)(5)(i) to (xiv), inclusive, and paragraph (a)(5)(xvi) of
Rule 15c2-11 (§ 240.15c2-11 of this chapter) under that Act or, if the
issuer is an insurance company, the information specified in section
12(g)(2)(G)(i) of that Act.
(d)Holding period for restricted securities. If the securities sold are
restricted securities, the following provisions apply:
(1) General rule. A minimum of one year must elapse between the later
of the date of the acquisition of the securities from the issuer or from
an affiliate of the issuer, and any resale of such securities in reliance
on this section for the account of either the acquiror or any
subsequent holder of those securities. If the acquiror takes the
securities by purchase, the one-year period shall not begin until the
full purchase price or other consideration is paid or given by the
person acquiring the securities from the issuer or from an affiliate of
the issuer.
(2) Promissory notes, other obligations or installment contracts. Giving
the issuer or affiliate of the issuer from whom the securities were
purchased a promissory note or other obligation to pay the purchase
price, or entering into an installment purchase contract with such
seller, shall not be deemed full payment of the purchase price unless
the promissory note, obligation or contract:
(i) Provides for full recourse against the purchaser of the securities;
(ii) Is secured by collateral, other than the securities purchased,
having a fair market value at least equal to the purchase price of the
securities purchased; and

70


(iii) Shall have been discharged by payment in full prior to the sale of
the securities.
(3) Determination of holding period. The following provisions shall
apply for the purpose of determining the period securities have been
held:
(i) Stock dividends, splits and recapitalizations. Securities acquired
from the issuer as a dividend or pursuant to a stock split, reverse split
or recapitalization shall be deemed to have been acquired at the same
time as the securities on which the dividend or, if more than one, the
initial dividend was paid, the securities involved in the split or
reverse split, or the securities surrendered in connection with the
recapitalization;
(ii) Conversions. If the securities sold were acquired from the issuer
for a consideration consisting solely of other securities of the same
issuer surrendered for conversion, the securities so acquired shall be
deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the securities
surrendered for conversion;
(iii) Contingent issuance of securities. Securities acquired as a
contingent payment of the purchase price of an equity interest in a
business, or the assets of a business, sold to the issuer or an affiliate of
the issuer shall be deemed to have been acquired at the time of such
sale if the issuer or affiliate was then committed to issue the securities
subject only to conditions other than the payment of further
consideration for such securities. An agreement entered into in
connection with any such purchase to remain in the employment of,
or not to compete with, the issuer or affiliate or the rendering of
services pursuant to such agreement shall not be deemed to be the
payment of further consideration for such securities.
(iv) Pledged securities. Securities which are bona-fide pledged by an
affiliate of the issuer when sold by the pledgee, or by a purchaser,
after a default in the obligation secured by the pledge, shall be
deemed to have been acquired when they were acquired by the
pledgor, except that if the securities were pledged without recourse
they shall be deemed to have been acquired by the pledgee at the
time of the pledge or by the purchaser at the time of purchase.
71


(v) Gifts of securities. Securities acquired from an affiliate of the
issuer by gift shall be deemed to have been acquired by the donee
when they were acquired by the donor.
(vi) Trusts. Where a trust settlor is an affiliate of the issuer, securities
acquired from the settlor by the trust, or acquired from the trust by
the beneficiaries thereof, shall be deemed to have been acquired
when such securities were acquired by the settlor.
(vii) Estates. Where a deceased person was an affiliate of the issuer,
securities held by the estate of such person or acquired from such
estate by the beneficiaries thereof shall be deemed to have been
acquired when they were acquired by the deceased person, except
that no holding period is required if the estate is not an affiliate of the
issuer or if the securities are sold by a beneficiary of the estate who is
not such an affiliate.
NOTE: While there is no holding period or amount limitation for
estates and beneficiaries thereof which are not affiliates of the issurer,
paragraphs (c), (h) and (i) of the rule apply to securities sold by such
persons in reliance upon the rule.
(viii) Rule 145(a) transactions. The holding period for securities
acquired in a transaction specified in Rule 145(a) shall be deemed to
commence on the date the securities were acquired by the purchaser
in such transaction. This provision shall not apply, however, to a
transaction effected solely for the purpose of forming a holding
company.
(e) Limitation on amount of securities sold. Except as hereinafter provided,
the amount of securities which may be sold in reliance upon this rule
shall be determined as follows:
(1) Sales by affiliates. If restricted or other securities are sold for the
account of an affiliate of the issuer, the amount of securities sold,
together with all sales of restricted and other securities of the same
class for the account of such person within the preceding three
months, shall not exceed the greater of

72


(i) One percent of the shares or other units of the class outstanding as
shown by the most recent report or statement published by the
issuer, or
(ii) The average weekly reported volume of trading in such securities
on all national securities exchanges and/or reported through the
automated quotation system of a registered securities association
during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of notice
required by paragraph (h), or if no such notice is required the date of
receipt of the order to execute the transaction by the broker or the
date of execution of the transaction directly with a market maker, or
(iii) The average weekly volume of trading in such securities
reported through the consolidated transaction reporting system
contemplated by Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (§ 240.11A3-1) during the four-week period specified in
paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
(2) Sales by persons other than affiliates. The amount of restricted
securities sold for the account of any person other than an affiliate of
the issuer, together with all other sales of restricted securities of the
same class for the account of such person within the preceding three
months, shall not exceed the amount specified in paragraphs (e)(1)
(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section, whichever is applicable, unless the
conditions of paragraph (k) of this rule are satisfied.
(3) Determination of amount. For the purpose of determining the
amount of securities specified in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this
section, the following provisions shall apply:
(i) Where both convertible securities and securities of the class into
which they are convertible are sold, the amount of convertible
securities sold shall be deemed to be the amount of securities of the
class into which they are convertible for the purpose of determining
the aggregate amount of securities of both classes sold;

73


(ii) The amount of securities sold for the account of a pledgee
thereof, or for the account of a purchaser of the pledged securities,
during any period of three months within one year after a default in
the obligation secured by the pledge, and the amount of securities
sold during the same three-month period for the account of the
pledgor shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount specified in
paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable;
(iii) The amount of securities sold for the account of a donee thereof
during any period of three months within one year after the

aggregate, the amount specified in paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this
section, whichever is applicable;
(iv) Where securities were acquired by a trust from the settlor of the
trust, the amount of such securities sold for the account of the trust

acquisition of the securities by the trust, and the amount of securities
sold duringthe same three-month period for the account of the
settlor, shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount specified in
paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable;
(v) The amount of securities sold for the account of the estate of a
deceased person, or for the account of a beneficiary of such estate,
during any period of 3 months and the amount of securities sold
during the same period for the account of the deceased person prior
to his death shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount specified
in paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable:
Provided, That no limitation on amount shall apply if the estate or
beneficiary thereof is not an affiliate of the issuer;
(vi) When two or more affiliates or other persons agree to act in
concert for the purpose of selling securities of an issuer, all securities
of the same class sold for the account of all such persons during any
period of 3 months shall be aggregated for the purpose of
determining the limitation on the amount of securities sold;

74


(vii) The following sales of securities need not be included in
determining the amount of securities sold in reliance upon this
section: securities sold pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Act; securities sold pursuant to an exemption provided by
Regulation A (§ 230.251 through § 230.263) under the Act; securities
sold in a transaction exempt pursuant to Section 4 of the Act (15
U.S.C. 77d) and not involving any public offering; and securities sold
offshore pursuant to Regulation S (§ 230.901 through § 230.905, and
Preliminary Notes) under the Act.
(f) Manner of sale. The securities shall be sold in brokers’ transactions
within the meaning of section 4(4) of the Act or in transactions directly
with a market maker, as that term is defined in section 3(a)(38) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the person selling the securities
shall not (1) solicit or arrange for the solicitation of orders to buy the
securities in anticipation of or in connection with such transaction, or (2)
make any payment in connection with the offer or sale of the securities
to any person other than the broker who executes an order to sell the
securities. The requirements of this paragraph, however, shall not apply
to securities sold for the account of the estate of a deceased person or for
the account of a beneficiary of such estate provided the estate or
beneficiary thereof is not an affiliate of the issuer; nor shall they apply to
securities sold for the account of any person other than an affiliate of the
issuer provided the conditions of paragraph (k) of this rule are satisfied.
(g)Brokers’ transactions. The term brokers’ transactions in section 4(4) of
the Act shall for the purposes of this rule be deemed to include
transactions by a broker in which such broker:
(1) Does not more than execute the order or orders to sell the securities
as agent for the person for whose account the securities are sold; and
receives no more than the usual and customary broker’s commission;
(2) Neither solicits nor arranges for the solicitation of customers’ orders
to buy the securities in anticipation of or in connection with the
transaction; provided, that the foregoing shall not preclude
(i) inquiries by the broker of other brokers or dealers who have
indicated an interest in the securities within the preceding 60 days,

75


(ii) inquiries by the broker of his customers who have indicated an
unsolicited bona fide interest in the securities within the preceding 10
business days; or
(iii) the publication by the broker of bid and ask quotations for the
security in an inter-dealer quotation system provided that such
quotations are incident to the maintenance of a bona fide inter-dealer
market for the security for the broker’s own account and that the
broker has published bona fide bid and ask quotations for the
security in an inter-dealer quotation system on each of at least twelve
days within the preceding thirty calendar days with no more than
four business days in succession without such two-way quotations;
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (g)(2)(ii): The broker should obtain and
retain in his files written evidence of indications of bona fide
unsolicited interest by his customers in the securities at the time such
indications are received.
(3) After reasonable inquiry is not aware of circumstances indicating that
the person for whose account the securities are sold is an underwriter
with respect to the securities or that the transaction is a part of a
distribution of securities of the issuer. Without limiting the foregoing,
the broker shall be deemed to be aware of any facts or statements
contained in the notice required by paragraph (h) of this section.
NOTES:
(i) The broker, for his own protection, should obtain and retain in
his files a copy of the notice required by paragraph (h) of this
section.
(ii) The reasonable inquiry required by paragraph (g)(3) of this
section should include, but not necessarily be limited to, inquiry as
to the following matters:
(a) The length of time the securities have been held by the
person for whose account they are to be sold. If practicable, the
inquiry should include physical inspection of the securities;
(b) The nature of the transaction in which the securities were
acquired by such person;

76


(c) The amount of securities of the same class sold during the
past 3 months by all persons whose sales are required to be
taken into consideration pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
section;
(d) Whether such person intends to sell additional securities of
the same class through any other means;
(e) Whether such person has solicited or made any
arrangement for the solicitation of buy orders in connection
with the proposed sale of securities;
(f) Whether such person has made any payment to any other
person in connection with the proposed sale of the securities;
and
(g) The number of shares or other units of the class
outstanding, or the relevant trading volume.
(h)Notice of proposed sale. If the amount of securities to be sold in reliance
upon the rule during any period of three months exceeds 500 shares or
other units or has an aggregate sale price in excess of $ 10,000, three
copies of a notice on Form 144 shall be filed with the Commission at its
principal office in Washington, DC; and if such securities are admitted
to trading on any national securities exchange, one copy of such notice
shall also be transmitted to the principal exchange on which such
securities are so admitted. The Form 144 shall be signed by the person
for whose account the securities are to be sold and shall be transmitted
for filing concurrently with either the placing with a broker of an order
to execute a sale of securities in reliance upon this rule or the execution
directly with a market maker of such a sale. Neither the filing of such
notice nor the failure of the Commission to comment thereon shall be
deemed to preclude the Commission from taking any action it deems
necessary or appropriate with respect to the sale of the securities
referred to in such notice. The requirements of this paragraph, however,
shall not apply to securities sold for the account of any person other
than an affiliate of the issuer, provided the conditions of paragraph (k)
of this rule are satisfied.

77


(i) Bona fide intention to sell. The person filing the notice required by
paragraph (h) of this section shall have a bona fide intention to sell the
securities referred to therein within a reasonable time after the filing of
such notice.
(j) Non-exclusive rule. Although this rule provides a means for reselling
restricted securities and securities held by affiliates without registration,
it is not the exclusive means for reselling such securities in that manner.
Therefore, it does not eliminate or otherwise affect the availability of any
exemption for resales under the Securities Act that a person or entity
may be able to rely upon.
(k)Termination of certain restrictions on sales of restricted securities by
persons other than affiliates. The requirements of paragraphs (c), (e),
(f) and (h) of this section shall not apply to restricted securities sold
for the account of a person who is not an affiliate of the issuer at the
time of the sale and has not been an affiliate during the preceding
three months, provided a period of at least two years has elapsed since
the later of the date the securities were acquired from the issuer or
from an affiliate of the issuer. The two-year period shall be calculated
as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

83


(b)A person filing statements pursuant to section 16(a) of the Act with

(c) Any issuer that has equity securities listed on more than one national

with which reports pursuant to section 16(a) of the Act need be filed.
Such designation shall be made in writing and shall be filed with the
Commission and with each national securities exchange on which any
equity security of the issuer is listed at the time of such election. The
reporting person’s obligation to file reports with each national securities
exchange on which any equity security of the issuer is listed shall be
satisfied by filing with the exchange so designated.
(d)Any person required to file a statement with respect to securities of a
single issuer under both section 16(a) of the Act and either section 17(a)

Form shall be filed within 45 days after the issuer’s fiscal year end,
and shall disclose the following holdings and transactions not
reported previously on Forms 3, 4 or 5:

84


(i) All transactions during the most recent fiscal year that were
exempt from section 16(b) of the Act, except:
(A) Exercises and conversions of derivative securities exempt
under either § 240.16b-3 or § 240.16b-6(b) (these are required to be
reported on Form 4);
(B) Transactions exempt from section 16(b) of the Act pursuant to
§ 240.16b-3(c), which shall be exempt from section 16(a) of the Act;
and
(C) Transactions exempt from section 16(a) of the Act pursuant to
another rule;
(ii) Transactions that constituted small acquisitions pursuant to §

person, all holdings and transactions that should have been reported
in each of the issuer’s last two fiscal years but were not, based on the
reporting person’s reasonable belief in good faith in the completeness
and accuracy of the information.
(2) Notwithstanding the above, no Form 5 shall be required where all
transactions otherwise required to be reported on the Form 5 have been
reported before the due date of the Form 5.
NOTE: Persons no longer subject to section 16 of the Act, but who were
subject to the Section at any time during the issuer’s fiscal year, must file a
Form 5 unless paragraph (f)(2) is satisfied. See also § 240.16a-2(b) regarding
the reporting obligations of persons ceasing to be officers or directors.
(g) (1) A Form 4 shall be filed to report all transactions not exempt from
section 16(b) of the Act and all exercises and conversions of
derivative securities, regardless of whether exempt from section 16(b)
of the Act.
(2) At the option of the reporting person, transactions that are reportable
on Form 5 may be reported on Form 4, provided that the Form 4 is filed

85


no later than the due date of the Form 5 with respect to the fiscal year in
which the transaction occurred.
(h)The date of filing with the Commission shall be the date of receipt by the
Commission; Provided, however, That a Form 3, 4, or 5 shall be deemed
to have been timely filed if the filing person establishes that the Form
had been transmitted timely to a third party company or governmental
entity providing delivery services in the ordinary course of business,
which guaranteed delivery of the filing to the Commission no later than
the required filing date.
(i) Signatures. Where Section 16 of the Act, or the rules or forms
thereunder, require a document filed with or furnished to the
Commission to be signed, such document shall be manually signed, or
signed using either typed signatures or duplicated or facsimile versions
of manual signatures. Where typed, duplicated or facsimile signatures
are used, each signatory to the filing shall manually sign a signature
page or other document authenticating, acknowledging or otherwise
adopting his or her signature that appears in the filing. Such document
shall be executed before or at the time the filing is made and shall be
retained by the filer for a period of five years. Upon request, the filer
shall furnish to the Commission or its staff a copy of any or all
documents retained pursuant to this section.
(j) Where more than one person subject to section 16 of the Act is deemed
to be a beneficial owner of the same equity securities, all such persons
must report as beneficial owners of the securities, either separately or
jointly. Where persons in a group are deemed to be beneficial owners of
equity securities pursuant to § 240.16a-1(a)(1) due to the aggregation of
holdings, a single Form 3, 4 or 5 may be filed on behalf of all persons in
the group. Joint and group filings must include all required information
for each beneficial owner, and such filings must be signed by each
beneficial owner, or on behalf of such owner by an authorized person.

86

such class allocated to plan participants where participants have
voting power) as long as such shares are acquired by such

the securities holdings disclosed on Form 3, and changes in beneficial
ownership reported on subsequent Forms 4 (§ 249.104) or 5 (§ 249.105),
would be determined by the definition of “beneficial owner” in paragraph
(a)(2) of this section.
(2) Other than for purposes of determining whether a person is a
beneficial owner of more than ten percent of any class of equity
securities registered under Section 12 of the Act, the term beneficial
owner shall mean any person who, directly or indirectly, through any
contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has
or shares a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the equity
securities, subject to the following:

88


(i) The term pecuniary interest in any class of equity securities shall
mean the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in
any profit derived from a transaction in the subject securities.
(ii) The term indirect pecuniary interest in any class of equity
securities shall include, but not be limited to:
(A) Securities held by members of a person’s immediate family
sharing the same household; provided, however, that the
presumption of such beneficial ownership may be rebutted; see
also § 240.16a-1(a)(4);
(B) A general partner’s proportionate interest in the portfolio
securities held by a general or limited partnership. The general
partner’s proportionate interest, as evidenced by the partnership
agreement in effect at the time of the transaction and the
partnership’s most recent financial statements, shall be the greater
of:
(1) The general partner’s share of the partnership’s profits,
including profits attributed to any limited partnership interests
held by the general partner and any other interests in profits
that arise from the purchase and sale of the partnership’s
portfolio securities; or
(2) The general partner’s share of the partnership capital
account, including the share attributable to any limited
partnership interest held by the general partner.
(C) A performance-related fee, other than an asset-based fee,
received by any broker, dealer, bank, insurance company,
investment company, investment adviser, investment manager,
trustee or person or entity performing a similar function;
provided, however, that no pecuniary interest shall be present
where:
(1) The performance-related fee, regardless of when payable, is
calculated based upon net capital gains and/or net capital
appreciation generated from the portfolio or from the
fiduciary’s overall performance over a period of one year or
more; and

89


(2) Equity securities of the issuer do not account for more than
ten percent of the market value of the portfolio. A right to a
nonperformance-related fee alone shall not represent a
pecuniary interest in the securities;
(D) A person’s right to dividends that is separated or separable
from the underlying securities. Otherwise, a right to dividends
alone shall not represent a pecuniary interest in the securities;
(E) A person’s interest in securities held by a trust, as specified in §
240.16a-8(b); and
(F) A person’s right to acquire equity securities through the
exercise or conversion of any derivative security, whether or not
presently exercisable.
(iii) A shareholder shall not be deemed to have a pecuniary interest in
the portfolio securities held by a corporation or similar entity in
which the person owns securities if the shareholder is not a
controlling shareholder of the entity and does not have or share
investment control over the entity’s portfolio.
