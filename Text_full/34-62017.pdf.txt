On September 19, 2007, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings
against Evergreen Investment Management Company, LLC ("EIMCO"), Evergreen Investment

Admin. Proc. File No. 3-12805, Exchange Act Release No. 56462. (September 19, 2007)
("Evergreen Order"). Also on September 19, 2007, the Commission instituted settled
administrative proceedings against William M. Ennis in connection with the market timing of
one Evergreen mutual fund. See Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist
Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist
Order Pursuant to Sections 15(b)(6) and 17A(c)(4)(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, Admin Proc. File No. 3-12806, Exchange Act Release No.
56464 (September 19, 2007) ("Ennis Order"). Among other things, the Evergreen Order and the
Ennis Order required EIMCO, EIS, ESC, Wachovia Securities, and Ennis to pay a total of
$28,503,280 in disgorgement and $4,150,000 in civil penalties. The Evergreen Order further
provided that a fair fund (the "Fair Fund") be established and distributed pursuant to a
distribution plan developed by an Independent Distribution Consultant ("IDC") retained by
Respondents.

Respondents selected Kenneth Lehn, Ph.D., of the University of Pittsburgh, to serve as
the Fair Fund's IDC. The IDC has developed a proposed distribution plan (the "Distribution
Plan") in consultation with the staff and Respondents.
The Fair Fund is comprised of the $32,653,280 million paid by Respondents and Ennis,
plus accumulated interest. The Distribution Plan sets forth the procedures by which to distribute
to investors, for the period spanning September 1998 through June 2004, their proportionate
share of the fund established to compensate such investors for the harm caused by the conduct
described in the Order. Persons eligible for distributions from the Fair Fund will not need to go
through a claims process.
In accordance with the Commission's Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans (the
"Fair Fund Rules"), 17 C.F.R. ยง 201.1100, et seq., the Distribution Plan proposes a Fund
Administrator and sets forth, among other things, procedures for the distribution of proceeds to
funds or shareholders of funds; procedures for the administration of the Fair Fund, including
provisions for filing tax returns; and a proposed timeframe for the termination of the Fair Fund.
On March 19, 2010, the Commission issued an order (Exchange Act Release No. 61746)
appointing Rust Consulting, Inc. as the Fund Administrator of the Distribution Plan and waiving
the bond requirement generally required of third parties under Fair Fund Rule 1105(c).
Also on March 19, 2010, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Distribution Plan
and Opportunity for Comment (Exchange Act Release No. 61745) pursuant to Fair Fund Rule
1103, 17 C.F.R. ยง 201.1103. The Notice advised interested parties that they could obtain a copy
of the Plan at http://www.sec.gov, or by submitting a written request to Kevin M. Kelcourse,
Assistant Regional Director, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 33 Arch Street,
23rd Floor, Boston, MA 02110. The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on
the Plan could submit their comments, in writing, no later than 30 days from the date of the
Notice. No comments were received by the Commission in response to the Notice, and no
modification has been made to the Plan since its publication.
